 I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book.
 Great price, but it is all 7 books combined into one volume and one table of contents; which makes navigating to different books and chapters a bit more difficult than if they were 7 distinct books.
 IMPORTANT: For U.S. customers purchasing the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, you will notice the text has NOT been converted to the "Americanized" version of the original U.S. releases. This difference isn't as prominent or noticeable as it was with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, but still something to keep in mind. Also, to answer a question that has come up quite a bit, this is the FULL BOOK and not an abridged or shortened version.<br/><br/>The overall quality is fantastic. The colors are vibrant and the images are, in my opinion, even better than those in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: The Illustrated Edition (Harry Potter, Book 1).<br/><br/>The best features:<br/>1. Underneath the book jacket, the novel is bound in a sturdy orange hardback with green lettering on the spine.<br/>2. The paper is thick with an eggshell glossy finish.<br/>3. All chapter intros are illustrated.<br/>4. Some images take up full pages or multiple pages. Most illustrations share the page with text.<br/>5. Every inch of the book is illustrated or decorated in some fashion. There are NO white pages in the book. Even the pages without large illustrations have the paper printed and marked with ink blots or paper "stains". In Chamber of Secrets (compared to Sorcerer's Stone), some pages even have beautiful patterns over the entire page. One page has a spider-web pattern and is right next to a picture of Aragog. Quite brilliant overall.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to read the series (again, or for the first time), especially if you plan to read this with someone younger. Based on the fact that the illustrations for this book were even better than in the first book, I'm now looking forward to the rest of the series even more. Prisoner of Azkaban is next and I'm heartbroken it'll be so long before I get to have it in my collection.
 I didn't read Potter as a child, unfortunately Christians were making a fuss over it and it was banned. Now as an adult with an 11 year old daughter I delved in and having read the firs chapter of the first  book , I declared I didn't get the fuss...<br/><br/>I am now in my second read through of the books. I finished them in three weeks.  We've watched the first three movies and I await my daughter finishing each box anxiously so we can watch the next!<br/><br/>The books are so well written they transport you, nothing less. It's a great escape at the end of the day.<br/><br/>As for all the Christian hullabaloo there's no real magic in the book. It's on par with bewitched or cartoons. I suppose if you're the type to ban Disney then these aren't for you, but for the rest of the population they're really harmless and silly.<br/><br/>The later books are a bit darker but the first several are really kind of cartoon magic.<br/><br/>This second book is better than the first as we are already introduced to all the characters. Character development and friendships deepen in the second book and you begin to become attached to the little magicians and start to realize why this series created such a rabid fandom.<br/><br/>The books are adventurous and imaginative and have so much heart. The stories are packed with substance- very little to no filler in these books. They're a kids series, but it's the first time in a long time I have read a book and didn't feel like skimming a good bit. There's nothing you want to miss in these!<br/><br/>It's great for a parent to read with their child, bc anytime you can bond over something especially as they get older it's a wonderful thing.<br/><br/>And for those adults who didn't read as a kid, go ahead, you won't be bored. Yes they're kids books but they're written on a level everyone can enjoy. That's the real magic!
 The Chamber of Secrets is in my opinion the weakest of the Harry Potter books.  Still, it is a great read compared to 90% of other books in general, and 99% of other children's fantasy novels.  The art in these books are simply amazing.  They add to the story subtly, rather than take the story over as the movies did.  To me, this is vital, as part of the joy of the Harry Potter world is the evocation of your imagination.  I am happy to give my kids a little push with art, as they clearly still create their own images of quidditch, Hagrid, and the often explosive and unexpected effects of Ron's broken wand.
 These illustrated editions of Harry Potter were done right! All of the original text is there and the artwork is beautiful. Every page has something, whether it's an illustration that takes up a full double page spread, a little drawing in the corner, a thematic border, or just a visually textured background. It may sound chaotic, like the visuals could be too much and break up the flow of reading but it is not; it enhances the story as you turn the pages and delight in the new visuals that each page brings. I imagine these would be a great way to bring children into the story, but they're so nice you may want to protect and collect these beauties. I can't wait for them to release the others.
 These Illustrated edition’s are my first time ever reading the Harry Potter series, and I am so happy to be reading the series through these editions. The illustrations add so much magic, liveliness, intrigue, and fun to the story of Harry Potter. I absolutely love these editions and I can’t wait to turn each page to see the story progress as well as see the beautiful illustrations. I can’t recommend these books enough especially if you have never read Harry Potter, this is the perfect way to start and truly be immersed in the world of Hogwarts and the magic that each page brings. J. K Rowling’s writing is so much fun to read and it truly keeps you captivated in the plot, settings and characters. The writing is also the kind that keeps you from not wanting to stop as the book is so well written and portrayed through words. This is quickly becoming one of my top two series I have ever read. 100% recommend getting the illustrated edition as you will fall in live from the first page.
 The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating
 Stunning Hardback Collection<br/><br/>As for the books being hardback vs paperback debate. This set that I am reviewing (the set in this picture ISBN:9781408856789) are indeed the hardback as stated in the listing. I would encourage you just to read the description of what you are ordering and check the ISBN for details.<br/><br/>The art work on the covers of the Red Collection is beautiful. The hardback also has golden inlay stars on the actual cover on all the books as well as golden inlay writing on the Spine.<br/><br/>I got this set in the mail yesterday and stayed up way to late last night reading. :) I am an almost 37 year old adult and I am over the moon in love with the beauty of these books. I actually ordered this hardback set as a Birthday gift to myself from myself. I never read the books growing up but always enjoy the movies and watch them often with my kids. I highly recommend this version set to anyone who appreciates lovely art work on covers.
 The story itself is already a classic - it needs no reviewing. However, the artwork is new and it is AMAZING. I am not kidding when I tell you that I LOVE the illustrations.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter movies are great, but they don't capture the magic of Harry Potter very well (the first 2 do a decent job, but they become more action movies after that). My second gripe with the movies is that after they came out, 99.9% of Harry Potter merchandise is based on the movies and the way things are portrayed in the movies. I get it. It makes sense. But I don't like it.<br/><br/>The illustrations in these books are actually based on the descriptions from the books! It is so hard to find high-quality illustrations that are made based on the books and not the movies. I LOVE IT. These books do a really great job of capturing the feeling I had as a kid reading the books, before the movies! You will be surprised how different some of the characters look compared to the movies, but you'll love it! I honestly would like to purchase each of these illustrations as stand-alone prints and hang them up. Perhaps one day if I have the space and I'm not broke. I'm a teacher, so that's not likely to ever happen :)
 This is a sure fire, jump-up-and-down, and wiggle-in-excitement Christmas gift for the niece. She’s been asking for this set since she was 3! I’ve always been amazed that she knew about Harry Potter from so young. My deal was that she’d get the set once she was a little older and a great reader. She started reading early - later that same year actually - and she is now a full grade ahead of her class in reading. I’m going to credit some of her accomplishment to her sincere desire to join Hogwarts.<br/><br/>I already own this exact set and cannot wait to share in the excitement with her. There’s no need to attest to the greatness of this story; you’d have to live under a rock to not know about the acclaim of the Harry Potter series. Instead, I will say that the set arrived in great condition. The box is sturdy and keeps all of the books organized.<br/><br/>I’m patiently waiting for the call on Christmas Day when, again, I’ll be the best aunty ever. Haha!<br/><br/>Update: As expected, my phone rang Christmas afternoon to screams that she got the HP set. Sorry Santa, but she instantly knew that only an aunty could think of such a great gift as this. She now insists on reading a chapter with her mom each night before bed.
 I bought these to replace my books I have had forever and got destroyed. Well I hadn't gotten a chance to read them until recently when I decided to reread them. I read the first (socerers stone) and second(chamber of secrets). I went to read the third, the prisoner of azkaban instead it was a chamber of secrets eith a prisoner of azkaban jacket overtop. So I go to look and my "goblet of fire" is actually another "order of phoenix". So instead of having books 1,2,3,4,5,6,7  I have 1,2,25,5,6,7. I am so angry right now! I wish I had looked earlier and discovered I had been screwed.
 Thought I was getting the illustrated version so I was disappointed... until I started reading. I'm enthralled in the series all over again, and to be honest, illustrations would probably take away from the vivid images I already have in my mind plus those books are bigger and harder to read with small hands. These books are spectacular- I won't review content because everyone knows they're amazing! I love FINALLY having my own set. I'm a 29 yr old lady who originally read these as they were published, varying sizes bought, and split up between sisters. This is one box set that's all MINE!
 Order of the Phoenix is missing quite a few pages 😡It’s missing p.174-224.
 Pages missing from page 28 to 77!
 Book pages fell out after only a few days of reading. Doesn't even have any wear and tear.
 The books are fantastic BUT in this combo pack: pages are missing, chapters are missing and since there are all 7 books together it would be nice to have a table of contents so it you wanted to read "The Order of the Phoenix" you could easily find it.  VERY disappointed in this combination, it is nicer having the separate books.
 I have the first illustrated deluxe book and wanted this one, but the price was close to $300 on Barnes and Noble. I saw this one, sold from a seller in the UK, which was about $120, including shipping, and hoped that it would be the same as the one sold at BN and bought it. I was completely delighted to see that it is the same as the one on BN at about half the price. It comes with the protective cardboard box, just like the first book did, and the slipcase. I suspect that this is the British version of the story, which is exactly the same as the US version except for certain words like Mum vs. Mom. I highly recommend this version if you want a beautiful and collectible book that you can pass down to your children.
 I bought this collection as a gift for my girlfriend. Before choosing this one I saw a couple of reviews showing beautiful illustrations, between other choices of Harry Potter collections, the illustrations I saw for this book series is what made me choose this collection in particular. Unfortunately this group of books did not have the illustrations. Although my gf liked the gift, we were both slightly disappointed that it wasn't what we expected. I personally believe that pictures of products that are not of the item(s) being bought should not be displayed on the reviews. I wouldn't have bought this item if that were the case.
 So I was an idiot when I was a child and thought Harry Potter was dumb. I was wrong, obviously. Well long story short I didn't have hard copies of the books! So this worked out perfectly. All the books are hardcover and it's a great collection. Only two downsides:<br/>1. The price (that's expensive for books)<br/>2. The box. You would think that for the price the box that the books go in would be made of something other than cardboard.<br/>In conclusion if you have the books, don't worry about buying these as an extra copy. If you don't have any of the books, then it's a good buy.
 I was ecstatic when I saw these in Barnes and Noble and bought one immediately at 40 bucks a pop (which would still be worth it), but once i saw it on Amazon at almost HALF the price, I returned mine back to Barnes and Noble and bought TWO on Amazon sui I could gift one to my Harry Potter loving cousin for Christmas and keep one for myself. I have been wanting to reread these for awhile since it's been so long and I tried awhile back and it was hard because I'm 31 now and the first books are pretty young reading. I think these new books are going to bring the reread to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL! The art is literally phenomenal. It's beautiful and dark and adult. I'm looking forward to collecting all of these to pass on to my daughter who is 7 now. I think she'll be into these soon and can pass them down to her children because they are classic and hardcover so they should last. LOVE.
 My son (8 years old) has been hesitant to read the Harry Potter series because the novels looked too intimidating. But after my sister got him the first book like this one, he dove right in and finished in a week. I got this one for him and he finished it just as quickly as the first! My only disappoint came when I realized the other books haven't been printed like this yet. Of course, now that he's been introduced to the series, he's fine with reading the third one "like a regular book." :)
 I ordered the blue collection set that pieces together Hogwarts in the spines of all the books combined. The books came perfectly in their boxed collection set. Each book, though paperback, has a soft/matte cover. Each chapter at the top has an illustration. Bought this for myself (I’m 24 and reading for the first time, be jealous! Nothing like that special first time experience!) to pass down to my kids &amp; hopefully their kids because I know Harry Potter will be a lifetime classic!
 Just phenomenal! Of course, the story is the amazing series I started reading over a decade ago. But these illustrated versions are just beautiful! The artwork is incredible! There were a few scenes I wish would've been illustrated that weren't but, overall it exceeded my expectations just like the first.
 I wanted a full set of the seven hardcover Harry Potter volumes for my son and thought this pre-packaged group was an interesting choice.  I think he'll like the "treasure chest" (or foot locker) motif of the container, and all of the volumes are the the standard good quality, full-size, dustjacketed editions.<br/><br/>You'll find lots of other reviews of the Potter series -- mostly adoring, of course.  Suffice it to say that I wouldn't have gotten these if I didn't similarly admire the books.<br/><br/>By the way, even though I have a DVD set of the films, I plan on having my child read the books before seeing any of the visual interpretations.<br/><br/>One comment about the enclosing decorative carton for this set:  It's substantial enough, but definitely just cardboard, and I can't predict how well it will hold up over the years.  I suppose I expected something of slightly more heft, but it's not enough of a concern for me to drop to 4 stars.<br/><br/>Do look around for a good price ... I had no trouble finding this shrinkwrapped set at a price well below the total cost of buying all seven hardcover volumes separately ... plus you get the box if you want it!
 The ubiquity of Harry Potter (movies and books alike) stretches across the globe. When my girlfriend was looking for an accessible fantasy series to get into, this immediately came to mind. We both had seen all of the movies multiple times, but had never really touched the books beyond the first two in the series. I therefore purchased this box set for my girlfriend and she has since read all of them (it took her just about two weeks in total!) The storytelling, world, and characters were as compelling, vivid, and resonant with her as the rest of the countless fans around the world. These books are awesome page-turners and are accessible to a wide range of age-levels. Anybody looking for a way to get into quality fantasy or to just get lost in a magical and engaging world should look no further and purchase this box set!
 I am a veteran of several trips through the Harry Potter saga, and each time I enter the world of witches and wizards I am amazed at Rowling's wizardry in creating this rich, and exciting tale of a boy and his friends' adventures and maturing. If escapism is your goal, the Harry Potter series is a great choice. What I appreciated about the Deathly Hallows is the confident plotting. The story flows, and the sins and omissions of the characters are rewarded and punished. I like the series -- a lot. If there is anything annoying about Harry Potter is his sheer dumb luck. Very few literary characters have managed to squeeze out victory against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>By all means, buy the series for your Kindle and have a wonderful world waiting for you whenever you need it.
 I got exactly what the description states and pictures of the item show. However, I was and still am, very confused with all the reviews for the pictures being amazing since this collection has no pictures.<br/><br/>Seems like the reviews are for a completely different product. So I was very disappointed to learn that this product was not what all the reviews I read were for. I am debating returning but my son seems pleased never the less, so I'm torn. I guess it's my fault at the end of the day for not doing more research.<br/><br/>Rating on the actual product I cant really knock it. Books seem fine but the "chest" is pretty low quality.
 Boy am I glad Amazon exists in these days!<br/>I bought the limited editions that were only available in the UK/Ireland.<br/>I have always wanted a luxury Harry Potter item, and this just screamed out to me!<br/><br/>If you don't want the hassle, or to spend easy 4-8 times the amount though, you can get the US/other languages of this book for roughly $30-$40.<br/>It is totally worth the price as I love the artwork associated with the Harry Potter novels. As good as the movies are, the art isn't the same as the illustrations that demand to be seen in these books!<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars FOR SURE!
 The progression of Harry’s story from an 11 year old just off to Hogwarts to a 17 year old off too take down Voldemort is truly remarkable.  Harry has matured, and yet he’s still a teenager, with his mercurial teenaged emotions and concerns. All of Harry’s friends have likewise matured. Excellent character development is one of J. K. Rowling’s gifts to the world. If a young reader has made it this far, they deserve to keep going and finish the series. It’s a very serious book and deals with death and dying quite a bit, as well as loss, love, friendship, and redemption. You WILL cry.
 What can I say about JK Rowling's runaway best-selling series that hasn't already been said? This captivating septology had me hooked from beginning to end. The story is familiar to many. A bespectacled orphan boy, Harry Potter, goes to a school for wizards to learn magic and faces off against the evil Lord Voldemort (or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named). Prior to his acceptance to Hogwarts, Harry has been an outcast all his life, forced to live in a broom cupboard by his cruel aunt and uncle and constantly tortured by his cousin, Dudley. His whole life changes when he receives his acceptance letter and learns that he is actually a wizard, and he also learns that he is famous in the wizarding community for the downfall of Voldemort.<br/><br/>At his new school, he meets his best friends, Ron and Hermione. Over the course of the seven books, the three of them go on many adventures together, mature from children to young adults, and face off against Voldemort.<br/><br/>The series is great for escapism, with its vivid imagery, rich world-building, and  thrilling plot twists. I loved reading about all the different creatures and how magic works in this world. The books will keep you turning page after page as Harry faces off against seemingly impossible odds. Someone may say that Harry relies too much on luck to get him out of scrapes, but keep in mind that although he inadvertently defeated Voldemort once, he is still a teenage boy. In a straight up magical battle against Voldemort, wand to wand, Harry simply doesn't have the experience to come out on top.<br/><br/>Get this phenomenal series today and enjoy this spellbinding world of witches and wizards. I have the whole series on my Kindle, and it was worth every penny! I highly recommend these books for readers of all ages.
 Boy do I feel like a sucker, suckered by packaging. This set is not worth the money and the box that looks real from a distance is cheep cardboard. To be fair the books are of good quality but that is to be expected. The problem is you can get them for less then half the price without that fake box.
 I have to give Rowling credit: she really understands how to structure the books so you can't put them down.  Just as you reach the end of a chapter (and, therefore, a logical breakpoint), she sucks you right into the next one.<br/><br/>I re-read the series to compare the books to the movies.  I think I like the books better than the movies, especially  this one.  She did an excellent job of tying up the loose ends.  The movie had a lot of questionable subjects: like when Harry is using the Resurrection Stone, why weren't Tonks and Fred present, since Lupin was (answer: they weren't germain to telling the tale.)<br/><br/>The only problem I have with the series is that the first book needs to have a stronger binding.  Each time a new book came out, I went back and re-read all the books.  So I've read Sorcerer's Stone over 10 times now, and the binding has split. The other books are still intact. I tend to treat my books very gently, so it isn't a matter of abuse, it's a matter of overuse. But they are very enjoyable.
 The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/
 Before I start this review, can we just take a second and rejoice in the amount of Harry Potter-related stuff we're getting this year?  *Screams in excitement*<br/><br/>Ok, Now, on to this review!<br/><br/>I  have been anxiously awaiting the release of the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets since I finished the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!  Some people might wonder why I'd buy another version of any of the Harry Potter books, but this is an absolute MUST HAVE if you even so much as LOVE Harry Potter and the wizarding world in general.  Jim Kay has always brought JK Rowling's wizarding world to life, but these illustrated editions just take it to a whole new, exciting, and fantastic level.<br/><br/>Part of the joy of reading (at least for me) has always been bringing the words on pages alive in my own imagination.  This may seem counterintuitive to my raving review, but what if I told you that almost everything illustrated was at the very least close to what I had always imagined? It's probably part of the brilliance of JKR's vibrant descriptions, but it's still pretty cool when you see them.<br/><br/>The illustrated edition of Chamber of Secrets is phenomenal in short.  Inside the cover you see the Hogwarts Greenhouses, and it only gets better from there! I would like to say I could totally use LESS of the illustrations of the acromantuals!  GROSS! Not only are they all over the contents pages, but there are WAY too many full page(s) photos of these gross spiders!  PASS!  My two favorites though are the illustrations of the phoenix and of Dobby!<br/><br/>I could laude over the illustrations for a year, but I won't.  What I love about this book (and for the whole collection of illustrated editions I hope!) is that this is the version I can see first introducing my (future) children to Harry Potter with.  I put these on my bookshelves waiting for the day when I can show my kids the wonderful world that has filled my life with such fun and fantasy.<br/><br/>The book DOES include the full text of Chamber of Secrets in case any of you were wondering, it just also includes some fantastic illustrations from Jim Kay!<br/><br/>If you love Harry Potter, don't hesitate.  Collect these editions! You and your family will love this for a long, long time!
 Absolutely love this series! This is definitely worth owning. Whether you're just getting into Harry Potter, or have grown up loving this series, the illustrated series is worth owning. We love the illustrations, the text and everything about this book. Yes, this is the full book, and not an abridgment of the story.
 This second book in the famous Harry Potter series is just as riveting and captivating as the first, solidifying in my mind that Rowling is an absolutely amazing author.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I actually have found that I don't usually like fantasy novels all that much, but the world that Rowling creates for Harry Potter actually makes me feel right at home, and I can easily connect with the characters.  This might have something to do with the fact that I watched the movies first, so I have visuals and such imprinted in my brain, but even so, this fantastical world is easy to follow and become a part of, in my personal opinion.  The story jumps right off the page, wrapping readers up in the awesomeness that is Hogwarts and beyond.<br/><br/>One aspect I really love about this novel is its continuous detail.  From the wizards to their families, potions, spells, and backstory, there is just so much detail that it blows my mind.  Rowling is complete in her descriptions and creation of this world, and the fact that it exists right alongside the human world (which opens the doors for that giddy wishful thinking that maybe, just maybe, it all exists) brings a spark of wonder and jubilation to all.<br/><br/>Dobby is an awesome addition in this novel, and I really liked the introduction of the House Elf.  His abilities and class within the wizarding world is also a bit of a social commentary on our very own society and the way society has treated others, such as slavery, and even the way society treats people today.<br/><br/>And of course, I love the ingenious way that Rowling found to bring Voldemort back into the picture.  The idea of the journal was ingenious, and I am amazed how Rowling is able to bring everything together, from book one to two, and how she'll be able to keep this up in the next five books as well.  Amazing.<br/><br/>Another aspect that I adore about both novel and movie is that, I feel, the movie got it right, from the big to the small, the casting and characters were perfect, in my mind. Professor Lockhart was even more annoying in the book than in the movie, and I loved Rowling's portrayal of him. Potter is, as always, a wonderful role model, and this novel is an all-around feel good story with many happenings to keep it all interesting.  From Dobby and his mischievous antics to a Quidditch match gone awry, from spiders trying to eat people to a snake with the same powers as Medusa, the novel kept me glued to the pages and in this for the long haul. Of course, the characters are even more defined in the novel than they are on the big screen, making it impossible for readers not to connect with them on some level; I loved every minute of this. Book still beats movie, but it's another close call.
 I read all 7 books more than 10 years ago. I can't believe how much I had forgotten! It's as though just a few highlights remained, just enough to pique my interest once again.<br/><br/>I rated this collection with 5 🌟 s because it will hold you spellbound from beginning to end. You will laugh, cry, sit on the edge of your seat, but alas, you must put it down for the day in order to get some sleep!<br/><br/>I don't believe in witches, wizards, ghosts, goblins, elves or even hippogriffs. I don't think these books should be intended for young impressionable children. It could potentially induce nightmares!<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent read. It can be instrumental in educating humanity against the ills of bullying and making fun of those who are different from you. We all have worth, and we all are worthwhile.<br/><br/>God bless.
 ...which is what Harry Potter realized while on his quest to defeat the evil Lord Voldemort.  The difference between him and the Dark Lord was that Voldemort feared death above all else, while Harry understood that death is a necessary part of life and therefore, nothing to fear.<br/><br/>What else can we say about J.K. Rowling's famous septology?  We've had mystery, a bit of romance, mythology, drama, folklore, comedy, and adventure, wrapped up in a wonderful package.  The standout of this story (all well as the previous six books) is Rowling's eye for detail and imagery, as well as character development.  She also understands psychology really well, being able to create distinct personality quirks for each character.  The Potterverse isn't Harry's alone, it's everyone's from owls, centaurs, wizards and witches, house elves, and magic spells.  One is no greater than the other.  I also liked learning the pathology of each of her characters: their fears, desires, their motivations, and ideas.<br/><br/>In this book, Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger decide to carry out Albus Dumbledore's request of Harry to find the remaining Horcruxes in order to finally defeat Voldemort.  Three 17-year old (barely qualified) wizards on a journey to destroy the most evil wizard of the age is not an easy undertaking, physically and emotionally.  They begin their journey in a panicky escape, and sort of improvise the entire way (where would they be without Hermione, one of the most brilliant witches of their generation?)  The journey wears heavily on them, but this is the true coming of age for the three.  What they discover on this journey is probably the greatest education that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry could have never given them.  They experience pain, loss, abandonment, freedom, sacrifice, and most importantly, the impact of love.<br/><br/>If there's anything that I would criticize, it's Rowling's trite epilogue.  Compared with her complex storytelling throughout the series, the epilogue was pretty childlike, a bit corny.  In her defense, she wrote the epilogue very early in her creation of the entire Potterverse, and was determined to stick with it until the very end.  For the orphaned and neglected Harry, who faced death again and again, I suppose that it's only fair that he gets a bit of saccharine.  If anyone deserved a chance at a happy ending, it would be him.  At least for us faithful readers, we know that his major ordeal wasn't all for naught.
 The books are in great condition. I have a hard time purchasing used books, so getting these brand new and wrapped was very helpful.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed in the box. It's cool and it's probably my own fault for not reading the details more closely, but it's really thick cardboard. For whatever reason, I was hoping it was a wooden box. Not a big deal, but if you're purchasing for the box you should know.
 This set of books has to be one of the most beautiful sets in the HP series that I have ever seen. They come in a very nice case that has doors on the front. The books fit perfectly inside the box and it makes for good decoration in my room.
 Dust jacket was garbage when we got it. I opened the book and was shocked!  It had rips everywhere. Very unimpressed with this seller. (The actual book is amazing and beautiful.)
 I found this set when it was on a super deal for $20! Yay, me! Which makes me feel better since we discovered ( a year after purchasing), that the Deathly Hallows book is missing 2 1/2 chapters! It repeats 2 chapters, as well. I’m glad this isn’t he first time through these stories, or we’d be foaming at the mouth trying to figure out what happened! And I’m consoled by the $20 price I paid on sale. I see from other reviews that Scholastic must not care about accuracy and has trouble printing and binding all correct pages together in this set, so buyer beware. Be prepared to head to the library to get another copy of the book when yours is seriously messed up.
 These new paperback Harry Potter editions are absolutely gorgeous! I have made it my goal to get every beautiful edition of Harry Potter out there and this is definitely one of them. To people who have never read Harry Potter... just do it! I mean come on... Wizards/Witches/Friendship/Love! There is nothing to dislike about these books, they are so magical and captivating no matter what age you are!
 You don't need me to review the book as written. This is to note that the paperback version from Scholastic is well made and reasonably durable. We needed to hand out a bunch of copies and these were kid valued, kid friendly physical copies.
 The Harry Potter series is never disappointing. This is my third trip through the books and I’ve enjoyed them more each time. There are so many new things that I noticed with each reading. I would like to have had a few more details about the different kinds of magic like the difference between jinxes and hexes and so on. Overall the books are fun. Best when read as a youth because your imagination hasn’t been destroyed by reality yet.
 I read these one by one as they were released and loved every minute spent devouring every word. I was an adult with grown children during that first read. Now, as an old lady, a really old lady!, I bought the series for my Kindle and have spent the past several weeks binge reading these amazing stories again. They’re better the second time around. I found so many things I had missed. The stories were much richer and very much more meaningful during this marathon immersion. And don’t let anyone dismiss them as ‘just children’s stories’. There’s nothing wrong with a good children’s story but the Harry Potter books are so much more. Amazing tales told by a master craftsman at the top of her game. The level of imagination it took to breathe so much life into these magical characters and the events surrounding them just leaves me awestruck. If this review makes you pick them up for the first time, I’m green with envy at what you’re going to experience. And if, like me, you’re going at them for the second, or more, times, just burrow in and ENJOY!
 I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.
 Bought the Chambers of Secret illustrated book as a gift. When the person received it, the cover jacket was fine, but the both top and bottom corner of the entire book seemed to have water damage. Also, had dirt stains smeared through out the pages. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, especially since this was supposed to be a gift. Now the person has to go through the hassle of returning it.
 This review is for the hardcover set. The books are of course amazing. I've had a paperback set for years and couldn't pass up on the hardcover set when it was on sale (44% off). I would not have gotten them if not for the sale. The only reason it isn't a 5 star review is the "collectible trunk" it came with. It is kind of misleading in the description. I wasn't expecting something luxurious or grand, but it is literally just cardboard with a plastic "privacy lock".<br/><br/>As long as you aren't expecting some super fancy trunk and can get this set when it is on sale, I highly recommend it!
 My favorite thing about this book is how we get to see that wizards and Muggles are much the same.  Mr. Weasley actually thinks that Muggles are fasinating and even "magical" in their own way.  It's a nice little theme that I only picked up since it was my third time reading it.  It's a subtle contrast to the "Muggle-born" hate the goes along with the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>And enter Lockhart - the fun, semi-villain.  He's fun to make fun of and laugh at but I think he represents a villan that we are more likely to encounter in real life or even become ourselves if we're not careful.  He's selfish, vain and will do anything to get ahead including hurting others.<br/><br/>Honestly, this book gave me chills when I first read it. I was not expecting what I considered to be a "kids" book to be scary. I had to finish it in one night so I could sleep.  If I didn't find out how Harry got rid of the voices talking about blood and killing, my subconscious would have no way to fight back in my nightmares.  I have nightmares about everything.<br/><br/>The magical world J.K. Rowling has built is so fantastic and unbelievably real that it makes me ask questions like, "Why is Peeves physical when ghosts are not and why is he afraid of the Bloody Baron?"  And I seriously want an answer.  There is no level of detail that is too much in my mind.  I must know all the things about Hogwarts.  And oh how I love Professor Binns.  He's the ultimate old and boring teacher (another thing that Muggles sadly have, too).<br/><br/>I really can't get over how very relatable this book is to kids.  It deals with the big and small struggles that kids go through every day.  It shows how the characters deal with unfairness and how tedious and boring school can be.  And Harry really acts like a kid  - he doesn't tell Dumbledore important things in the fashion of any kid who is afraid.  Who as a kid didn't tell their parents something even though they knew they should?<br/><br/>After reading it for the third time, it's fun to pick up on the foreshadowing that I missed.  I'm noticing that Ms. Rowling often disguises important things as jokes or just another detail to make the world more interesting and colorful.  Ooh I just get chills when they figure out who Moaning Myrtle is.  See? She's important although at first she appeared to just be a colorful character to annoy them in the bathroom.<br/><br/>I can't end this review without the best quote of the book:<br/><br/>It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.<br/><br/>- J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (p. 333)
 I am re-reading the entire 7-book series after recently downloading a Kindle file that contains all 7 books.<br/><br/>In this second book in the series, Harry returns to Hogwarts after a long and boring summer being ignored and abused by the Dursleys, his Muggle family. He flies the Weasley's car back to Hogwarts after missing the Hogwarts Express at Platform 9-3/4 and crashes the car into a huge tree known as the Whomping Willow. The challenges are just beginning. The 2nd year students are beginning to study Defense Against the Dark Arts, and the menacing situations that they find themselves immersed in are far more difficult and frightening than what they endured last year. They learn about the Chamber of Secrets, which is supposedly hidden somewhere deep in the bowels of Hogwarts Castle. Harry is given his Invisibility Cloak which will be featured in many escapades to come. They are faced with Moaning Myrtle, the self-abusing elf Dobby; the insipid faker Gilderoy Lockhart, spiders the size of carthorses, and many more.<br/><br/>Harry learns from the beloved headmaster Dumbledore, that "The trust is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should...be treated with great caution." Harry spends the rest of this episode is searching for the truth about the Chamber of Secrets and the dreaded Voldemort.
 The really wonderful thing about JK Rowling's endeavors is her ability to create a story line acceptable to all ages.... Except for Deathly Hallows. This book is extremely dark, and yet has an exciting and satisfactory ending. I have read this book three times thus far, and yet I learn more from each visit.  I would recommend this book to all, but strongly suggest the entire series be read in order. Rowling has the skill to recall situations and people introduced in earlier books that reappear if only the second time in Deathly Hallows. Just sit back and enjoy.
 I'm so glad that I decided to re-read these books right now. Because oh, how I am loving them. Reading this book again was a lot of fun. And I loved it so much. Harry is amazing. The Weasleys are so adorable. I love Ron and Hermione. I love the school. I love Hagrid. Just, I have so much love for this book.<br/><br/>I like how every book in this series is about one year at Hogwarts. Harry must spend every summer with the Dursleys. And oh my god. I can't stand them. I really can't. They are so awful towards him. They never get him anything. And they are cruel, in a way. Did not like the small part of them in this book.<br/><br/>There is so much to love about Chamber of Secrets. The writing is gorgeous. I liked it more in this than I did in the first one. This book is special to me. I loved reading about Harry and all his problems. Things aren't going very well for him. He is getting blamed for just about everything, and I must admit to loving that, hah. There was this new teacher in this one. And oh, how he annoyed me. How he annoyed Harry. And it was so much fun to read about. This book is awesome. And not nearly as dark as the books that are coming up.. sigh. Yet still a bit heartbreaking, even so. The writing is lovely. The characters are all perfection to read about. The plot is awesome. All of it is so. I'm so happy that I loved re-reading this gorgeous book.<br/><br/>So much is happening in this one. I don't think I will describe much of it. But I have some thoughts to share. I adore the friendship between Harry and Ron and Hermione. It is stunning to read about. Though I also feel like we don't get to see nearly enough of it, and that makes me a bit sad. Hmph. But I'm okay. Probably. Because there is so much amazing happening at all times. I like reading about Harry's sort of hate relationship with Draco. It's awesome. I don't fully hate this boy. He's a bully, but not the worst one.<br/><br/>I also liked reading about the sport in this book. How awesome Harry is at it. How great he is at flying. I'm all kinds of jealous, though, as I have always wanted to fly. I still adore reading about the different classes in these books. Though not too much about it, so I didn't get tired of it. I keep thinking that I don't see how people could love Snape after book seven, but so far I don't hate him at all. He just seems a bit grumpy, maybe. But yeah. Not liking him much either, to tell the truth. He is interesting, though.<br/><br/>The plot in this book is all kinds of exciting. I loved the mystery about the Chamber of Secrets. About who was turning so many people almost into stone. About the whispering that only Harry could hear. About that annoying Dobby, and all the awful but meant in a good way things he did. I loved reading about the different creatures in this one. Huge spiders. Shudders. Those were awesome. And huge snake. And just, yeah. It was a lot of fun to read about and I can't seem to say much more than that :)<br/><br/>I wish there were tons of things I could say about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. But my mind seems empty. Probably because this book is so awesome that I have no negative things to talk about, hah :) So my review is a lot shorter than usual. But that's okay. I just wanted to share about how much I adored re-reading this book. And how happy I am that I did this right now. You all need to read the Harry Potter books. If you have only read book one, you should know that this one is even better. It's so good.
 This is for our 3-grade grandson.  We gave him The Sorcerers Stone to him in  July for his birthday.  He read it in 4 days.  He is hopefully awaiting the next installment which he will receive for Christmas.  The book is beautifully illustrated, just perfect for a young reader. New look forward to adding the books to his beginning collection as the new books are produced.  Since wevhavevall read the Harry Potter series, our grandson enjoyed asking questions for clarification and discussing the why or how of the characters.<br/>If you have a reader who wants to dig into some outstanding reads with beautiful illustrations, this is the book for you!
 great book. i grew up during the time the books were being released but for some reason never read them at the time. i saw every movie and i loved them all. just recently i decided to start reading, the first one was free as a prime member so i thought 'why not?'. i asked my friends if i should read them even though i essentially knew what happened because i had seen the movies, they all said yes and they were right. the details are great, it makes you wish certain things from the book made it into the movies. my goal is to at least read a couple more books (it took a month each to finish the first two, just reading when i had some time) this year. it would be even better to finish the complete series but i know the books get longer so we'll see about that.
 The final confrontation between Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the "symbol of hope" for both the Wizard and Muggle worlds, and Lord Voldemort, He Who Must Not Be Named, the nefarious leader of the Death Eaters and would-be ruler of all. Good versus Evil. Love versus Hate. The Seeker versus the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>10 years in the making, from the Greek myths to Dickens and Tolkien to "Star Wars." And true to its roots, it ends with good old-fashioned closure: heart-racing, bone-chilling confrontation and an epilogue that clearly lays out people's fates. Getting to the finish line is not seamless -- the last part of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the seventh and final book in the series, has some lumpy passages of exposition and a couple of clunky detours -- but the overall conclusion and its determination of the main characters' story lines possess a convincing.<br/><br/>With each installment, the "Potter" series has grown increasingly dark, and this volume is no exception. While Ms. Rowling's astonishingly limber voice still moves effortlessly between Ron's adolescent sarcasm and Harry's growing solemnity, from youthful exuberance to more philosophical gravity, "Deathly Hallows" is, for the most part, a somber book that marks Harry's final initiation into the complexities and sadnesses of adulthood.<br/><br/>From his first days at Hogwarts, the young, green-eyed boy bore the burden of his destiny as a leader, coping with the expectations and duties of his role, and in this volume he is clearly more high-spirited war games of Quidditch have given way to real war, and Harry often wishes he were not the de facto leader of the Resistance movement, shouldering terrifying responsibilities, but an ordinary teenage boy -- free to romance Ginny Weasley and hang out with his friends.<br/><br/>Harry has already lost his parents, his godfather Sirius and his teacher Professor Dumbledore (all mentors he might have once received instruction from) and in this volume, the losses mount with unnerving speed: at least a half-dozen characters we have come to know die in these pages, and many others are wounded or tortured. Voldemort and his followers have infiltrated Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, creating havoc and terror in the Wizard and Muggle worlds alike, and the members of various populations -- including elves, goblins and centaurs -- are choosing sides.<br/><br/>No wonder then that Harry often seems overwhelmed with disillusionment and doubt in the final installment of this seven-volume. He continues to struggle to control his temper, and as he and Ron and Hermione search for the missing Horcruxes (secret magical objects in which Voldemort has stashed parts of his soul, objects that Harry must destroy if he hopes to kill the evil lord), he literally enters a dark wood, in which he must do battle not only with the Death Eaters, but also with the temptations of hubris and despair.<br/><br/>Harry's weird psychic connection with Voldemort (symbolized by the lightning-bolt forehead scar he bears as a result of the Dark Lord's attack on him as a baby) seems to have grown stronger too, giving him clues to Voldemort's actions and whereabouts, even as it lures him ever closer to the dark side. One of the plot's significant turning points concerns Harry's decision on whether to continue looking for the Horcruxes -- the mission assigned to him by the late Dumbledore -- or to pursue the Hallows, three magical objects said to make their possessor the master of Death.<br/><br/>Harry's journey will propel him forward to a final showdown with his arch enemy, and also send him backward into the past, to the house in Godric's Hollow where his parents died, to learn about his family history and the equally mysterious history of Dumbledore's family. At the same time, he will be forced to ponder the equation between fraternity and independence, free will and fate, and to come to terms with his own frailties and those of others. Indeed, ambiguities proliferate throughout "The Deathly Hallows": we are made to see that kindly Dumbledore, sinister Severus Snape and perhaps even the awful Muggle cousin Dudley Dursley may be more complicated than they initially seem, that all of them, like Harry, have hidden aspects to their personalities, and that choice -- more than talent or predisposition -- matters most of all.<br/><br/>It is Ms. Rowling's achievement in this series that she manages to make Harry both a familiar adolescent -- coping with the frustrations of school and dating. This talent has enabled her to create a narrative that effortlessly mixes up allusions to Homer, Milton, Shakespeare and Kafka, with silly kid jokes about vomit-flavored candies, a narrative that fuses a plethora of genres (from the boarding-school novel to the detective story to the epic quest) into a story that could be Exhibit A in a Joseph Campbell survey of mythic archetypes.<br/><br/>In doing so, J. K. Rowling has created a world as fully detailed as L. Frank Baum's Oz or J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, a world so minutely imagined in terms of its history and rituals and rules that it qualifies as an alternate universe, which may be one reason the "Potter" books have spawned such a passionate following and such fervent exegesis. With this volume, the reader realizes that small incidents and asides in earlier installments (hidden among a huge number of red herrings) create a breadcrumb trail of clues to the plot, that Ms. Rowling has fitted together the jigsaw-puzzle pieces of this long undertaking with Dickensian ingenuity and ardor. Objects and spells from earlier books -- like the invisibility cloak, Polyjuice Potion, Dumbledore's Pensieve and Sirius's flying motorcycle -- play important roles in this volume, and characters encountered before, like the house-elf Dobby and Mr. Ollivander the wandmaker, resurface, too.<br/><br/>The world of Harry Potter is a place where the mundane and the marvelous, the ordinary and the surreal coexist. It's a place where cars can fly and owls can deliver the mail, a place where paintings talk and a mirror reflects people's innermost desires. It's also a place utterly recognizable to readers, a place where death and the catastrophes of daily life are inevitable, and people's lives are defined by love and loss and hope -- the same way they are in our own mortal world.
 I will never tire of reading these books.  As soon as I read the last line I am ready to begin the journey again.  This is by far the longest and most complex of the books, and while there is much sadness and devastation in this story, there are moments of sweetness and joy.  I was less than thrilled with the film's adaptation of this particular book, especially the battle of Hogwarts.  Having recently re-watched Part 2 of the film it was satisfying to read the original written story again.  In spite of some more significant deaths that occur.  Almost everyone who reads this, if anyone does in fact read it, has already read the books, but I'll refrain from anything too obvious, in the hopes that new generations will continue to discover and love this series as I have.
 As detailed and amazing as the first illustrated edition! The illustrations reflect the darker tone of Chamber of Secrets. The designers flipped the layout using black on white ink to enhance the suspense in some of the darker chapters. The effect is beautiful and intense.  There are two page spreads, character portraits and two creature portraits highlighting Mandrakes and the Phoenix. I can't praise this book enough. I am extremely looking forward to the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban. I'm sure it will be my favorite.
 Beautiful covers and tough packaging. Bought these for my neices and nephews. I can read them but they are having trouble because the print on the pages. Several are blurry like this and book 1 (currently in my neices possession) has several pages with light spots down the middle and you can barely make out the words. They keep bringing the books to us for help. Haven't been into the other 4 books yet. I imagine they will be similar.
 I am pretty certain that more children today have read "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" than "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and whether that's a bad thing or a good thing, I don't really have an opinion.  One distinction shared by the two books is that they've both been featured at the top of "challenged books" lists, i.e., books that people sought to have banned from libraries, though Twain a lot longer than Rowling.  I see it as a badge of honor for both authors.<br/><br/>HPDH is a big, rambling book.  And what are children getting in their nearly eight hundred-page tome that concludes the seven-book Harry Potter series?  Harry explaining things as usual (or not, as the case may be) to his buddies Ron and Hermione, some considerable searching for "Horcruxes" and "hallows," and a lot of death and mayhem.  In other words, just what the kids ordered.<br/><br/>Rowling shows a sure hand in this volume.  Her style feels considerably more polished than at the start of the series, and she gets the mood right, dark and foreboding.  I must say the Horcruxes and hallows threads get rather complicated though ingenious and, in the case of the hallows, even lyrical.  You know it's complicated when our hero Harry has to explain it all to arch-villain Voldemort, and yet his Lordship doesn't seem to quite get it, does he?<br/><br/>Someone has said that film adaptations of adventure stories capture action better than the books on which they're based, and the original novels are superior in characterization exposition.  If true, part of the reason for this is that movies can only show so much in two-to-three hours, and books can, as in this case, just go on and on.  Also, watching things going boom is arguably a lot cooler than reading about things going boom.  However that may be, it seems to this reviewer that the movies really did excel in the action sequences and the book in delivering depth in characterization.  As the only novel in the series that is not really structured by a year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--this one was to have been Harry's last--HPDH depicts Harry's trials largely far away from the familiar haunts of the previous books.  When he finally does return to the school, there's almost a palpable sense that he's no longer the boy wizard.<br/><br/>Despite the cinematographer's advantage, the climactic battle late in the story is well executed.  This is the only book that I read after viewing the film version, and so I am at a disadvantage in trying to be evenhanded in treating the novel.  Even so, Rowling describes the battle effectively and, at the same time, pleases her fans by uniting all the surviving characters from the novels.  Not as convincing, as mentioned above, was Potter's insistence on explaining things to Voldemort rather than simply dispatching him.  It was like one of those Bond movies where the villain sets up a Rube Goldberg death machine to dispose of the hero (allowing him to escape because it's so slow), but in reverse.  "Let me tell you where you went wrong..." is the uptake, and you want to go, "No, you idiot, kill him!"<br/><br/>Reading the seven Harry Potter books aloud to my daughter has been a highlight of our lives over the past several years.  She's been absolutely delighted by the novels, and I have been thrilled to spend time reading them to her.  And so now, having performed these books, all the while trying to keep straight all the different voices of the various characters, it's sad to say goodbye.  Also, I believe I am now entitled to The Order of the Phoenix, honoring parents who read aloud all of the increasingly longer books.<br/><br/>"Dad, that's not what the Order of the Phoenix is!"<br/><br/>I know, I know.
 Wonderful collected of a beloved, classic series! Great gift for Harry Potter fans in your life. Arrived on time, as described. If you like a beautiful boxed set to display without the extra expense and weight of a hardback collection, go for this set. This set is a keepsake. I have the kindle books and this boxed set as a sentimental collectors item.
 I have been trying to replace items my mover "lost" but I ordered the wrong book. I own the book read by Jim Dale. Sadly I now have two of these. As an older Harry Potter fan,I highly recommend all the books. I love that these genius books brought so many hundreds of thousands of people to reading. Audio books are great at bedtime instead of TV. They allow one to listen while doing other things. They are just brilliant!
 I have bought every single book throughout the years as they came out, both in hardcover U.S. (first two U.K. version) and in paperback Chinese. They are all sitting in my parents' house far away.<br/>I was hesitating to buy another set of hardcovers, but once in a while I've felt strong urges to reread the books so I decided to buy these.<br/>The packaging was very secure - the box set was make out of paper and felt a little bit cheap, but the books look so gorgeous inside. You also get a bunch of stickers to put on our laptop or luggage.<br/>So glad I made this purchase. Now I can enjoy my old bedtime favorite again! :)
 I received my box set today, 10-14-2018. I counted all the pages and every thing was proper. I was worried about the 1 star reviews that I read about saying pages were out of order and things were screwed up.<br/><br/>I received everything I was looking for. The hardcovers are great. The cover jackets were in fine condition. The books themselves came in a plastic sealed box inside the chest itself.<br/><br/>Of course, the books themselves are the best. I love Harry Potter and JK Rowling. She's simply a wonderful writer.<br/><br/>I hope all the problems with missing and out of order pages has been fixed for any new orders. Good luck, happy reading.
 I really enjoy this box set of Harry Potter books. I am a big fan of paperbacks, as you can bring them with you most anywhere.<br/>Also, for anyone who likes to read in bed, they are flexible and forgiving (ever fall asleep reading, and drop a HARDCOVER book on yourself? Ouch! ;)<br/>I love owning the whole series, as I can dive into the world of witchcraft and wizardry anytime I crack one open. Now, that's magic!
 I’m not sure why lots of the reviews show a beautiful illustrated series. I was under the impression that was what I was receiving. While I love the Hogwarts book spines, the insides of the books are plain. It’s very misleading to have reviews that are not for the actual product shown.
 This was a gift for my grandson on his 10th birthday.  He has only recently discovered Harry Potter and had told me he would like a Harry Potter book for his birthday.  At his party, with all the lego presents and other toys from his friends, this was the one that he got most excited over.  When he opened it up and realized what it was he, quite litterally, lept up from the floor and jumped up and down with excitement!  Nothing warms this grandma's heart more than seeing her grandchildren so excited over books!  J. K. Rowling's books will bring joy for generations yet to come!!
 The book itself is Harry Potter if you are looking at book two you know this already - the three stars is not for the book, but for the kindle edition. This is because - even now in 2019 - these books still do not have whispersync between the audible and the kindle editions.<br/>I bought the second book's kindle edition after reading the first through kindle unlimited as a test to see if it was because of the unlimited book's free status. That was not the case.<br/>I attempted to do some research, articles about the series, its popularity as an audio book, and the whispersync availability of other books was misleading. - and yes I know it doesn't say whispersync on the Amazon page for the Potter books. But honestly, there is no good technical reason for it not to be available, and until a time as they enable it on this series my rating will remain the same.
 Of all the books I've only read this one once...well because it was so emotionally powerful. I laughed, I cried, I yelled at the book when the three were doing stupid things, and I cheered when they got things right. Harry, Ron and Hermoine are tested to the limit here in many ways. I cursed Dumbledore with Ron for no telling Harry what to do to defeat Voldemort, but knew he had done the right thing for it was important for Harry, and the others, to be able to grow from figuring it out. All throughout the story the three main characters have success followed by failure as they learn and grow into their adult selves. All I can say is that you just want to shake them as they make wrong,stupid, choices which cause them grief and failure, then cheer as they make the right, smart, choices and take two steps closer to victory. I was surprised at many things in the book, I'm talking about things from past books, which sent me back to read the others to see if Ms Rowling had left us clues that this is what they meant. And of course there is the deaths, which for me made it all the more real because in a grand battle of this proportion it would be unrealistic not to expect deaths. Then there is Draco and his parents who show you characteristics that make you feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>My summary of the book, without spoilers, is WOW!!! Ms Rowlings takes things from all the books and pulls them together and makes a truly epic novel, a great end to the series. The solution to who must live and who must die is very realistic, yeah I know it's not possible in the real world but in light of the world of Hogwarts it is possible there. And like any great book it leaves you with a sense of having been enriched morally for having read it, as another author said, it "Give(s) a feeling of resonance".<br/><br/>While you need to read all of the six previous books, because otherwise as things are pulled together you would be lost, if you only have this one I would tell you to read it anyway because it is great literature.
 There was another product on Amazon that was charging like $140-ish dollars for this and for literally $20 less I got the same thing. Boy was this an awesome buy. For one I love the hardcovers on this. The classic covers is what I love and what I enjoy the most. It's in that awesome trunk case and it's so nice to open the trunk and see all the books so neatly put in there. Honestly cannot wait to dig back into the series again. I wish I had my original copies but my sister decided to take them so this was a treat for me. I love this series and I'm so happy I have the hardcovers and honestly buy this one cause it's cheaper than the other option here on Amazon.
 These audiobooks are a perfect blend of unabridged dramatic reading of an excellent book.  Jim Dale does such an excellent job, it's easy to forget that it is the voice of one person, listening to the reading is like listening to a movie that you can play in your mind.<br/><br/>Jim Dale does such an excellent job, the movies are a disappointment because of what is cut out.<br/><br/>The danger of buying these CD's is that it's hard not to buy all the books; and they ... are all excellent.
 My 9 year old Grandson thought I would reAlly like these books, so I grudgingly thought, ok I,ll read them. Not knowing I was addicted to this story line before the first half of book 1 was done.  JK Rowling was ahead of her time in writing this story that follows so closely to the problems of life and the sins of mankind. Very deep and very moving. A Must read for everyone!
 My child purchased this item, and it was a big deal to her.  The seventh book had some misprinted pages, and we didn't realize it until the return window had closed.  I contacted Amazon on a Sunday evening, asking if there was some way that we could swap it out for a correct copy of the book, and they sent out a whole new set, which arrived less than 36 hours later.  My kiddo was ecstatic.  Awesome books, great boxed set, and AMAZING customer service!
 I bought this for 2 reasons: one of my favorite podcasts was doing a deep-dive of Harry Potter and I wanted to reread it to see if I missed anything. I enjoyed revisiting one of the defining series of my childhood and making all the connections that I missed the first time around. But having the digital editions on Kindle allowed me to save time and the frustration of trying to look for passages that I remembered occurred or of looking for where I left off. In both cases, the Kindle version immediately found what I was looking for (the passage or the place where I left off) and made it much easier to continue the adventure with as little interruption as possible. Great value and support your favorite authors!
 My 8 year old has a hard time reading Harry Potter and these have been wonderful for encouraging her inner Potter nerd. The illustrations and layout of the words on the pages eased her right into it. Even I have enjoyed rekindling my Harry Potter love reading these with her. We have all 3 now, waiting for the 4th to be released. Will be purchasing fantastic beasts and tales of beetle the bard as well in the future.
 I've held off on purchasing Harry Potter in hard back until now,WAITING TO GET ALL 7 VOLUMES WITH THE BRITISH COVER ART-- and I had to go to the UK Amazon site to get mine, but they were well worth the price--even with the extra shipping and the several weeks wait.<br/><br/>The UK cover art is just prettier than the American, and what I really appreciated was that the same art is reproduced on the actual book covers and not just the book jackets.<br/><br/>The covers themselves have a nice powdery soft feeling when you hold them, and the books have a nice legible font. The new book smell is a bit much at first, but that soon clears up.<br/><br/>Not sure I care to keep the box they came in, but it's a nice way to package them-it kept the covers from damage during shipping, even though the blue box itself had a few dings.<br/><br/>Thanks Bloomsbury, for a gorgeous set of Harry Potter books--these are fun to look at and to hold, and they will certainly look colorful on the book shelf.<br/><br/>If you are a Harry Potter fan, or have someone on your gift list who is, these books will be read over and over. You've probably already read them a few times, and if you have children or grandchildren, you will be reading to them--so why not get a quality set that will last.<br/><br/>*updated 12/21.12<br/><br/>Well, I don't know about the "last" part. I have since read my HP collection and I treat my books like holy relics and the spine/papers creased right away. Yes the books have jackets, but I was a little bummed out by this.<br/><br/>LOL Now maybe I need to get the American issues for repeated readings and just let the British versions be decorative.<br/><br/>Hope this was helpful.
 I could go on and on about how talented Rowling is; she does an amazing job in developing her characters, plot, and setting.  She has moments of humor, warmth and depth.  And I LOVE how she developed Snape's character and answered all the questions about this enigmatic character in this final volume.  A superb ending to an excellent series!
 I think it's very, very sad that when people read the word "love" they automatically think of it as having to do with sex. I have read this book 4 times, the last time with my 12 year old daughter, and I NEVER ONCE thought that any of the quotes given by the previous reviewer were trying to allude to Dumbledore's sexuality!!!  I didn't think "sex" I thought of two teenage boys who were too smart and powerful for their own good becoming obsessed with plotting world domination (I have three very smart younger brothers and it's not a stretch to imagine them having that sort of conversation with their friends)!<br/>If there was anything that read as having a remotely sexual undertone it was Alberforth and his obsession with goats, but I'm pretty sure that's not anything a kid would be thinking of!<br/>I also never thought of Snape's love for Lily as creepy.  Okay, so he was a very creepy man, but Lily had been his friend and confidant since childhood.  He would do anything for her, even after her death. Snape's was the kind of love that Voldemort never understood and would never suspect would be anyone's driving force for betraying him.<br/>Yes, the 7th book is definately dark and I wouldn't recommend even starting the series for younger then 5th grade. The series is written as seen through the eyes of Harry.  So, it starts out with being as innocent as an 11 year old and ends up as sad and bloody as an 18 year old going to war.<br/>Sorry the last reviewer didn't like the ending.  Yeah, it does basically come out to, "And they all lived happily ever after..." but it makes you have to think about it.  It made for an interesting conversation between my daughter and I.  Personally I think Harry, who had expressed having had enough excitement to last him a life time, apprenticed to Olivander and learned all of the deep, dark secrets of wandmaking.  :~)
 My son loves reading this book. We both love the a,axing illustrations. This is definitely an heirloom series. We have the first two books in the series and will buy all the rest as they are released. I also LOVE that it has a built in ribbon to use as a bookmark. My son rarely uses bookmarks and is always carelessly letting them fall out around the house. Then he leaves his books upside down. This is not a book to leave upside down.
 The seventh Harry Potter book. It was just as action packed and mysterious as the other six, but there are some necessary differences.<br/><br/>Dumbledore is gone, but his ghost is present through many of Harry's actions. Dumbledore's relative absence from the seventh book is necessary because it allows Harry Potter to take the lead in the final battle against  Voldemort and his Death Eaters.<br/><br/>This was Harry Potter's definitive growing up moment. It's also a real testament that Rowling gave everyone their crowning moment, even in death. Many old friends return for the final battle of Hogwarts as the series comes to a close.<br/><br/>It would've been easy to let Harry Potter have all the glory of the final victory. By not doing that, it reinforces Potter's image as the anti-Voldemort. There's also something distinctly human about this seventh book. The conflicts between Harry and Dumbledore over who the ladder really is and the conflicts between best friends Harry, Ron, and Herimone lead one to question who their true friends are.<br/><br/>In between these conflicts, and the ever present question of whose side Snape is on, the final Harry Potter hits a home run.
 Yes, the case is cardboard. But, it's pretty heavy duty for what it is. Sure, if you give it to a toddler to play with, they could probably tear it apart. But if you use it like a normal adult, to literally sit on a shelf and hold a book, it will probably last forever. The books themselves are just as advertised, all books and pages are present.
 Love this book and frankly all the books in the series.  I purchased this book in 2007 and decided to go back and  reread all the books.  Just as exciting and page turning as the first time I read them.  The movies sucked, but the books are awesome (for anyone who only watched the movies - you should def buy and read these books.  You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't).
 Bought the box set for my good friend for xmas and with her being a HUGE HP fan and not owning all of the books she is in love. I'm so happy. The box came in good condition, none of the books look messed up from the back angle. I haven't unwrapped it since it is a gift for a friend but as far as I can tell they're in mint condition. I'm so glad I got them when I did!
 There is a chapter in this book titled "The Wedding" ---- My sweet daughter saw this book on Etsy -- they wanted $200 for the darn thing because someone decided to cut a heart shape hole starting at the wedding chapter --- I sealed mine with a Heart Shaped cookie cutter to give the completed box ring book a finished edge -- You tube has great videos to help you along your way to greatness !!! I secured the section with silk ribbon making it easier for the wedding couple to find the rings enclosed
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is perhaps the least impressive of all the Harry Potter books. The novel is still one of the very best of the genre, but compared to the other books in the series, Chamber of Secrets felt rushed and was less in depth than what we expect from these books.<br/><br/>The earlier Harry Potter books are much shorter than the final four in the series. While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone managed to make the very post of it's page count, Chamber of Secrets seemed to focus more on plot progression than the wonderful details we loved in the first book. The story was very fast paced. It had to be to fit a story with so much action into such a small space. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a consistently thrilling adventure, but I would have loved if we could have explored Hogwarts and the rest of the magical world in as much detail as in Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>During my re-read of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was struck by just how protective Fred and George seem to be of both Harry and their family. On first reading, all I could see what their face value of irresponsible jokesters. I felt like I saw them much more clearly this time around and loved all the things that showed them to be deeper than they first appeared.<br/><br/>While Ginny did appear in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we really get to know her better in Chamber of Secrets. I loved how clearly unsure of herself she was, especially with what we know of her in later books. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets really sets of the basis from which Ginny grows from.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is most likely my least favorite of all the Harry Potter books, but even being my least favorite of the series, it still gets my highest rating. This book is absolutely necessary to the story as a whole and while not the best of the series, is still well beyond most books of its kind.
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets seems to be the least favorite book of many HP fans. However, for many years The Chamber of Secrets was my second favorite book (this was before I read Deathly Hallows and followed my other favorite The Goblet of Fire). There's just something about it that's so captivating, a bit moreso than The Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>I think my love for The Chamber of Secrets stems from the fact that this is the first time we get an in-depth introduction to the elder Weasleys. In fact, I think the chapter where Harry goes to the Burrow might be my FAVORITE chapter out of all seven books (or at least my favorite "fluffy" chapter). Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are just really great characters and so my love for that chapter knows no bounds.<br/><br/>Of course, The Chamber of Secrets also holds my LEAST favorite chapter out of all seven books: Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party (I can totally see why it was excluded from the movie). It's just such a boring chapter. I do like St. Nicholas, but mostly in small increments. Devoting a whole chapter to him, though, is not my idea of fun.<br/><br/>I also loved the whole rivalry between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slythering. I found it fascinating how Slytherin only wanted "pure" bloods in the school and didn't want any Muggle-borns in (there has to be some allegorical meaning behind THAT). Plus, I remember reading the line "The Chamber of Secrets has now been opened. Enemies of the heir, BEWARE" and literally getting chills on my arm (I'm a bit weird that way).<br/><br/>Oh and let's not forget the inclusion of two very lovable characters: Dobby and Gilderoy Lockheart. There's no need to go in to why Dobby is loveable (he's sweet, loyal, and he's so easy to sympathize with), but Lockheart needs a teeny bit of explaining. He's hilarious. That's it. That's the only reason why I love him. Sure he has a big head and thinks he's God's gift to the wizarding world, but again, he just has such fantastic one-liners ("celebrity is as celebrity does" and my personal favorite "It's like magic!").<br/><br/>So, yes, I love Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's always one of the books out of the series that I look most forward to reading. But, let's face it, I look forward to reading ALL of the Harry Potter series.
 I have read this book with my heart and I will never forget the journey in which Harry started out facing hard times with muggles to him saving the wizarding world. When I finished the book I have been outstanded and awestrucked about the book that J.K. has wrote. I will stick to Harry  Potter forever and when my parents say how long I will like Harry Potter I would say "Always"<br/>Thank you J.K. Rowling for making my life better. Wingardium Leviosa
 This is my favorite of the HARRY POTTER books and I think that it is one of the best fantasies that I ever read.  Why?<br/><br/>(1) More complexity to the characters (although this is partly because many of them were flat in previous books).  On the evildoers' side, Dudley has the nerve to side with Harry against his parents for once.  Draco saves Hermione's life by pretending not to recognize her when the DeathEaters are present.  On the good guys' side, we learn of a tragic mistake in Dumbledore's side.  Harry has to cast some taboo curses, and all three heroes do some unpleasant things like insulting Lupin and making an insincere promise to Griphook.  Rowling doesn't justify them; she just reminds us that they have been demoralized by years of fighting Voldamort.<br/><br/>(2) The way the three heros are pushed to the extreme.  In all the previous books they at least had the partial protection of being at Hogwarts with some support from well-meaning adults.  For most of this book they are strictly on their own, living by their wits.  At the central point Harry is physically and symbolically naked, at the low point of his career, and from this point he finally rises to the point where he can defeat Voldamort.<br/><br/>(3) Oddly enough, the sheer messiness.  It takes the heroes months of futility and going in circles to get things done.  I don't think this is just to pad out the book, or to stretch it out to fit the school year.  It is how problems get handled in the real world, unlike a TV episode where everything gets solved in an hour.<br/><br/>Two or three irritating omissions.  We never learn exactly how Voldamort takes over.  Are wizard politics so primitive that his minions can take over simply by occupying the Ministry building?  If not, what did they do?  Another problem is that Rowling, conscious of the fact that little kids are reading her book, has to gloss over sexual complications.  Put three hormonal and bored teenagers in close quarters for months and they're bound to feel some temptation, yet she only addresses the issue once, and treats it as a temptation from Voldamort.  And Umbridge disappears after a couple of early chapters as a villainess.  She is last seen falling and banging her head; did she get too brain-damaged to function for the rest of the book?  It would have been interesting to know.  But the omissions don't ruin a great story.
 I'm that person that is ALWAYS rereading Harry Potter even if I have a huge tbr list. I have the complete set in hardcover but my purses were getting a bit too heavy whenever I read them so I decided to buy this set. I love this box set so much. The cover art for each book is beautiful. Plus I can easily put them in my bags and not have to worry about either book weighing down my bag. Also, the price is totally worth it. If you're thinking about buying this just do it! :) 💛🖤
 Bought this with for my boyfriend who always wanted an undamaged set of the Harry Potter books with original artwork. The back cover of the first book was bent. Not sure if it will ever straighten out. I guess Christmas dreams don't always come true.
 I try to avoid duplicating comments in prior reviews in general &amp; with this book the number of reviews is fast approaching the number of pages in the book--759!  Awesome.  As the final work in a series of 7, this book must be understood in context - of the other books.  The set is an epic tale in a magical &amp; mysterious world--the author stresses many things--mystery (keeping the readers guessing), fantasy (magic &amp; muggles), adolescent life (snogging &amp; infatuations), etc.--BUT relating them to real life through symbol &amp; allegory (muggle hatred &amp; mudblood discrimination).  Per Joseph Campbell's works <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Hero-with-a-Thousand-Faces-Paladin-Books/dp/0586085718">The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Paladin Books)</a>, its outward theme is a hero's quest--with both human &amp; magical helpers--Harry isn't Superman &amp; Hermione isn't Supergirl.  See also the wonderful works of Allan Chinen <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Beyond-the-Hero-Classic-Stories-of-Men-in-Search-of-Soul/dp/0738851566">Beyond the Hero: Classic Stories of Men in Search of Soul</a> &amp; Marie-Louise von Franz <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Individuation-in-Fairy-Tales-C-G-Jung-Foundation-Books/dp/1570626138">Individuation in Fairy Tales (C. G. Jung Foundation Books)</a> on the psychological value of fairy tales.  Of course, this involves a struggle against evil &amp; dark forces similar to Tolkien's works &amp; many others (e.g. E. R. Eddison <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Worm-Ouroboros/dp/0486447405">The Worm Ouroboros</a>).  But our author is multidimensional--aiming apparently at a VERY wide range of readers of varying ages.  Thus, it must be many-leveled to reach them.  Indeed, it is.  Many of the characters seemingly one-dimensionally good or evil, turn out to be deeper than that--like the Taoist yin-yang symbol, there's a dot of white in the black ½ &amp; a dot of black in the white ½--very archetypal.  Thus, it is not surprising to have a wedding in the middle of violent upheaval--like the Buddhist story of the person falling over a cliff when pursued by wolves who clings to a plant being chewed by a rat.  She reaches over to pluck a strawberry to eat &amp; savor even though death is imminent.  Enjoy what you can, when you can.  There is considerable death in this book too.  Such struggles require it.  But death is not the opposite of life.  Death is the opposite of birth--as shown in the Epilogue.  Life includes both.  It's a cycle.  Yes, there is a "Greater good" but (as shown in this book) one MUST be entirely selfless to discern what that is.  Even Dumbledore had something to learn!<br/><br/>In addition, there are some great lines in this book:<br/>p. 381: Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon.<br/>p. 388: Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral.<br/>p. 718: Those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.<br/><br/>Many will quickly read through this book in a "few" hours.  I suggest you do NOT.  Read it slowly &amp; savor it.  Experience the slow parts with patience--they may be trying to teach you something--&amp; the violence with compassion.  The world is the way the world is, not the way we want it to be, and to change yourself is to change the world.  Have a great read!
 Harry Potter has never had an easy life, but as he turns seventeen he faces challenges that would be daunting for an adult, never mind a teenager. Voldemort is on the loose and Harry knows that either he has to kill Voldemort and live the rest of his life knowing he is a murderer or Voldemort will kill him himself. But before he faces Voldemort, he must do the task assigned to him by Dumbledore, which is to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes that contain pieces of Voldemort's soul. This is not an easy task since not only does Harry not know where the Horcruxes are (or even what some of them are hidden in) but also Voldemort and his Death Eaters are dogging Harry's every move. As Harry searches for the Horcruxes, he will uncover many secrets and learn that not only Dumbledore but also Snape weren't who he thought they were and had many layers to their personalities. The danger filled journey will test his friendship with Ron and Hermione and the courage of everyone involved.<br/><br/>"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is the wonderful last book in a wonderful series. Harry's struggle to do the right thing, whether to go after the Horcruxes or Deathly Hallows, is very believable, as is his struggle to reconcile the Dumbledore he thought he knew with the man Dumbledore really was. There are some slow moments - Harry and friends seem to aimlessly move from hiding spot to hiding spot with no goal in mind and the camping bits go on too long - but there are plenty of exciting moments to make up for all the slow bits, including several battle scenes and close encounters with Voldemort. What amazed me about the series is how well all seven books were thought out and how things that seemed relevant to only the particular book they appeared in or not that important at all (for example: why Dumbledore had the invisibility cloak belonging to Harry's father; Harry's first trip to Gringotts; Dumbledore's brother; and Sirius's motorcycle) all factor into this last book. The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort more than lives up to readers expectations and J. K. Rowling does a great job in describing what is not only a physical but verbal battle. While the book has its share of violence, death, and sadness, there is also some humor in the book including Luna's father and a scene between Ron and Hermione in the middle of the battle. Characters, Neville especially, have developed nicely through the series and show their true worth in the heat of battle. While the final epilogue sums up a lot of things, it does leave some questions unanswered that will have readers debating long after finished the book.<br/><br/>Well done!
 I couldn't find my old books so I had to pick this up and read the whole series again this winter. The new artwork is truly breathtaking and artistic. Do not pass up this special edition box set. Harry potter is life.
 Overall:<br/>--------<br/>4 stars - A fairly satisfying ending to the Dark Lord / Harry Potter saga -- the ending is a bit weak, slightly cliched and a lot of dead cool characters.<br/>Harry controls the final confrontation with the Dark Lord yet gives the Dark Lord a way out (why?).  The Dark Lord's insanity combined with meglomania is his downfall not Harry Potter.  It is a cheapening of what one expected from Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The search for the Horcruxes is only really possible due to Hermiene's knowledge of magic and magical skills.  Harry does show much character and pushes for understanding the Deathly Hallows but really it is more a plot device than anything else.  The Dark Lord is blinded by power (searching for the Elder Wand) when he should be finishing off the opposition with the ruthlessness of hardened, paranoid war lord.<br/><br/>The great losses by the forces of good seem to be trivialized by the epilogue.  I was looking for some type of memorial / recognition of the sacrifices made.  The life as usual with the references of respect by naming of the various children is touching but not enough.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>-----------<br/>The deaths of main characters "off-screen" is disappointing and cheapens their loss.  Frankly, I cared much more about the characters that died off-screen than the potential loss of Harry's life.  It is strange to think the side-characters were more important; I guess the sacrafice they were willing to make for a friend and the side of good is more compelling than Harry's battle with the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>The assault on Hogswort showed a tremendous amount of the internal qualities of the side characters than Harry.  Harry raised the you can not do this as I will not have your death on my conscious non-sense again.  Harry is clearly missing the point of friendship, trust, sacrafice and need to fight evil/darkness at all costs.  Why does Ron and Hermiene have to be Harry's conscience all the time?  The characters understand the risk but they also understand what is at stake -- please give them some credit!<br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: She rocks!  It was great to see her step up as it is hinted that she is a formittable witch in the other books.<br/><br/>Snape: He is one of the best characters in a very long time for me.  He is very complex and well developed.  I did not like how it was all tied back to silent love of a character that is barely developed.  If you are going to tied up so much of your life for a lost love, the lost love should be developed in more detail.<br/><br/>Harry: The sudden rash of logistical ability to get the horcruxes is out of character for him.  The sudden wisdom to appreciate what Dumbledore had setup is out of character and seems forced just to get the story to a conclusion.  It is good that he finally accepts people for being able to think and work as a team (not guided by him).<br/><br/>The selflessness of Harry that the ability to turn down the Deathly Hallows is not done well as it conflicts with his selfness internal discussions.  I appreciate that Harry is supposed to be the bright shining light of all that is good but the suddenness of being selfless does not quite work for me; it needed more development as I have found Harry to be very selfish in a lot of ways through out the series.<br/><br/>Ginny: She is a good character that deserves more development.<br/><br/>Dobbie: A good tie in here and lead up to the final battle.  A way to turn an annoying character from early on into a real character.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/>-----<br/>The plot is pretty straight forward as it needs to resolve the Dark Lord vs. Harry situation...does the evil triumuph over good.  The race between the Dark Lord and Harry's small group is reasonably well done.  However, the Dark Lord would have realized the problem with the Elder Wand before the final showdown.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows is an interesting plot device but should have been mentioned in the prior books.  It seems like it was added as a way to wrap up the series while the rest of the books show a clear well-developed back story.  Note: this is a minor point given the level of complex back story JKR has developed for the other books.<br/><br/>Action:<br/>-------<br/>The final assault is well done with good pacing.  The "good" guys should really have been wiping out attackers more effectively as they would fight together better than typical one-on-one tactics of the Death Eaters...the concept of surpressing fire, area of effect spells and defensive casting would really have helped the good guys.  Also, it is a war and killing the attackers is ok...war is hell!<br/><br/>Prose:<br/>------<br/>The prose is on par with the other stories.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>--------<br/>Overall: 4 stars<br/>Characters: 3 to 3.5 stars<br/>Plot: 3 stars<br/>Action: 4 to 4.5 stars -- the assault is well done<br/>Prose: 3 stars
 I got hooked on these books by accident around when the second movie came out.  After that, I had to read them all and I was one of those people who would buy the book at the midnight release.<br/>The same happened with my mother so I started buying them for her on in large print so she could easily read them without straining her eyes.<br/>The story is simple without being too over-the-top fantasy (my opinion) like other series I could never really get into.
 This is the last book in a seven book series that reads as one long fabulous story, a fantasy classic for all ages. It stands with JRR Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" in that it started out as a children's book: "The Hobbit" in Tolkien's case; "The Sorcerer's Stone" in Rowling's case, and both moved on quickly, as if of their own volition, to proceed away from a simple child's story and become a real world in fact, with humor, tragedy, love, and loss and a great overwhelming evil that the decent people are required to fight in order to keep their self-respect and honor.  In each case, the sagas are works that can be appreciated by every age. The Harry Potter series gives us characters as real as any people we have known.  They have faults and frailties, we have seen them  grow and mature before our eyes through the series from childhood to late adolescence with all that entails, and we have come to really care for them. Though surrounded by magic, by potions, by fantastic animals, and unknown species, the main characters are deeply human.  The world they live in is similar to our own, but has the added ingredient of magic, which all the major characters can use.  However for much of the story magic is a sideline---very important, discussed  and used continually--- but not as important as those very human qualities of friendship, love and trust which actually pull the characters through their losses, to fight their battles, and  get them through the on-going great battle with almost overwhelming evil. The human qualities inevitably trump the magical ones in this world: The protective spell of a mother's love...sacrificing oneself for one's friends...those qualities and others are more powerful than spells, potions and wand-work.  This, the final book is an excellent entry to the series.  Every thread is tied up, and a surprising new subplot is introduced.  There is much fighting and death, but it is for  a cause well worth fighting for, which mirrors events of our times, and no death is for shock value or the wantoness of blood, gore and pain.  The losses suffered by the good people in these last two books have been enormous, yet, again, suffered meaningfully for that great cause, and always appropriate and always mourned. As the book ends, one feels that this world exists and will continue.  The work which is the seven part series will stand, I think, in the fantasy literature genre as a classic to be read and remembered. The word "heart" is used frequently, and  "heart" is at the center of this world: love, friendship and self-sacrifice are themes repeated over and over, and are the touchstones of this world and what make it special. No recent great work has so unashamedly been so clear on that point, and that is what has drawn so many to it.
 I got this used and it's in great shape.  My family and I read the original series all the way through, and when we got to this one, we just borrowed this from someone in my family.  I wanted to complete my collection and got my own copy.  My father just recently re-read the entire series himself and enjoyed it.
 This review is for the paperback boxed set. I got this set on a great sale and am happy I got them. I previously only owned the Kindle copies and wanted to read the paper version.<br/><br/>I am through the sixth book of this set and am surprised by how many typos there are in this print. The further along I get in this physical set, the more typos. It was such a crazy good sale, I can't be that bummed. It does seem like the editor started dozing off towards the later books especially.
 I have a question for anyone who has read both the UK adult version and the US version of the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>I have also followed through all of the Harry Potter books and movies. Being just over 50, I was surprised at how easily the books and movies pulled me into the delightful world of Harry Potter. I have relatives in their 70's who have been just as steadfast at following the series and reading all of the books. It is a wonderful thing how this series instilled the love of reading to an entire generation (and then some). Reading books had almost become a lost art until Harry Potter came along.<br/><br/>My question on the UK adult version of the Harry Potter books...... Are they different from the US standard hardback version which we have been buying from Amazon? I bought the entire series through Amazon and on the last book, I bought the deluxe US version with the illustrations.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there is a difference in the writing or additional info in the UK adult version. If there is more to read which I have not yet seen, then I would want to buy those as well... but I thought I would  put this question to those who have read both versions to find out whether there is more to read in the UK versions.<br/><br/>I would hope Rowling changes her mind and adds more books to the series. There is an endless number of storylines she could continue into their adult lives for deacades to come and it does not have to be focused on Voldemort. She could write a story about a virus among the magical world which affects their powers with Hermione as a Doctor or medical researcher at St Mungo's trying to find a cure to the ailing wizards and witches who don't know how to cope without powers... and muggles who catch the virus could gain powers which go haywire. The storylines have endless possibilites. Perhaps if Rowling changes her publisher's contract to not have a hard schedule like the previous series, she can take more time to enjoy writing without  harsh deadlines now that the characters ages for the movies are no longer an issue once the seventh movie is completed.<br/><br/>I still think Mrs Norris, the cat, was Filtches former lover who was turned into a cat by her husband which is why Mr Filtch is so devoted to the cat. I know there is a storyline in that which has not yet been explored.
 This book is simply Harry Potter meets the Godfather. Unlike many or most children's books, there are a lot of hurt and dead people between pages. And, that may be the reason why I liked this book more than the six previous publications.<br/><br/>Also, Potter fans know the nuances.  They have become accustomed to Rowling's great language among the wizards (Is there a greater term than "muggle?") .  With familiarity comes comfort, with comfort comes enjoyment. In turn, the greater the familiarity bestows greater enjoyment.<br/><br/>Now, one would think I am implying that her formula was simple:  Just write more and be more appreciated.  Actually, this book could have bombed.  Pottermaniacs have such great expectations - which makes each book more difficult.  You have heard of television wearing out a concept - they call it "Jump the Shark."  I am sure Rowling and her publishers were sincerely concerned about Book 7 "jumping the shark." I guarantee you that this book did not come close to jumping the shark - in fact the opposite is true.  Some disgruntled readers deplore the ending's epilogue "Nineteen Years Later." This may be legitimate. Rowling  infuriated fans.  Why? Because we must grow up and realize that the epilogue leads readers to the logical conclusion that Harry Potter books have come to a close. Ouch.  They did not end because of "jump the shark" reasons.  This veteran player did not leave the game after its prime.  This series ended in aplomb. Rowling, like a great player, hit a home run her last at bat with Harry Potter.<br/><br/>This is a great year for Potter.  Book 5,  "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", was for may their least popular book - but was one of the better films among the five thus far produced.  And, this book is overwhelmingly a Pottermaniac's favorite.<br/><br/>And, it seems that Rowling's writing style has matured.  Vocabulary seems stronger.  Some of the verse is flavorful. She starts right off with Doyle-like description of English manor gardens: "The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's ways. . . Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the door. . ." She is underestimated in her writing skills and overly presumed to be thriving only from her imaginative plots.  Oh do not be fooled - this is a really talented writer - stylistically as well as content.<br/><br/>After reading these books, one must wonder about Rowling The above-cited verse is strong. The dialogue is strong, and the concepts are "out of this world." .  For most Pottermaniacs, she is their most read writer. The seven books total more than 3,868 pages (American Publications)  respectively 259, 256, 320, 752, 870, 652, and 769 pages]. That is a tremendous number of pages to read from three or more authors. But, Rowling has awed us to not only read, but buy the hardbacks en masse - on the date of release!!<br/><br/>Pottermania is more than mania - it is a phenomenon. And, Rowling should be heralded for it. She changed the rules for NY Times' Best Seller's List  - after having 3 or 4 books on the list for period exceeding one year, the rules changed to exclude children's books forever from that list.<br/><br/>For those who are younger than I am - my children are deemed too old for Harry - I offer some advice of those you may want to read, based upon concepts within her books.<br/><br/>If you like the plots and nuances of the issues: pull out Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes" series at the library. Also, Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code" or Deception Point" may give you further intrigue.<br/><br/>If you liked the suspense, and enjoyed the mild gore - look to America's unique venue of mystery gumshoe novels by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Micky Spillane, John MacDonald, and James Ellroy among so many others.<br/><br/>If you likes the concepts of speaking to the dead and out-of-body experiences, try Philip K. Dick, Stephen King (his books are equally long), or Tony Vigorito.<br/><br/>If you are a science fiction lover, try the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert and his writing heirs, Isaac Asmiov or Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br/><br/>If those names are new to you, great. If you are familiar with those names, you would know that I am putting Rowling in company with writers of great fame and who have all won awards (Dick actually has an award named after him).<br/><br/>Don't be surprised if an award is named after this writer in the near future.
 When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hit the shelves, I was one of the many who waited anxiously on the edge of my seat to begin reading. I was in the airport that day, and I could see people everywhere with their eyes glued to the pages of an orange-colored book. It took all of my willpower to not take one off the shelf and read a tiny bit during my long wait, but I knew that that very same book was waiting for me when I arrived home. I am glad I waited though, because my excitement made the book even more enjoyable, even in the many places where it seemed to not go anywhere at all.<br/> The latest and last installment of the Harry Potter books is probably the darkest in the series. The story opens with a murder, which told me that JKR was showing no mercy in this book. What surprised me the most about the opening of this book was that it did not begin on Privet Drive, unlike all the other books in the series. Even in the fourth, where it does not appear like the setting is anywhere near Little Whinging, it turns out that we were witnessing (or reading) a dream of Harry's, therefore it was still in the tidy little house of the Dursleys'.<br/>The beginning sped along rather quickly, with the dismissal of the Dursleys and the seven Harrys flying along in the sky. The main character death count rose from zero to two, and the twins finally can be told one from the other (one of them without an ear). Overall, I liked the beginning, but I felt JKR rushed things too much.<br/>The middle dragged on slowly, as if all of the speed was taken out of it by the beginning. They went on a Horcrux hunt that turned into a Hallows hunt, and then it was back into a Horcrux hunt. Also, during all that was happening, there was the question of what Dumbledore was really like. It was all rather confusing, yet still surprisingly entertaining. The middle wasn't extremely difficult to read, however it felt as if JKR was trying to fit multiple books into one.<br/>The end I was extremely pleased with. Where to begin? Neville Longbottom completely evolved as a character, into someone people admire and look up to, instead of someone people laugh and talk about when he's not listening. Teddy Lupin was such a mood lifter in the midst of the dark tones of the books.<br/>What I liked about `The Deathly Hallows' was the perfect ending, the spellbinding plot, and the way JKR let you imagine what could happen next. The ending was very well balanced and, in my opinion, highly satisfying. This series deserved a finale, and JKR delivered it beautifully. The plot, as difficult and confusing as it got at times, seemed to draw you deeper into the story with every page, a talent that JKR adds to her books masterfully. What an author.<br/>However, along with the prosthere are also some cons, and unfortunately, to review this book fully, I must address them. First of all, there is the uneven speed ratio in this book. The beginning was too fast-paced, and the middle wasn't fast enough. I found that rather disappointing, because JKR usually smoothes things over perfectly in her books. Then there is the matter of the Dursleys. They just seemed to disappear in the beginning. I was sure we'd see more of them, but they just are... gone. It seemed as if JKR was trying too desperately to dispose of them. Lastly, there is Dumbledore's history. I disliked what it was in the end, because in my opinion, she made Dumbledore too sweet of a character for that. I know, that is not a very good reason, but the thought of Dumbledore using Harry ever since the beginning seems absurd. The Dumbledore I knew from the books would never do that to anyone, especially not Harry. The history we found out about seems like the wrong fit for Dumbledore.<br/>I would recommend this book to all Harry Potter lovers, adults and teens alike. However, unlike other books in the series, this is not for younger kids. I don't recommend it to those under ten. I believe this book is geared for ages ten through one hundred and ten.<br/>JKR has, through this series, let the entire world laugh together, cry together, be surprised together and hate villains together. Did I like this book? Yes. It could have been better, but I liked it. JKR is an unimaginably talented author, and because of her many kids wanted to read. I would've liked it if she had shown a bit more in the finale of the `Harry Potter' saga, but nobody is perfect, and she did a good job all the same. After all, who besides her can unite all races, countries, genders, and ages in a reading frenzy over one of the best stories in the history of writing?
 First, I love the Harry Potter series even though I'm over 50. It is a work of genius which will entertain generations of all ages for eons.<br/><br/>With that said, I have noticed a tone of Rowling's growing resentment toward the Harry Potter character, which has increased with each of the last 4 books. I remember her saying many times that she was writing the series for herself. However, once an author publishes, their books cannot be for the author alone. The minute they sell their works, the author has a responsibility toward the public, the publisher and any contracts with studios and residual Agreements. From the 3rd book on, you can detect a growing resentment which Rowling is developing toward her main character as she begins to lose control of the books and is under increasing pressures with timelines and schedules to complete each sequel. The schedules are an unavoidable necessity due to the aging of the actors and a rush to complete each sequel before they became too old for their roles.<br/><br/>I believe Rowlings did not like being pressured by deadlines and it shows in Harry's increasing tendency toward petulance, disregard for the consequences for his actions and increasing self-concentric stubbornness she has instilled in his character. Increasing in intensity with each novel. By this final book, she clearly intended to kill off Harry and irretrievably end the series. Only extreme pressure from her publisher, family or high ranking members of the British Parliament or Monarchy may have changed her intent because hundreds of fans, celebrities and other famous people who pleaded with her did not seem to make any headway in persuading her to spare Harry for the sake of the millions of fans and children.<br/><br/>But it looks to me that she attempted to sully the reputations of Dumbledore and make Harry so petulant and self-indulgent with no regard to others that it would turn the fans off from wanting further sequels. If you noticed, she had him sitting in tents for weeks at a time doing nothing with no sense of concern or urgency about innocent people dying, suffering and disappearing at the hands of Voldemort and his followers while Harry supposedly sat around for weeks making no effort at all to expedite his mission. And to ignore the warnings about the tracking attached to those who spoke the name of Voldemort which resulted in loss of life. Or his insistence to indulge his desires to visit the graves and Potter home without concern for Hermione's safety or time lost while people suffered.... and yet, with each mistake, he did not learn. He only became more careless and self-concentric while Rowlings did her best to destroy Dumbledores character for no good reason. It did not enhance the story and she was still dropping bombs on his character even after the book was published. It is clear she has grown to hate her own creation and wants to be free of the Potter aura which made her wealthy and famous. I think she would have made the last book much worse if the publisher had allowed her to crucify the characters in a final act to destroy the series for good.<br/><br/>Thankfully, most readers were oblivious to Rowlings growing resentment toward her own characters or were able to ignore it and still enjoy the book.<br/><br/>The movies will likely make the time periods seem like days rather than weeks as written and they will soften the petulance and negatives.<br/><br/>It is still an enjoyable book and wonderful series despite Rowling's inner struggles to break free from the Potter series prison. I don't think any other books she writes will do well. It would be similar to the actors of Star Trek who could not break out of their roles and finally gave in on the movies and conventions and learned to enjoy and appreciate their stereotyped fame and popularity rather than fight it.<br/><br/>One note of interest was a mid 1980's movie I saw a couple years ago called, "Troll" starring Angela Lansbury, her daughter Jessica and a main character... a young boy named "Harry Potter." I nearly fell off the chair when I saw this movie about a magical kingdom, trolls, witches, magic and talking mushrooms. There were several things about this movie which made you wonder about the birth of the Potter series, however... the difference between that movie and this series is like night and day and does not hold a candle to this series.<br/><br/>There are endless stories the Harry Potter series could do with the characters as grown adults. There is no limit to how many could be made. I hope to see more even if it is from another author as long as it is written in the same style and does not contradict the basic premise and past events.<br/><br/>Nothing could diminish the enjoyment these books and movies have brought to hundreds of millions worldwide....  So Ms Rowlings, get used to it and think about how others feel. You took on this responsibility for the fans the moment you decided to publish your books and sell them to the public. If you wanted to write solely for yourself, you shouldn't have sold the stories to the public. Your responsibility is even greater because the majority of your readers are children and will continue to be so as more children are born and begin to read your books. You are an excellent writer for all ages. Now that your characters are adults, you could write without the same schedule pressures you had when they were young. But like you wrote into Harry's character, you need to be aware of what you say, write and do and how it will affect the majority of others. You can't please everyone, but you can have more empathy and consideration for the majority of the fans and how your actions will affect them. It's a wonderful series, so please don't spoil it.
 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is a triumph.  (No spoilers in this review).<br/><br/>Rowling gathers together all the twisting and complex threads she's scattered throughout the preceding six books and weaves an agonizing and ultimately exhilarating and satisfying conclusion.  As I neared the conclusion I was wracked by competing emotions - loss and sorrow that this superb series would soon be over; joy and satisfaction for Harry, Snape, Dumbledore, Neville, Hermione and Ron; and admiration for Rowling.  She managed to craft an ending pitch perfectly in tune with the rest of the books.  An ending totally in keeping with what came before - and yet cataclysmic enough to surmount all the amazing peaks and worthy of this tremendously entertaining series.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows, like all the preceding books, starts slowly.  Harry leaves the Dursleys; Harry finds himself increasingly outflanked and cut off.  Each scene is incredibly good - but the plot builds over hundreds of pages and you find yourself wondering "when will the headlong action begin?" - and "how will she have time to wrap this all up?".  Here, the headlong rush begins barely past half way and the final half of the book is an incredible thriller of a rollercoaster ride.  There's so much content that certain moments might appear rushed on later reflection but the pacing is so superb that no one can question her genius for thrilling action.<br/><br/>Before starting this final book I worried that Rowling would be unable to craft an ending that wouldn't seem like an anticlimax.  After building the conflict between Harry and Voldemort for more 3600 pages how could the final showdown be anything but a bit of a letdown?  Well, Rowling proves her genius here.  She gathers all the magical threads and adds a new a stunning aspect - then she takes Harry's quest beyond magic and into the mythic.  I can't be more specific without giving things away - but believe me when I tell you she transcends fantasy here and takes us into the transcendental themes of Greek tragedy.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to buy and read this book.  If you haven't read the series, do yourself a favor and do so.  This is one for the ages.
 This boxed set allows you to buy the first five paperbooks in the Harry Potter series at a very reasonable price. I think buying it is a good idea for:<br/><br/>a- those who want to give their kids/friends (or even themselves) a great gift at a very good price --&gt; due to the fact that you will give 5 books at the price that some bookstores sell one.<br/><br/>b- those who are very lazy --&gt; because it is almost certain that if you buy the first book for yourself or your children, you will end up at the same bookstore buying the other books in the series. Buying the first 5 books at the same time will save you time and money, and you will only have to return later to buy book number 6.<br/><br/>c- those who want to read a book that their kids will love, but that they will like to, and turn the fact that they are reading the series into a family experience.<br/><br/>d- those who want to motivate their children to read --&gt; because reading Harry Potter will make them understand that there are books can offer them some things that the television cannot. If your children just hate the idea of reading, show them one of the movies based on the series, and afterwards tell them that the books have a lot to do with them, but that they are way better.<br/><br/>e- those who are learning English, and want to practise it in a entertaining way. And what better way to improve your grammar that reading something that is actually fun?.<br/><br/>f- those who aren't from an English speaking country, already have the books but want to read them in the language Rowlings wrote them --&gt; because the reading experience is totally different (and yes, I know because I read some of the books both in Spanish, Italian and English).<br/><br/>g- those who are curious about the series but haven't given it a try --&gt; because this series really grows on you, and it gets better and better, specially after book number 3.<br/><br/>After telling you about all the reasons why buying this boxset is a good idea, I would like to talk a little more about point g- because that was my case some years ago, even though I wasn't lucky enough to get my hands on a boxset. First, though, I would like to comment upon the fact that I know very few people who haven't liked the first book, and that have given up after a few chapters. I don't know anybody that has given up after reading the first 3 books. Yes, the first 2 books are very simple and short, but they help to set up the parallel world J.K. Rowlings is writing about. The 3rd book already shows a great promise of how the series are going to be like.<br/><br/>In my case, I bought the first 4 books at the same time, a Saturday afternoon. I read the first 2 books ("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets") rather quickly, and wondered why everybody including my sister loved them so much. They weren't long, and they were rather good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is only while I was reading the 3rd book ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"), that very same night, that I understood what the hype was all about. Even though when I finished it it was high time to go to bed, I couldn't help but starting the 4th book ("Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"), even though I was tired, and it really was much bigger than the others. It also was much more entertaining, and noticeably more complicated. Understandably (for those who have read these books, at least), I started reading it and couldn't stop until Sunday's afternoon. I was tired, but very happy of having discovered the magic, something I wouldn't have done if I had stopped after reading the first two books...<br/><br/>From that point onwards, I'm a "pottermaniac". I've read all the books in the series, and I thoroughly enjoy them. Yes, I like other kinds of books too, and I'm an adult with a degree in Political Science, but that doesn't mean that I cannot find these books engaging. One of the wonderful things about the Harry Potter series is that very diverse people can like it, for very different reasons. Despite that, all readers share something special, the ability to share the magic. Be one of us, and have fun :)<br/><br/>Belen Alcat
 Having grown up with great series like Nancy Drew, Anne of Green Gables, The Lord of The Rings, Piers Anthony's Xanth Books, The Chronicles of Narnia, and many more I feel like I have the insight to be able to compare and contrast this book with the best of them. I eagerly awaited book 7, warned all around me that no HP talk was aloud until I was finished. My husband also reads the books and we agreed that for this last one, we would buy one copy (which we purchased on Amazon, and it was delivered the day the book came out as promised) and he would read it to me so that both of us could find out what was happening at the same time.  I was certain that I would laugh, cry, and cheer and it did not disappoint. Other reviewers have had complaints that:<br/>*"The book lulled, and felt bogged down at points especially when they were in the forest", and I don't agree with that. On the way through a journey, an adventure, not everything can be quickly paced and I think JK did a marvelous job showing us the passage of time while Ron, Harry, and Hermione had to keep moving.<br/>*"There was no $ex" which blows my mind those readers expected any $exual scenes in this book, or any of the others at all. "Harry is 18, Boys that age have urges" and that is true, but boys that age aren't running for their lives, protecting loved ones, and carrying around a piece of an evil wizards soul. It's sick to expect anything more than honor and dedication from the characters in this series.<br/>*"JK Left so many plot holes" Where? Did we read the same book, she left nothing a mystery, she made no mistakes, and she tied everything up. Including the Horcruxe/Hallows thing, she didn't just throw in the hallows for the 7th book, they have been there since the beginning.<br/>*"JK doesn't tell us what happened to all the characters" Does she really have to? I would have been so turned off if at the end she just spent a chapter painting a lovely scenario for every single character use your imagination!<br/>*"the epilogue was cheesy" And I can see how many think that, the book could have ended on Harry going back up to Gryffindor tower to go to bed, but JK chose to put the little happy ending in, I liked it, didn't love it, but I understood it.<br/><br/>I invested a lot of emotion in this book, and I yelled lot of "YES" and "NO!" I held my breath, and I sighed with content. The Characters that die, some surprised me and some didn't, I wept, and sobbed, and snarfled into my pillow, I will forever mourn their loss. There were times I was so stressed out, knots in my throat that I feared for my mental health! In the end, when we put it down, I felt satisfied and relieved and more than a bit sad that it was over. I personally do not want her to write any more Harry Potter books, because without Snape they wouldn't be the same. Thank you JK Rowling, for giving me a lifelong love of the wizarding world, and a permanent place for me to escape into, curl up next to crookshanks and relive it all over again.
 The final book in an amazing series.  What can I say that has not already been said...<br/><br/>Let me tell you a story about a small, 11 year old boy.  I loved to read and loved fantasy books the most.  My school would occasionally hand out pamphlets full of age appropriate books for kids to order.  I looked through and came upon a bundle of three books, the first three in the Harry Potter series.  Something about the picture or the little blurb about i must have piqued my interest because I promptly ordered them, and devoured them when they arrived.  I immediately fell in love with the series and simply could not wait for the next to arrive. As every book came out I quickly re-read all the previous books and the latest (I believe i'm at about 15+ reads on the first).  In between every release I eagerly waited and waited for the next.  I would go on the website, visit the forums, read through fan theories, talk about them with my sister, who also dearly loved the series.  With every wait my brain would go crazy with anticipation for the next.<br/><br/>Finally the last book.  So many good memories, so many questions.  It felt like a very fulfilling resolution.  I was sad it was over, that there was no more to this world that I would every find out about again.  But while that did sadden me, I still felt good having read it, having experienced it growing up.  Luckily there were those small books about Fantastical Beast, Quidditch, and childrens' tales, which are small but nice and I would highly recommend them.<br/><br/>Pssst - there's also going to be another book in the wizarding universe, just a different time period, can't wait!  I'm going to go crazy!
 If Rowling intended for Harry to go out with a bang and a boom, she succeeded. Both for her plucky character (and perhaps a bit for herself).  She finally breaks the barrier between childish escapism and the harsh realities of evil-perhaps plunging some of her younger fans into waters they are unable to navigate. (Ahoy thair be sharks here)<br/><br/>One thing is for certain throughout-Rowling has poured more of herself into this tome as if to inbue the Deathly Hallows with a bit of her own soul-our own Horcrux for the fans. That is how I will always remember it in that first reading, an exhaustively written story, which could not have been created without some serious reflection.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows is, simply put, a firecracker whose sizzling fuse resonates from chapter to chapter culminating to its bittersweet ending. It rarely lets up, from start to finish.  Questions that have haunted us for years are answered as our resilient Dumbledorians grapple with a wizarding world that has gone truly mad.<br/><br/>Hermione finally recognizes who is truly in her heart-Ron stumbles from immaturity to take the lead in some sequences, Neville is finally worthy of his parents Auror legacy, Snapes' astounding and poignant declaration, the remorse of the Dursley's (well at least one of them feels remorse)all of it ends up too dizzying for words.<br/><br/>What fans will find most exciting is that the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army realize they are not alone, that the wizarding community from the giants, to the trolls, to the house elves, to the goblins will not be put down by insidious Death Eater propaganda. Even a coup d'etat at the Ministry of Magic will not stamp out the hope radiating from the united.<br/><br/>Fans will forever remember the scene in the Lord of the Rings when entire Middle Earth banded together against a common foe. So is the same with Harry and his followers as they batten down the hatches. Truly, Hogwarts is a fitting place-the only place for the final battle to unfold, its bastion of chilish innocence coming face-to-face with a war brought to its door.<br/><br/>It is these connections that permeate and reinforce the strength of the story, the only elemental allegory that we recognize-that of good and evil. even Harry, as their unwitting leader, and as the sacrificial lamb, learns that painful lesson at King's Cross.<br/><br/>Rowling gives us a glorious calvacade that is deadly, vivid, melancholy and bittersweet, but oh so satisfying. Some will be left crying, some wanting more, feeling in wont of a friend, and perhaps some will also be replete, satisfied and are able to push away filled without need for more.<br/><br/>It is truly an end of an era. We'll miss you Harry.Copyright(c)Nicola Mattos
 The final book in the series.  The ongoing battle between Voldemort and Harry Potter finally reaches its culmination, and loose ends are wrapped up.  The last book left us with the impression that Harry would not return to Hogwarts, and indeed he, Ron and Hermione go on a quest for Horcruxes instead of heading back to school, in the hopes that gathering and destroying the Horcruxes will finally destroy Voldemort forever.  Of course it's not quite that simple, and as Rowling warned us, we lose a few beloved characters on the way towards the final confrontation.<br/><br/>At the risk of being lynched by fellow Potter lovers, I have to say that I was a little disappointed in this final installment, which should have been the best one and should have put a terrific final cap on what has been a truly groundbreaking and brilliant series.  Rowling is as engaging as ever, but I was very disappointed in the way she wrapped up certain elements.  I expected much more development of the Snape situation, for instance.  The reason behind his hatred for Harry was exactly what I thought it was, so I felt vindicated there, but I did not like the quick, rather cop-out method Rowling used to finish that story line.  Similarly, I expected further development of Draco and Harry's tense relationship, given the occurrences in the book 6 and the other side of Draco we glimpsed there.  Some people feel that it was developed exactly as it should have been, so this is just my personal opinion and what I personally had hoped for.<br/><br/>The climactic scene was unique and innovative, I thought, and I liked the way she played that out.  I was a little less impressed by the epilogue - a bit too neat, I thought.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this has been one of the most entertaining series' I have ever, ever read, and I anticipate reading it from start to finish many more times.
 I bought these for my wife for Christmas, after visiting Universal Orlando over Thanksgiving.  She was never into Harry Potter...NEVER!  But after visiting Universal, she was curious.  Well, she is on the 3rd book already &amp; she can't put them down!!!<br/> The heavy cardboard case are very nice to keep the books together.  The books themselves are very well put together as well.  There are different models to buy, I ordered the books that are not paperback or hardback.  So far my wife loves this set of books...both for the quality of the books and of the stories.
 Unfortunatly there were no illustrations throughout the pages of these books. Either send the correct items or change the descriptions and review the customer photos.
 This was a gift for two young brothers who love Happy Potter.  The youngest likes to sleep with the books next to his head.  Big win.  Recommended for anyone who loves Harry Potter and thinks reading the books is an important aspect.  (I confess, I've only ever seen the movies, but I promise I do read stuff:  Cereal boxes.  Bills.  Physics books, etc.)
 Okay I will admit that it took me years read this series of books.  That being said I'm so sorry I waited for so long to read them.  They pull you into their world of wizard's and witches. The made you follow along behind them.  Pulled you into their world.  After reading I now understand why they are in the hundred must reads.
 The seventh and intended final book of the series sees Harry become an adult, which happens at age 17 for wizards.  Once more, the evil Voldemort is intent on taking over, with his Death Eaters and Dementors backing him.  Harry, of course, has other ideas.  While he no longer has his adult supporters of Sirius Black, Dumbledore, and others, Hermione and (most of the time) Ron remain firmly at his side.  They still have allies out there, but they're scattered and oppressed by Voldemort, whose minions now control the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts.  In mounting an offensive against the evil Lord, Harry is faced with the problem of whether to pursue the course Dumbledore assigned him, the finding and destroying of horcruxes, objects containing portions of Voldemort's spirit, or the three (legendary?) components of the Deathly Hallows which give anyone holding all three great powers.  While wrestling with this choice, he is also challenged by being the most wanted individual in the wizarding world, and so, safety becomes paramount and problematical.  Many locations and characters from the first six books show up here.  For this reader, Dolores Umbridge rivals Voldemort in pure nastiness, but there are other nastiness contenders, Bellatrix Lestrange and others.  There are good guys, too and also resolution to the main good guy/bad guy paradox of Severus Snape.  And, yes, there are deaths, some very moving.  As a whole, Deathly Hallows is about Harry and friends getting into very sticky situations, and Rowling providing fascinating means of addressing those situations on a regular basis.  It's a wonderful quest story, with necessary rapid changes of location, battles, good and evil, and resolution for the younger readers who are Potter book fans.  Knowing its predecessors definitely makes this ending  volume more meaningful.  Great ending to a great series.
 I understand that this series is loved by many. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't fall in love with it either. The story is well crafted, but it did adopt some writing elements that pulled me from the story. Not to go into spoilers, but when one character stops in the middle of the story to explain everything to another character (and myself the reader), that drives me crazy. Overall though I understand that this is my quirk, and I can completely understand why so many have found so much joy through the series.
 The Harry Potter series will stand, not on it's merit, but on its social impact. The Deathly Hallows is the culmination of an important chapter in so many adolescent lives that it hardly matters whether it is a good book or not.<br/><br/>But, the fact is it does fall short. The whimsy of Hogwarts has always set it apart from run-of-the mill fantasy stories, but that important feature is missing in this volume. Without the characters attending Hogwarts, the story settles into a derivative "quest" epic. It's not a bad one as quests go. Maybe a little slow and dreary, as the first 500 pages serve to simply drive home the point that times are dark indeed. It has decent puzzles, mysteries, and plot twists. But, it lacks anything to rise above the standard fare in that genre.<br/><br/>The bigger problem though, is the poor fit of the characters we all know and love in the epic battle against evil. It is necessarily a violent struggle, with death and mayhem. But, Harry Potter and his friends are gentle children. Putting them into fierce battle scenes simply doesn't work. There are too many contrivances that served to avoid having them actually seriously hurt anyone. That conflict could have been shaped into a moral dilemma, but instead it just feels awkward, as if they wandered into this story by mistake.<br/><br/>In the end though, it is a satisfying conclusion. The challenge for Rowling was to add some surprise to the climax, not suspense. In that regard, she succeeded.
 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final book in the wonderful series by J.K. Rowling is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, it's like none of the other Potter books at all.  Harry has grown up.  There is very little humor, plenty of terror and action, and many, many heartwrenching moments involving the loss of beloved characters, some unexpectedly.  The primary point of this book is for Harry, Ron and Hermione to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes mentioned in earlier books.  This in turn, will hopefully result in the defeat of Voldemort.  Naturally they run into multiple problems that impede their quest.  Can Harry defeat the Dark Lord?  Who will survive in the end?  To find out, you must read "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."<br/><br/>As stated before, this book is both action-packed and terrifying at times.  Younger readers may find it hard to understand or accept the deaths of key characters.  I can honestly say that the death of one particular character hit me very hard.  It almost brought me to tears, and I haven't read a book that has been able to do that to me in a long time.  There is a sinister air about the entire book until the final chapter, where everything, like it or not, is resolved.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away, so I'll keep this review short.  Just know that Rowling neatly resolves all of the loose ends of the other books and revisits a few (now) obvious hints from earlier books.  I think that the ending isn't so much a shock as it is bittersweet goodbye to a wonderful series of tales.  Highly recommended.
 Love the illustrations, don't love the weight of the book when lying in bed to read it.  It's a keeper though and probably will be read multiple times  by multiple kids and then passed to another family who will do the same thing.  I'm reading it to my 7 year old twins and the pictures help keep them interested while I read aloud to them before bed.
 J.K. Rowling triumphantly closes the Harry Potter series in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." I bought the first one for my son when he was eleven years old. He loved it and I then read it to see for myself what the big deal was. During the past eight years, my son and I have continued read and enjoy the books. I am especially grateful to Rowling because she gave us something to talk about during the teenage years. My son will be a junior in college this year and we are both thrilled to see that # 7 is one of the best. Rowling did a fantastic job in creating a suspenseful, dramatic, and best of all, a satisfying ending to the series. I am impressed with how Harry, the other characters, and the story-line matured with each edition. From the first installment which was a kid's book to the mostly adult fantasy story in Deathly Hallows, the Harry Potter series is a true coming of age saga. Rowling has a prolific imagination and a breezy, but thoughtful writing style that prevented the staleness and repetition that usually occurs in a series based on a single character or theme. Harry Potter and his friends are now almost grown-up and appropriately, Deathly Hallows is not a little kid's book. The plot is complex and dark and a little disturbing at times, but this should be expected when the subject becomes the "real" Magical world in which decency and good are at stake. I hope that she will continue writing of this world in a new series. I would enjoy reading her future works along with any grandchildren that come along someday. In the meantime, Rowling has created something that will be beloved for a long time.
 A look at the Acknowledgment section reveals that this book is dedicated to us, the mudblood readers of Harry Potter, all 9 million of us, and to those "who have stuck with Harry until the very end."  After reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there can be no doubt this book, in J. K. Rowling's series of seven, covering the seven years Harry Potter has attended the Hogwarts School of Magic, is the last.<br/><br/>Hard to imagine why anyone would read this book without reading the other six first.  The books do build naturally upon one another.  Now that it's over, one could conceivably buy the seven volumes and set out to read them all straight through.  That would be fun.  On the other hand, I have enjoyed, as millions of readers have, anticipating the publishing of each volume, the lines at the bookstore, the hype.  For me I've read, except for this one, the paperback edition.  But now I find that no way am I waiting a year for this paperback to come out.  Like Harry, I'm ready to finish this thing now.<br/><br/>I envy the reader who has just discovered Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Year One at Hogwarts.  But now that I've read them all, I'm starting over.  And I would recommend, start at the beginning of this journey.  What can I say though to the reader who has read Book Six and like me, trying not to listen to the spoilers, waiting for the much more economical paperback to come out in a year's time?  What if you can't wait another day, much less a year, to find out what really happened to Dumbledore?  Can you wait to find out who wins, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or Harry Potter?  I didn't think so.  The books are a circle and this one connects them all.  And why wait when Amazon has the book on sale?
 At this time, there are 1198 reviews on amazon.com for this, the last of Harry Potter series, so it's pretty unlikely anyone's going to be reading this. Take home message- I can be as brutally honest as I like :) hehe<br/><br/>1. It's too long. Too much wedding talk. Too much lost in the wilderness and bickering stuff.<br/><br/>2. The last third of the book has it all. The setting, the battle between good and evil, the inside scoop on the two most important players of the Order of the Phoenix. And no, it's not Harry.<br/><br/>3. JK Rowling did an excellent job in not only providing all the answers, but fleshing them out, giving depth and soul to it.<br/><br/>4. One of the biggest loopholes I've found is that muggles seem to be oblivious to the Magic world. But how can that be, when hundreds of the wizards are mudbloods, which means, over the last few hundred years, millions of muggles parents have had children attend Hogwarts. And the muggle parents dont have their memories altered. Hermione's didnt- they knew perfectly well she was magical and took her to the train bound for Hogwarts every year.<br/><br/>5. Overall- if you've read the first 6 books, read this one, the last of an epic series. After all, a series that made a penniless single mother a billionaire must have some style and merit about it.:)<br/><br/>6. I've wanted to say this for a long time. The guy who divorced JK Rowling before she penned Harry Potter must feel like a real loser and twit these days. I can see people asking him every second day for the rest of his life- do you regret divorcing her? She's a billionaire, what are you?
 Obviously the story is the same as all the other U.S. Versions of this set, but these are BEAUTIFUL! I bought them solely for that reason. The covers feel very smooth and nice in your hands, they are texturized in a silky material I've never felt on a book before. Very vibrant and colorful and detailed yet slightly modern in a way that just really speaks to me. I absolutely love that the spines come together to show a big picture of Hogwarts when on the shelf in order. Also, if you buy the boxed set of these, all so far are first editions. I think it's a great first set for young readers, and a wonderful addition to any collection for those who actually collect them. (I have 3 different sets myself LOL)
 These books are beautifully illustrated. Only complaint is that the illustrator has only done the first three, so you have to change your set halfway thorugh i you're just reading them for the first time (like we are with our kids).<br/><br/>They're big, but make great bedtime reading. Not exactly what you want to take with you on the plane, though.
 The condition of the book was great! No rough edges, the cover was flat. It was great! I love the harry potter books. I'm reading them for the first time at 23 ,and once I picked up on I couldn't put it down and needed the second! These books are great for children and even better for adults! Need a book club idea? ThIS!
 The Seventh (dare we say 'the last'?) Harry Potter novel is a triumphant conclusion to what everyone has to admit is a colossal undertaking. I read it with excitement and wonder, for in this story Rowling completes the cycle of the six archetypes that she sets up for Harry in book one. He moves, in these books, through all six archetypes of personal growth - the same ones that recur in all the great books of the Western Canon over the last 3000 years.<br/>  What does this mean?  Well, in book 1 Harry starts off as an Innocent (stage 1), and it is this quality that helps him survive Voldemort's attack.  When we meet him he's truly an Orphan (stage 2) at the Dursleys'.  He is then taken off to Hogwarts where he goes to the next stage (stage 3) as a Pilgrim-after-Truth (remember, he's a Seeker in quidditch, which is a neat echo). Working his way through the mystery he has to be both a Pilgrim and show his courage for what he believes in - a real Warrior in fact(stage 4).  He shows his true value when he retrieves the Philosopher's stone even though he has no desire for it himself, which is the mark of the Monarch (stage 5) - working for others without being dominated by selfish ego needs. And, remember, it's this essential unselfishness that makes him the only person who can hold the stone - a true Magician (stage 6).<br/>  If you've followed this so far, you'll see that Harry completes a trajectory through all six archetypes, but at a low level - a bit like Ordinary Wizarding Level exams, they're the highest he can attain at that time.  But Rowling shows him going through the same sequence EACH year, and each time at a slightly higher level. Each year the struggle against Voldemort gets a little harder. Finally, In volume 7 he learns to unite the Magician with the Innocent (stages 1 and 7) which will make him truly a complete Magician - wise and humble, powerful and modest.<br/>  I know of no other writer who even comes close to attempting this, and in doing so Rowling has placed this cycle of novels on a par with the Odyssey, the Oresteia, and the works of Shakespeare in terms of what she can tell us about the growth of the psyche.<br/>  If you want more details of this theory take a look at "Stories We Need to Know; Redaing Your Life Path in Literature"<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Stories-We-Need-to-Know-Reading-Your-Life-Path-in-Literature/dp/1844091236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stories We Need to Know: Reading Your Life Path in Literature</a> You can also take a look at my webpage  ...]
 I did not plan on reading the Harry Potter books put by accident I came<br/>across J.K.Rowling bio on dvd and I was so taken by her imagination as<br/>a child and through her adult life I decided to check it out and I could not<br/>get enough of these books I would read the book and then watch the<br/>movies which are fantastic! I have watch the movies over and over,and<br/>now I am on book 7 and will read it as slow as possible because I just<br/>hate the series to end . If you don't have time to read the books get<br/>the dvd's the production is outstanding and who ever did the casting<br/>for that movie really bought the books to life. Danial,Rubert, and Emma<br/>are great little actors and they are the kids in that book. My favorate was<br/>the first book and the first movie those kid are so cute. Please check<br/>these books out they are not just for children. Gabi
 What can you say about this series? It has all been said. As I embarked on this magnificent story over seven years ago, I knew I would dislike when it ended. This seventh and final edition of Mr. Potter is more than I could have ever hoped for. I dislike that Dumbledore was killed - however, when the first actor who played Dumbledore died (Richard Harris) it was only fitting that the character die as well - as NO ONE - not even his son - could replace the energy he brought to that role.<br/><br/>However, I digress. Every story Ms. Rowling writes takes me on an inner landscape ride of enormous proportions - into my imagination which is filled with all sorts of wonderful characters and the story she tells captivates my very soul. All the cantankerous arguments about this story, about her, the spectulations have all ended now. As I look back I know I was part of an epic story, an epic milestone in children's literature and I am proud to be a part of it.<br/><br/>The story will continue on as the movies will be out forever and so will my memories. There is only one Harry Potter and he was a magnificent story that will live forever in my psyche. The way the story ended was excellent - I will keep my promise to Ms. JK - read the story for yourself and be mystified by the brilliance of this writer and learn to lesson from all seven books - never quit, keep going despite how you are treated, how much interference there is, even if you doubt yourself - keep going - endless effort - and your reward will be Peace.<br/><br/>A very well written book - worthy of compliments and awards from this generation to the next. Well done JK, well done.
 Jim Dale again provides a wonderful performance of the scores of characters populating the world of Harry Potter.  I am astonished by his skill at switching between multiple voices with only a couple rare lapses.  Anyone disappointed by the movies should consider listening to the audio books for a complete entertainment experience.<br/><br/>The 7th book is the finest of the series, and one of the best conclusions to any book series I have read.  I anticipated some surprises by the clues Rowling gave in previous books, but nothing was certain until it actually happened.  You will find surprises in volume 7!  There is lots of action and character development.  Rowling cleverly brings in nearly every living and dead character, creature, and herb that appeared in the previous books.<br/><br/>There are several messages to be found in the book.  I will only mention the one generally overlooked - that HISTORY MATTERS.  Such a message may be lost on the majority of people who only live in the moment, but understanding history is the key to understanding the people and problems we must deal with.  History also offers us choices, and an opportunity to repeat what worked and avoid what failed in the past.  Harry's success or failure ultimately depends upon his ability to learn from the history of the people and magic he is facing.  The conclusion of the story hinges upon the insight Harry can achieve.<br/><br/>I was surprised by an obvious gaff early in the book - Hermione says she modified her parents memories, then a few pages later, says she has never done a memory charm!<br/><br/>The middle section of the book has the characters on the run, and suffering through a painful period of personal growth.  Although essential, this is the least satisfying portion of the book.  Maybe an editor could have offered a few helpful suggestions.<br/><br/>The last section of the book is well constructed, even though complex and full of intense action on a grand scale. Rowling chose to edit heavily to keep the pace rapid. Yet, I would have liked more details, particularly about how some favorite characters died. Rowling admitted that she cried over some of these, and perhaps she was trying to spare the readers some of her own grief.<br/><br/>The final confrontation is immensely satisfying and seems flawless.  An epilog offers a comfortable close to the entire series.  Rowling leaves a feeling of completion, yet with the option to write more books if she decides to write again.
 This is the 3rd copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that I've had. My last copy was worn terribly, but I held on to it until it went missing. I had to order another. This is not my favorite book in the series, but I cannot have a complete collection without this book. I'm happy that it is back on the book shelf with the rest of the Harry Potter books &amp; memorabilia.
 Una estafa total ; decía que traían baúl y calcomanías y no trae nada; un engaño les he dejado mil mensajes y nunca contestan<br/><br/>A total scam; he said they brought a trunk and stickers and he does not bring anything; I have left a thousand messages to them and they never answer
 I first saw this at a book fair at my daughter's school. It was absolutely gorgeous and I knew we needed to get it as soon as I saw it, but the retail price was too much. Amazon, however, had a much better price. My 6-year-old and I are reading these together- the first time for the both of us. I'll probably wait a few years to go beyond the second one though.
 EDIT:  Some people mark audio reviews as "unhelpful", which I found strange, until I realized what Amazon does.<br/>--  They pool audio and text reviews and place all of those reviews on each of the products' pages, regardless of form the material is taking.  You wouldn't expect a book review on the DVD's page.  In this case, every word is the same, but a book review tells you only about the story, not the quality of the audio product.<br/>--  But any regular audiobook listener has experienced a great book poorly read, or hammed up, or a voice that grated on your nerves, or found a book you loved to listen to, but couldn't find the time to sit and read (Lord of the Rings for me).<br/>--  A review of the author's work tells you NOTHING about the audio, and yet, if you try and find what you're getting into, you have to sift through MANY book reviews before finding out the quality of the voice work, as most people have reviewed the author and the book, rather than the audiobook.<br/>--  So, here's a small review of the audiobook, if you're interested in purchasing that.  If you're looking for a review of the author, I am not being unhelpful, but Amazon is.  I will request that they change their policy and display the reviews separately.<br/><br/>... Jim Dale is one of the best voice actors I've ever listened to and he brought the books to life an a way that reading could never do.  I like reading, but it's really incredible to have someone put a different voice to every character, displaying the emotions and tone of the interactions.<br/>... They are a really phenomenal experience, and I've listened to them over again and again.
 My son received the set of Harry Potter books for his birthday. It’s quickly become his most used gift! He won’t put them down! He reads to me and on his own, and i loved the series as a kid so the nostalgia makes it even more loveable. It came when expected and i highly recommend this to anyone!
 The paper is very thin and slightly gray. These books are obviously very cheap, for $52 for the set, you get what you pay for. Came with some scuffs on some corners and a page was torn out of the last book (not a page of text, looks like it might have been a flyer or a bookmark of some sort?). If you're a book collector, you'll want to upgrade to something nicer. But if you just want to read the books, or have copies that you wouldn't mind losing while traveling, these are probably fine.
 This is as great an adventure in fantasy as you can get. Loved the story line and  character development as well as the tempo which keeps you interested from beginning to end. The movie followed the book pretty well, howver, it cannot match the detail and depth of the book.
 Love the British editions for all the original British language in them!  It made reading the books again lots of fun, looking for the differences between the wording in the British editions and the American editions.  I far prefer the British editions, and am sorry the publisher here changed so much.
 As the finale of the HP series The Deathly Hallows is a must read.  It is the final evolution of both the HP series and the ideas and writing of Rowlings (at least within the series).  The book finally ties together the unresolved but suspected issues and tensions between Harry and Severus Snape and ends the feud between Harry and Voldemort.<br/>Reading this on an Android phone was somewhat less satisfying than turning the pages of a real book but it is far more portable and available to a busy scheduled person.
 Come on there's theme parks and epic movie contracts about this series. This just makes all those hardback copies you purchased at Walmart the night they came out seem cumbersome. It's a bajillion pages, so a thin profiled boxed set is ideal for paper lovers like you and me. DO IT.
 Many books take you on a roller coaster of emotions, and yet many more lose their charm when they become a series. The Harry Potter story captivated me from the beginning, and I feared that every book I subsequently read would be a dissapointment. They were not; they each added to the story, building up slowly to this final Deathly Hollows.<br/>I give this book five stars because it puts a final seal to a great story; as in life, it makes you shed tears, but in the end, it leaves you with s smile and a hope for more.
 What I Loved:  The amount of detail that went into wrapping up the major storylines.  This book was not for the faint at heart: you cried, you laughed, but in the end you realized that life does indeed go on if you let it.  The characters that were amazing in this book: Mrs. Weasley, Bellatrix, Ron (showed huge growth), the Twins, and Neville!  My favorite parts were centered around these characters and what they brought to the table.<br/><br/>My Thoughts:  This book was better the 2nd and 3rd time I read it.  It is hard to explain but the first time was just overwhelming and left me raw that it really did take re-reads to capture all the small stuff that really made it shine. I was sad to see the series come to a close but I think it was the right thing to do.  The world is rich and she could re-visit it with other characters and adventures but she needed to let Harry become just "The Man Who Lived".<br/><br/>Why I gave it a 5:  Very well written and presented!<br/><br/> ...]
 Absolutely amazing. If you think these books are for kids, you’re partially correct. They are also for adults, particularly the last 2 in the series. Heartwarming, a truly wonderful series. Wrapped up beautifully with this final installment. I open at the close.
 Arrived on time (actually, I think a day or two early) and the set was as promised.  The set didn't match, but that's okay because we're not looking for a something to collect and display.  My daughter is 8 and is really reading for the first time.  She's burning through these books at a remarkable pace.  These books are in perfect condition for reading.  Isn't that what books are for, after all?
 Just finished the second book and I'm definitely hooked on this series. It's so much more than the movies. Don't get me wrong I love the movies but there is so much more in the books. Love the way you keep the pace though out the chapters. So now on to the next book!!!
 Books are classic. Covers are beautiful. Spines are terrible. Each book's spine holds the pages so firmly together that you can't even open the book without cracking the beautiful castle on the back.
 I love the Harry Potter series. I'd read it before borrowing from friends and had several volumes lost in moves. It's one of those timeless classics like the Wizard of Oz, that breaks down the barriers between children's books and adult reads, that really brings out a lot of depth in life -- and carries a definite undertone of British school satire that I loved from the beginning.<br/><br/>When I got a chance to replace them, I'd thought of getting used copies and then found the five volume boxed set. It's got a sturdy cardboard box printed with jolly art, all five volumes fit neatly and do have their original paperback cover art -- something I appreciated since I came to enjoy the illustrator's style with its whimsical accuracy to story.<br/><br/>Well worth it at the bargain price I got. You won't regret it, at least not till book 7 is in print, in paperback and out in a boxed set. If you're new to the series or replacing old copies, this is the way to go. It'll also make a very handy bookend if you have open shelving, just put one end against the corner and the Harry Potter boxed set on the outside and all the rest of the books on that shelf won't shove it off.
 I love reading, and I got weaned off of Dr. Seuss and picture books thanks to Harry Potter. While I read the books as a kid as they came out, I never actually had the complete series at home. I usually had to borrow the books at my school or public libraries. I just thought it'd be nice to finally have all the books now, so here I am! It's honestly great knowing I can read these at any time without having to go to the public library, where someone might have already checked out a book, and especially since I'm not in school anymore.
 The gift was great, but it came with 2 number 1 books and no number 2. A bit disappointed.
 While the story is a bit clunky in places and has a feel of someone trying to clean up loose ends while distracted, it is still very enjoyable and you will like the finish. It's not the typical ending but a good ending for this story and in this author's opinion, leaves the door open for more or even fanv ersions of alternative storylines much like Star Wars and Star Trek. I ordered the audio CD version of the book and the UK version of the printed book. Jim Dale as in the past, is an excellent narrator of the story complete with his 130 or so voices (his number from an NPR interview).  I did use Audiobook Builder (OSX) to make my CDs into something that I could load on my iPod and still bookmark and have the proper names on each track. The book really does have a special feel when you listen to it because of JK's nicely done descriptions.  For the fan, I recommend that you try the audio version and listen to JK's world of wizardry and magic with Jim Dale. It can make the commute much more enjoyable and even make cleaning the kitchen a fun task. Unless you have some house elves help you.
 I started reading Harry Potter books as they were coming out. Life took a bad turn, and I never opened the 4th or ordered the rest. Now I have them all om my Kindle app (much lighter). I just finished reading them all, and loved them. Now I wish there were more.
 Includes the full set of the hardcover books in the original book sleeves from when I was a kid. Product image doesn't show, but the set does come in a cardboard "Chest" that is both study enough to move the quite heavy set around in, and decorative enough to keep the set in for display (If 'Harry Potter themed book chest' fits your style). There were no printing errors found so have to give the highest marks.
 Amazing obviously. Rowling is queen and I plan to read these with my little girl when she gets a little older--old enough to enjoy the story. The pictures will be awesome for reading to a smaller child. I plan on introducing HP at a very early age lol. I'll buy each one as they come out.
 Harry Potter is the most amazing world to delve into. I have read this collection more times than I know. My children who are now 33, 31, 28 &amp; 28 started reading them when they came out. They had their heads buried in each book constantly. I finally decided to read them in the summer of 2007, and continue to do so whenever I feel the need for joyful, exiting sometimes scary fantasy. Thank you JK Rowling, you have brought much joy to this 57 year old mother of four and grandmother of one.
 I began re-reading the Harry Potter series shortly before my recent trip to the UK to present a paper and perform for an academic conference at the University of Cambridge. At the closing night dinner, an older man scoffed at me when I said I looked forward to reading on the plane ride home. “But that’s a children’s book!” he said. Yes, I first read this series as a child, but as an adult—and a scholar with a doctorate in musicology—there are things I appreciate now that I couldn’t appreciate twenty years ago, for example: that Gilderoy Lockhart is the textbook definition of mansplainer. Moving on now to my ninth read of The Prisoner of Azkaban.
 Came in pretty good condition for being used. No rips, tears, or damage to be found. All pages intact.
 Talk about imagination!!  These books are for young and old!  I'm reading them with my granddaughter and wish I had read them earlier.  We are both enjoying all the adventures.  I've now suggested to my husband that he would really enjoy all the exploits - great reads!
 The illustrated versions of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series are outstanding. The illustrations really bring the book to life. I would tear the book apart and frame my favorite illustrations, but that would almost be sacrilegious. Perfect for the avid Harry Potter fan.
 Got the ebook version for my mobile device. I'd forgotten how much fun these books were to read. no technical issues with ebook version, no complaints.
 Wow!  Is the only family appropriate word I can come up with to describe this purchase.  This was brand new set, the plastic seal on the books had not been opened and the trunk for the books was in beautiful condition, my daughter is going to flip out when she opens this Christmas morning!
 I've read them all - usually in a few days after meeting the postman at the mailbox - then preferring to pass them on to others (only to find that my wife - another HP/JKR junkie) - has stashed them in the guest room.  We took our granddaughter to NYC to see Mary Poppins on Broadway - she brought a Potter/Rowling book along and buried her nose in it on the train to and from the City, through lunch and at every intermission  she had already read it ONCE and was going through it the second time!)  What can I say more?  Well, that this one is the beginning of the end of the series and pulls together many loose ends, answer questions I did not know I had and making sense of much while leaving plenty for #7!
 Definitely worth all the praise, although I was somewhat annoyed by the many "Hey remember this?" recaps that often mentioned events only one book earlier. Highly recommend.
 This is the fourth time I have read this series and it is as exciting to read now as it was the first time. As a librarian, I make it a point to tell parents it is not about witchcraft but about good triumphing over evil. Adults and children alike should enjoy the entire series. Well it`s on to the next book!
 Bought this set for my Grandson because I wanted to share this wonderful series with him. My daughter (his mother) and I read (devoured) every book, and even though I was well above the recommended age for these books, by about 40 years or so, I thoroughly enjoyed the series. Read and own every book, saw and own every movie. I would recommend these books to anyone who loves a well written story. For those who think they are bad - witchcraft, etc., - try teaching your children the difference between fiction and reality.
 Rowling is excellent. Kids books, young adult? I'm 72 I read the first 4 books in 2002, waited with great anticipation as each of the remaining 3 were published and have enjoyed every one. The newer books are also very good as are the movies.
 What seems most wonderful about the conclusion of this series is the interconnectedness of generations of families both past and future that gives a rich depth to the values that are in conflict. The story becomes timeless. We are just enjoying this generation as they experience the conflict. There is a sense that the lessons learned are something each generation must pass on to the next.<br/>This series also continues to develop characters so that we really feel attracted to some and repeled by others -- or sympathetic at least.<br/>This is something movies can only give a glimpse of so reading the books remains a must do before thinking the movies will do the story justice. The movies made of these will continue to be a series of snap shots reminding us of the books and helping enrich our imaginations.<br/>Several of my pet theories play out in the end but there are several things that remains loose or lost.<br/>I would love to know what happened to Crookshanks. I thought there was more for the cat to do.
 I’m in deep love with all the books, I love having this amazing book collection part of my room, not only is it cool to have the whole collection but they really went above and beyond to make a cardboard trunk that could fit all the books into it and make the whole thing really come to life. My only little complaint is that the cardboard did come with bashes and a broken knot of the side so I can’t really pick it up from the sides but all in all, it deserves 5 stars for delivering one hell of an awesome collection item. The stickers for the trunk was a plus btw.
 The illustrated versions of the Harry Potter books are wonderful! We own the first and third ones as well, and we are looking forward to the fourth coming out in the near future. It makes for a wonderful read aloud with younger children. It is so neat to witness a new generation of kiddos being introduced to the magic that is so much a part of our lives of us who were blessed to have had these in our youth.
 This is a fun collection to have, especially if you enjoy going through the entire series in one fell swoop. The first book is fairly light hearted in style and as the series advances and Harry Potter matures, the content becomes more serious and darker. While it remains child appropriate I wouldn't recommend it for young children, however it is a very enjoyable series that both young and old will enjoy if they're looking for a bit of magic in their life.
 I really like the fact that I can get this product delivered digitally to my Kindle Fire.<br/>I also enjoy reading this series, there is a lot more details that were not captured in the movies.<br/>Things that were not explained in the movies are explained in the book, so you get a better understanding of the characters and how their lives interconnect. Really enhances the story!
 I breezed through CHAMBER OF SECRETS almost with a sense of urgency.  I wanted to read what was going to happen next, and I was never bored.  As soon as I finished I picked up the third Harry Potter book and began reading it.  This reaction pretty much describes the strength of the book and the series (at least thus far) - it is compelling, interesting and entertaining.<br/>I liked that CHAMBER OF SECRETS made use of stories, powers and characters mentioned in the first Potter book but in a more expanded way here.  I'm never a fan of inventing something new to get a character out of a situation.  That happens to some extent near the end of CHAMBER OF SECRETS, but the book is stronger when Harry's ability to speak with snakes comes in handy and is explained further, Hagrid's past plays a key plot role and Percy the prefect subtly falls under suspicion.  In each case, these things first appeared in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORUCER'S STONE.  On the other hand, Tom Riddle, the sword of Gryffindor and the phoenix seem introduced to explain away situations that can't be explained with already-introduced elements.<br/>Some other things I don't like about this book (and the first) - Harry's distrust of authority, while perhaps true to form for a child, is annoying.  When Dumbledor asks him if he has anything to tell him, Harry withholds key information, but when his abck is up against the wall, he trusts in Dumbledor's promise.  What's the message here?  Be distrustful of adults unless there's no choice?<br/>Also, poor Draco Malfoy never even temporarily gets a leg up.  Harry's one-upping Malfoy has become boring because Malfoy never takes the lead, never pulls one over on Harry, and never does a bad deed that goes unpunished.<br/>Similarly, the return of Voldemort is something of a disappointment.  How many times will Harry beat him?  Pretty soon, Voldemort will cease being intimidating.<br/>Finally, the ending, like the ending of the first book, is too good.  Like the repeated defeat of Voldemort, repeated all-out happy endings lose their excitement after a while.<br/>None of these problems take away from the book's pace.  Despite its flaws, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is awfully fun.
 HP books - what's to say?  We needed an extra set and these are all great simply because they are smaller and easier to carry.  My family needed to replace some of our well worn hardbacks and to have multiply copies is a big help.
 ...which warn that Harry Potter books are part of a satanic plot to capture the minds of our children? The point they all raise is the obvious one, of course--the central theme of Potter books is sorcery and witchcraft: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live", and so on. ...But Rowling gives her books a family dimension. Her important characters all have families, even if they are lousy ones--Harry's, for example. In this book in particular, we get to meet the large, wacky and loving family of Harry's friend Ron. We already met Ron's brothers as upperclassmen in "Sorcerer's Stone"--now we meet his parents and kid sister. We meet Draco Malfoy's father and discover why he's so mean-spirited--he's a "chip off the old block". We get a look backwards in time at "dropout" Hagrid as a difficult student and Dumbledore as an young professor trying to bring him round, which includes an insight as to why Hagrid failed. Issues like bigotry are addressed--such as the disdain "pure-blooded" wizards have for those with "muggle" (non-sorcery people) or mixed (one wizard and one "muggle") parentage. Purebloods such as Malfoy &amp; Son call them "mud-bloods"...In truth, this series is in keeping with a lot of other youth-readership fiction. It sends a great message about human dignity--what sort of behavior and attitudes are consistent with it, as well as what sort harm it. When a writer can do that and still tell an enjoyable story, that writer is going to be a big success in the "kid book" genre...
 Been wanting to read these for years but I waited until I could get them all at one time. The books are better than the movies because the characters have more depth. The author give both the heroes and villians depth that helps you understand what motivates them.
 I love this! I love the chest that the books come in and they all fit in it perfectly. The chest isn't as ornate as it could be but for the price and for it to include all the books, I think this is absolutely worth the buy!
 This was an amazing deal, and I'm very glad I purchased it. One thing I didn't know before I bought the books is the progress bar/percentage of what you've already read is for the overall series, not for each book. All of the books download as one large file. I don't have a problem with this, but I know some people prefer separate books, but it was cheaper to buy them all this way. Also, Harry Potter is the greatest story ever and I'm super happy to finally have the kindle versions! ⚡
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, having grown up with the books.  I purchased this book so that when I have children I can introduce them to the world of Harry Potter through the books and read to them.  The illustrations are amazing and I just love this book so much.
 I bought this book as (used-good condition) from Benjamins bookshelf &amp; it was more like in VERY GOOD condition the only blemish on this book is a name written on a page. Other than that it's perfect, possibly unread &amp; stored on a shelf. For $9 😲 an absolute steal. Used/pre loved books are the way to go!
 I am 74 years old and read and enjoyed these books as they came out.  I am rereading them now.  The characters are well written and very much like the ages they portray.  The plot is great and keeps one reading.  I recommend this book series from 10 to 75 at least.
 Repurchased the whole set of books, to reread<br/>The entire series is my favorite books to read, and came in perfect condition<br/>If you haven't read The Harry Potter Series, you are truly missing out!!!
 Based on the reviews I thought this was the illustrated version.
 Books are great first time reading them. Unfortunately on Book Five-Order of the Phoenix. I got a bad print. My book goes from chapter 24 to chapter 14,q5,16 then then end of chapter 26. Unfortunately this kind of messes up the timeline lol. But overall great series so far.
 Good book. My kids love Harry Potter. Both the books and the movies.  The books go more in detail, as expected.  The books are better than the movies but also take longer amount of time to finish.  If your kids like to rad these are great books.
 I was introduced to the Harry Potter books by my 9 1/2 year old son and I didn't really know what to expect...  I was very plreasantly surprised when I loved all 3 of them!  I had a to giggle at a negative review of  "Sorcerer's Stone" that was written by a 16 year old; she/he  spent more time slamming anyone who enjoys the books than actually writing  about the book itself and I got the feeling that she/he wanted to hear  her/himself go on and on.  She/he also said that the only reason that these  books are popular is because of media hype, but my intorduciton to the  books shoots down that theory.  "Sorcerer's Stone" picks up where  "Chamber of Secrets" left off and I found myself instantly swept  away with Harry and the gang.  Rowling uses tidbits from the first book and  I also know, from having read the third installment, that she will continue  to weave the web further as more about Harry' s past and future is  revealed.  It's fun to hate the Dursleys, Snape and the Malfoys and it's a  kick to love the charming Weasleys and the kindly, but strict teachers at  the wizard school.  And I love Harry, Ron and Hermione because they  continue to be typical kids, albeit kids who happen to be magic.  Rowling's  desciptions are very vivid, her characters are very well fleshed out and  the story is extrememly compelling.  I'd recommend this book to kids above  7 or 8 (depending on their reading level) and to all adults who enjoy being  swept away by a book that has a wry sense of humor and an engaging plot.
 These books are beautiful. I’m sharing the Harry Potter series with my 8 year old for the first time, and the beautiful illustrations are really helping in making the story come alive. I’ll be getting all of these.
 I did enjoy this books and all the other Harry Potter books very much! I won’t very well read I admit but found these books fascinating and hard to put down. I am amazed that what seems like a children’s book held such intrust for me. The description in the words in each story made the story come alive in my mind I hope I find more books in the kindle format that can interest me like these books have. I guess its never too late to be better read.
 I absolutely love these books! I didn't get into them until now, as a college student, but they truly are as incredible, if not more so, as everyone says! Having all of them on my Kindle in one purchase is absolutely wonderful too! I highly recommend reading them and buying them in this format!
 This boxed set was for my grandson, who is obsessed with Harry Potter.  The box and the books are good quality, and my grandson was thrilled with them.  This price (under $40) was the best I found.
 I promised myself that I would go back and review my purchases on Amazon, so here I am having found my first ever order. I remember waiting for my Amazon delivery the day this book was released... I hugged the delivery man when he arrived at our door. Thank you to Amazon for bringing happiness to so many young Harry Potter fans, myself included, as we anxiously waited for the newest and final installment. This is my favorite book of all time. It ties together Harry, Ron, and Hermione's story (the story belongs to all of them, not just to Harry) in such a beautiful, holistic way. I highly recommend this and all Harry Potter books to any reader, young or old.
 My 7yr old is now obsessed with Harry Potter because of these beautifully done books. We are so sad that only the first three are like this. The illustrations are just amazing and so well done. They bring out the magic of this wonderful story.
 As I was reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I realized that there are quite a few things in the magical world that I am glad exist only in the magical world. I tried to think of things specifically from this book that I would love to have exist, and my list got very, very short. I think I’ll share them both with you. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Magical Things from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I Wish Were Real:<br/><br/>Flying Ford Anglias<br/><br/>Seriously, who couldn’t use a flying car every once in a while? I love love to have one of these. That invisibility button would also be awesome since then people wouldn’t even know where I was when I was flying across the country. This would also probably be cheaper than flying commercially. Okay, someone needs to make this a thing.<br/><br/>House Elves<br/><br/>So Dobby is a bit crazy but house elves could be extremely useful. Every bookworm could benefit from the services of one of these. They could clean up after us, make us food, and even bring us chocolate. I would be all for having a house elf, though I would treat my house elf better than Dobby was treated.<br/><br/>Magical Things from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I Am Eternally Happy Are NOT Real:<br/><br/>Aragog and Family<br/><br/>Anything that is ready to eat Ron, Harry, and Fang needs to not exist. Also, a spider the size of a small elephant sounds terrifying. I am glad these exist only in the world of dear Harry Potter. Though, now that I think of it, this would be a very good reason to avoid the Forbidden Forest forever.<br/><br/>The Monster in the Chamber of Secrets<br/><br/>Since I don’t want to spoil this for anyone who hasn’t read the book/seen the movie (do you even exist?), I will refrain from naming the monster. However, this monster needs to never exist in the world that I live in. I have no desire to know that something this creepy could truly roam unseen around a gigantic, medieval castle. If these exist, kindly refrain from telling me so.<br/><br/>Tom Riddle’s Diary<br/><br/>So, a creepy blank diary that writes back to you? No thank you. I full heartedly agree with Mr. Weasley that you should never trust anything if you can’t tell where is keeps its brain. Yep, this diary definitely falls into that category of things that shouldn’t be trusted, ever. Also, after reading the later books and knowing what the diary really was, I am so grateful that it does not exist in my world.<br/><br/>Polyjuice Potion<br/><br/>I have to say that this could, potentially, be handy sometimes. However, at most times, this would be terrible. Imagine never knowing exactly who you are talking to or spending time with. Especially in light of the fourth book, this potion is a terrible idea, at least in my opinion. I prefer to deal with people honestly and so this type of a potion does not sit well with me.<br/><br/>This review fist appeared at Orandi et Legendi ( ...]).
 The movies didn't do this book justice, you much read the books to get the full impact of a very satisfying ending to a wonderful book series.  I'm sure I'll be starting again with the 1st book within a matter of months because it's such a excellent saga.
 Son loves it, and it's a better price than buying all the books separately. Some of the other reviews mentioned artwork on every page, but that must be the hardback version only. No fancy pages for the paperback edition. The box does have a nice piece of artwork though.
 Why are  so many people wild about Harry?<br/><br/>I have a fascination with the thought of teaching at Hogwarts though notice they do not seem to have a philosophy course in the curriculum!  Over the last year or so I have read the Harry Potter Books and watched the movies. I listen to the music on the soundtrack CDs while working. It sets a nice mood for me. Why?<br/><br/>There has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that Lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.<br/><br/>Some have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.<br/><br/>We also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, "It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live." as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.<br/><br/>With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.<br/><br/>I do not want the story to stop. It bugged me that I had to wait until June to see the last movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. Book 6 is scheduled to come out July 16, 2005 and my order for it is already placed. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word "scar."<br/><br/>When I received my order for HPCS, as a side note, I puzzled over this recent development of ordering things before they are published. I have had outstanding orders for about four of five things that have not come out yet. This never used to be the case, at least for me. So this is some new kind of economic development in its own right. I suspect computers had something to do with this. And credit.<br/><br/>I would love to teach at Hogwarts. Imagine! Students studying. Reading assignments and papers done. Students working at the library. (I seriously think Snape is the best teacher there). Reading books after class on school grounds. Students getting along well in their own houses at least. Competition between houses is a good stressor. Teachers get to teach what they consider important and they don't have to worry so much about their popularity. They can be as strict as they want. In fact, if they are not good enough or strict enough they can lose their positions!<br/><br/>No more casual clothes. Discipline is the order of the day. All you need to do is deduct points or give detentions, even if those are no longer hanging by the thumbs in the dungeons; they are amazingly effective at Hogwarts. Students really behave. School spirit is great. The school spirits are interesting as well.<br/><br/>The classrooms look like the pits - well, dungeons at least. At least they are not temporary or make shift! And if they are drafty? Except maybe divination class where it is warm on purpose. Students have sweaters and robes to keep them warm. Cooler is always better for staying awake anyway. Heck, even dead teachers can keep going in a school like this! (See professor Bins in the books.)<br/><br/>No Internet. Heck, no eklectricity at all in fact. But instead of instant messaging there are instant owls. No spam, though there are occasionally howlers. You never have to find someone's address even if they are hiding from everyone. Owls know where they are. Imagine the possibilities! Message to Osama? Better use a timer if you want your owl back. How would that work?<br/><br/>But I think the reason I would want to teach there is not just the castle and its peculiarities. It's the quality of the students. They are smart and interested. They are the kinds of kids we really want. Is this different than the ones we really have? They come to school reasonably prepared even if some of their wands are defective. There is still the pressure on those who would over indulge in intellectualosity-- maybe I should use the word "lucubrations". "This is light?" "How can you be behind in your school work? We are on vacation!" "She's a nightmare. No wonder she doesn't have any friends." But that sort of thing is resolved. "Thank goodness. Hermione pays attention in Herbology." What could be more rewarding than being her teacher?<br/><br/>I do miss the fine arts. History taught by a dead teacher is not the best critical thinking course. Would critical thinking be out of place in Hogwarts? Not likely. Maybe there is a place for philosophy? At least in Britain.<br/><br/>Well, no tickling sleeping dragons.
 This book, a sequel to "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone", is the second book in a proposed seven-book series following the adventures of one Harry Potter as he advances through Hogwart's School of Wizardry. In the first book, he was eleven years old, a first-year student; in this one, he is twelve and a second-year. This is to be the pattern for the series; each book is to be one year in his school career.<br/><br/>Like the first book, this one is a wonderful tale which has deservedly captured the imaginations of most of the fantasy-reading populace (and a fair number of people who DON'T generally read fantasy.) It has all of the elements of a traditional story, with an evil villain and main characters who are good people struggling against that evil and doing heroic things in the process, but it is far from a stereotypical story. The characters have very definite life, and Rowling is a fine writer with a deft touch at a clever turn of phrase, who never lets her desire to show off that talent become distracting, as some lesser authors do. What's more, the books are competently edited and proofread, something of a rarity these days in mass-market paperbacks; I didn't notice a single typo or poor word choice or grammatical error throughout the entire book.<br/><br/>This series compares favorably to C.S. Lewis's "Narnia" series, with which it shares some elements, and if I can't QUITE bring myself to rate it higher than Tolkein's "Lord of the Rings" saga, that's only because it would seem sacrilege to suggest such a thing (besides, it isn't finished yet; maybe by the time it's done, who knows...)<br/><br/>If you have ANY interest in fantasy at all, DO NOT miss this series.
 The hardback collection is as expected.  The box (made to look like a Hogwarts student's trunk) is a show stopper.  It's made of cardboard, so not especially durable, but it makes for a great presentation.
 Amazing books, we are huge Harry Potter Fans. After a trip to London last year and a visit to Kings Crossing we had to get the books. They are beautiful highly recommended. Very fast shipping
 The second book in the series is just as great as the first. JK Rowling's style is easy to read yet keeps a reader's attention. This hardcover copy was purchased to complete a set where the paperback copies were falling apart.
 Reveived this box set as a gift from my husband. The trunk is made of thick cardboard with a smooth printed design and a plastic latch. The books are contained in a smaller interior box have the original cover illustrations. The set also comes with a sheet of stickers intended to decorate the trunk. I absolutely loved the set when I received it. And yes, I used the stickers on the trunk and enjoyed every second decorating it!
 I think this book will be an instant classic and think the author is really onto something with the series.<br/>We will see where it goes from here, but I'm guessing this will be one to have in hard copy/hardback for the bookshelf.
 As a huge HP fan it was only natural that I had To buy up all of these that are available. The illustrations by Jim Kay are gorgeous and just perfect!<br/>I have already read it myself and this series will definitely be the way I read HP to my kids!
 My son has all harry potter books from the same collection and was missimg this last one. It was so hard to find.<br/>When I finally found and bought, my son told me that the book was fake, I checked and looks like fake or a horrible copy.
 It seems that if Harry Potter returns to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizards that bad things will happen.  And it does.  Somebody is turning students (and others) into stone.  And it has to do with something that happened 50 YEARS AGO.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this book.  Same style as the first, with a mystery, and some information about the school and history of some of the characters, like Hagrid and Tim Riddle.  Secret Chambers, snakes and spiders do make this slightly more darker than the first book, so be warned!<br/><br/>Addition - Hey!  They didn’t change the title!  I guess they felt people would know what the Chamber of Secrets meant?  Or maybe Chamber of Unknown Things would have been too silly.<br/>The books are getting a tad darker.  There are hints of racism toward non-humans and non-magical people.  You kind of got that before but in this book is stands out more.  I mean, just look at the elves.  Or how people treat Myrtle the ghost and Muggle-born students.<br/>On the other hand we get to see where the Weasleys live.  The Burrow.  And we meet Ginny who has a crush on Harry.  Don’t worry, all of them will play a part in the series at one point or another.<br/>Once again I don’t want to spoil it for you but if you don’t like spiders you may have a hard time.  And there are hints that Harry may be an Heir of the Slytherin. Dun-dun-dun.<br/>We meet Lochhart which is, to me, a slightly flat character.  He is the NEW Defense Against The Dark Arts professor.  Why anybody wants that job I don’t know.  I just didn’t feel like he was a fully fleshed out character.  You may think otherwise but I was not impressed by him.  And yes, that may have been the while point of his character.  You have to read the story to understand that last sentence.<br/>Also the movie based on the second book does a good job of following much of it.  The problem being is that at the time the first two movies were made the book series was not finished yet.  So after this many of the movies will go off the rail as characters who turn out to be important to the overall arch are sometimes neglected or taken out of the story totally because they don‘t seem important at the time.<br/>If you liked the first story I would suggest this one also.  But after this, as the setting becomes darker and the characters become older, I am not sure I would be able to say that.
 Have read these books  at least seven times and I'm 73yearsol.  It's great to be able to go to a place and think of different world  I am a Viet nam vet and have to get away at times!!!!!
 Great book set. I haven’t gone through all the books, the only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because in the 5th book I’m seeing a lot of faded texts on a lot of pages. It’s almost as if the page printer was running out of ink for these books. Other than that the collection is good.
 Beautifully illustrated!  This book is everything I wanted it to be and more.  There are illustrations on almost every page, both full scenes and small details.  The illustrations themselves are lovely and full of quirky detail.  I have spent hours reading the text of the book and looking at every illustration.  Absolutely worth the money, even if you already have a copy of the book.  Perfect gift for a Harry Potter lover!
 I am in love, omgosh..<br/>Can not wait to start reading the second book. Whoever packed this, is brilliant. Love the treasure chest kind of box, love the carefully way it was boxed... the first of my book collections! Totally recommended &lt;3
 Great looking set. Bought for neice for birthday she’s excited to read! Price did fluctuate in week I bought it. A few days after my purchase, price reduced by maybe $5 🤷🏻‍♀️ Ya win some ya lose some I reckon!
 I was very impressed with the quality and the way it was shipped. The latch looks like a real lock to the extent I was looking in the box for a key!!! I haven't opened the books(each wrapped in celephane) I will write another review after I present this to my daughter.
 This is the first read-through of the entire series. I appreciate the characters, the setting and the flow of the story. The author’s writing is smart and engaging. It was sad to see the end. Now what do I read?
 What is there to dislike? It's the Harry Potter books.<br/>Bought the set for my son for Christmas so he could have his own copies. He loved them and it's nice they came in the little box to keep them together
 Books are printed incorrectly I'm missing about half of one of the books. Pathetic
 To be honest I wasn't to impressed with the first. Harry Potter book and almost didnt read the second  I am glad I did  The second started out slow but picked up the pace very quickly The characters were better developed<br/>and the plot was very good  I  am keeping my fingers crossed  for the third
 Never got the actual book, instead got the book before this one but with this ones paper cover, so was returned ... I'm sure I'll eventually get an actual copy so I can read it....
 I purchased this for my daughter and I. We have never read the books or watched the movies or books. Our plan: read each book then watch the corresponding movie.<br/>I like the packaging and how the series of books are kept organized in its own book case. It keeps it well organized.<br/>The price I thought was reasonable for a series collection of paperback books for an already popular well known author that my daughter and I are beginning to experience.<br/>The books themselves are already way better than the movies!!!!!
 Bought as a gift for my tween (11) daughter after she powered through all the movies the other day and expressed interest in reading the novels.  She's already teasing my other tween daughter with all the new info that didn't make it into the films, laugh.
 I have read most of the critiques here with a great deal of amusement.  The few dissenters seem to feel that the Potter series is contrived and predictable.  Sure the books are a little on the simplistic side.... they are written for 12 year olds.  I am very impressed with JK Rowling.  Anyone who can write a 700 page book that young adults are dying to read is someone who deserves my admiration.  As an educator, I see too many students who do not like to read and would much rather sit passively and stare at a computer game or mindless television instead of actually putting forth the mental capacity it takes to read and use your imagination.  I think ANY introduction into reading is certainly commendable and there is no way of knowing how many children (or even adults) have begun to read even a little bit more than they used to because they picked up one of these books.  I did not read the Potter series until after seeng the movie and I enjoyed them very much.  I did not find it to be sinister or teaching dark magic to children (lighten up folks!).  I have also read the Oz series, the Narnia series, The Wrinkle in Time series, and several others, and think the Harry Potter series will be a wonderful addition to young adult literature.  I wish this series had existed when I was a young adult.  I would have read them and enjoyed them along with the other series that have become classics.  I am not a child and knew these books were not Tolstoy when I picked them up, but that did not stop me from being entertained and appreciating them.  Instead of showing an intellect superior to the masses, dissenters came across as petty and small minded.  I, for one, will be joining the ranks of those who are anticipating the release of the next novel and know that my IQ is not threatened if I actually enjoy something that is not purely academic (Heck, I enjoy Brady Bunch reruns too - sue me)
 Arrived in perfect condition, the art in the book provides a wonderful new magical perspective of J.K.'s wizarding world. These illustrated books are a must buy for any Harry Potter fan and for a new generation of Harry Potter fans to be.
 My grandson loves anything HP..he received first two books in this collection from me..hopefully Somebody will get the others for him to complete it and see the big picture which is a great idea for collectors.
 This book is missing several pages
 I think it is very important that everyone read Harry Potter at least once, Ideally when they are young and malleable.<br/><br/>Reading these are amazing and it makes the movies seem terrible.
 Books have the origional artwork covers and fit nicely in the box. Box is suprisingly sturdy with thin rope handles that seem to be able to carry the weight of the box well.
 They've done a great job with the kindle version of the books and putting them all in one collection. My only complaint would be that you can't turn it sideways and get all the words.
 I never saw a physical copy of this book until it arrived in the mail and I was BLOWN AWAY.  For the price of these books I was expecting much less. Definitely worth your money and a much needed addition to your collection.
 It is really nice to have the entire set in one place. While I do own all the books I had several hard back versions so it was tough to keep track of it all. Now my kids can find whichever book they want within us having to figure up the mismatched original.
 I enjoyed all the twists and turns in this book and the rest of the Potter series.  Sorry to see it end and will have to continue following J.K. Rowling's other books as she is a good writer.
 HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS picks up the summer after SORCEROR'S STONE, a terrific book, leaves off, with Harry back at the Dursleys' house on Privet Drive suffering through another miserable birthday. Soon, though, the prospect of returning to Hogwarts School brings him the promise of more adventure and, of course, mortal danger.<br/>With this book, J.K. Rowling showed that the first book wasn't a fluke, that she knows how to craft an involving children's fantasy that doubles as complicated, twisted and dread-filled mystery. She also shows that she's creating a universe for her readers full of endearing, believable characters and plot cornerstones.<br/>It's no mistake that each book follows roughly the same course, starting in pretty much the same place each time. The things Rowling is able to do within the plot structure and pattern that she sets up in HARRY POTTER is nothing short of remarkable.<br/>These are great books, and, though CHAMBER OF SECRETS isn't my favorite or the most complicated and satisfying, the ending, which you won't see coming at all ... unless you've seen the movie, is startlingly inventive.
 I’m amazed at the depth of Rowling’s imagination.  Great descriptions of the characters and settings, and a lot of action and suspense.  However, I felt there were a couple of loose ends that didn’t get tied at the end of the story.
 The Harry Potter books have been a wonderful way to wind down the day reading them aloud before sleep. The stories are well constructed and the plot and character development through the series are remarkable.
 This was a gift for my daughter. She loves the books and appreciates the box. She also understands that the box is just a nicely decorated piece of cardboard, used as a box and is delicate.
 I've finally finished the Harry Potter series, and I will miss it dreadfully. But just as Harry's parents and other beloved teachers will never leave him, so this story will never leave me. That is, truly, the power of love. It defeats every ending.
 I've read enough books to fill a library.  The Harry Potter series I admit is by far my favorite.  My wish is for a 3 or 4 part prequail and I'd love to read the same amount in a seaqueal.  Perhaps Harry fights off Voldemorts unknown son......
 Danger abounds when the Slytherin Heir comes back, and the Chamber of Secrets is opened. Can Harry solve the clues in time to save his friend? Read this fantastic story to find out!
 The books are the most important part of this; which are amazing. the "trunk" it comes in it pretty cool but also a little useless. the "trunk" it made of cardboard and then covered in a book cover type of paper. There are stickers that you can use to decorate the trunk with but after about a week of admiring the box set I took the books out and put them on the shelf and put the "trunk" down in the storage. It was too bulky to really be displayed anywhere. If you can find the book set anywhere else for cheaper or by the individual ones for cheaper I'd recommend that.
 Love the series and this does not disappoint. Hard to put down, so ready yourself for sleepless nights as you surge forward along with the characters and their adventures.
 I grew up loving these books, but let a friend borrow my hard copies and never got them back.  I am very happy with my Kindle replacement that goes everywhere with me and I can never lose.
 As we come to the end of  this unique world of fantasy which JK Rowling created, kudos must be given to Jim Dale, who from the first book made every character come alive with a distinctive voice and personality. I have read the books, but for me, listening to the CD's of Jim Dale's narration made the experience fully real. He created little children, old women, giants, monsters, centaurs, and the hissing voice of the snakelike villain. Each voice so distinctive we came to recognize it instantly.<br/>As for the this the final book in the series:<br/>This is the last book in a seven book series that reads as one long fabulous story, a fantasy classic for all ages. It stands with JRR Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" in that it started out as a children's book: "The Hobbit" in Tolkien's case; "The Sorcerer's Stone" in Rowling's case, and both moved on quickly, as if of their own volition, to proceed away from a simple child's story and become a real world in fact, with humor, tragedy, love, and loss and a great overwhelming evil that the decent people are required to fight in order to keep their self-respect and honor. In each case, the sagas are works that can be appreciated by every age. The Harry Potter series gives us characters as real as any people we have known. They have faults and frailties, we have seen them grow and mature before our eyes through the series from childhood to late adolescence with all that entails, and we have come to really care for them. Though surrounded by magic, by potions, by fantastic animals, and unknown species, the main characters are deeply human. The world they live in is similar to our own, but has the added ingredient of magic, which all the major characters can use. However for much of the story magic is a sideline---very important, discussed and used continually--- but not as important as those very human qualities of friendship, love and trust which actually pull the characters through their losses, to fight their battles, and get them through the on-going great battle with almost overwhelming evil. The human qualities inevitably trump the magical ones in this world: The protective spell of a mother's love...sacrificing oneself for one's friends...those qualities and others are more powerful than spells, potions and wand-work. This, the final book is an excellent entry to the series. Every thread is tied up, and a surprising new subplot is introduced. There is much fighting and death, but it is for a cause well worth fighting for, which mirrors events of our times, and no death is for shock value or the wantoness of blood, gore and pain. The losses suffered by the good people in these last two books have been enormous, yet, again, suffered meaningfully for that great cause, and always appropriate and always mourned. As the book ends, one feels that this world exists and will continue. The work which is the seven part series will stand, I think, in the fantasy literature genre as a classic to be read and remembered. The word "heart" is used frequently, and "heart" is at the center of this world: love, friendship and self-sacrifice are themes repeated over and over, and are the touchstones of this world and what make it special. No recent great work has so unashamedly been so clear on that point, and that is what has drawn so many to it.
 I've been a fan of Harry Potter since about the grade school, back when the only books that had been published yet were the first three, when Potter's popularity was still on the rise, when Christian fundamentalists were still catching on to the horrifying idea that a "witchcraft" story was gaining popularity with children, and grade-school teachers were similarly catching on to Harry Potter being a pretty effective tool for getting kids to develop a liking for books. Indeed, that was how I discovered them: my English teacher somewhere in the 6th-to-8th-grade portion of schooling (where my Catholic school shifted to a high-school-like classroom and teacher shuffle to prepare students for the routines public school would involve) introduced me and several other students who were showing less interest and enthusiasm in the class to the Harry Potter novels, actually lending us her own copies of the first three books to get us reading. By the time the much thicker fourth volume, Goblet of Fire, came out, I was so in love in the series that its intimidating size was far more appealing to me than intimidating, like a larger bowl of rocky road ice cream might look appealing.<br/><br/>In the decade-and-a-half since, I've never let go of my love of Harry Potter, even if I have gone long stretches of time without keeping an active eye on the franchise. The recent revival of widespread Potter interest of the appealing-but-flawed sequel stage play ("Harry Potter and the Cursed Child") and an arguably-more-interesting-and consistently-engrossing prequel-sidestory-movie ("Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them") has prompted me to revisit the book series yet again, as well as replace my old worn-down hardcover copies with both the paperback box set and the eBook downloads from Pottermore's e-shop — which are cross-compatible with Kindle accounts and can be transferred over as identical files to the Kindle versions, by the way, even though Amazon doesn't count those files as purchases of the Kindle eBooks, but rather as separate account-exclusive items. Having checked on Audible, this series does not seem to be compatible with Whispersync for Voice no matter where you buy the eBooks as of yet, so audiobook fans who like to read the text while listening may wish to take note of that when deciding whether to buy a physical or eBook versions (this is possibly due to revisions having been made to the text for series consistency in the time since the audiobooks were recorded).<br/><br/>In-depth reviews of the individual books are perhaps best saved for each book's individual page on Amazon, so I will give only a broad-stroke review of the stories here — if you are considering buying the series as a complete box set, it's likely you've already read and enjoyed at least the one of the books. But for the uninitiated, Harry Potter is a series that follows a boy, Harry himself, across a seven-year series of adventures culminating in the return and subsequent war against Lord Voldemort, a terrible Dark wizard who wreaked horrors upon the magical and non-magical communities alike until his unexpected and inexplicable destruction when he killed Harry's parents and then attempted to kill Harry while he was still an infant. Harry, growing up with his non-magical ("Muggle") aunt and uncle, who cruelly neglect and emotionally abuse him, receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turns eleven, whereupon he discovers that not only is there a burgeoning community of witches and wizards living and hiding in plain sight in a seemingly-ordinary 1990s British society, but that he is famous among the magical community. They call him the "Boy Who Lived," the cause of Voldemort's disappearance and the end of his reign of terror. But as Harry enters the magical world and begins to learn about this new side of his life and the wonders of magic, he gets drawn into a series of perilous events that lead him closer and closer to his eventual destiny with each passing book, gradually revealing more of the truth behind what happened on the night Harry's parents were murdered and what led to it, among other things.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a fantastic series. One might be tempted to think it's overblown or over-rated by its enthusiasts. One would, in fact, be forgiven for taking that impression almost exclusively from the movies; they're enjoyable enough in their own right, but suffer problems of less-than-amazing adaptation and fluctuations in creative vision that make the film series feel somewhat disjointed and less-thoughtful than the books they're based on, and have the added problem of the younger actors and actresses often taking a few films to develop the skills to portray their characters naturally (an occupational hazard of a fantasy epic that relies on child actors, really). The Harry Potter novels, meanwhile, provide an arguably smoother introduction and, subsequently, a more fleshed-out experience in Harry's world, with the earlier, shorter books providing a comfortable and more "episodic" early portion that's great for allowing readers to get their feet wet, becoming gradually more involved and complex until the build-up culminates with the fourth and fifth novels, where the story goes all-in on characterization and worldbuilding detail, presuming the writer to be fully invested by that point, and keeping that level of maturity and intensity right up to the ending of the final volume.<br/><br/>It would be remiss of me to call this series perfect, don't mistake the five-star rating for that. J.K. Rowling certainly has her weaknesses as a writer, and it could be accurately said that the novels suffer from a bit of a bloating problem that surfaced around Book Five, where Rowling clearly had more power to say "no" to her editors (incidentally, this is also the point at which the American text just gives up at hiding away a lot of the Britishisms in narration and dialogue, and I will say the books are at least better for that much). This is a clear Your Mileage May Vary kind of point. I personally enjoy the tangential worldbuilding that comes out of it, and consider it worth whatever "bloat" occurs as a result. But then, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of the seven novels, and even for some avowed fans of Harry Potter, that book was too long and spent a little too much time on certain things. There's really no way to tell whether that will be a problem for you until you get there and either like it or don't like it. But what problems the Potter novels have are, in the grand scheme, just niggles. It all comes together in a really great way and in spite of the flaws, it's a really great series of books worthy of the classification of "epic."<br/><br/>But one thing that might surprise people unfamiliar with Potter is that this is not a fantasy action-adventure series. It's more of a mystery series coated in a gooey chocolate fantasy syrup. Harry Potter himself tends to fill the role of a combination Frodo Baggins figure and up-and-coming detective character, and the most important plot points are, regardless of who figures out or explains a given part of things, presented as mysteries. Action sequences occur and can be quite intense, particularly in later volumes, but this is not the story of a big, super-cool hero slaying dragons; it's a story of circumstance, figuring out the circumstance, and then reacting to the circumstance. Some readers seem annoyed by the fact that eleven-year-old Harry never matures in this series to a point where by the end of magical high school he's capable of going head-to-head in a duel with a Dark Lord with decades of extensive magical knowledge under his belt, but that is simply not the angle that this series goes for. My comparison of Harry to Frodo Baggins was not an idle-name-drop. Harry's role in this story is very deliberately that of the hero who stands strong against adversity but ultimately triumphs through low-key action behind the scenes of a conflict in which number other, more powerful or more experienced combatants command the bulk of the Dark Lord's attention. And, like Frodo (and his progenitor, Bilbo), sometimes Harry is helped by sheer circumstance, the timely and skillful intervention of one of his friends, or a combination of his own efforts plus those things. The series does give us a fairly clear picture of what an action-centric lead character in this universe might look like, and I think that's where a fair portion of reader disappointment with Harry's more subdued take on heroics comes from, but he is an eleven-year-old who eventually becomes a seventeen-year-old over the course of the story, contending with a villain who has fifty-plus-year lead on experience over him. I think I would have raised an eyebrow had Harry ever bested Voldemort in a straight-up magical fight.<br/><br/>As with everything, this series is something you should read for yourself if you're unsure. There's probably a copy available at your local library if you don't live in a particularly strict area with a stick up its rear about fantasy novels with magic in them. I recommend giving them a shot, and if Book One doesn't jive with you at first, sticking with it at least until the end of Book Two. This is a series that improves as it moves forward, each book adding new layers to the existing world by pacing its narrative in the same way a child might learn more and more about the real world as he or she grows into an adult, which is a large part of Harry Potter's effectiveness as a coming-of-age story. The reader, in a figurative sense, grows with Harry, as many of the original readers grew with Harry alongside the release of each subsequent book. This is as much a narrative tool as a consequence of readers aging as they read the books, because with very rare exceptions scattered through the series, the narrative is locked firmly into whatever it is that Harry Potter himself is seeing, hearing, saying, feeling, or thinking, and the reader's understanding of events and the world around him is often limited to what he knows or notices at any given time.<br/><br/>As for the separate editions of these books. I can't voice for the "Complete Collection" eBook specifically, since I bought the eBooks individually on Pottermore, but assuming the formatting for the Complete Collection is identical, then the digital set relevant to this review is well-put-together and smoothly formatted, just about the best way you'll ever experience Harry Potter digitally without buying the iBooks-and-iOS-exclusive Enhanced Edition eBooks available on Pottermore, which feature animated illustrations and the like. If you have an iPad or iPhone, that is the edition I recommend for digital consumption, but for standard Kindle and Android users, or people who like reading eBooks on PC, this collection and its individual-eBook versions aren't inferior to physical books in any sense other than not having a special font for chapter headings; the U.S. editions of the eBooks even contain the iconic chapter title illustrations, although not the original American cover art (the minimalist cover art of the eBooks makes for a smoother transition between colored screens and black-and-white e-readers, though).<br/><br/>The hardcover collection is one that I can't vouch for as a set, but having owned and read through the series in hardcover in the past, what I can vouch for is that the American hardcover editions are very nice to own. The box set for Hardcover may lack the text revision of the eBooks and more recent paperback printings, however, and while the chapter artwork and font for titles is something I prefer over the U.K. editions, it should be acknowledged that the American hardcovers are of a slightly cheaper construction than the U.K. editions, although also, paradoxically, they have a higher page count due to Scholastic's formatting choices (there are fewer words per page compared to the U.K. versions, and Order of the Phoenix has the formatting oddity of being the only book in the series with narrower margins and line-spacing, due to its much higher word count). Having researched this set, it should be acknowledged that the "trunk" is made of cardboard, so don't expect, you know, an extremely durable box or anything. It's just a stylized container for a box set.<br/><br/>As for the paperback box set, the purchase that prompted this review? It's fantastic. The American version with the characters riding a dragon, specifically: I'm seeing a lot of user pictures in this review second for completely different sets, and it seems there's a motley assortment of mixed sets in the marketplace listings, too. The box itself is quite sturdy and adorned with beautiful artwork by the cover illustrator, Mary GrandPré, depicting a scene from later in the series that puts me in the mind of the old R.A. Salvatore "Cleric Quintet" omnibus cover art (which features a similar scene by what I assume is coincidence). The paperback volumes themselves are of a nice quality that makes them both more durable and less stiff-feeling than some smaller, cheaper mass-market paperbacks, and they even feature raised lettering for the front cover titling, although the paper and print quality are noticeably lesser than the hardcover editions, feeling at a casual touch like the pages would be easier to damage both by bending and by splashing a few drops of a drink in the book's general direction, not up to the quality of some of the better-made paperback novels that I own. Even so, these are paperbacks that should be taken care of and kept for posterity rather than tossed about like a cheapy grocery store throwaway novel that you picked up on a whim during a food-shopping trip, though the thickness of books four through seven may make it difficult to avoid bending the spines.<br/><br/>Having checked certain passages in the books, I can also confirm that the paperback boxed set, bought new, should contained the revised editions of the text, as well, for as minor as those changes are to the overall experience (again, they're really just consistency tweaks).
 Got this set for my wife for 2018 Christmas.  It is just what I expected and my wife (HP fanatic) approves it!  Exterior art isn’t original but the story and pages are accurate.
 Teenager loves it. Author does a great job with the story.  Quality entertainment to read. Love the  hardback version for library  Collection.  Price is excellent.
 books r perfect but the box they come in is cardboard.. for the price I really thought they would have put a little more into the box. especially because the books are so big and heavy.
 A well thought out, high quality book set. Not meant as a descriptive review; I just wanted to add my name to the ever-growing list of satisfied purchasers. 😉
 The character development from the first book to the last is amazing.  JK Rowling nailed the idealism and belief that anything is possible of youth coupled with its self absorption.  And she nailed the understanding and regrets of age coupled with the wisdom of experience.  I read the series first with my two sons as they were growing up and have revisited it again and again.  As my sons have become men and expectant fathers I find new insights into the characters of the story.  JK Rowling has built a world that is magical and real.
 I started reading the Harry Potter series with my 8-year nephew...and I have to say I am hooked.  The second book in the series is just as good as the first.  HP AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS lives up to the high standards set by the first book.  JK Rowling does a great job of keeping the reader (no matter what age) excited about the book - constantly wondering what is going to happen next.<br/>Harry and his friends - Hermoine and Ron - are once again put in the middle of a mystery at Hogswort.  The book begins with an elf-like creature warning Harry not to go back to school...there is danger.  Harry does not believe the creature and decides to go back, after all danger at school is better than living with the Dursleys!  Once at school, strange things start to occur.  As the mystery unravels, secrets and questions left unanswered from the first book are revealed.<br/>I highly recommend this book to everyone - it is well written and keeps the attention of all readers.  I can't wait to start the 3rd book in the series!
 Geez! I am reminded of buying first the album, then the 8 track, on to the cassette and finally a CD. I love the illustrations but will be very happy when collection is done. So much fun. So much money. C'mon JKR!
 I fell in love with the remastered artwork done in this newer version of the Harry Potter series. To my disappointment, the binding of the books has already begun to peel and tear, even upon my first and very carefully done re-read of the series. If you are someone who prefers to keep their books in good condition I would steer clear of this set and opt for the original instead.
 These were a gift for our son and he really liked them. took awhile to get them but I was told what the delivery date d be so it wasn't a problem.
 Was very worried when I finally spent the money on this since I saw other reviews saying they had some issues with the print but my copies all arrived in perfect order. So pleased to finally own the series myself.
 I read this book in my late twenties and never could of imagined how the imagination and power of this book would change my life. It got me into the spirit of reading which I never did as a child and I've never looked back.
 It was a Christmas present for my daughter. She was very surprised and happy. It came fast happy with product it was not damage it was wrapped carefully, I was extremely satisfied.
 The pictures are awesome, even if the books are written for a little older age bracket than my kids they definitely enjoy looking at the pictures while I read it to them!
 beautiful pictures. provides a nightly activity for the whole family to read together. recommend to all those harry potter fans out there who want to share the delightful story with their young children.
 But I am glad I finally gave in and purchased the box set. The book covers are beautiful and the story has completely capitativated me. I understand why the series is such a beloved favorite.
 This complete series is even better as a reread.  The connections are easier and all the subtle aspects you missed on the first read come through.  Nothing better.
 I purchased this as a gift for my Potter fan! She's flown through all of them quickly! It's a great feeling when your kid falls in love with the same characters you did!
 I love having the Harry Potter series in these beautiful, large, and colorful books.  The illustrations are wonderful; I could not be happier with them and these books.  I am looking forward to reading these to my kids when they are old enough.
 If you're a Harry Potter fan, you HAVE to get these! They are wonderfully illustrated and the packing (cover, slip cover, etc.) are so wonderful. They truly take the story to a new level and I treasure them with all my heart.
 Harry Potter had finished his first year at Hogwarts. The second story began as the first. Harry was with the Dursley family. This time, however, it was only until Summer was over and the next school year began. While with the Dursleys, Harry received an unexpected visitor in his bedroom. It was Dobby, a "house elf" (think slave) of some wealthy family. Dobby begged Harry not to return to Hogwarts and gave many dire warnings. Failing that, Dobby took drastic measures.  This time, however, Ron's little sister, named Ginny, was in her first year at the school. She had a crush on Harry since she met him.<br/>** The second book is just as fantastic as the first. I understand a movie based on this story is due for release around November 2002 in the States. If the movie follows the book, it will be a smashing success! Filled with suspense, good vs evil, and school rivalry, I foresee many awards for the book and movie alike!<br/>Extremely Recommended Reading! NOT just for the younger readers! **
 It really really is. I am purchasing each of these as they come out so my daughter will be interested in them in a few years. I have to say, they are so beautiful I am considering ordering a second set (one for me and one for her!). If you are a Potter fan, you will LOVE the illustrated editions. Jim Kay really brings the books to life with his beautiful illustrations.
 Many top reviews speak of the gorgeous illustrations, which frankly made me order this box set over others. This was misleading. The paperback version I received has absolutely no illustrations other than the seven book cover art across the spines. There are even reviews that say paperback was purchased and had the illustrations. The product description makes no claims to illustrations to be fair - but so many top reviews do. I’d suggest that this is highly misleading as they are prominent in the page and state verified purchase clearly at the top. Can a seller hange the product that much and keep the original reviews? Seeems like it. Two stars only because I got what I ultimately wanted the box set of stories themselves. Big disappointment though.
 My child is in love with Harry Potter and he loves how this book has the illustrations and it’s a big book. Totally worth having in a book collection
 We are huge Harry Potter fans. We read them growing up so our parents have the books but my husband and I didn’t! So we bought the whole set so we can read again!
 Once I read "The Sorcerer's Stone", I had to immediately start reading "The Chamber of Secrets". I was hooked. Rowling's expert writing and vast imagination drew me in the world of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarths. This book, and the others in the series, are great works of literature that will be looked back upon as the 'must read' novels of this decade. They are humorous, intelligent, imaginative, and adventuresome.<br/>The "Chamber of Secrets" picks up where "The Sorcerer's Stone" left off. Harry is in his second year at Hogwarths. His aunt, uncle, and cousin still mistreat him. He still gets in some sort of trouble at every turn. And there is still plenty of magic and other mishaps. Something or someone is secretly turning students to stone at school. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine try to get to the bottom of it.<br/>As with the other books in the series, I recommend this book to both adults and children. It goes without saying that you should read "The Sorcerer's Stone" first though.

The books came in great condition and the cover art is gorgeous!! I love Harry Potter and I bought this because I lost my old bookset a few years ago whenever I was moving houses. This is an amazing replacement and it makes me so very excited to read the series again❤️
 As always, it keeps you wanting more. Rowling has an excellent execution in style that’s simple yet elegant and makes you care about the characters and envelopes you into their world. A future classic, I would say, and I do. Well done.
 The pictures in this book are so sumptuous that I couldn't just tuck it away anonymously on my bookshelf - instead it occupies pride of place on my coffee table. I bought a copy for all the kids in my family and they love it, its a must-have book for any Harry Potter fan.
 I finally got all seven Harry Potter books.  Once I started reading I couldn’t put them down.  Fabulous stories.  Loved all seven books.  From the first page I was drawn in and believed completely that there a whole magical world that I was never aware of.  Excellent writing and story telling!  These are definitely books that I will read over and over and over
 The box it comes in makes it even more worth it. The kid inside me loves everything about this. Books were in great shape. No dings on the box or books. I love it!
 Very happy with entire purchase. Item packed very well so no damage to books. Item exactly as described. Daughter extremely pleased with books. No issues with transaction and delivered as said.
 I’m getting in to Harry Potter late. I got all seven books on my kindle. Enjoy reading  these stories. Even as an adult, it’s a great mental escape for me
 Well, so far my son and I love the Harry Potter stories, but I’m giving it only 4 stars because of some of the pages having the ink smeared in them. You can see it in the photo I’ve attached.
 I’d never read Harry Potter before, until my friend and husband finally convinced me. The books are really nice and they’re enjoyable. Every page is a new adventure.
 All the books we're in fantastic shape they looked all new. The box set that the book were in was the only down fall of the whole set because it was in really bad shape so that's why I gave it a 4 out of a 5. If the box set part was in a whole better shape I would have given it a complete 5.
 One curious aspect of the 7th and final Harry Potter book is that, after 6 years of education at Hogwarts, the 7th year takes place largely outside of the hollowed halls of England's Magic School.  Luckily, that's just a detail - we still get a deep and extended plot full of the peripheral characters that makes the Harry Potter universe so fulfulling.  And yes, Minerva McGonagall still has a significant part to play....  As the story starts, Harry and his mates (i.e. Hermione and Ron) have decided to skip the last year at Hogwarts and concentrate on the quest given Harry by the late Hogwarts headmaster, Dumbledore.  The quest is well-known to Potter readers: Voldemort is unkillable because he's split his soul into several pieces.  Harry's job: find the remaining pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them, allowing the corporeal Voldemort to finally be destroyed.<br/><br/>The greater wizarding world is awash in mysterious disappearances/deaths as Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters step up their campaign to take over first the wizarding world and then the (non-magical) world at large.  In such a world order, non-magical beings would become 2nd-class citizens, and even magical people of non-magical heritage (e.g. Hermione) would be stripped of their rights.  Harry is target #1, declared by prophecy that only he or Voldemort (but not both) may live.  The book is mostly a cat-and-mouse game of Harry trying to find the Horocruxes containing Voldemort's soul pieces, and Voldemort trying to locate and defeat Harry.  In an inspired plot idea, Rowling has Voldemort pursuing a separate quest to Harry's, and Harry having to decide whether to attack/prevent Voldemort's ambitions at the expense of Harry's own quest.<br/><br/>There are battles aplenty, and deaths aplenty as well.  There have been rumours of Harry's death at the end of Book 7 ever since the series turned serious (around Book 3, probably).  Naturally I won't say whether Harry (or anyone else) dies in this review, but I will say that Rowling's writing throws enough twists and turns into the plot that you certainly believe it possible that Harry could die.  The plot twists are well earned, however - while there is one "deus ex machina" moment where something appears for no good reason other than "it's magical", all the other twists grow organically from this book and from the previous books in the series.  Rowling makes good use of her accumulated extended cast and background lore.  It makes this final book complete and satisfying, even if one or more of your favourite characters are doomed to end up in the graveyard at the end.<br/><br/>Thus, I think it's safe to say that Potter fans will largely be satisfied with the conclusion to the series (at least, those I've talked to have been!).  In the overall scheme of things, I still regard "Goblet of Fire" to be the best in the series.  This book falls somewhere in the middle - perhaps not as engaging as Prisoner of Azkaban or Half-Blood Prince, but certainly far superior to Order of the Phoenix.
 That was the third reading of the series.<br/>Time for the fourth.<br/><br/>I learn something new every time. Wonderful mind that woman !
 Perfect condition thank you!
 These books are a treasure, a destination I enjoy visiting from time to time. Better than the movies, rich detail, great characters, and plot to keep me reading from the first word to the last.
 Had to buy the kindle version. Best books out there; something for everyone who likes magic and has a sense of humor. Muggles need not apply.
 I do not know who Schoolastic Press hired to manufacture the hardcover version, but it is of the poorest quality and begin falling apart after 3 readings.
 The Harry Potter books are my favorite new reading find, and I can't say enough good things about them.  This latest in the Harry Potter saga is better than the second in the series (Harry Potter and the Chamber of  Secrets) and almost as good as the wonderful first (Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone).  It's somehow not quite as dark as the second book,  although parts of it are still too scary for bedtime reading to a six year  old.  It's perfect for 9-12 year olds, or for 41 year olds. Harry is back  at Hogwarts, beset by his old adversaries Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy,  and the wonderful returning cast of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione  Granger.  There are some delightful cheer out loud moments in the book--the  appointment new Care of Magical Creatures professor and the climactic  quiddich (sp?) matches.  J.K. Rowling continues her wonderful comic touches  with minor characters (the Divinations professor Trewlaney), her charming  offbeat world (the Knight Bus) and the emotionally powerful theme of Harry  learning more about his parents and their final struggle to save his life  by giving theirs.  There are new dangerous creatures, the menacing  Dementors, and the delightful mystery of Sirius Black and the mysterious  Grim--are they the sinister characters they seem, or does J.K. Rowling have  another plot twist and secret villain in mind, like in the first book?  You'll have to read this new one to find out, and it's a delightful read.
 I have the complete collection and enjoy reading them over and over!<br/>J.K.Rowling is a very talented writer and I look forward to any new books she brings us.
 Hey it’s Harry Potter. We all no how it ends even if you watched the movie so no need to comment on character development and so on...
 I was looking for a less bulky version of the 1st Edition American Harry Potter hardcovers I grew up loving. When I saw this poppy redesign in the original British English (“philosophers” stone, etc), I fell in love. They are beautiful, slim, and really don’t feel like kids books with the overly silly illustrations. Exactly what I was looking for, although some of my more diehard Potter fan friends don’t understand what I love about the style. I think they’re missing out.
 This review is for the books, not necessarily the packaging this particular set is sold with.<br/><br/>When the Harry Potter hype first started, I was a little annoyed. I just couldn't understand the big deal.  But, of course, I hadn't read any of the books yet.  In fact, it wasn't until book five came out that I finally started reading them.  I became interested after having seen a portion of the first movie while channel surfing.<br/><br/>It's so obvious it shouldn't be necessary, but as a practicing witch I feel compelled to mention that the "magic" practiced in Harry Potter is not real... obviously.  True magick is far more subtle and much less reliant on wands and special ingredients. But make not mistake:  The enchantment Harry places on the reader is quite real. It is impossible not to fall in love with Harry, Dumbledore, Hagrid.... all of whom feel so real to me.<br/><br/>Rowling's extensive knowledge of mythology is formidable and the moral lessons woven within the plot make this epic tale a definite read for children and adults of all faiths. It is all about the classic struggle between good and evil, right and wrong. Now we Christians who rail against the books haven't read them.  The architects of the bible dictates that all witchcraft is evil only because they didn't want any competition.  How is a priest walking through a congregation waving a censor filled with burning incense and reciting verses in latin any different than a Pagan burning incense and reciting a spell?  There's no difference.  Just that the Christians believe it is their divine right to practice magic and anyone else who does is evil.<br/><br/>I'm still in mourning after reading the last of the series.  These books were a big part of our lives (mine and my children's) for several years.  If you haven't read Harry Potter yet, please do.  If you're a parent, please don't deny your children this experience.  As time moves on, Harry Potter will be counted among the other classics in literature.
 I did not read the fine print and was joyously surprised to see Harry's travel trunk  in the delivery box with little lock, opening like a trunk to reveal all the books. Yes it's a heavy cardboard set up but so colorful and fun inside and out. Books wrapped in cellophane and pristine.  LOVED it all!
 I gifted this set to my grandson for an excellent report card. He is so anxious to finish his homework so he can have time to read a couple of chapters before bedtime.
 Not just for children. Absorbing, well-written and suitable for adults who want respite from complex, sometimes repugnant “adult” fiction. I like books like this for bedside reading.
 I returned to the entire Harry Potter series 14 years after first reading it to my son. I must say, reading it again, back-to-back in order was a great treat. I'm so glad I've gone back and done so.
 Reading the Harry Potter series to/with my kids. I love it just as much as the first time I read it, and the kids are enthralled! We all look forward to our Harry Potter time each day!
 Love having all the books in one collection. Okay, so there are some typos and line run-ins, but having them all together is worth it to me.
 Stunning, this is a must have for anyone who is a Harry Potter fan or a book collector! The illustrations are amazing, it's nice to be taken back into a world that so many have fallen in love with. Pre-ordered this book awhile back got it the day it was released, thanks for making me look cool Amazon, first of my Harry Potter friends to have it.
 This is my second time through whole series. It was even better than I remembered. Captivates from the first page of book one to the last page of book seven. I recommend it for everyone 's bucket list. It has brought joy to three generations of our family and in a few years we'll start on the fourth.
 I did not "meet" Harry Potter until January 2001 when I read the Sorcerer's Stone for an undergraduate college course dealing with forms of literature throughout our lives (from children's to adult books). I was intrigued by Harry and sought out his other books, eventually purchasing the set for myself.<br/><br/>Since Order of the Phoenix, I have been a die-hard Harry fan. Rowling has spun an enchanting tale that has obviously done some good since people are so willing to fight and argue about whether or not this or that happened after each subsequent book was published.<br/><br/>This final installment was much anticipated for me. I wanted to know if all of the rumors were true, and could this book possibly live up to the hype? For me, it did. It was everything to me a good book should be: some parts were funny, some parts were sad; there was bravery and cowardice.<br/><br/>The epilogue left something to be desired for me...simply because I wanted to know MORE than she gave. There were also several parts where I felt like she "hurried" across them without adequate explanation and I was again left wanting more details. Overall, however, I was glued to this book from the beginning and am sad that Harry's journey is over.<br/><br/>It was worthwhile and I think it speaks a lot that people all over the world have been so enraptured in "Harry-mania".
 Beautiful set of books. Bought them for my mother who is elderly but a huge harry potter fan. Well packaged and padded.<br/>Delivered to my door. Thanks!
 Cutest book set for any Harry Potter fan. The chest is absolutely adorable, complete with stickers and we couldn't be happier with it
 When I got the book I was so excited to look through it. As I was going through it, the book is already falling apart and I’m so disappointed. I got this as a collectors item and because I love HP so much so this is a let down. And on a full page illustration too.. also the whole book sounds like it’s cracking every time I turn a page.<br/>I’m still rating this 5 starts because the illustrations and everything else is amazing! Just wish this was better quality.
 It was with a poignant nostalgia that I received this book, the last of the Rowling's tremendous series. I remember clearly that first one that I opened. A little late to the game, I remember thinking I couldn't believe I was to read about wizards and fairies, a book obviously meant for sniveling 10-year-olds, but as I was under orders to read it from my wife (She Who Must Be Obeyed), I dove in, fully intending for the book to be the last of Rowling I ever read.<br/><br/>Now, years later, thinking back to every single book after that first one and the pleasure each brought during the glorious week (on average), it took to read, I can only say a heartfelt Thank You to J. K. Rowling.<br/>The seventh does not disappoint. In some parts, the pace slows a bit and one wonders how it will all end, like the characters themselves, come to think of it. Not to worry, it's on again soon and the reader is treated to action, toil and trouble, heady stuff that through it all finds Harry hardening, becoming an adult and ready to handle the challenges thrown his way as The Boy Who Lived; to top it all off, there's an ending that is just delicious.<br/><br/>I felt like at the end of a bountiful, never-boring feast lasting years: utterly sated and strangely, ready for more!<br/><br/>By the way, as a Fred myself, I can't say I understand why my namesake had to be the one who went, when everyone knows George was the lesser twin! ;-)
 I love this box set, the only downside is a few pages here and there are faded as if the press was running out of ink. It's still legible just not worth five stars
 J.K. Rowling manages to make the second book in her Harry Potter series just as interesting and creative as the first.<br/>The novel begins with some useful background information for those whose memorie may have gone fuzzy since reading the last book. Harry is enduring the summer with the Dursleys when he is visited by the house elf Dobby, who gets him into even more trouble with the Dursleys, and warns him not to go back to Hogwarts. Harry is rescued from his punishment of being locked in his room by Ron and his trickster brothers Fred and George in a flying car.<br/>Back at Hogwarts, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the vain and incabable Gilderoy Lockheart. He is the least of Harry's worries, however, when students start turning up petrified at Hogwarts. Rumors circulate that the culprit is the one who opened up the Chamber of Secrets. As fear on the Hogwarts campus increases, Harry and his friends set out to find out the truth about the Chamber of Secrets.<br/>In this book, Harry discovers a little more about his past, and we are also shown more character devolopment and fascinating glimpses into the wizarding world.<br/>This book, like the last, is a page turner, and a very satisfying read. My only complaint is the character of Dobby, whom I wanted to kick by the end of the novel, but then again, maybe that's the point. The ending of the novel wraps the plot up nicely, but still leaves readers longing for more stories about Harry and all the other characters.
 This book set was bought as a gift and it looks great, books are paperback and look very nice when in the casing.<br/><br/>I was at Barns &amp; Noble the other day and saw the same collection for $85.00, so it seems to be a great deal also!
 We have a set of these books and gave them as a gift to tweenage neice, as she has the complete set on her wishlist this Christmas. They are a lovely edition of this beloved series. Beautiful inside and out.
 And of course, in our society, if you can't read, you're screwed.  My nephew has long had problems reading, but, with some better education he has taken to these books, and LOVES them! I mean, for an almost-teen to tackle a 400 page book for a book report instead of something much smaller speaks well of this writer's ability to capture attention and write a compelling, meaningful, book.  And I as an adult (an engineer and a minister) have loved all four books! This is genius writing at it's best. Reminds me a lot of the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, or the Warner Brothers Cartoons, or Shakespeare - for the simpler minds, there's a wealth of entertainment and easy readability, and for the adults/more advanced minds, there's another level of humor and literary wonderfulness.<br/>Although choosing a "favorite" from the four books now in print is very difficult (they are all easily 5 stars), I would have to say that this was my second favorite, losing out to Book 4. But that's kind of like saying I prefer the filet mignon with 1.5 pound lobster over the prime rib with french onion soup and chocolate cheese cake for dessert. See what I mean?<br/>Do you have a child? Do you have a child within you? THEN READ THIS BOOK! I have read hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of childrens books and teen novels, and I think the Harry Potter books have everything a child wants - a hero who's "not mainstream", who has some secret powers he didn't know he had, who faces danger bravely but with fear, and who wins - but who wins not by destroying an enemy, but by overcoming a situation.<br/>And for you bizarro fundamentalist Christians who think these books are evil - please read your Bibles, stop listening to your ministers, find a church with intelligent people who actually understand the Gospel, and leave J.K. Rowling alone.  These books exemplify the Christian life in a way that puts them in a category above most children's writing.  I mean, please - if you want to teach moral, ethical behavior, these are wonderful books for it. And remember - I'm a minister, trained in this stuff, so I know what I'm talking about.  These books are not evil, they do not promote evil, they do not affirm evil, they do not glorfy evil. On the contrary, they glorify self-sacrifice, dedication and honesty to friends, honesty in the face of evil, courage in the face of evil, and most importantly, these books show our children (and us adults) how to face our fears with bravery, even while our knees are knocking and we wish drastically we didn't have to face it.  We can learn a lot from little Harry Potter, and I find it a shame that so-called Christians have decided to wage some kind of bizarre illiterate crusade against these books.
 Although the package was opened in the box nothing was damaged so couldn’t complain. Harry Potter’s box set 1-7 was brand new. I loved reading them as a kid. I had them on half paper books and some were hard cover. I still have them but they’re kept at my dads. I am grateful that this series, Harry Potter is still popular. I watch the movies a lot but, I always forget what more there was in the books. I bought these to keep reading for myself because the stories never get old.
 A word of praise to add to all the others but this one for Jim Dale, whose marvelous performances in audiobooks make Harry Potter and his world come alive. I'm a commuter in DC so the audio version is perfect for me but  parents may want to look at audio as the ideal version for their children  too. Dale's voice communicates all the wonder and wit of the text, with  faultless characterizations of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the whole crew. His  British public school accent is so well suited to the subject that it  actually enhances Rowling's wonderful work. His voice for Gilderoy  Lockhart, that grating fraud, is so perfect he should get an Academy Award  for Best Supporting Actor. It's like having a bedtime story read to  you--although of course you're not likely to fall asleep amid Harry  Potter's adventures.
 The last of the Harry Potter series wraps everything up into a nice bundle and has readers feeling glad that they have shared their lives with these characters.  This series has coined new words and literally changed the lives of so many readers throughout the world. It is a joy and a learning experience to see children of all ages exploring the written word and becoming captivated by it. It demonstrates the power of the written media, and it separates those people actually interested in proactive entertainment vs. the passive genre like movies.<br/><br/>All went well for Harry and his cohorts.  Things are more than they appear, and small seemingly unimportant details actually become pivotal.  Congratulations to JK Rowling for her imagination and fortitude!!!
 The hardcover books are very high quality!  The bindings, covers, and print are all excellent.  This would make a great gift for any Harry Potter fan!  I'm very glad I bought these.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I didn't read until I was 60 years old. Once I started I couldn't put them down. Bought the movie series and I'm watching that now.  I will read this series at least once per year.
 I chose five stars because I read straight through each book wanting to know what was going to happen next. I am a senior citizen and I truly enjoyed this series. I would read until my tablet would fall from my hands. I would recommend these books to everyone that enjoys such creativeness. Thanks to the author Rowling.
 I've been wanting to get this edition for a while, the illustrations are very nice, too bad they didn't make them with a hardcover too.
 I do not give away the plot, so I will not even begin to detail the story in this, or any other book review.<br/><br/>While this installment is a tad better written than the first, J. K. Rowling still exhibits a lack of literary style.  Her story is engrossing.  It draws you in and wraps around your mind as easily as her latest creature wraps snugly 'round the Slytherin Heir.  Fortunately, her style will obviously become more developed with the next few installments, as it has improved a bit with this one.<br/><br/>The addition of some supporting characters was lovely.  I particularly loved poor, sweet, tragic Dobby.  He was an unintentionally treacherous delight.<br/><br/>I was delighted with the subtle clues laid throughout this work, the overall dark feeling of danger invoked by the power of her words, the red herrings, and the implications of things to come.  This is, as I indicated at the beginning, superior to the first, if only marginally.<br/><br/>I anticipate the next work with great relish.
 Beautiful set and excellent for reading. My son turned 9 and he is an avid reader...would recommend this to everyone whose kids love reading. The content is also age appropriate.
 I recommend this book for outstanding contents and for bringing the reader in a journey through magic and exploring a young boys adventures! I have to admit this book may be a little tedious, but it is teaching to children to help expand their vocabulary. Just the suspenseful feeling of this story makes the reader want to five right in to figure out happens next!! I can't really see what's not to enjoy about this awesome book!! Bravo to J.I Rowling and the rest of the book series!! 😊
 I've read this book two or three times now.  Depending upon your definition of 'read'.  The first time, I was a little disappointed, but after thinking about the previous books and rereading this book, I got over it.<br/><br/>HP and the Deathly Hallows is awesome.  Yes, it plods along, but there is nothing there that can be cut.  And the action is as intense as any I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Character development has, in my opinion, always been JKR's strongest suit.  And in this book Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow up.  Especially Harry.  In the beginning of the book he is a boy, but the end he has become a man.  This transformation takes place both gradually, and in leaps and bounds.  I'd give examples and details but I don't want to spoil things for those who have not read this book.<br/><br/>I like how JKR handles the love story.  Harry's love for Ginny and Ron and Hermione's love for each other is always there, but there is nothing sappy about it.  Its a subtle thing of glances and actions and descriptions, with just a touch of dialogue.<br/><br/>I also liked how JKR handled the life and death struggle.  There are several deaths in this book.  But there is nothing gratitious about them.  Nor is there anything trite.  Each is sad in its own way.  I only saw one of them coming.<br/><br/>I do wish that we had seen more of certain characters.  I think the book would have benefitted from the Trio seeking outside help a little more often.  But other than that, I loved this book.
 I think this final year really pulls off with a bang.<br/><br/>The story goes by fast just like any Potter book. It answers lots of questions left off from the previous books. Some people say that there are some loopholes throughout the story but I suppose, those should be left for the readers' imaginations.<br/><br/>The book isn't kidding about deaths. There will even be some unexpected deaths so I warn some of you who are very connected with certain characters to brace yourselves. You will also know the fate of Snape and the truth behind his actions.<br/><br/>The middle part of the story may feel a bit well, slow, but that is a very good part on Rowling's behalf. ^_^  It shows character growth among the characters and is essential to their relationship.<br/><br/>There will be parts that will make you laugh, make you insane, and other parts that might make you go "ah-ha! That person's theory is correct!"  Depending on your guesses and speculations, I can only applaud a certain number of you for getting some things right. ^_0<br/><br/>The epilogue is probably, I have to agree, a little on the weak side. It's a bit cliched but that's alright. I'm grateful for the ending.  J.K. Rowling gave life to all these characters and the magical world of Hogwarts. She's enchanted millions of readers across the world, young and old, with her very own magic as well.<br/><br/>Throughout the 10 years of adventure, Harry Potter has gotten what he always wanted.  A family.  Not just in the book but from the fans as well. :D<br/><br/>Thank you J.K. Rowling for all that you've done,<br/>You've made Deathly Hallows number one on Amazon,<br/>Watch as the good guys battle the Death Eaters' rule,<br/>As Harry must come face to face with You-Know-Who....<br/><br/>Note: Since my last review was taken off probably due to a stated reference to a spoiler (in my comment), I apologize for that. ^__^  Although, it was just a gratuity poem which didn't really reveal much, I should've put a spoiler warning anyways.
 With the movie coming out soon, I had wanted to reread the book before I saw the movie. I was nothing but amazed at the book yet again.<br/>J.K. Rowling has way to take the reader and pull you into the world of Harry Potter and his friends.<br/>Harry Potter is back at Hogwarts, but before he left for Hogwarts he got a warning that it might not be a good idea to go back, but Harry doesn't listen. As soon as they get to Hogwarts strange things start happening. The students at Hogwarts are scaried of what might happen.<br/>Harry and his friends set out on a mission to find out what is causing all the strange things. As they look further into the history of the events they find more out and eventally they figure it out.<br/>The second book in this series is just as good as the first one. Having read all the books before I know the rest of the books are just as good.
 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" culminates Rowling's wonderful series, but I wish it didn't.  I have loved every book in this series; and it makes me sad that no more about Harry Potter will be coming to us from Rowling's genius.  The books in this series have been growing darker and scarier with each installment.  This last installment continues the trend.  It made me sad to lose so many beloved characters to death in the Harry Potter series; but the fact that some of our favorite characters must die in the war against Voldemort does lend reality and credibility to the story.  I would like it if Rowling now ventured further into the back-stories of some of the other characters in Harry Potter's world -- like maybe Dumbledore.  We get glimpses of Dumbledore's youth in "Deathly Hallows" -- enough to pique my curiosity and whet my appetite for more.<br/><br/>I have only one slight criticism of this novel:  The epilogue rubbed me a little bit the wrong way.  Rather than telling us that Harry and his surviving friends lived happily ever after, I wish Rowling had ended this episode with the victory over Voldemort, and would now go on to tell us about Harry's further adventures with magic in future episodes.  But I suppose all authors get tired of their characters -- even if the rest of us don't!
 Pros:<br/>Big, heavyweight, hardcover, colored illustrated edition.<br/>Beautiful illustrations on almost every page.<br/>A wonderful fantasy story involving witches, wizards, and other otherworldly characters.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>None.
 The books looked old and Had some stains in some of the pages ,but it did say they were used so , you get what you pay.
 Love the illustrations. I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she's loved it. Only downside is that they are large and hard to carry, but once you get used to it, it's fine.
 My son loves the series and I’d give the series itself 5 stars, but this particular edition seems to have a flaw with one of the bindings. Book 5 completely fell apart when he was only about 100 pages in... The binding started ripping apart, which is making it really hard to read.
 Talking spiders, giant snakes and a Snape. What more could the Heir of Syltherin want? Except Harry Potter. Whatever you do Don't Open the??????
 The cover art, when the books are aligned, creates a beautiful mural of Hogwarts.  More importantly, the binding and printing of these volumes is superior to the way the older paperback copies were manufactured.  Highly recommended.
 I love all the Harry Potter books. I'm very glad my daughter loves it, too. Recommend to all wanting to introduce their children to the wizarding world.
 He is really into reading now that he is in the 5th grade and loves chapter books. He could not wait to start reading them.
 She certainly has a wonderful way with words that draws you into their world. Each new book is more enjoyable than the last.
 Obviously these are great books! Shipping was fast and came in good shape OTHER than, ONE of the books had a small tear on the spine. Not a huge deal though!
 Great story, made even better by fantastic illustrations. I purchased the first three Harry Potter books in this set, with the hope they continue with the last four. I originally thought to keep these as collectors’ items, but I can’t wait to start reading these books to my baby. :)  I’m sure she will love them as much as I do, and the photos are sure to be a big hit!
 My son adored the trunk storage the books came in. It sits nicely on his shelf so the books are both functional and beatiful.
 I read through these about every two years!!!, But LOTR will always be my #1 favorite escape from the real world. Rowling's story is so enthralling spanning 7 books, so rich in detail that in makes you feel apart of the story. But Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien ranks one in the fantasy category in my list. But J.K. Rowling is #2
 Loving the series as much as the movies. So glad I broke down and decided to read them. Can’t wait to buy the next book!
 The book set is great, and arrived as expected. The box that houses the set, however, was damaged. One of the side handles was torn out and crudely taped back on, and the box itself (which is decorated to look distressed) was actually scratched and bent. The book set is perfect, but paying the premium for a cheaply made and damaged box was a shame.
 My granddaughter was reading the books so I joined in.  We can discuss the books and compare them to the videos.
 I purchased this set of Harry Potter books for my nephew. His excitement at receiving them was equal to or more than his excitement over his electronic gifts which did my 64 year old heart good.
 This is a masterpiece of printing.  I'm not going to bother reviewing the book, because you should know it and its quality simply by living in the 21st century.  This edition is beautifully laid out, and the illustrations add to the storytelling.  It is an improvement on an already wonderful children's book.
 Read the whole series in nine months. They were a great read, cleared up a lot of questions left by the movies.
 I was hooked on the first book after a few pages.  I just wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  Now, I'm hooked again.  J. K. Rowling takes us back to the wonderful world of Hogwarts (via a flying car) and allows us more adventure with young Mr. Potter.  The imagination and creativity of the author are ever present and as addictive as the first book in this series.  I have the feeling I'm gonna be a Harry Potter junkie.  This book, as well as the first, if excellent reading for both children and adults---don't let anyone tell you otherwise!  After establishing the story in the first book, Rowling can now plunge us into more storylines with action.  If you enjoy top of the line entertainment, if you love to read, if you just enjoy having fun---this book is for you.  Pick a comfortable seat and enjoy the ride.
 This was a Christmas present for my 10 year old grandson.  He was so excited that he started reading before he opened the rest of his presents!  He loves them!  He told me that there are so many details that the movies didn't include.  Now his brother, my 8 year old grandson is beginning to read them also!  He also loves them!  It's hard to get the boys to stop reading!  I'm extremely happy with this purchase!
 My kids have been Harry Potter fans for 20 years! It was fun to get them these illustrated versions as adults. The books are beautiful and seem to be of good quality.
 My whole family loves the set. My complaint was the amazon bar code sticker was placed right on top middle of the case set. Could not remove the sticker, totally ruined this beautiful collection. :(
 Finally!  The final chapter in the exciting Harry Potter adventures.<br/><br/>This book was a fine addition to the Harry Potter series.  And while I would love to be able to give this book 5 stars, it falls short on too many levels to warrant it.<br/><br/>This book turns the series on end.  Too many characters do almost a complete one hundred and eighty degree turn from where they have been in every book up to this point.  While I'm all about plot twists and turns, the inconsistencies certainly rack up in this final book.  Since I don't want this review to ruin any secrets for those that have yet to read the book, I'll just point out a few of the inconsistencies in general.  The Deathly Hallows never function as she describes them.  The explanation of the wands is so confusing, that even my friends and I can't exactly figure it out.  And she even changes her stance on the Horcruxes (not a lot, but enough to be in direct opposition to the last book).  The book also has a noticeable lull in the middle, which ruins the fast pace that is set by the beginning and end.<br/><br/>This is also the darkest of all the Harry Potters, which is actually kind of a nice change.  It shows the characters to be in a "real" world, where there is loss and pain.  It also puts the three main characters in a position to really grow and be fully fleshed out.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling definitely writes a great book.  I have enjoyed all her books, including this one.  They are a great, easy, enjoyable read that keeps you coming back for more.  Her characters are very accessible, a person can definitely identify with their struggles.  Her plot twists are unique and believable.  Her stories are filled with lush characters and "magical" places.<br/><br/>Inconsistencies aside, this is a wonderful read.<br/><br/>So jump on your broom, and take Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows out for a spin around the Quidditch Field!
 Our grandchildren have enjoyed reading the entire set or will be reading all of them. Fun way to keep them reading over the holidays.
 Great value to gift a great book series.  I bought this for my 7 year old daughter because the price was perfect.  She is starting on book one and will grow with them.
 Thanks to having had children of a perfect age when the first Harry Potter was published, I've been a Harry Potter fan since most people never heard of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The 7th and final book in this series was every bit as enthralling as the previous ones, and, as a writer and poet myself, I cannot get over my amazement at the imaginative achievement demonstrated in these books.<br/><br/>After reading to page 544 in 10 hours Saturday, I completed the book yesterday evening, and have spent an equal number of hours between readings and since remembering the vast number of characters, developments, personal relationships, magical surprises and well-turned phrases packed into these books.<br/><br/>Entirely apart from the delight the books have given to me, and our entire family, I've also found them an encouraging analogy for our troubled times. It is possible to triumph over adversity and evil. And at this particular moment, I can only hope that truth and reality, will for once, mirror art.<br/><br/>Yes, art. It's a brilliant series, and it's given some brilliance and immeasurable enjoyment to me in all 10 years since the Potter adventures began.
 A year has passed, and Harry is on his way back to Hogwarts.  But before he leaves, a mysterious creature arrives and warns him about dangers that will occur if he returns to Hogwarts, but Harry pays no attention to him and goes back to school.  When he gets there, mysterious things begin to happen.  Threatning messages start to appear, and one of them claims that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened, but those who know about the Chamber don't believe it to be true.  Now Harry and his friends must solve the mystery to the Chamber, because whatever has been released is turning Hogwarts students into stone statues, and Harry is hearing strange, bodyless voices.  This book is darker than the first one, and it delves into Harry's and Voldemort's pasts.  This is another winner written by Ms. J.K. Rowling.
 Since this was a used set I was concerned there would be some scratches on it that would not play back well.  I just finished listening to the entire set and it played back perfectly!  It also came on time as promised.
 I read the Harry Potter books a long while ago and really wanted to re-read them so I've bought the set all over again. Even though I'm old I loved these stories. They kept me quite captivated.
 My daughter is a huge fan of the series and just loves this book. It is sturdy and visually appealing. The pages are glossy and vibrant. It’s become a treasured item in her collection.
 What hasn't already been said about Harry Potter? Reasonable price. Quick delivery. My kids just devour these.
 Gave as gift.  All books in new condition, the storage box was a huge hit, and seems sturdy enough.  I liked that it was shipped in it's own outer box, simply wrapped it up.
 As a middle-aged mother, school counselor, and Jane Austen fanatic, I never thought I would be obsessed with a series of books written for children.  Granted, I love children's literature and use books extensively in my counseling programs but Harry Potter has grabbed my heart and is constantly tugging it!  Books become classics when they not only stand the tests of time, but when they can appeal to all ages.  These Harry Potter Books become classics the day they become published!  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is another powerfully written, dear and sweet novel about the adventures of Harry Potter and his two best friends.  This book is about how good wins over evil but the exploits that the children get involved in are so delicious, so compelling, that only the hardest hearts would be able to put down these books.
 Misleading title. It says boxed set, But In reality it doesn’t came in original box. Very disappointing!
 Used and written in
 I've seen the movies numerous times, but wanted to see the whole story/adventure that the movies had to skip over.  I'm loving it so far.
 Magic, wonders, mystery... highly recommended to all HP fans and of course is so much better than the movie!
 I know that most people would say because it is the last book it is the best.  But, this is not the case with this story.  This is the best book because I believe there were a lot more feeling and character growth and development in this story.  I wont give away anything about the story or the future of Harry Potter.  This book (verses all of the previous stories), you are watching as young adults are trudging their way into adulthood.  There isn't any teenage annexed or teen pressure.  This story is said to be "slow" at the beginning, mostly because there isn't any "action".  I would whole-heartedly disagree with this assessment.  The first half of the book is the character development that I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Loads of people write reviews of the Potter stories.  Everyone has their likes and dislikes for the stories and characters.  J.K. Rowling has done her best work with this story.  She has brought all of the previous questions; plot twists and characters back for one final party.  There is no way you could read this book first or without the others, but once you get to it - I'm sure it will be your favorite.
 While this is not the best book in the whole series, it is a fantastic second book.  We learn in this book that evil has more than one way of surfacing, that Harry has special talents that few people have, and that Harry can handle himself under some intensely scary and difficult situations.  This book tells you that the series can go farther.  The book gets a bit darker, a bit scarier, and begins to reveal more about the darker side of the wizarding world.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that if you've read the first one you should go ahead and read all of them.  Having said that, you may need more motivation.  It's quite a commitment, after all, and in some ways the first book was a bit "oh, that's why it's children's lit."  I'm past 30.  I love the whole series, have read every book many times, including in other languages. I'm here to let you know that this book and the others in the series will have you wondering, "Is it possible?" Rowling (Pronounced "Rolling") writes so well, so convincingly, so truly, that you wonder if maybe there is some kid, perhaps with his name changed to protect his privacy, who has magic in him, goes into another world, and is the predestined hero of the whole world.  More so, the writing has you wondering, "Is there magic in me?"<br/><br/>It's a great book. I also recommend the audio version.  Jim Dale's rendering of all the accents and speech patterns of the various characters is superb.
 Following the catastrophic events in the previous book, The Half-Blood Prince, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine embark on the quest that Dumbledore gave them.  They must hunt down and destroy the remaining horcruxes, the items that Voldemort placed parts of his soul into.  They know that this is the only way to defeat Voldemort for good.<br/><br/>This installment is by far the most intense and suspenseful, with no relaxing until the very end.  And the final, climactic battle scene was inspiring.  I avoided spoilers and all hints about the book, so I'll avoid any details here.  But this was definitely my favorite of the seven books. Besides being so suspenseful, it was extremely emotional and epic.<br/><br/>With many surprises, good and bad, I literally could not put the book down and finished it in less than a day and a half.  While I love the movie adaptations, they simply cannot compare to the depth that the books have.  I teared up at the end. And finished the book with a sigh and a smile.  Rowling has created a wonderful classic series that will continue to entertain for years to come.
 PROS: I really enjoyed this conclusion to the Harry Potter series. It was lots of fun. I read it in about 48 hours. The climactic scene was great! Rowling brings everyone back into action: it's like seeing a host of old friends. Molly Weasley has a GREAT moment.<br/><br/>I don't always love Rowling's prose (take a look at how many adverbs she uses when her characters talk: Harry said testily, Hermione said prissily, Ron said lazily), but she has created a wonderfully detailed, colorful, exciting world and has developed characters that I care about (even when I don't always like them). I couldn't put the book down.<br/><br/>CONS: I got a wee bit bored during a certain section, but frankly, the characters themselves were bored during that section, so I suppose it's fitting. At one point near the end, I couldn't figure out how a certain character had gotten a certain item, but upon rereading, it made sense.<br/><br/>Some of my minor gripes are well articulated in Lev Grossman's TIME blog entry entitled "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The Spoiler Post. This Post Contains Major Major Major Harry Potter Spoilers. Minor Ones Too" (July 23, 2007 - available on-line).
 Great looking set, arrived quickly and in good condition. The box is cardboard and seems sturdy,  but as its for a 9yo, I'm going to reinforce the inside.
 Exactly what I expected, all of the books! They are in a beautiful box that helps to keep them all together on my shelf. There was no damage or even bent pages. Highly recommend if you’re looking to get the entire set together!
 I started with Harry Potter books 4 years ago, when the first movie came out. Rowling has been getting  better in the story telling and details on characters and the scene.<br/><br/>This book is the best among all 7 in respect of story telling. It starts with a bang and keeps the momentum. There are no useless chapters. Every scene or a situation is tied very closely to the story. Every page either answers your questions from previous books or creates new questions.<br/><br/>The book explains to us that even a good person can have some skeletons in his closet from past. Whether they are relavent  to today is the question.<br/><br/>The characters have already been built in previous books. In this book we see them at their peak. Ron, Hermoine, Harry, Weasleys and all other important characters have a significant role in the story. Ron , as usual, a little unsure of himself, always the second best, excels in his role. We see Hermoine mature further. Harry shows big leadership qualities and also tells us that sometimes even leaders make mistakes.<br/><br/>Voldemort shows his power and his weakness.<br/><br/>Harry meets all his enemies. The book is full of action and does not bore for even a second. I hope the movie makers this time make a 4 hour long movie to do any justice to this book.
 Click try sample awesome to me  woo hoo awesome awesome e awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
 I ordered this as a gift and it came quickly and in excellent condition.  The child love it!  The pictures help the story come to life!
 The one I bought did NOT come with the decorative box and given that each book had a price tag from a different store....it shouldn't have been listed as a box set....just the book series...
 Got them as a gift for my son who after reading them perhaps 20 or 30 times now I will probably have to buy another set one of the best gift Investments I have ever made
 Well bound, and beautiful.  Paid about $52, which was a great price.  My son was thrilled to have his own set.
 Gave as a gift to my Harry Potter fan.  He loved it and the pictures made it even more interesting.  As a teacher, I approve of all books that children will read. :)
 Wow!  This book is wonderful!  It will grab your attention from the beginning, and won't let go until the very last page.  Doesn't matter how late at night it is, or how early you have to be up the next morning, you  won't put this one down.  I'm in my mid-20's, and I still couldn't put the  book down.  However, word of warning to parents of younger children, this  book is much more intense, and much scarier than the first Harry Potter  book. This book may not be suitable for younger children (9 or under).  Towards the end of the book, Harry encounters hordes of spiders...one of  the size of an elephant!  Yikes!  Then, the battle between Harry and the  20-foot serpent occurs.  It is extremely well written, but may frighten  younger children.  With that said, it is an excellent book, and I highly  recommend it (for anyone over the age of 10).
 The stories are excellent but the book binding is sub-par; it makes the pages pucker.
 We are reading this book has a bedtime story to our children and they love the illustrations.
 Came well double boxed. It has all 7 books wrapped new inside of Harry's chest. Looks great!
 I decided to reread the series after reading from High School through College. It's been 10 years and the first full read through for me. I'm 4 months pregnant and it's been a great thing to read out loud to the baby (and kitties who love story time). These themes are eternal: Love, courage, dedication, family and friends, equality will deliver you from the fear of oppression. It's truly one of the greatest stories ever told :)
 Not much need to discuss this publishing phenomena. I purchased the packaged set in November of 2001 and have since read it several times. I have the same tingle of anticipation for Volume 5 as I did 40 years ago while waiting for the next Hardy Boys Mystery to be published. I do caution you that Scholastic has been quite slipshod in the production of these books. Volume 2, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is missing an entire chapter. I only discovered it after viewing the movie and seeing the dueling club scene on screen but did not remember having read it in the book...Heaven only knows what other portions are missing.<br/>Note-Amazon.com was marvelous in replacing the defective set with a new one even though the purchase was a year old.  Great customer service.
 I am an absolute fan of Harry Potter, I love the original classic paperback version and I 'm very excited to give this to my niece.
 Of course these books are great... I have paper copies of them all, and have read them over and over. It is nice, now, to have them all on my Kindle.  Lol..  so much more portable!
 Arrived on time in good condition. Over the years the copies we bought as they came out have been lost, scattered or lent out so I wanted to but the collection to have. As advertised.
 Bought is used, should have gone for new.  Lost over a 1000 books in a house fire.  Miss them.  It will take years to replace them.
 I think there are very few people on this planet that haven’t read or watched Harry Potter, but for those select few who are reading this for the first time, this is a fantastic read and an amazing series!! For me it’s the second time through since this came out so it’s more of a refresher since the movies tend to be more of a condensed version.
 Books were in good shape and boxed nicely. Read these when they first came out many years ago. Wanted to reread.
 A Third generation reading the series. He's 8 and is excited to read about Harry every day.
 Great value on a good series of books. I bought them for my 7 year old and he loves them.
 I just got into the Harry Potter books a month or so ago (yes, I'm late on the bandwagon). Overall, I loved all the books, even if book 6 was a bit slow and boring.<br/><br/>I liked this last book a lot and it had the right amount of action and story development to keep me entertained throughout. We learn a lot about Dumbledore and can see each of the characters growing into their own as adults. There are serious issues though, that prevent me from giving it a full five stars.<br/><br/>I don't mind that characters had to die, but some of the main characters didn't even get their own death scene. Also the fact that Rowling killed off certain people "because she wanted an orphan from the war" was beyond stupid; these and other deaths were unneeded (seriously, leave the hot guys alone already). I also dislike what she made Draco into.<br/><br/>Also, the epilogue is pathetic. While I appreciate the fact that she included an epilogue in the first place (because I am anal about knowing the final ending), it is nowhere near complete. She leaves so many questions unanswered and the epilogue creates even more questions. I kind of wish that instead of the epilogue, there was an additional chapter that described the immediate aftermath of everything or summarized the next year or two. I hate loose ends and can only hope that, if she chooses to make an 'encyclopedia' as she has hinted at, she will take care of most of these unanswered questions.
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the adventure known as Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts.  On a side note, do you ever wonder what is happening in the lives of the other students?  How is it that only Harry, Ron and Hermoine notice the subplots?  I wonder what life is like at Hogwarts for people outside of Harry's circle.  Enough of that though.  During Harry's first year, he learns about his past, starts playing Quidditch and develops an arch-enemy, Darco.  After Harry's room is hexed in a Quidditch match, Harry and his friends begin to think Professor Snape is trying to steal what is being guarded by the school and kill Harry.  But Harry and his friends are in for a surprise when they discover it is another professor who is attempting to steal the Sorceror's stone for Voldemort.<br/><br/>The second book begins much as the first, with Harry having to escape his muggle family to attend school.  But Harry can't even make it to school without "borrowing" a flying car from Ron's family which lands him into trouble before the year even starts.  Harry and his friends encounter a force that hates muggles, and must stop what is in the chamber of secrets before it kills.  These books are entertaining and a pleasure to read.  I recommend them to everybody.
 At the time of this review many have not yet finished reading the book, and no one wants the plot given away. Therefore I will comment only generally.<br/><br/>As one of those readers who has followed Harry Potter from the beginning to the very end, I am very satisfied with this conclusion to the Harry Potter saga. The reader has watched Harry mature through each of the books until he reaches a point at which he has matured beyond the level usually achieved by a seventeen year old. While there are a few touches of the humor of the first book, each of the books has become progressively more serious, and this culmination of the Harry Potter approaches the epic nature of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling is a great storyteller, and she has tried very hard to wind up all of the loose ends of the Harry Potter saga in this book. I like this the best of all her books, and I hope that she will continue to write, although it is clear that she doesn't want to write more about Harry. Rowling has deepened the meaning of her story and she has achieved a more resonant work in this book than in all of the past books.<br/><br/>Thumbs up on this book!
 Good storyline, keeps the reader engrossed in the story, but I had a good idea how it would end, throughly enjoyed it.
 Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for a second year of wizarding education.  He has a few mishaps even getting to the school; by now the wise reader pays attention to the small episodes that can have significance later.  Harry's first-year friendships with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have solidified.  They'll rely on those bonds to deal once again with the truculent Lord Voldemort.  This time the school is plagued by a series of mysterious attacks against some of the school's muggle-borns, assaults that literally petrify the victims.  The mystery is compounded by Harry's hearing a murderous voice that others cannot hear, and the appearance of an enchanted diary that spills secrets that imperil favorite Hogwarts characters.  Moreover, Harry is tormented by the thought that maybe he was supposed to have been a Slytherin--indeed, that he may be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin!<br/><br/>The book includes many references to the first volume, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, to help the reader who's either forgotten key aspects of the first story or who's never read it.  The latter reader is better off going back and reading the first volume.  In addition to many returning characters, this volume introduces important new characters including Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's equally sinister father; Ginny Weasley, the youngest of the many Weasleys to go to Hogwarts and who's besotted with Harry; and Gilderoy Lockhart, a famous wizard author whose braggadocio seems to embarrass everyone but Hermione.  The story generally is written well, and becomes ever more suspenseful as it nears the conclusion: my daughter begged me to keep reading beyond her lights-out time.
 I've been eagerly looking forward to this book and dreading it at the same time.  The Harry Potter universe is fascinating and I hope that JKR recuperates from this book soon and starts the Wizarding Encyclopedia.  There was a lot of action in this book, and a lot of loss of beloved characters. Some of the losses were dealt with so quickly, that the impact wasn't immediately felt.  Perhaps this is because they were still in danger at that point.  I don't want to spoil the book for those who haven't read it yet, but I really loved how some of the "fuzzier" witches and wizards stepped up to the plate.  I'm talking to you Neville, Molly Weasley and Professor Trelawney.  I also hope the next 2 movies include Bill and Fleur.  As for the epilogue, it answered some questions, but left a lot of others unanswered.  I saw an interview with JKR where she said she had trimmed it down, but she still has all her notes.  Hopefully, her encyclopedia will let us know who's running Hogwarts, where all our favorite Gryffindors ended up (besides our heroic trio) and how the Wizarding World is faring in this century.
 Just like others, (this story is probably getting old, I know) I never really cared for Harry Potter. That was until I realized I had way too much time on my hands being home from college, and decided to give the series a shot. Instantly I was hooked and I mean it's true that you don't really know until you actually pick up the books to read them. I constantly laugh out loud or find myself tearing u- wait no.. I mean never tearing up, but honestly the series is AWESOME so if you're looking into getting the series just to read it (I'll worry about the collectors box in a second) this is an absolute must buy, even as paperback... however hardcover is where it's at ^.^<br/><br/>The packaging, or "chest" for the hardcover series is excellent. Yeah, it may be cardboard however don't picture this piece being as flimsy as everyone upset by it makes it sound. It's sturdy enough to hold the books and thats its exact purpose so no one should be complaining. Besides it being sturdy, it looks actually... beautiful. I was expecting much less artsy detail but it has a nice tattered look that really makes it a great piece of work.<br/><br/>Long story short the series is excellent and so is the box, base your judgement off the ratio of the 4 and 5 star reviews to those who rated 3 and below. Honestly you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Final thought, the last 3 books (5,6,7) when I went to Barnes&amp;Nobles cost me $100.42 (I think, some odd cents off possibly O.o). Think... this box set will cost you 10$ more than that, AND you get the first FOUR books plus a nice case to keep them organized all in one spot. Honestly I should change the title to, "You get more than what you pay for" however with how much you're already saving on the series alone, you can't expect a nice hard plastic or wooden case. Be thankful you can get the whole series... hardcover... with a collectors box... all for just $114 period. (or around that price, you get what I mean)<br/><br/>P.S. I returned those three books instantly when I saw this on Amazon!. Always helps to do the research BEFORE you buy -.-<br/><br/>Hope this helped! You won't regret this purchase!
 Bought this for my daughter for her birthday this was one of the better prices on  here she loves the set
 My belief is that the Harry Potter Books are quality reading. So, it doesn't matter how the books really look like... The most important thing are the contents. Anyway, beware that you are buying PAPERBACK editions. Don't expect beautiful hard covers, even though the drawings are great. The box in which the books come is very pretty and useful. And let me assure you that this is the best way to get all first 5 books, mostly for people like myself who live outside USA and it's not easy for us to buy books in english. You won't regret it (and a plus, the books are pretty much cheaper if they are bought in this way).
 Gave the set Harry Potter books to my 10 year old granddaughter and see loves yhem!!
 Fabulous narration by Jim Dale.  Never read HP series, but audiobook made it so that I can listen to/from work.  I hate that it will soon be ending.
 I can't believe I never read these when I was younger. I'm 35 and have been really enjoying this series.
 I have been a true Harry Potter fan for 6 years now. These books are GREAT. Harry Potter books are fantasy books about wizards and their wonderful world and about a young boy who falls into a world of magic and adventure. Harry Potter is full of bravery and is one of the best characters I have ever had the pleasure of running into. He is surrounded by good and the bad but he faces it all with courage in his heart and love by his side. Harry Potter Books have turned millions of children into readers and never fail to be exciting, sad, and funny. I have fallen in love with the characters that J.K. Rowling presents in Harry Potter Books and envy them for their unique and realistic personalities. If you haven't read these books you are positively insane and you must immidiately read them or be shot. These are the greatest books ever written and I applaude J.K. for her writting that always ceases to fall past perfection.
 Okay, so I am not in junior high. I am a 27 year old mother of three and I am now a fan of Harry Potter. I got into it on the advice of my 40+ year old sister in-law. She gave the books rave reviews. Although I am not yet finished with Book 2 (I still have yet to read Book 1) I am amazed at the fact that does not seem like a children's story. True, it deals with the trials and tribulations of the average preteen, but the way Rowlings writes, she makes you forget that her books were written with children in mind. The plot is as good as any adult thriller in the sense that it keeps you guessing and looking for more. Once I finish with Chamber of Secrets, I will backtrack to read Book 1 and then continue on with the series.
 When I purchased this book set it was labeled as "New", however, I have come to realize that this was untrue. Some of the books have clear marks of not being new. Including folded pages, stains, and worst of all, I have had to scrape things off of multiple pages in one of books. Although I can't really tell what they things are I assume someone else read these books while eating.
 I read and loved all the Harry Potter books.  My granddaughters are starting to read them (they are 9 &amp; 10). I bought the paperbacks because I was afraid the hard backs would be too heavy for them. I like the looks of this  New set.
 I love this! I enjoy the harry potter series and reading to my daughter. Baby books get old and we both can enjoy these.
 If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you won't want to miss the audio CD version read by Jim Dale. As he has done with the previous six stories, Jim brings vibrant character voices and great sense of style to his reading of the seventh story of the famous boy wizard, Harry Potter. Dale's consistent performance makes it easy to know which character is speaking, and his performance is top-notch.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter books are my favorite audio CD's, and that is because of Dale's talent and performance abilities.<br/><br/>The Audio CD is perfect for listening to in the car or on your MP3 player (ripping to MP3 format is required, but can easily be done with iTunes or other software). This is not an iPod audiobook, and it won't show up on your iPod as an audiobook unless you take several conversion steps that you can find on other websites.<br/><br/>Both adults and children will love listening to Dale's fantastic reading of J.K. Rowling's fantastic tale in this, the concluding installment, of the Harry Potter series.
 This Collector's Box is awesome!  Came in on time and package was carefully taken care of before it arrived.  No damages and very happy with the packaging.  So far I love the original art on the cover and got it for a great price.  Almost $25 cheaper than what the stores have it for now.  Very pleased and will definitely be looking out for more Harry Potter deals.
 These books are LOVELY!!!! My daughter enjoys them so much &amp; I like that they’re in the original grammar.
 This book was the hardest for me  to put down in the whole series.  I really enjoyed it a lot.
 I like this paperback set. Great pictures on the cover. I like that they make Hogwarts when put together.
 Everything we expected and hoped for, and exactly what is pictured. I'm not sure what others are reviewing on here, but it was very misleading after I ordered the product. What you get is a trunk that opens made of some kind of super sturdy cardboard. All seven books with the original Mary Grand Pre illustrations, hardcover. Plus one set of stickers to decorate the trunk :)<br/>I haven't had all these books together like this since I was a kid!!
 I am an adult and I had not read the Harry Potter books prior to purchasing this box set.  I am currently making my way through the entire series and enjoying it immensely.  However, this review is not of the Harry Potter story;  my review is of the quality of the books in this boxed set, and its slipcase and packaging.<br/><br/>I did the math, and this boxed set was a cheaper deal than purchasing all the books individually.  However, there is nothing new here.  As far as I can tell, these are the same books as the original Scholastic print runs, with the same covers.  I was lucky enough to have been given and original Scholastic Book 1 by a friend, and in comparing that with the Book 1 in this set, I can say quite definitely that the paper used here is thinner and lesser quality than the original book.  Other than that, the books are identical in size and cover art.<br/><br/>The slipcase is a nice way to keep the set organized and displayed, but there is really no quality here.  It's just a cardboard slipcase decorated with the book covers and other paintings from the cover artist.  In fact, when all seven books are in the slipcase, it's actually quite difficulty to pluck out a single book, without first tipping the slipcase over and causing all the spines to protrude.  Just be careful not to tip them all onto the floor!<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think if you already own all seven paperbacks, then there is nothing new here for you. Your original Scholastic books are (probably) on better quality paper anyway.  But if you don't have all the books, and if you do the math and find this is a better deal versus individual purchases, then I think this is a great way to buy the complete series, regardless of the thinner paper used in the printing.
 My 8 year old boy is on the 3rd book now and I've never seen him so engrossed in a set of books like he has been with these. I'm reading the books for the first time too and my only problem is that he reads slower than me (duh!) and I have to wait for him to move onto the next book before I get the chance at them.
 The Harry Potter books are enchanting and wonderful, and there are much better reviews of their content both for this item and elsewhere on Amazon.  This is a review of the boxed set itself, its presentation and condition.  I'm writing it this way because I find it a gamble myself to purchase a good boxed set.  You often never know what will arrive in that box.  With this one I was made very happy.<br/>Admittedly, I was very surprised.  The books are printed on high quality paper.  They are the hardcovers (not first edition no) but wonderful nonetheless.  Very sturdy books indeed, these will last for generations if cared for.  The quality is far superior than other hardcover books I've purchased as of late -- my preferred medium for books by my favorite authors.<br/>The box itself is very sturdy.  You have to work to crush it; it's cardboard after all.  The illustrations on the sides makes one proud to display it.  The box supports the books, as opposed to cheaper, flimsier boxed sets where the books support the box.<br/>The icing on the cake was that mine came with two limited edition bookmarks, which really was thoughtful.  I bought this from Amazon on November 29, 2001, so I don't know if ALL the boxed sets at the time of this reveiw contain them.  However, this was a nice touch I wish all book sets would include, since with hardcovers of high-quality, you do NOT want to dog-ear the pages.  It's lovely to have a set of bookmarks to keep with the tomes, as it enhances the value greatly of having the entire set match.<br/>All-in-all, a great buy for great value.  If you need the Harry Potter books, definetly get them in this set if you can help it at all.
 It's the Harry Potter series, what more is there to say?! (I already have about 3 sets but these were purchased as a gift)
 Great set and it came without any damage, which was a big concern given that the books are in a nice outer box. This makes for a great gift.
 Harry Potter is the best box set I have read thus far.  There are other books that are good in different ways, but none quite do it like Harry.  The first four books are great, the fifth book I thought dragged on a little too long and didn't have as much of the action and adventure as the other ones.  It was good nontheless, but being the longest book without as much in it, it was just not as good.  I think this book was used as a bridge though to fill us in on a lot of details that we will need to know for the future.  Even if you have seen the movies, please read these, they are so much better.  I think I liked Book 4 the best since that was the only one besides Book 5 that I hadn't seen the movie first.  I loved the Quidditch World Cup etc.  It does not matter how old you are, these books are timeless.  Rowling does a wonderful job, I can't wait till I get my hands on the sixth one.
 I think #7 might have been my favorite of the series.  It was a roller coaster of emotion and full of surprises.
 On the level of introducing a child to the joys of reading a long novel, this book has succeeded far and beyond my expectations. Ever since I began reading Harry Potter to my six-year old daughter, it has been the main attraction of the day or evening. In addition to the suspense, adventure, fantasy, and mystery that come with a Harry Potter story, the author does a good job in walking a fine line between writing about a magical world in which anything is possible (e.g. preserving a copy of one's self in a magical diary), to addressing that part of life which is governed by laws and rules (e.g. underage wizards cannot practice magic in front of muggles, but how the Ministry of Magic knows when this happens is never explained).<br/>For us the excitement of reading Harry Potter is certainly real and magical; and I hope my daughter's enthusiasm carries over when reading other books that are more concerned with the rules and laws governing the lives and relationships of muggles.
 This was purchased as a gift for our Harry Potter fan and was well received.  Nice collection and packaging.
 This book is gorgeous. I bought this and the other as a gift for my SIL and she loves them. I'm tempted to buy them for myself even though I'm not a huge HP fan.
 Can’t beat the price on the whole set. The books are in wonderful condition and the handy box keeps them neat.
 Yes, I bought the Deluxe Edition which had a cardboard box cover signed by JKR.  I purchased it from Amazon via the advanced-order service and had forgotten I had ordered the Deluxe version by the time it arrived.  Initially, I wasn't really impressed but now that I've finished the book, I'm really glad I spent the few extra dollars.<br/><br/>Like many people, I loved the whole series.  I re-read 5 and 6 before beginning 7 simply because I'd read #4 (which used to me my favorite) so many times that I'd forgotten what happened in the next 2 books.  I read the last 3 books in one week which probably influenced my overall opinion of #7 which is that I found it to be simply amazing.  I just finished today and am now suffering from withdrawl.  I agree with the critism that the Prologue should have been longer with more detail but that is simply because I didn't want the story to end.  All I can do now is send out a word of thanks to JKR for such a wonderful and uplifting tale.
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerets is an exciting story filled with suprises. Harry meets the House-elf named Dobby who tries to keep a Harry from going to Hogwarts, his Wizard School.  Soon, Dobby gets Harry into  more trouble, and Harry is kept like an animal in his room. Soon, his  friend Ron, (With Fred and George) save Harry in a flying car. Harry stays  with the Weaslys, and when Harry tries to go to Platform  Nine-and-Three-Quarters, someone closes the gate on him and Ron. This story  is positive to keep you busy on Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I would reccomend  this book to people who wish to fly (We know, we know), love magic, like  snakes, and are crazy for adventure.
 Chamber of Secrets is a fine book, but even after having read it several times and now listening to it on audiobook (the first time I've revisted the story in probably 5 years), my feeling hasn't really changed in regard to it being my least favorite of the Potter books.  Even saying that, it's not that I hate the book.  There's a lot to like in it.  I just feel like it remains the volume in which the main mystery is the least well-developed; it's the book in which two of the final reveal feels like they come from out of left field.  Yes, I'm still bothered by the way Ginny is absent for most of the book yet stands revealed in the end as a main component of what has been going on at the school all year long.  I felt like there should have been more indicators than the occasional "Ginny looks like she's got a stomach ache" toss-off line.  I also think the reveal of Lucius Malfoy's connection is a bit of a stretch, although there at least you can go back to the beginning of the book and think "okay, yeah, I guess that happened."<br/><br/>However, as I said, even with that dissatisfaction, there's still plenty to like. Gilderoy Lockhart remains one of my favorite smarmy, self-involved characters of all time.  I can't help but picture Kenneth Brannagh when I reread the book, and even with Jim Dale's slightly different take on the voice of the character, I still felt Brannagh's presence.  And of course, Rowling used this book to set up so much of what will come later: the mystery of Harry's shared abilities with Lord Voldemort, the Harry-Draco Quidditch rivarly, the possibility that rather than being the Heir of Slytherin, Harry is actually the Heir of Gryffindor, and of course the introductory mention of Azkaban prison.  While Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party feels like a bit of a waste of space considering the smaller and smaller roles the ghosts play as the series evolves, it is still a fun diversion.<br/><br/>Jim Dale, of course, does his usual stellar job at performing the book and giving characters individual voices.  It is a little tough listening to these while driving because his voice is just so darn soothing, but if I don't listen to them on the road, I never will!
 Fans of the series may very well enjoy the many plot twists and turns as Harry and his two friends attempt to destroy the horcruxes revealed in the Half Blood Prince (book 6). Many times, the characters aren't in agreement and there are a few times when it seems hopeless. The Voldemort-Potter relationship becomes clearer and is used by the Dark Lord to play mind games with Harry. JK Rowling does indeed answer a lot of questions lingering from the previous books and a couple generated in the text of this one. Most elements are resolved one scene at a time, however she does employ lengthier discourses in the second half of the book to explain the purpose of significant characters. The only problems with the story itself being for youthful readers are the shifting of most of the plot away from Hogwarts and the implied use of vulgarities by several characters. I'm sure no one missed the frequent "effing". Other than that, the book is sure to keep many people busy reading for a week or two.
 I got this for my daughter and she absolutely love this rare edition.  Each book cover and box are beautifull, she likes to display her books on her bookshelf, so this collection looks great amongst her other books.<br/>But what I loved about it, it was packaged  and shipped securely. And I recieved in a timely manner
 I think one needs only to see the happy look on children faces to discover how important Harry Potter has become.<br/>I loved books as a child and they have helped me through out my life. Fairy tales are my favorite especially with Merlin he was my first encounter with a wizard. He remains hard to out do but Harry is running a close second. These are wonderful books thank God we live in a country that may burn the book but can't keep it from being printed. I loved Harrys compassionate side something adults could use more of. He feels things and it shows He can't help taking on the bullies and fighting for the underdog.  He evolves in his stories so you do to.  So much happens to this little wizard that we await his future. Finally a book I can give my grandchildren that has sparkle a bit of fairy dust, and lots of make believe.  Thank you England for Merlin and Harry...
 Fantastic for early readers. All of these are wonderfully done and instantly pulls the reader in. They are wonderful - esp if you have an early reader.
 The box is cheap. I was expecting better quality. The books are great if you are looking for this printed version.
 Beautifully illustrated and easy for younger eyes to follow along. Not so bad for the old eyes either.
 My granddaughters love these illustrated versions, the pictures are wonderful!
 Loved Harry Potter my first read years ago as each book was initially published!  Loved them even more as I binged my way through all 7 volumes this past month. I was delighted that the quality of Rowling’s imaginative storytelling, characterizations, and beautifully textured writing stands the test of time for me.
 I have loved all of the Harry Potter books, but this has been my favorite.  Yes, it has been darker than the earlier books, but it pulled everything together in a complete and compelling way.  I now understand so much more about many of the characters and the situation that Harry has been in since the initial attack by Voldemort.  I was moved to tears at times, and felt the odds against Harry and his friends were so insurmountable that I was overwhelmed for them.  Yet there were unknown helpers along the way, and Harry's close but effective escapes that stemmed from Harry's luck and perserverance, as well as his faithful friends' talents and loyalty.  Yet, in the end, it really was Harry against Voldermort.  Harry's goodness shines through in his actions, particularly with the noblest of sacrifices.  I have read the book twice, and plan to read the books 1 -7 to savor the entire story.  A must read for everyone.  BUT, first read the first 6 books of the series or you'll miss out!
 Wonderful set. Very eager to read them. She loves anything Harry Potter.
 Made me laugh and cry all over again. I have loved these books since I read them the first time. Great adventure! Kept me turning the pages and left me with wanting more.
 Finally, Hogwarts lives up to its name. Harry has settled himself to the task of ridding the world of Lord Voldemort and in the process found his true love, Ginny Weasley. Hermione and Ron realize that they truely in love with each other. In the final confrontation, the Hogwarts students live up to their training and bravely take on Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The only suprise to this was the death of some of the characters who had a lot to do with Harry's growth. The action was fast,  hot and furious, and really struck home in the imagination. One could almost visualize the fight scenes. The loss of both Professor Lupin and Tonks, so shortly after their marriage and the birth of their child was totally unexpected. Couple that with the death of Fred Weasley, instead of Percy, seemed a terrible loss to the story. The ending of the story was almost as if the story was about to start all over again with another lonely child. Still, J.K. Rowling saved her best for last and it really comes out.
 I've been a major fan of the Harry Potter books since I got my hands on the Sorcerer's stone, some six years ago.  I fell in love with the characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione and absolutely adored their friendship.  Ever since then I've been fanatical about the series, and feel that Rowling has wonderful wit and a phenominal way of creating a world.<br/><br/>However, I was sorely disappointed in the conclusion of the series, unfortunately.  As many others have said, the series ending does rely on a lot of deux ex machina, cliche and entirely too convenient plot devices to get Harry and his friends out of a jam, and also does rely on major characters giving long soliloquies about the whats and whys of the plot so that the characters finally understand certain elements, and consequently, so do the readers.  A good author knows to subtly include these answers in previous books, under the guise of something completely different so that we and the characters might re-discover them later.<br/><br/>Another thing that was most disappointing to me was the introduction in the very last book of certain items that we had never before heard of, one of which helped Harry defeat his enemy.  These were entirely too convenient and felt like a huge cop-out on the part of the author.<br/><br/>The most annoying and unfortunately, disappointing element of the last book, however, has to be the relationships that were ultimately formed and stuck, until "nineteen years later".<br/><br/>I am one of those readers who gets more involved and invested in the characters/relationships of a series, even above the storyline.  I found the resultant romantic relationships to be unrealistic and frankly, bewildering, considering what we know of the characters "personalities", and considering that a good author should understand what must happen between two characters in order that a later romantic relationship between the two of them seems viable.<br/><br/>I find that in books, the most satisfying and realistic romance comes from having written a well-developed, deep and abiding friendship between two characters first; having them together through the hero or heroine's trials from the beginning. Unfortunately, in trying to keep Harry from falling for Ginny too soon, Rowling kept Ginny almost completely out of Harry's life, and out of the story, until the ending.  This results in a sudden love relationship that is neither satisfying, well-written, or realistic, and makes it so that the hero's love interest is not well-known or desired by readers for the hero.<br/><br/>Considering Ron and Hermione's relationship, although Rowling did grow them relationally through the series, there was not near enough of the positive in their friendship, and not near enough respect and genuine "like" of the other person to warrant such an ending for them.  In other words, although I caught the author's many hints at letting the reader know the two felt romantically for one another, the author did not do enough to show why they fell for one another.<br/><br/>Neither love match in the end was satisfying, realistic, or well-written to me as a reader, and unfortunately for me, as I am so invested in characters and relationships even more so than storylines, it left me cold towards an ending I so dearly wanted to embrace as a satisfying one.<br/><br/>The author would have been better served to have placed Ginny in the "Hermione" role of the story, so that Harry and his intended grew together throughout, in friendship and respect.  As for Ron and Hermione, the resultant relationship would have been much more believable had the author included more positives in a relationship between the two that almost the entire time focused on the negative.<br/><br/>I may be different from others in what I view constitutes a well-written story, and the friendships between the characters, I believe, were well-written were they to stay as mere friendships... but the fact that they turned into romances when they were not written well enough to have been, ruined much of it for me.<br/><br/>Children's series or not, I feel that if an element is to be included in the story, it should be done believably.
 This is a awesome early Christmas gift for my wife. Surprisingly she havent seen the movie because she rather read the book before watching the movie. She loves it. The only reason why I give 4 stars is because the third book cover was bent. I was highly disappointed due to the fact i spent money for a brand new mint collection of harry potter books but whatever.
 Was gifted. it came in good shape. No need to exchange as I did other books
 Wanted to read the series over again since I havent read them since I was a kid and I'm glad I bought it. The box itself is really nice and make the books looks great.
 Nice set of the Harry Potter book series in paperback. All the books are included and compared to other sellers of the series online, the price was really good. I bought these for my 12year old daughter at the time and was super excited she finally wanted to read them! I would recommend. They came pretty quickly too.
 I had all of these when they first came out but lent them out to people never to be seen again! The set was a great price and I won't be lending them to anyone... With age comes wisdom haha
 Amazon has yet again done themselves and their customers a disservice by grouping together all reviews for different versions of a product.  Being as popular as it is, the Harry Potter series has had a lot of different editions, which means many people are interested in knowing the physical quality of a particular edition as much as they want to know about the content of the books themselves.  That's why I'm focusing this review mostly on the physical aspect of the books, but first I'll make a small note on the story, without saying too much.<br/><br/>About Harry Potter, the story:<br/>This is, to put it simply, a wonderful series of books.  The overall story, the subplots, the characters, the setting, all of it is wonderfully written.  The movies based on them Hollywoodize the story and play up the cool aspects of the magical world, but make no mistake: in the books the magical setting is just a means to an end, which is to tell the tale of a boy turning into a man and seeing himself facing a powerful evil, not by fate, but by choice.  The books are mystery novels, which, again, is something that the films unfortunately play down to focus on the action.  If you found yourself dissapointed by the films, please still give the books a chance.  The films are only OK by themselves, but as companions to the books, as a way to get a visual representation of what occurs in the original story, they're great.  It's a timeless story, one that will be a loved classic forever.<br/><br/>It should be noted, thought, that the books were written to be read alongside the kids growing up.  So, the first books cater better to kids, while the last ones are better for adults.  Reading them all one after another to a kid might not be the very best idea, but for a teenager/adult they're all a great read (even if the first two are better suited for kids).  Alternatively, letting a kid read one book a year would be a good way too.<br/><br/>About this collection:<br/>At first glance, this collection is amazing.  The books come packaged in a box with beautiful art by the aforementioned artist Kazu Kibuishi, depicting several characters from the books in one of the most famous settings from them.  One end of the box is open, featuring the books spines, which, when lined up together in sequence, feature a beautiful sight of Howgwarts Castle, the most important setting in the series.<br/><br/>Each book has a cover art depicting an important scene from that particular story, and the back cover from each beautifully represents Harry with his back turned to us, facing another scene from the book, each new book showing Harry growing but basically in the same pose.  It's a really nice touch.<br/><br/>On the inside, each chapter starts with a small illustration, depicting a scene from that chapter, but drawn by a different artist.  I'm not familiar with the differences between the UK and US versions, but I found that the book has a lot of british slang and such.  I don't know if it's the original version, the americanized one, or one in between, since this is the first time I've read these books in english.  Suffice to say, it's perfectly understandable, though some kids might not be familiar with some of the slang.<br/><br/>So, this books are great, the content is great, why only 4 stars?  Well, the packaging is the problem.  Yes, it looks nice, but for a Special Edition it wasn't really thought out.  The books fit inside the box too tightly.  If you take out the books to check them out and put them back in right after you just got them, there will be no problem.  But as soon as you take out the books and start reading them, they will invariably get a little bit thicker, no matter how careful you are.  It'll be just one or two milimeters each book (and more in the larger ones), and after some point it will be impossible to get all the books back in the box.  If you try to force them in, it will break.  That means you'll be forced to either throw away the package, leave it aside empty or have only the partial collection inside, and none of those solutions will look good in your library (or, at least, not as good as having the box intact will all the books inside).<br/><br/>It's an oversight, but it would have been so easy to fix.  Either make the box adjustable or at least able to be disassembled, and things would be just fine.  But, as it is, for what's clearly a collector's item, quality really wasn't considered as much as visual appeal.  These are not action figures.  I understand people having action figures in an unopened package (it's a waste, but I understand it), but you can't have books in a package just so you never damage it.<br/><br/>There is one other thing.  The books themselves have a nice quality, they feel soft and smooth to the touch, because of the soft transparent plastic lining.  But in my copy of Book 6, the lining peeled off really easy.  So now the book stands out from the rest.  For all that, it loses a star.  Make no mistake, though.  These still are great books, and I recommend everyone to get them.  I just want people to know the small inconveniences they might ran into with this particular edition.
 Unless you have spent the past few years in the wilderness, or in a coma, JK Rowling's tale of "The Boy Who Lived" is a familiar epic that, with luck, you have read and savored more than once.  "The Deathly Hallows" is the culmination of the journey, and a savory one it is.  Ms Rowling's magical world is one that we enjoy, not merely because of its realism, but because of the rare combination of the mundane and the fantastic. We can accept the existence of magic because the characters leap from the pages and live in our imaginations. The spells and incantations don't necessarily advance the plot--or substitute for plot development.  They flow naturally from the events that the characters face and react to.  The author isn't trying to convince us that wands and fantastical creatures do or should exist in our lives, but that, in this world, they do, and that the characters use the tools that they have.  Read the "Iliad" or "The Divine Comedy", and you will see the same striving to overcome the impossible.<br/>  Ms Rowling, I look forward to whatever genre you turn to next. It has been a pleasure and an honor to watch you hone your craft and develop your gift.
 I have bought this set twice now one for my self and one for my bestfriends sister. I love this set so much and the price is great especially when it goes on sale. the box is cardboard but I still love it and is great quality.
 Can you say beautifully illustrated version of an already loved classic.
 always a sure fire best bet... good book... I want to get the other two!!!
 Every time I reread the series I’m drawn in by a great story and superb writing. What a treat to have the hero’s journey retold in this extraordinary fashion while revealing the power of character, caring, standing up for what’s just, and working for a society that includes everyone. Perfect for the today’s zeitgeist. Equally as great for kids and adults.
 My 9 year old was so hyped to see the box set come in. He started 4th grade this year but has a high reading level. We were looking for something after he read and completed the Percy Jackson series. The box set just gave him another reason to jump into the first book and I couldn’t be happier!
 Excellent collection.  With it on my Kindle I can get a Harry Potter fix any time.
 Love Harry Potter and the animated box it comes in. It's a very cute set.
 This series is for more than just children,  it has lessons to teach for anyone who cares to read it.
 Most of the books are fine, but the third volume is badly damaged. Many of the pages are ripped and look like they’ve been caught while being put together. For this kind of money you expect a perfect product!
 I now have a complete set in hard cover, my paperback copies were falling apart
 My son loves the whole series. I love that this book encourages him to pick reading over screen time!
 Gorgeous illustrations. Love that they don't use the movies as a model.
 I got these as a gift for my daughter.  She loves them.  It is a great set of books.
 Excellent quality, obviously one of the best series ever written.
 My mom has trouble reading books with normal print. She loved the large print
 We love the illustrated versions of these books! Must-have for Harry Potter fans!
 The pictures are great and the writing is larger than the original books  so it makes it easier reading. Hope they come out with the rest of the books
 It’s conveniently packed and the artwork on the cover and the box are nice
 I bought 3 of these US hardback box sets because the books are quite lovely and printed on high quality paper. The heavy cardboard 'trunk' looks nice and is OK for storage only; the books are heavy and it is not built strongly enough to support carrying them around much, as a wooden or metal trunk would be. This set makes an impressive gift that anyone can appreciate because the books are of such high quality make and content.<br/><br/>For those who are interested in buying or knowing about other available versions and formats of HP, here are my comments on the British books, ebooks and audio books that I also own:<br/><br/>I bought the UK Bloomsbury Children's Edition hardbacks but unfortunately their paper quality is not the greatest. For the most part, the differences between the US and UK books are not significant. I simply wanted to have the original British versions because I really love these amazing stories. The Bloomsbury books can be ordered from Amazon UK or Amazon Canada.<br/><br/>Ordering the ebooks from the Pottermore web site was easy and the download to my Amazon Kindle library went quite smoothly. Pottermore also holds the books for you and enables buyers to download them to a maximum of 8 devices without having to repurchase them. All of the US and UK ebooks are nicely done.<br/><br/>I also have the Bloomsbury version audio book CDs narrated by Stephen Fry and the US set narrated by Jim Dale. The major difference between these is that Jim Dale 'acts' the different characters with significant voice changes for each character, while Stephen Fry narrates expressively more than performs. Each is nicely done and I enjoyed listening to both complete sets, but if I had to pick a favorite I'd choose Stephen Fry; I liked his style and his vocalizations beautifully express the meaning and mood setting of each passage.  Some of Jim Dale's female voices are annoying to listen to and he inaccurately gives Bellatrix a French accent when she is actually British, and also inaccurately gives a French pronounciation to words like 'Voldemort' or 'beazor' instead of pronouncing these in their proper British context. Both sets of audio books are also available in MP3 format and can be purchased on the Pottermore web site.<br/><br/>As you may gather from my purchasing all of these versions, I think the Harry Potter series is extraordinary and J. K. Rowling is a truly gifted author who has given us this treasure. For those of you who have read through the entire series at least once and have had time to think about the details and wonder if/where some corrections and revisions are needed, you might like to read my review of the kindle book DESTINY UNFULFILLED by Jim Adam. I hope you will find worthwhile insights and suggestions there that you can enjoy and think about:<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Destiny-Unfulfilled-A-Critique-of-the-Harry-Potter-Series/dp/B004GUSE4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Destiny Unfulfilled: A Critique of the Harry Potter Series</a>
 I read this book in 9 hours. Everything I wanted from the series and more.
 Nice basic book set, but I thought this set was Illustrated; bummer, it's not.
 A brilliant illustrator joining up with a brilliant author...what more could one ask for? I am (almost) obsessed with Jim Kay's art as I am with JK Rowling's writing.
 I have read them many times and they are  excellent books. You grow attached to the characters and caught up in their lives.
 All of the Harry Potter books are fantastic. Where else could we lose ourselves in all circumstances? J K Rowling is amazing!
 Grandson wanted this book set, was very happy to get the set.
 After reading all of Ms. Rowling's books, I have watched her writing style grow as her characters grow.  She may have started writing a childrens book, but she brought the characters and the readers up through the ages.  She never looked down upon her readers, and demands that they keep up.  Children throughout my neighborhood spent the first week that the book was out reading; it was as if the entire world had stopped in order for these children to just read.  It was phenomenal.  The world that J.K. Rowling created is one that children and adults enjoy -- many who don't have a zest for reading, are spell-bound by this collection.  The final installment did not disappoint.  I re-read the books in order to pick up the clues that may have been there that she wrapped up so well in the final book.  To think that this woman was able to tie up every loose string from books one through seven is just amazing.  Now that is writing at its best!
 I am 20, and up until I saw the first book in the series for free due to Prime and decided to just read it out of boredom, I had not seen the movies nor knew anything about Harry Potter... Now it is my favorite book series of all time. I am an avid reader, but I have NEVER been able to read a book twice.. well Harry Potter broke that. I am now reading the series over again, and it's just like reading it for the first time. It's nice that the kindle version is all one book, so I just read it through and then started over again. I also purchased the movies, but was SEVERELY disappointed in them. They are alright, but I prefer the books WAY more. I always have my kindle with me, so it's easy to just read the books when I have downtime. I am glad I read this series at this point in my life, because I feel like if I'd read it when I was younger, it wouldn't have meant as much to me as it does now. Now I have a question for the Harry Potter fans out there... Should I also purchase the paperback books? I am conflicted as to whether or not I should. I mean the kindle version makes it much easier, I can't just restart if I finish the books, or move from one to the other without having to worry about grabbing the physical book. But of course, not having the actual books makes me feel like something is missing... so what do you fellow fans think?
 I love Harry Potter, and I decided to buy the illustrated versions for my second read through of the series. The drawings are amazing and incredibly immersive. My one draw back is the weak binding, it arrived with it being torn from the spine and I have to handle it so carefully. The price is definitely not worth a broken book, but the illustrations are lovely!
 Came super fast for a class my daughter was taking thank you
 It was and amazing book let's just get this said Percy gets a girlfriend!!!!!!<br/>  Well also perfect isn't spelled correctly on a lot of pages
 I just turned 30, but I absolutely ate up the first four Harry Potter books! They brought back great Narnia and Wizard of Oz memories from my childhood. The stories and characters were complicated, rich and just plain fun enough that even "old" me loved them!<br/>I realize I'm not telling you anything you haven't heard before, but I wanted to add my two cents and say that Harry Potter is a modern classic. I'm positive my *grandchildren* will be reading these books alongside the Narnia and Oz books, and loving them. I don't doubt for a moment that I too will enjoy dusting them off in the years to come and taking a mental spin with Harry on his Firebolt at Hogwart's -- even when I'm an old granny.
 These books are absolutely amazing for all ages. I got the collection for my boyfriend for Christmas because we have both read them, but didn't have the full set.  I love that these copies have the original artwork from when I was young.  Overall a great price for a brilliant book series!
 Bought these for my mother for Christmas and she has already finished them. No quality issues whatsoever! Comes with entire HP set.
 Love them could not find hard back but my daughter loves these.
 It's an entertaining read that will intrigue readers. The characters are unique and the plot is composed of never-ending adventures.
 Harry Potter looks forward to his second year at Hogwarts.  His Muggle relatives are especially horrible and lock him in his room.  He receives a disturbing visit from Dobby the house elf, before the Weasley boys rescue him and bring him to their home.  Things don't seem to go as well this year.  Draco Malfoyle has bought himself onto his house's Quidditch team and is determined to make life miserable for Harry.  Ron's little sister has a crush on him, and the new professor is a publicity hound who seems to want to use Harry for more attention.  There is much more going on, someone has opened the dreaded Chamber of Secrets, which threatens wizards with Muggle blood.<br/>There is so much detail in these novels, yet they flow smoothly from one to the other.  This is a really wonderful series.
 I had no idea how addicting these books really were.  I got through them in no time and plan to read them again and again.  They were so much better than the movies mainly because the movies had half or less than half of what was actually in the books.  After reading Harry Potter I find it difficult to read anything else.<br/><br/>Update: I wanted to update this because I wanted to add that these books have opened me up to a whole new world that I didn't know existed.  I said after reading Harry Potter that I found it difficult to read anything else, but once you start reading other books, you get used to the different writing styles.  These books have really changed me.  Before I couldn't stand to read and now I love reading, so thank you to J.K. Rowling for writing these and getting me interested in reading.
 My four year old absolutely loves Harry Potter. When he saw this package, he knew from the font on the side of the packaging box that it was "from Harry Potter". He loves the little locking trunk (relatively durable cardboard -- nothing too fancy, but still very cute) and the hardcover books are obviously amazing. An absolute steal. I would buy 1000 times again.
 I ordered these books as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She works at Universal Studios and is a huge Harry Potter fan. As advertised, great quality, beautiful books and fast delivery. I would recommend buying from this seller. Can’t wait for my daughter to open these when she comes home for Christmas. Thank you!
 It's pretty difficult with any medium to create colorful characters with a crusading plotline. From Stephen King to Luke Skywalker, from old-time westerns to modern-day tv, it's tough  to create characters that continually stand up book after movie after magazine with entertaining stories. Our man Harry has perservered through this challenge -- leaving us with a very engaging first novel, The Sorcerer's Stone, and a only mildly less-so sequel.<br/>Mild as it may be, the only thing that I found troubling in Chamber of Secrets was its close echo in form, in flavor, to the first book. While hiking a different path, J.K. Rowling climbs the same mountain -- the climax, for instance, is too similar in both books.<br/>Considering the audience, though, is not 22 year old readers like myself, this seems like a wholly insufficient reason for anyone younger not to buy this book.
 I have been watching the movies and reading the books at the same time to see how different they were. If you like to read it was fun to do. I will always say that the saddest part is when Dobby dies. He is the coolest elf and I couldn’t believe that I actually made me cry.
 WARNING<br/>SPOILERS***<br/>This is my second reading of the final chapter in the Harry Potter series, and as good as it was, it fell short of being a great book.  The character of Snape appeared to be a mere afterthought in Rowlings' writing and Snape was always one of my favorite characters.  Given his importance in all that transpired, you would think that he would get a better send-off than the one he received.  Moreover, the reasons behind all the things he did -- love for Lilly is rather simplistic.  This character came from a troubled background, and he appears to have struggled to find his place in the world for most of his life, yet his only motivating factor for doing anything is Lilly Potter?<br/><br/>In the end, Rowling also raises questions about Dumbledore's character and motivations without any real exploration or resolution to the question's posed.<br/><br/>As for the ultimate resolution, instead of being inventive, she sticks us with the unbelievable and pedestrian pairing of Harry and Ginny Weasley, and the "I've run out of ideas, so I'll stick them together" pairing of Hermione and Ron.  Does Ms. Rowlings seriously believe that putting these couples together speaks to creativity or ingenious?  To me it spoke to how do I wrap this up in what I think is a neat little bow writing.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I would have preferred a more thoughtful examination of the characters than what we were provided.  Having said that, I still love the series as a whole, and commend Rowlings for bringing these characters to the public, and for getting kids to read.
 Of course the books are awesome. The whole set comes as one download which is quick and efficient, but does give the feel of taking forever to read since it displays as one book.
 I bought this book used, I wanted to complete my set.  I am happy with it, clean, crisp and delivery on time.
 One of my favorite books/series of all time.<br/>... Of course it’s happening in my head, but that doesn’t mean it’s not real...
 It is perfect! My sister in law is going to love this! Bought it for her Christmas gift early so that I wouldn't worry about the item being sold out! It's just what she wanted and just as the picture shows!
 I bought this set for my wife for our 10 year anniversary and it was missing the first book! How do you seal something up without the first book???? That’s the most important book!!!!!!!
 This is a book I've been reading for 15+ years. I lost my old copy &amp; was so happy when I ordered this copy.
 Value for money. The cover and pages are not as durable, fold easily.
 All of the books in one place.  My nephew was overjoyed to have the complete series. He's already on the fourth one.
 Love all the Harry Potter books. Books everyone will enjoy!
 Harry Potter is amazing and I know my niece will be so excited to receive all of these for Christmas!
 Bought this a gift for a 12 year old. She loved it !! . Also good quality.
 I’ve read all 7 books, It was a truly, Spectacular Experience, I recommend reading it. Amazing,  Spectacular And a great collection.
 As usual in the Harry Potter series, incredibly well written, kept me on the edge of my seat, couldn't put it down.
 My fifth reading of this series and as always something new to find and love. Can’t wait for my sixth reading .
 So happy I have these again after losing them for so many years. Couldn’t be happier!
 I love this set. I keep mine pristine in a box as part of my collection. I’ve read all books from my kindle. :)

 Was happy to find these on sale and cheaper than any place else. My daughter and I read them at night. She is excited to get started on the series. The container they come in is a great storage box. The books are all crisp, cut well, and feel good in the hand.
 In J.K. Rowling's sequel to _The Sorcerer's Stone_ we learn more of the magical world of Harry Potter.  It is simply delightful to return to Harry's second year at Hogwarts, meeting new characters like the Herbology professor, Ms Sprout, or the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockheart, and the Whomping Willow, and to learn more about Hermione and the Weasleys.  The imagination of Ms. Rowling allows adults (such as myself) to again feel the magic of youth.<br/>In _The Chamber of Secrets_, the plot centers around Hogwarts students who are being turned to stone, and a possible plot to once again harm our intrepid hero, Harry.  Rowling's prowess at writing a mystery is just as adept as her writing of fiction.  It is simply a delighful read and I highly recommend it.
 The second book in the greatest fantasy series of all time is just the way all sequels should be: darker and deeper. Harry's magical world begins to show its cracks: slavery, racism, elitism, classism, hate crimes and slurs against "inferior blood". Harry himself is darkened by the threat of his own destiny (hero or villain?), as he must unravel the mystery of the monster hidden in the Chamber of Secrets that threatens his school. Themes and events of this book send shockwaves through the rest of the series (particularly Half-Blood Prince, which is essentially its sequel). What is amazing isn't that Rowling is able to maintain her Dickensian cast of brilliant characters, her Agatha Christieish complex, enigmatic psychological plots, her sly Austenian wit, her Tolkien imagination, and her Shakespearean themes of destiny and heroism, but that--with each book--she improves to create a thoroughly original, satisfying, intoxicating read. Yes, this is my eighth time reading it. Each read reveals more and more of Rowling's brilliance ("maybe he killed Moaning Myrtle...").<br/>...and, you know, the best part of COS is finishing it, because you know which one is up next.... Grade: A
 Rowling has created a wonderful series that is multi-genred and applicable and entertaining for multiple demographics. It's not that there has never been anything like it before that makes the series so attractive- it's that Rowling manages to take multiple types of literature and combine them into one beautifully written package that has something for everyone. A wonderful sense of high fantasy, mystery, thrill, love, and even adventure. Any child will be thoroughly engaged from the very first few lines in the book and any adult can read right along with their child without struggling through the coddling or talking down that most children's literature is so riddled with nowadays.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic step in the right direction in the overall genre of children's literature in that we are moving away from expecting so little of kids and letting them open up a few hundred pages of text and ask them to recall tiny bits of information, digest plot twist, and really understand characterization.
 Prepare for a hair-raising rollercoaster of a ride, down to the very last spell cast. Enjoy! It's a journey you'll never forget.
 This is one of the best series I've read in a long time about coming of age, good vs evil and what it truly means to be a friend.  It says life isn't all sweetness and light, but you don't give up or give in when things are bleak.<br/><br/>If you lose someone you love, mourn them, remember them, and then get on with life.  Honor their memories but don't become a terminal victim.<br/><br/>JKR did an incredible job of writing and teaching lessons without preaching, and to be able to kill off characters that were good as well as those that were bad is a mark of her character and resilience.  She also did a good job of tying together all of the threads without taking any of the edge off of the story.  I believe these books will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>I have read each book at least 6 times and Deathly Hallows twice so far.  They have pride of place on my bookshelf and will for years to come.
 This book is very well written. I do wish that Doby didn't die. I just feel that too much has been taken from Harry. Other than that it was a great book. I loved the ending with the elder wand.
 I have just finished listening to "Deathly Hallows" and I am still numb. Jim Dale's narration is gripping and thrilling. I was hanging onto every word that came out of his mouth. He is brilliant in capturing characters verbally; even when our heroes take the polyjuice potion and are different people, he gives them new voices but still retains the essence of them. The pacing is first rate and his ability to portray verbally a wide swath of emotions of seemingly hundreds of characters is amazing.<br/><br/>I have listened to all the Harry Potter books, which are narrated by Dale, and find this is the best way to encounter Rowling's series. When I've read some of the books, I always thought she needed an editor because the books seemed bloated. However, when listening to the books, Dale makes every word count, which then makes all the books a coherent whole.<br/><br/>Dale deserved the Best Narration award from Audiophile for his narration of the "Order of the Phoenix." I know he'll get another for this book.<br/><br/>I think he would be a great narrator for another audio version of the Lord of the Rings series. Ron Inglis' version, which is very good, is from the early 90s. It's time for a new one and Jim Dale would be the perfect voice for it.
 the  2nd captivating and fun imaginative book in the harry potter series starts with harry wishing someone would remember his birthday doesn't  receive anything letters,presents,or cards from any of his friends at hogwarts then gets a warning from a house elf about dangers that are going to happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry a year  after harry found out he was a wizard but now he has to defend himself,friends,and the whole school from an even lurking inside the castle that only harry can hear cause of being a parseltongue so read my review and enjoy harry potter as  much as i do and if you don't own this or any of the harry potter books go out and get all the harry potter books and get lost in the magical,mystical ,imaginative,fun world that is harry potter.
 There are so many reviews here that this book certainly doesn't need one from me but I wanted to say I loved it. I've read all the others and was looking forward to this one,too. I'm very pleased that Rowling chose to end the book the way she did. It was satisfying and sweet.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is the classic Hero's Journey --- Joseph Campbell would have loved it. It has all the elements of great, classic adventure and the triumph of good over evil. Plus it has the addition of some of the most wonderful characters a reader could ask for. I'm sorry the series has ended and I know that the entire Weasley family, Sirius and Mad-eye and Lupin, all those great kids and, of course, Harry, will always be characters in my internal world. I think I'll miss Luna most of all.<br/><br/>Thanks, Ms. Rowling for the magic. In a world that can be trying at times, it is deeply appreciated.
 My daughter loves these books. I bought this one as a Christmas gift. Beautiful pictures!
 I just recently bought this series as I had to go on a business trip and needed to bring along something to read.  I had avoided this series up til now because I always thought it was geared more towards kids.<br/><br/>Well, I'm glad I bought it.  I'm on book 5 right now and it's amazingly good.<br/><br/>I really like Rowling's writing style.  The pace and overall "feel" of the series reminds me very much of good old Lord of the Rings.  It's got just the right mix of action, dialogue, intrigue and suspense to make it hard to put down once you've picked it up.  The characters are detailed and interesting and I feel a real investment in where the story is heading next.<br/><br/>The invention of "Quidditch" was brilliant, as well.  It's basically a vehicle for the characters to display more qualities and social interactions in an aggressive setting without constantly putting the characters in truely dangerous situations (which makes it that much more edge-of-your-seat when the characters DO get into truely dangerous situations).  Basically, it's school sports, but "football" wouldn't make much sense at a wizarding school, so Rowling invented a wizard sport that helps get across all the character interaction that a good sport tends to deliver.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm in my 30's, a old school fan of the genre ever since I had read "The Hobbit" as a kid of possibly single digit age and this series belongs on my shelf right up there with the best of them.  You're doing yourself a disservice if you aren't reading them simply because you think you're too far above the age of the target audience.
 This is the third time reading through the Harry Potter series and the first time on the Kindle. Loved the portability on Kindle.
 The pictures are beautiful! Every HP fan needs these books!
 Bought these for my brothers and they absolutely love them... They are averaging 1 book every 1-2 days... The books come in a beautiful sturdy "box".  These were a really good deal for the quality of the books.
 Love love love this! If you’re a Potterhead like me, you’ll want this set! It’s spectacular.
 My middle school son claims that he hates to read, but he hasn't put down book 1 yet.  It's great to have the whole series so that he can continue reading now that he's found books that he likes.
 All five books came and while they were used and in good quality(a little on the worn side but nothing too bad for older books), it did not come in the box and DOESN'T come with any leather book mark.  It's still a great deal if you wanted to get these books and don't want to pay for indivudual brand new ones but just be warned they are all seperate books and are all very much used.  Mine still had old price tags on them which told me they were from different shops to start with so never part of a set, let alone special edition or anything.  Suprised they are getting away with such false statements.
 Absolutely, GREAT!  No negative issues - period!
 I purchased the Bloomsbury red box set, which was published in the UK. I am clarifying because it seems that all of the reviews here are mixed together for various Harry Potter box sets. I have to say, these books do not photograph well. They are absolutely stunning in person. The dust jackets are a soft matte texture with shiny gold foil lettering. The pictures on the covers are deep, saturated, high contrast images, but for whatever reason, probably the matte texture, they show up kind of muted in photographs. They are like glowing jewels! I love them so much!<br/><br/>I thumbed through each book to check for obvious printing issues, since some people have reported creased pages, missing print, etc, but nothing jumped out at me at all. The only issue I have found so far is a slight bit of shipping damage to the red box the books are housed in. It is also a little difficult to get the books out if they are all inside together since there is nothing to grab onto, but you can just tip the box and they will start to slide out.<br/><br/>As for the stories themselves, I have only read one and the beginning of the second so far. We are late to the Harry Potter party, but my children and I are really enjoying the series. They are very engaging and enjoyable to read aloud to my crew. They always ask me to read another chapter when they could be running off to watch TV or play.
 Loved, loved, loved, this book and the six before!!
 It was a fun book to read. Easy reading, I will get the next book too. J K Rowling is a good author.
 J. K. Rowling proves to us that the success of the first book was no fluke by giving HP fans another dose of adventure. There's a new mystery this time, new characters and a new attempt by Voldemort to return.<br/><br/>We see more revelation in this book about the different characters of the four houses at Hogwart's School, most notably the contrast between Gryffindor and Slytherin. The motives and conflicts of the founders are explained as being behind the present day struggles. The "pure-blood" prejudice becomes more of a major theme and becomes a defining issue between good and bad wizards.<br/><br/>Getting to see more of the Weasley family is a special treat in Book II. Arthur's love of muggles and fascination with "muggle artifacts" is humorous and provides insights into a humble attitude toward magical gifts which characterizes the good wizards. The growing relationship between Ron and Hermione continues to spawn great dialogue. Mrs. Weasley continues to endear herself as the good mother who is a bit over-bearing at times and the twins continue to be dedicated to the type of mayhem which is all in good fun.
 Came in perfect condition. Super happy with care.
 Ive been a Harry Potter fan for quite sometime, after reading The Sorcerers Stone I was hooked, excellent plot great for even kids to read, as time went on I picked up the next book as they became available in paperback, well needless to say that I waited over a year for the last book "The Deathly Hallows" and I must say that it was worth the wait, normally I can devour a book in no time but this book was savored, read slowly and totally enjoyed, the story does start off quite formatable but then in no time it just takes off, one event after another happening and the quest behind Harry and his companions Hermoine and Ron leave nothing to chance, the story is very well thought and written, the amazing things in this last book will leave you crying for the chapters to never end, every emotion will be felt in this last book, the triumphs, the sorrows and pain....it will keep you quite occupied and hungry for more, I know it did for me, every last detail in this book was brilliant...like I said very well thought and written, if your a Harry Potter fan then this book is a must have and it must be read not once but dozens of times, Ive read it 3 time already and love each time more than the last.
 I've read the first 4 Harry Potter books at this point, and while this one would not be ranked as my favorite, it still is well worth 5 stars. Certainly you need to read this before continuing on to books 3 and 4! But this book did not have quite the novelty of the first book, the wonderful characters of the third, or the great plot developments of the fourth. It just sort of falls between all of them on these counts, giving us an interesting plot, further development of the main characters and a few things we will see again in later books. But the book is still certainly engrossing and a fun read, and highly recommended.
 Collection is great and arrived as expected. Very satisfied
 It's the second year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. This year, Harry will need a little extra help breaking away from his muggles family, and from an unexpected house elf, but Ron Weasley and his brothers are equal to the task. At school, there is a new instructor of the Dark Arts and of course a new menace that Harry and his friends will have to face. A chamber of secrets has been opened, by party or parties unknown, a monster unleashed, and everyone seems to be acting queerly...<br/><br/>In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", we get to know the main characters a little better, and we learn more about Harry's long term foe, who has his own backstory.  The climactic set piece in the Chamber of Secrets is extremely well done, and who can resist a flying car? Very highly recommended to fans of the Harry Potter series.
 Got this for my wife for Christmas since she loves Harry Potter. Outstanding value and quality.
 Even though I ordered 3 copies of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" I was the last in my family to get ahold of the book.  I wanted undisturbed reading time and that is a rare commodity.  I rushed through the book since I needed to know what happened and missed many of the details in my hurry to finish.  I was able to really enjoy the subtleties driving in my car and listening to Jim Dale read the book to me.  My inner voice is not nearly as rich as Mr. Dale's and I was enchanted with his reading of the story.  I found myself sitting longer than need be in parking lots and in my driveway waiting for a chapter to end.  To term Mr. Dale versatile doesn't do justice to the variety of voices he produces.  Each character came alive and I found myself even more attached or repelled by many of them after hearing the cd.  Can't believe the saga is at an end.
 all 7 Harry Potter books at a reasonable price.
 Part of series, ordered to use with Audible
 Ok... so when the movie came out I was like "I bet it's something that only kids would enjoy" but after I saw it, I became an instant fan and couldn't wait for the second book to be released as a movie so I bought this luxurious set and believe me the books are even better than the 3 oscar-nominated movie. J.K. Rowling is an amazing writer with the best style to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the books are beautifully cnnected to each other and each and every one of them has it's own breathtaking ending. being an adult doesn't always mean that you have to live in the real world the rest of your life, you have to read more books like Harry Potter to stay sane in this insane world. Once you start reading the book it's non-stop action, fantasy and suspence it's simply brilliant this is definetly worth every penny.
 The item is described as having "a collectible trunk-like box with sturdy handles and privacy lock. Bonus decorative stickers are included in each boxed set." There was no box or stickers in the package, however the books themselves looked to never have been opened but the paper covers had fraying on the edges and what looked like third party price tag stickers on the bindings.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Hard-Cover-Boxed-Set-Books-1-7/dp/0545044251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Hard Cover Boxed Set: Books #1-7</a>
 What's not to love about the Harry Potter series? I was a latecomer to the world of Harry Potter, so I borrowed each book in the series from a friend of mine who had the British edition copies. I loved the series so much that I wanted my own set to read again, and since I had first experienced the Harry Potter series in the British form (and found it very charming--I'm an American, by the way), I decided to go with a British set for myself. I've not read the American version, but my friend was telling me that several of the British terms (like "jumper" for "sweater" or "spell-o-tape," aka "cellotape," for just "tape" here in the States).<br/><br/>So that's really a minor thing, but again, I found it very charming. I actually like looking up things I don't know, so that made it even more charming in my opinion (like what is a "jumper" and why is every dessert a "pudding"?). And even if that weren't a factor, again, the nostalgia piece is something I find lovely as well.
 Love these books!!! Crisp new books, such a great read its hard to put them down.
 The second installment of the Harry Potter series is a wonderful story that continues the young wizzards at Hogwarts.  Although this book stands perfectly on its own, I strongly suggest that you read the first book in order to understand all the background.<br/>The second book follows Harry, Ron, and Hermoine through their second year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Once again, strange things are happening.  This time however, they are affecting the students a bit more seriously.  People are being petrofied and no one knows what is doing it.  Then the rumors start about a secret chamber hidden somewhere in Hogwarts.  Once again, Harry and his friends set out to find the truth.
 I have become a fan of Harry Potter after spending the month of August reading the entire series.  I even intend to be Professor McGonagall for Hallowe'en this year.  Naturally, I wanted to read the original text.  I first purchased this set from a marketplace seller, but after 2 months the books never arrived.  So I purchase from a UK seller, and they arrived in seven days. Go figure!  Anyway, it was well worth the wait.  The books are great rather in American or British English, and it is fun to see the different spellings, vocabulary, and idioms used.  If you are not into this kind of thing, then you probably won't see the value in purchasing the UK editions, but for all you aspiring linguists check them out. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-UK-Bloomsbury-Publishing-Vol-1-6-Children-s-Edition-Boxed-Set-Harry-Potter-1-6/dp/0747581533/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter UK/Bloomsbury Publishing Vol 1-6 Children's Edition Boxed Set (Harry Potter, 1-6)</a>
 Rather than review the book, which I find to be generally outstanding and a satisfying end to the series, I'd instead like to review Jim Dale's reading of it.<br/><br/>This is my second "reading" of The Deathly Hallows, but my first foray into audiobooks. I thought it would be good filler during a road trip and beach vacation when I would be unable to actually pick up a book. Now home from that trip, I can't stop listening to it.<br/><br/>Dale's pacing slows me down and allows me to appreciate details I probably skim past while reading at my usual steady clip. His inflection draws you in, brings Rowling's rich world out of the words, gives a wink and a nod during the fleeting happy moments, and sets you on edge as tension rises. He provides a distinctive and appropriate voice for each character, bringing life to their personalities.<br/><br/>The one rather major exception I take is with Hermione's voice; the younger women's voices in general sound a bit strained, but not distractingly so. Hermione's parts, however, are spoken with a whiney inflection that elongates the last syllable of words and gets high and squeaky at the end ("Haa-rryyYYY"). Rather than making her sound reproachful or thoughtful, as I'm sure is intended, it makes her sound a bit dim-witted, almost like a thoughtless stereotype of someone with a disability. Emma Watson (Hermione in film), in contrast, manages to enunciate each syllable while simultaneously spitting out the words like the intellectual bullets they usually are.<br/><br/>To sum it up: while drifting off into his otherwise excellent reading, it's jarring and distracting to suddenly have such strange portrayal of a character who speaks with such frequency.
 My whole family loves the Harry Potter series and we had bought one copy of this set years ago.  The box/chest the books comes in is cardboard but sturdy and has held up very well over a period of about four years.  My daughter moved out recently and wanted a set for herself, so I bought another copy of this without hesitation.
 So glad to get the whole set at one time.
 I have to say that after reading the 2nd in the series, I know "get" why such a fuss has been made about Harry Potter.  I liked the first one, but this was truly masterful storytelling.<br/>I really love the boarding school aspect to this series and enjoyed seeing the kids return for the 2nd year.  This time the plot centered around the dark froces at Hogwarts being unleashed from the Chamber of Secrets.  There were so many plot twists and surprises.  The author offers hints, there is really no wasted information in this story.  I honestly could not put it down for the final 50 pages!<br/>It was so much fun to read- I have to go read volume 3!
 Nice set but the box is huge. My granddaughter loved the books, especially since they came in their own storage box.
 It's all one file so can be extremely difficult to maneuver.  Though the books themselves are wonderful!
 The illustrations are amazing and bring so much joy to my heart.
 Kudos to J.K. Rowling for a fitting and fantastic end to the Harry Potter series. She has fulfilled all of our hopes for the Boy Wizard and his friends while staying true to life and magic. Not everyone survives and we are saddened by some of the losses. Others get their final comeuppance - usually well-deserved. And there are surprises- oh yes, there are surprises.<br/><br/>Rowling's writing and characters have grown as the series has progressed. Literary "critics" can always find fault, but until one of them comes up with characters and stories like this, I figure it's just the jealous rantings of those-who-can't! I, for one, have enjoyed the joys, trials, successes and tribulations of Harry, Hermione, Ron and all the wizards and witches of this magical world since day 1. I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either.
 Bought these for my son.  Love the books and the box to keep them together.
 the whole harry potter series is great
 Read them every year.  They make you laugh, cry and everything in between.  Definitely in my to 10 all time favorites.
 An amazing set of these books. They are a gift for a 12 year old that is just begining to enjoy reading. She loves them!
 This review is for the<br/>Deluxe Harry Potter UK/Bloomsbury Publishing Volumes 1-7 Boxed Set (The Complete Harry Potter Collection)<br/><br/>Now that we are (well almost all) huge fans of the Harry Potter books... here is the set that you want for your library shelves. This is a first edition of this particular set and very special for several reasons. First they are the Great Britain version and have more story in each book, starting from the very first chapter of the first volume their is more detail - more Harry Potter what a delicious thought.<br/>They feel great in your hands, cloth bound ,all 3 sides of the pages are guilded, each book has a heavy duty,meant to last, ribbon marker.There are severeal different colors of book covers, and markers.  The front of each book has a beautiful color illustration of some event in that volume.  The title is gilded ,all 4 sides of each illustration is double gilded leaving the illustration with the slight illusion of being matted and at the bottom of each volume front cover the authors signiature is gilded.  The spine of each volume includes the name of the volume, authors name, and publishers symbol and Bloomsbury ( publishers house name ) all of the writing on the spines are guilded as well. The inside of the covers is covered in paper that complements the color of the cloth covers, only in the same color and being a comlimentary hue.<br/>The fabric covered slipcase houses all 7 of the books with a lovely crimson satin ribbon tie attached to the slipcover with strong,decorative,gold rivets, when displayed thusly the spins of all 7 volumes can be seen and the set is very pretty displayed this way with its ribbon tied in a tidy bow. The back of the slipcover case has in guilding the name of each volume written in pretty script.<br/>I have never spent this kind of money on any book or book set before, so why now?  I believe the Harry Potter books are already huge classics that generations are going to read, reread, read together as a family out loud,and be shared with  generations of family . Because I know that I will read these books over and over and because my children are as crazy about them as I am, and because I adore these stories, I decided I would splurge and go for the most beautiful set I could find for the most wonderful stories penned in decades. I will be reading these to my grandchildren in a few years.AND the topper on the cake was I wanted all of this beauty in the English Version of these volumes. In the next few years I will be holding these beautiful books in my hands and reading them to my grandchildren.  And of course their is a chance this set might become quit valuable over the years. And selfishly, I get to pick up these gorgeous British gems whenever I want and enjoy them myself, it's like a gourmet dinner , or your favorite hot beverage by the fireplace with a favorite book in a gourmet wrapper.
 It took a long time. I was reluctant, but this series is part of the literary canon now.<br/>Since I’ve read it, I can hold a conversation with people who grew up on it.<br/>I don’t regret reading it. Good message. Wordy.  A bit heavy handed.<br/>From an old millennial.  Jealous of magic
 This is the second one I have bought as a gift...
 Gift for my daughter and she loves it
 I'm at a loss as to why anyone would complain about getting all seven books in HARDCOVER of the best selling set of books of all time.  It's beyond me how someone could complain about paying less than $120 for this timeless set.  Oh, the box is to flimsy, it's not collectory enough.  Gimme a break.  What did you expect?  The REAL Harry Potter chest made out of wood with a brass shackle on the front?  I'm really disappointed in people's perception of reality nowadays, take a step back and think before you buy!!  Not counting salestax, it's listed right now for $115, divide that by 7 and you get $16.50 per book not including the box they come in and the stickers.  Really?  You're gonna complain about that?<br/><br/>You are missing out if you listen to these people moan and cry over something that has plenty of pictures in the description.  After all, 632 reviews can't be wrong, the thing is still rated up in the 5's.  It's a great set to have and each book is so think and has a book cover for each one.<br/><br/>Well worth the price.  If you don't think so, then go buy each book individually, you deserve it.
 All the books were there. The art is arty. The packaging was great.
 This was purchased as a gift and they loved it!!
 If you've read all the other Potter books you probably enjoy all the quirky but ever endearing characters.  In this final book Lord Voldemort's army grows in power and makes normal life for wizarding community impossible. After the death of Albus Dumbledore Harry, Hermoine and Ron set out to search and destroy the remaining Horcruxes to diminish the power of Lord Voldemort.

 Wonderful version it brings the story to life in pictures as well as words.
 This was a birthday gift for my son...loved it.
 Myself. 82 ye old reader
 I have always loved these books since they the first time I’ve read them when I was little. They are also the books that got me interested in reading in the first place.
 Gift for my grandson and he was thrilled with them.
 I couldn't ask for a better ending to a wonderful series of books !  J.K. Rowling is genius!  Fabulous... just fabulous!
 This review is for the Special Edition box set with covers by Kazu Kibuishi.<br/><br/>Man, this is a good set!  The cover work is beautiful and richly detailed (none of the images I've seen online do them justice- they look flat onscreen but have nice depth and detail in person), with fully developed scenes on both the front and the back covers.  The designs are not 'wrap-around' either.  There is an additional scene of Hogwarts visible when you line up the spines, so you are actually getting 15 new cover images.  I really like that the new artist kept his designs compatible with the interior illustrations (they still use the GranPre chapter illustrations so a radically different art style would have been jarring).  I had given my paperbacks away, since I've got the set in hardback and in eBook... but I had to get this when I saw it, and I don't begrudge a single penny I spent.  If you are a Collector, get this set.  If you are looking to replace copies that have been read to tatters, get this set.  If you are introducing a child to their first Harry Potter books, get this set.  In fact, for whatever reason, just get this set!
 It's the 3rd time I've read the complete series it's still awesome
 Love the series of harry potter. Would recommend this book to anyone.
 For my 9 yr old granddaughter, she’s in love with her books
 The Harry Potter series is a charming collection of novels and Chamber of Secrets is no exception.  Chamber is a novel with appeal to all ages, much outside the 9-12 market in the book description.  For young adults, Chamber will be a challenging and exciting read (and reread).  For adults, Chamber is fun.  It'll take you back to your youth.  One thing I find striking about J.K. Rowling is her extraordinary knack of being able to capture the essence of young adulthood.  Harry, for all his wizardness, is special and unique in the way all 12 year olds are.  His friends are great and his adventures are entertaining.  A fun read all around.
 So happy I got this set! I’ve been wanting to get it for myself and my 9 year old and I finally gave in this year. Everything comes exactly as expected, the cardboard storage box in the pictures is pretty sturdy. Can’t wait till he opens this on Christmas!
 unlike a lot of series, each book enthralls you for the next.  as harry potter matures, so does the storyline.  i started reading them just to see how close the movies were to the books and to make sure they were suitable for the kids to read.  strange to say, but the movies deviate only slightly, which is refreshing.  yes, it is fantasy, but so brilliantly written, that you tend to be able to see it in your mind's eye to the point of wanting to read more.  i congratulate J. K. Rowling for her cunning insight and being able to take the trials of growing up and entwining it into a fabulous fantasy.
 I am a total fan.  I love all of the Harry Potter books.  I've read them all and listened to them all.
 Awesome box set! My son is flying through these books &amp; the box keeps them back together when he finishes
 So all my friends were telling me I had to read Harry Potter. I got this book set to see what all the fuss was about. I've only read sorcerer's stone so far, but it's lots of fun, and if all of the other books are as fun then everybody was right. The boxed set itself is nice. It's colorful, seems pretty sturdy and the artwork is nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because even though I ordered it with the super saver shipping (which I know takes longer and is normally fine) it still took over a month before I got my books.
 I am old for a Harry Potter fan, 32 to be exact and I have no children.  That has not stopped me from falling in love with Harry and his friends at Hogwarts.  I received my copy of Goblet Saturday at 10 am and devoured it,  finishing it Sunday at 5:30  pm.  This book is considerably darker than the  first 3 but it is still fun and enchanting to read.  What little  information initially given about the plot had me, like many readers,  expecting certain things but it twists in ways I never imagined.  The  deceit and betrayals in this book and certain hints at the end lead me to  believe Book 5 will uncover a villain who has, in past books, protected  Harry.  The only thing I'm frustrated over is now having to wait another  year for # 5! (By the way, I have already started to re-read, slower this  time!)
 The conclusion of one of my favorite series as a child, however, there are at least 2-3 pages for each page number for the kindle edition, making it seem at first glance like there are pages missing. It is the full book, but the the first three pages are numbered "1" and this trend continues for the rest of the book.
 This book gets better and better every time I read it.
 This is by far the best set of Harry Potter books I have seen. Worth the money
 I grew up with these books. There aren't really words to describe how much I love these to this day. This isn't really a review of the books, but rather the digital edition.<br/><br/>I was thrilled when the ebooks were finally released but at the same time hesitant to drop nearly $60 on books I already owned several printed copies of. Naturally I completely missed the promotional $15 price, wish I'd heard about it. Still, I couldn't resist the lure of being able to carry all seven books with me wherever I went and finally I gave in.<br/><br/>Totally worth it.<br/><br/>If you like the convenience of having all the books with you, or are just slightly obsessed, I'd get the ebooks. If you don't really care and just read at home, I think the printed box set might actually be slightly cheaper.<br/><br/>The books are super easy to navigate. It's all seven in one huge book, but using the "go to" feature on the kindle I can just jump from book to book, with a table of contents in each book to jump chapters. I haven't experienced any of the glitches some of the other reviews mentioned, but I'm only one book in, so we'll see how it goes.<br/>Was pleasantly surprised to see the drawings left in at the start of each chapter too.<br/><br/>There's not really much else to say. Glad to have yet another copy of these to carry with me everywhere, haha.
 I got this set for around $36, I couldn’t be happier!
 I watched the movies because i’ve never really been big on reading, but i liked it so much and heard that the movies are actually wrong about a lot of things so i bought the books. The first book is bent and thay really really bothers me. I’m not gonna be extra and send it back but it’s very disappointing and annoying.
 Love! Love! Love! Got it on time. Box was perfect. Fun read with my kids!
 Great finale of a great series.
 I am a late bloomer in the world of Harry Potter (starting reading in December 2010 through April 2011).  I did not understand what the big deal was...until I finally read the books myself.  I bought the paperback box set and from early into the first book I was hooked.  Every book is awesome and they get even better as you go along.  They are very addicting, complex, are not predictable and are full of surprises.  After 7 books, you have invested so much into the characters that they really become special to the reader.  The characters are dynamic, especially the relationship between Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  The connection between Harry and Lord Voldemort and their destined showdown is very engaging.  Many of the movies truly do not do the books justice, but some are real good in their own right and it's cool to see some things come to life.  I enjoyed the books so much that I bought this hardcover box set - hardcover books are meant to last, are collector's items, and the cover art on front and back are pretty cool later (first four are kind of silly and childish...as the books become darker, the cover art became more serious) .  The trunk case is kind of cool and protects the books from dust.  I am reading the books again, and they are even better the second time around.  I highly recommend these books to everyone - as a whole they are truly a masterpiece.
 Great illustrated edition of the book series that defines a generation — the Harry Potter Generation.
 The spine and cover are breaking Away from the pages upon first open
 Amazon shipped this set lightning quick and safely packed, and of course brand new. I'm not sure why anyone would choose to buy from other sellers on the list; Amazon always has the best price for brand new items!  I also pre-ordered the 7th book at the same time.  People here who complain about the publishers compiling &amp; selling a six book boxed set when there is a seventh book out soon don't understand the fact that a lot of us don't mind buying the boxed set of the first six books. We didn't have any of the HP books until I bought this set. I'm happy I didn't have to purchase them all seperately. I get to read these hard cover books to my children, children not child, which means I'll be buying more sets for sure. Each will want to have their own collection, of course.  And the people who say it's pricey?!?!  I have to disagree. $16.65 approximately is not expensive for a hard cover book of this nature. And you will own it &amp; reread it time &amp; again. My almost 5 yr &amp; 3yr old love the movies &amp; even better, they sit quitely to listen to me read the HP books to them. My 9 month old will too enjoy the stories as he is introduced to them over &amp; over by his sisters no doubt.  Also watching the movies convinced me to buy the books because the movies tend to jump around &amp; not explain why something occurred. I'm glad I was able to purchase this set so I can play catch up before book 7 arrives! We all want to "find out" what happens individually] without others giving the finale away.<br/><br/>A Great Purchase All the way !!!!!
 It's exactly what you want. It's well packaged and the books will be well loved.
 Good Story, Nice Case, Good Print
 Actually, I'll risk getting lynched by rating this 3.5 stars, but the system won't let me. let's just say that, while it's an okay book, it certainly wasn't worth the tremendous hype, or the original cover price. I'm glad I only paid half-price for it.<br/><br/>Yes, I read the darn thing in three days, and yes, the ending was  satisfying, except for the unnecessary epilogue chapter. But Deathly Hallows is not the best in the series, and it would have been substantially improved by being about 200 pages shorter. There are a lot of places where it just bogs down, such as when Harry, Ron, and Hermione dash off on their ill-planned Duh! quest for several weeks, and the entire pointless let's-dive-into-Snape's-memories and Harry-in-Celestial-Limbo chapters, which, coming as they do in the middle of the way-too-long final battle, brings the building tension and all the action to a screeching halt. We already figured out several books ago that a) Snape is a Tortured Character and b) Dumbledore is dead. We don't need these ideas pounded home by a series of heavy-handed flashbacks.<br/><br/>And that's what bothers me about this book. It takes itself way too seriously. Where is the fun and weirdness of the previous books? Granted, good vs. evil is a serious topic, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring. This book has no charm; it reads like a war manual. It does have a complex cast of characters that weave in and out of the story, making references to obscure events from several books ago that most readers have probably forgotten. And it does have way too many subplots, many of which seem to have been grafted on at the last minute, including the distracting search for the Three Mystical Objects that isn't even brought up until page 400 or so. One gets tired of all that angst; even Shakespeare had his jolly gravediggers. I think we should have seen more of the wacky Luna, and Neville in his more usual inept form rather than the stiff walk-on character he has turned into.<br/><br/>Now here's what I liked about this book: a lot of loose ends were nicely tied up. Not all (we never learn the fate of the house elves, or several minor characters), but a lot of little details in previous books suddenly become very important, and this gives the series a tightly-woven completeness which really makes the ending shine. (The real ending, not the epilogue). And despite his clumsy memory flashbacks, I was most satisfied with the revelations of Snape's true character, much of which I suspected all along, and I am far more intrigued by his fate than that of any other character, including the entire Weasley clan. The moral of this review is, Deathly Hallows is an absolutely necessary read for hard core Potter fans, but don't expect too much from it. You won't be disappointed.
 Spoiler Free: My feelings on The Hallows are some what inexpressible, other then to say, I was completely floored, Rowling opened the flood gates on her talent and let it pure out. In an interview with The Today Show JKR. said that she was determined to write the best book possible. I think that she succeeded by a landslide. In all the months of waiting and wading through all my personal speculation, I couldn't have imagined a better ending. Even had the series gone on for another seven books.<br/><br/>So.. Do I Think book 7 holds the answers to all the burning questions we've been asking? in the main yes, in as far as they were relevant to the plot, and to Rowling's overall vision. Did 7 fulfill everything I expected? Not everything no, there were somthings left out that JK. said would be included. but to be fair a lot was probably lost or changed during the editing process, I'm curious about certain things of course, but given the finshed product, I can't complain. It is I think my favorite of the series, followed by POA. and GOF. Jo really gave us and Harry her whole heart in this one. The result is not only one of the bust series closers I've ever read, but bar non one of the best books period.<br/><br/>Saying goodbye to Harry was very difficult to say the least, I read extra slow jut to hold on a little longer, I even got the Deluxe Edition in part because of the expanded page count cotaining full page chapter illustrations, which in a  small way extended the experience, and made the book into somthing of a keepsake.<br/><br/>Like many millions of potter fans, I will miss the nail biting wait, wild speculation, and finally the ultimate satisfaction of holding that next novel in my hands. And I sort of pity the coming generations of Potter Fans that they won't really get to feel what it was like.<br/><br/>My Potter sits proudly with my Tolkein, Dickens, Austen, and Bronte just waiting to be reread, and I will, so really it's not goodbye but rather hello again and again.
 Read the movies before you watch the books.
 Having stayed up all night to read this massive book, my eyes are gritty, my head is full of sand, and I'm pretty sure my breath reeks, and I crave sleep so desperately. And, because I really don't want to give away too many spoilers, this'll possibly be one of the shortest (and most scattershot) reviews I'll drop on the site.<br/><br/>Was the reading experience worth it? Yes, it was. Was it what I expected? I'll say this: there's not much wonderment and playfulness in this book. With everything seriously on the line in Harry Potter's magical world and a sense of doom prevailing throughout, there's no time at all for frivolity. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go about their task of seeking out and destroying the Horcruxes, and they discover that that quest is fraught with much interminable waiting and frustration, many stumbling blocks, and tons of dead ends. Much of the book has the trio striving to stave off capture from Voldemort's forces as they fruitlessly search for clues, and steadily growing more despondent as results prove to be few and far between. Also, not as much Hogwarts as I'd hoped, which, to me, was always the most glorious part of the series. There are casualties, as the author's promised, but, thank goodness for me, my favorite characters made it thru.<br/><br/>On the down side, many sequences plod, especially in the first half. Stuff does happen, but in between are many moments rife with not much going on except for Harry's soul-searchings and internal struggles. But it's realistic that Harry Potter doesn't arrive at the conclusions or achieve his tasks in a speedy manner. After all, Dumbledore, in the previous book, really didn't give him much of a blueprint. Harry is confused, angry, disillusioned, and frightened. But, still throughout, he remains determined, brave and true to the cause. His best friends, Ron and the very clever and resourceful Hermione, are with him. Mostly.<br/><br/>Rowling answers most of the questions. Is Snape good or evil (yes, there's still some doubt)? Who will live? Who will die? Will Harry end up with Ginny? And how can Harry possibly defeat He Who Must Not Have A Nose? Rowling delves deep into Dumbledore's past and also introduces new magical elements in the form of the Deathly Hallows, a trio of powerful artifacts purported to have mastery over Death. Thus, Harry is faced with a new conflict: Hallows or Horcruxes? By the way, it ticks me off  a bit that she drops this new bit of news seemingly off the cuff. No foreshadowing in other books about the Hallows (that I can recall, anyway).<br/><br/>Again, it's a massive book. At 759 pages, Rowling strives to put a capper on all the dangling plotlines and, more or less, succeeds. Many of the supporting cast from prior books make an appearance, if ever so briefly. But the rollcall of characters is so vast that many of our favorites are given the once over and then simply shoved to the background. The focus is, naturally, predominantly on Harry, Hermione, and Ron, with Voldemort getting some moments here and there.<br/><br/>By the way, I mentioned that portions of the book are slow. That doesn't mean that there aren't moments of extreme peril and tearful sadness, sequences of explosive action and hairbreath escapes thrown in. And the finale is totally, totally worth it. Believe me.<br/><br/>I guess I went on longer than I initially thought. Let me close this now by stating that the Harry Potter series is one of my all time favorites. I'll miss it greatly, because, even though I'll re-read this series often, it won't ever again have that initial sense of impending anticipation and excitement. I wish I can develop amnesia just so I can re-discover Harry Potter. There are still two new Harry Potter film adaptations to look forward to, but it's just not the same. *Sigh* I guess I'm off to sleep now.
 I was hoping for the case as well, however all the books are in fair condition.  You can tell they were very loved which only adds to the character and reading experience.
 Nice addition to my collection!!
 A fun little cardboard chest and stickers to put wherever that come with quality hardcover books with paper sleeves. I wouldn't recommend for kids who are rough with their stuff as the chest might not hold up, but who cares since it was a gift for them, right?
 There is no other way to describe this series except to simply say - it is complete crack for readers.<br/><br/>Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I have read this series 6 times! I know that isn't near as many as others, but it is a lot for me.<br/><br/>I find Rowling's characters lovable and relate able. There is a character for every reader to identify with in some way. She brings readers on a journey with Harry, Ron &amp; Hermoine, and what a journey it is.<br/><br/>Now that all 7 books have been published, this is a great time to start reading (if you haven't already).<br/><br/>This series is NOT about witchcraft - it is about friendship, loyalty, love, trust, believing in oneself, etc.<br/><br/>This series will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come. As a reader, you should take this journey too.
 I started reading the Harry Potter books when they first came out. Here's to all of us who had to wait years to see what would happen next! We hung on this long so I would say Harry is timeless.
 Illustrations are beautiful. My son and I love it
 finally, it had been deliveried, children happy so mucj.
 Nice set! Will be Christmas present
 Great for any fan of the movie series - of course the book is always better.
 I bought 2 sets of these books. I got them at a steal for only $38!! They're in mint condition, no issues with the books or shipping. My son and niece are going to be over the moon about this Christmas gift!
 Love the art in this story!
 Nice to have my favorite books accessible  everywhere I go.  If you're a Potter fan, I recommend buying.
 Came in perfect condition! I bought them used and I couldn’t be anymore happier with my choice because they got to me in a timely maner and obviously it’s harry Potter duh who wouldn’t love these books!
 I bought the whole set including the 2nd part of this disc. I like it.
 Very excited about these! I am collecting Harry Potter for my infant son. This is a great value for the books. The box is not a collectors item, as mentioned several times over, but it is more fun that wrapping paper if you are giving as a gift. As someone else mentioned, the cost of the box and the stickers above the cost of the books is about $3 more (Cheaper than most wrapping paper and a hallmark card.) I saw some mention of missing pages so I broke the plastic to check on book 5 and/or 6. Nothing was missing. Hopefully, that only happened to a few but it's worth checking given Amazon's return policy. It's true the pages aren't a heavy paper...but I don't see the problem. You can read it...so it does what it's supposed to.  I went back in forth between these and the more expensive British version because I thought I might like that cover art more. At the end of the day...I went with these. Cover art is still cool and I looked up examples of the language differences and decided that might make reading these more cumbersome for a child who's just learning to read. The american version still features some British terms but colloquialisms are swapped for ones that make more sense depending on country of origin. Someone mentioned that we "must be dumber on this side of the pond." It has nothing to do with intelligence or vocabulary. Some sayings just aren't going to make sense if you aren't from Great Brit. If that doesn't make sense to that specific reviewer, they need to see definition colloquialism. :-)
 What I Loved:  The friendships!  G. Lockheart (just because he was fabulously stupid) and Snape (which I read every scene he is in with a different perspective than the first time).  I loved when Harry got a name to being able to talk to snakes and also got a history lesson on why it was not looked at kindly.<br/><br/>What I Liked: The more description we get of Hogwarts and how the school is run.  I could probably say this about this exact same thing about the first 4 books but I really do think it adds a lot to the story.  You realize that school is very important and that the lessons are for life!<br/><br/>Why I gave it a 4:  This book had one of my favorite silly characters in G. Lockheart.  Is he good? No. Is he evil? Not really.  Is he fun to read? Absolutely!  I must add I thought he was brilliantly acted in the film too :)<br/><br/>Who would I recommend it too:  Honestly, anyone. This is a magical story for people of all ages.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite series to read and love my annual re-reading of them. If you are one of the few that have not read the books--you really should whether your young or young at heart!<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/>Read Again: 11/02/2010 (Watched the Movie again 10/27/2010)
 I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan, I wanted all the books but I'm trying to cut down on physical things so buying the complete collection on my Kindle was perfect. Rereading the series for the third time!
 This was purchased for my grandson and he loves that he has all of the volumes in one place.
 Loved this book, in the series is the second year of Harry's at Hogwarts. Harry has problems with a house elf who causes he and Ron are sealed out of  platform 9 3/4. They take Ron's dad Flying Ford Anglia back to Hogwarts. This leads to much trouble for them plus the other trouble as the semester at Hogwarts moves along. The characters are very well defined, and as the story unfolds more and more terror as people are petrified and Harry is accused of being the heir of Slytherin. Ron,  and Hermione and Harry try to solve the mystery. But, then Hermione is petrified, he and Ron have to go it alone. I really enjoyed the story. It is an excellent book. I'd recommend it as a read for anyone. I've read this book twice and watched the movie based  on the book many times. I still enjoy it.
 Got it, read it, loved it.
 he tells me about every chapter:):)
 Requested Christmas gifts for grandson
 I didn't get into the Harry Potter series until after the fourth book came out - I'm an adult, after all, and these are kids books. I'm a geek, though, and tons of my geek parent friends were hooked, telling me that they're more well-written than a lot of the books being published for adults these days. Whatever, they are VERY entertaining, and that's what I look for in a book! So, I had some in paperback, and some in hardcover, which looked very weird on my shelf. My inner OCD child was not happy, lol.<br/><br/>After a move, the books were lost. No big deal, I had read them, and was disappointed enough in the ending that I didn't think I'd re-read them. Then, after the last movie, my adult son suddenly decided that he wanted to read them! He does NOT like to read if it's longer than a Wiki article, so this was exciting. It was just before the holidays, and this set was on sale! I did look through the used books, but couldn't find the first one at less than a collector's price, and with shipping, it would cost more than this set, anyway.<br/><br/>Not only are all the books the same size, but it's in a compact, handy open-faced box so it's easy to move around. Some of those books were HEAVY in hardback, so I'm very happy with these!
 My five year olds loves when we read this book.
 NOTE: I strongly implore you to read ALL of the first six Harry Potter books BEFORE you read this one. If you fail to do so, you WILL NOT understand this book.<br/><br/>Also, you will want to be a speed-reader to really appreciate the swiftness of some of this book's events. Speed-reading simulates the speed of a movie superbly.<br/><br/>This book answered almost all of my questions about the Harry Potter series' characters in a brilliant and witty way. I enjoyed it so much, I almost snarled at people who disturbed me and I stayed up until 3:00 in the morning finishing it.<br/><br/>I don't want to go too in-depth about the book because that'd spoil it, but suffice it to say that this book alone is reason enough to read the entire Harry Potter series from start to finish just to appreciate the masterpiece J.K. Rowling has created.
 That this series didn't have to come to an end.  And it doesn't, Ms. Rowling!!<br/><br/>This was one of the better books in the series.  She worked with an editor who encouraged her to stop using so many -ly adverbs (angrily, hautily, etc.), and the writing's improved because of it.<br/><br/>I've read where others complained that Hermoine and Ginny threw themselves at Ron and Harry.  Balderdash.  These characters are now 17 years old, not 11.  Hormones are natural with teenagers, whether those teenagers are wizards or muggles.  Rowling acknowledges that.  Also, others complained about Ron's book which provides insight into girls.  How is that different than reading Cosmo or any of those other magazines?  And still others complained about the profanity.  There isn't that much in a 700+ page book.  Finally, one reviewer stated that she took this book away from her nine year old child.  Excuse me, who would let a nine year old try to read this book?  Probably the same kind of parent who takes a nine year old to an "R" rated movie and then complains about the violence and language.  Sigh...<br/><br/>Yes, "Hallows" was a dark book.  But when you have an epic battle between good and evil, things will be dark (Stephen King's "The Stand," for example).  And, as Harry phrases it, "This is war!"  In every war, there are casualities and collateral damage.<br/><br/>Jo Rowling does a great job of bringing the saga full circle.  We see characters we haven't seen since the beginning.  Wizards, giants, goblins, house-elves, other magicals, and muggles populate this book.  The book did sag in the middle when our trio searched for the Horcruxes.  That part was about 200-300 pages too long.  It picked up again when they made their way to Hogwarts.  But remember, this is an epic.  And any epic worth its salt will be on the long side.<br/><br/>As the story ends, there is an epilogue that takes place 19 years later.  If Jo Rowling wants to stop writing, that's her choice.  I wish she'd allow other writers to pick up this tale and fill in those missing years.  I think people would have great fun with it.  She once blasted fan fiction writers who wrote their own tales as a way to deal with the angst of waiting for her to finish these books.  There is nothing wrong with fan fiction.  Other writers would enjoy filling in that 19 year period, and we could have even more Harry Potter-related stories.  Hey, it worked for Star Wars and Star Trek and James Bond; why not Harry Potter??<br/><br/>You'll enjoy this book if you've enjoyed the series.  And to those who complain??  You remind me of a person who'd complain if he got a  million dollars that he'd have to pay taxes on it.  Take some deep breaths, relax, and eat a Chocolate Frog.
 I don't know where did Rowling gets her inspiration (must be someplace where Tolkien, Lewis and others got it to, please guys... let us now!) but this stories are beyond the five stars allowed here. You want to just sit down and read a book to the end in one day, because is so great you keep wondering what will happen to Harry and his friends in the next page. These are great books for kids and "adult" kids, I mean, these are great to any age, as long as the reader has the willing mind to create all this fantastic history in its mind.
 Who doesn't love JK Rowling's work? Fantastic!
 Love it! Have it alone centered on the top shelf of my bookshelf and it looks beautiful!
 Harry potter! Illustrated!!!
 -No spoilers here-<br/>While reading the final pages of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", one is overcome with a bittersweet feeling... part of you pushing on to the very last page to see Harry's fate, but part of you longing to take a step back... because you know these are the last words of Harry you'll ever read. Of course, the latter never prevails. Rowling takes you so in depth and on the edge of your seat with her masterful skill and talent that you cannot help but soak in every last drop and re-read the last line in the bitter hopes that another few sentences will appear out of no where so you don't have to say goodbye to Harry and the gang.<br/><br/>This conclusion to the "epic tale of Harry Potter" is remarkably dark and mature, showing that Harry has grown along with its readers, which was incredibly brave of Rowling to undertake. The maturity of the text is showing us that Harry has not just grown up a year since the last book, but that he's turned into a man with mature and life-threatening decisions he must make.<br/>Yes, there are deaths. Yes, there are tears. Yes, it is violent. But one gobbles it all up, and is thankful for the privilege. If you have not read "Deathly Hallows" yet and have not been spoiled by the media and have not yet heard the ending, you may be tempted to peek at the end to see Harry's fate, but don't! This is a 700 page journey you don't want to spoil by peeking!
 All the books came in perfect condition, got them as a gift for a fellow Harry Potter fan.
 What kid would be so desperate to go back to school, he'd steal a car to do it? Harry Potter, that's who. Okay, he didn't technically steal the car, and he technically didn't drive it. And technically, he probably shouldn't have returned to Hogwarts at all. But for Harry, anything is better than staying locked up and starved at the Dursleys'. With a rip-roaring case of homesickness and fearing his friends have abandoned him, Harry returns to Hogwarts, only to find the biggest adventure and most frightening danger of his life to date.<br/><br/>I'm reading Harry Potter for the first time as an adult, and my friends have assured me the books become more mature as the series progresses. Chamber of Secrets is a real step up from Sorcerer's Stone--not horribly dark, but definitely more demanding of your time and emotional investment. You will barely be able to put it down until you know what happens next and that so far, everyone is okay. As second year students Harry, Ron, and Hermione face more mature problems and bigger challenges, all of which J.K. Rowling crafts with a deft and talented hand.<br/><br/>The best adjective for Chamber of Secrets is "intriguing." I especially enjoyed the mystery surrounding the Heir of Slytherin and his or her desire to eliminate Muggle-born students from Hogwarts. It reminds me, in a fantasy-friendly way, of eugenics and the quest of good people to identify and stop such practices. That subplot also lends itself to some wonderful introspection and growth for Harry. He remembers the Sorting Hat almost placed him in Slytherin, and must now face not only who he is, but who he will become in light of his life so far. I loved J.K.'s idea of the villain placing some of him or herself inside Harry. It reminds me of the psychological concept of the "shadow twin"--that is, our evil sides, who we could be if we didn't use our moral and ethical compasses.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets because much of it reads like a mystery. Unlike other "kids'" mysteries, it's not easy to figure out, either. As with all good mysteries, the solution and whodunit make sense once you see them. Until then, the Chamber of Secrets is quite a ride. Several times I thought I knew where the story was going only to be surprised. Bravo, Ms. Rowling.<br/><br/>Some moments within the book are intense or even legitimately spine-chilling, even for a woman in her early thirties. Insider tip: don't read this if you're phobic about spiders or snakes. In particular, keep a careful eye on Chapter 15. With that said, it's often fun to be a little scared, and kudos again to J.K. for tickling my spine. The final scenes in the girls' bathroom are some of her best so far, especially the basilisk and accompanying serpent motif. (Although, side note: why, in a magical school where delicious food can appear on demand and students can turn into each other, are the bathrooms such pits? Well, that's middle school bathrooms for ya, I guess). :)<br/><br/>I can't end this review without pointing out a few other great parts. The main trio acquits itself well, and of course Harry is the hero of the day. But Hermione is an absolute champ in this one, proving a true friend will go to any lengths to protect and help those she cares about. The plot twist with Tom Riddle's diary and Ginny is executed brilliantly, as is the bit with Dumbledore's secret weapons. I also appreciated the little bits about the founders of Hogwarts; I'd love to see J.K. publish a book about them. Oh, and the bit with Dobby and the sock at the end? Brilliant again--finally, a Malfoy got what was coming to them!<br/><br/>Final verdict? Read this--during the day when possible--and enjoy the adventure.
 I have the read the Harry Potter series numerous times, but this is such a wonderful new way to explore the books. I am re-reading the books to my 7 and 5 year old who are just as enchanted as I am by these illustrations. It's a perfect companion to my ever-growing HP collection. I will definitely be buying the whole collection of illustrated books as they come out!
 BOOKS WERE BRAND NEW AND A GREAT EDITION TO MY COLLECTION OF KID'S BOOKS
 This book set, is the best ever to come out. And best of all, is cheap, but still very good, cause where I live they charge more than $12 for the paperback edition (each book), which I think is to much, but the box set is indeed for people who can not pay to much, but wants to read the Harry Potter books.<br/>To tell you the truth I was not interested in the Harry Potter series, but yeah sure, I heard from some of my friends talking about the books and everything, althought I didn't understand it very well since they read it in spanish, but after seeing the second installment of the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I became interested. I bought the box set, and I started reading, and I've notice that the movies are indeed very different to the books. So I kept on reading until the 5th book came out, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Bought it, read it in a couple of day ,and ,love it as much as the four previous books. And now I can't wait till the 6th and 7th book come out.<br/>So I recommend these books to anyone that likes or loves to read.<br/>P.S.<br/>  Sorry I didn't give descriptions pr said anything  about the story. I don't want to spoil anyones readings.
 His his sturdy. Good product
 I received my book via Amazon on the date of release...my daughter snatched it up and ready it in 1 1/2 days. Busy with work and getting ready for vacation I limited myself to 1 chapter a day. This worked out very well for me as I am the type that loves the anticipation and excitement more than the actual event (such as Christmas morning!). I closed the passenger door of our minivan and began to read until finished. Wow! Fantastic ending - the best book yet. Despite the leaks of the ending on-line and via friends....I held onto my faith that the good always wins, and evil always loses. Thank you JK Rowling for re-affirming this in your book so wrought with controversy in the christian arena. Magic, love, growing pains and all - a fantastic series to all those who believe in the fantasy of fiction and the imagination!
 I had purchased all the Harry Potter books for my daughter as she was growing up. When she moved out, she took her books with her so I was looking for a quick replacement for my own shelves. I saw this set and thought it would be good.<br/><br/>The case is okay, I guess, as it is just cardboard but it will work for my purposes. The stories seem to be a shortened version of the stories in the original books but they have all the important information and are good reads. The books, however, are not so good. The first 3 books were fine, but in reading the Goblet of Fire, I am finding several pages were the printing must have run out of ink. At the top of the page the printing is fine but it fades out to nothing by the bottom. I have run into about 5 pages of this in the book so far. I have not finished the book or started the rest of the series so I do not know if it is limited to just this book. If I did not know the story by heart, by reading the other books and having the DVDs, the missing pages would be a problem.
 Awesome illustrations! Perfect for the Harry Potter fan that has everything.
 This was given as a gift. My grandchildren love it.
 The collection is really great.  Full of imagination, magic and drama.  Loved it.
 Definitely a not to be missed book - perhaps the best story of our time!<br/><br/>Howev, my review is about something else.<br/><br/>The last 20 pages or so are so mundane, forgetful, so frustrating - that I am compelled to say, FORGET IT!<br/><br/>This is from a dear fan who is on the same page with you - you will be happier if you never read the conclusion - seems forced, contrived, wooden, and not at all what I would expect these characters to do.  Strange.<br/><br/>I think you will have a much happier time if you just closed the book before the epilogue - If you check it out, you won't like it and it will trouble you.<br/><br/>I really, really mean it !!!!!  It seems dashed off - like they were in a hurry!  Too Hollywood for HP!!!!!!!!  Avoid that last bit with determination - just a few pages!!!!  You'll prefer it -<br/><br/>With love and respect -<br/><br/>Scott
 Great condition. Love these books. Arrived fast
 Haven't read them since I was a kid; still the same magical experience as an adult!
 My daughter was loving these books right up until she started getting pages almost too feint to read. They are intermittent but are annoying.
 I have to assume that at this point anybody just now looking for a review of the Harry Potter series has been living under a rock for a long time but here it goes.  I read these books for the first time when I was well over 50 and some time after the rest of the world had already done so.  My niece warned me that the first book might seem a little simplistic but that the themes became more adult as the series progressed.  Although I would agree that the books became deeper and a little darker as they progressed highlighting the eons old theme of good versus evil I would have to say I enjoyed the wonder and general escapism in every volume.  I know J.K. is very very rich now but I think she earned every penny since seldom does someone manage to create an entire  world so detailed and nuanced as to be completely believable to a reader regardless of age. These stories are truly timeless and as such can be enjoyed and shared over and over again.
 Excellent! I was a big fan as a kid, but could only afford to rent the books. But now as an adult, I finally bought the whole set. The paper quality is good, if not the best. I would strongly recommend buying the whole set and saving about $25, instead of buying each book separately.<br/><br/>PS: this is the US version.
 Perfect for our 11 year old grandson!  He loves them and has read three in a couple of weeks!
 I had to have the set. Perfect condition. Thank you!
 I bought this book for just over two dollars and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was in perfect condition when it arrived.  The only noticeable problems are occasional notes or drawings in the margins (only about 3 total), and folded corners of the book's jacket.  It was definitely a good deal and I appreciate this seller immensely.
 It is a great sequel to the first book. It has a lot of fun bits that the movie lacks.
 i enjoyed it. wrapped up things nicely and in a fairly decent way. people died - some that hurt to read. i liked harry all the way thru... keeping in mind he was a 17-yr-old that was being asked to possibly die and all he really wanted to do most the time was be with the girl he liked... we were mostly in his head with his unvarnished desires. why wouldn't he want that? i liked all of them. i will miss them.<br/>read some of the negative reviews and I don't quite understand. this is a kids series. the somewhat trite epilogue does what the younger readers needed. that there aren't a lot of surprises... is unsurprising. didn't see any "adult situations" that my younger relatives shouldn't be reading... Ginny gives Harry a kiss on his b-day... big deal. and ron says "effing" a couple times - spelled like that - so i imagine that's okay. some typos - Lucious (thats probably mispelled) is referd to as Malfoy for about a page... that was a little confusing as he and voldermort were discussing Malfoy (that was the major one).<br/>The only reason it loses one star is that i thought it could have stood a bit of editting. more back story on harry's parents maybe - got a bit convoluted with the Albus stuff and i think perhaps JKR wanted to just wrap it up in a nice bow at the end... it didn't quite fit. the final duel is a let down. just sort of want to mumble "that's it?"<br/>It did drag in places but I figure that it was basically a war book... that's what war is. long periods of boredom marked by startling blinding violence. It did bother me that harry, ron &amp; hermone seemed to be dueling to disarm instead of kill right to the end. bit stupid. their loved ones were dying - they should have been... at the very least using some more brutal curses.<br/>In all, this is probably the third best in the series coming in behind the 4th and the 3rd where i felt the series peaked. It was a sweet ending though and I wasn't diasappointed.
 I loved the first and the sixth audiobooks in the Harry Potter series so much that I ended up buying them all within about a month's time.  Why? Jim Dale continues to deliver in these wonderful, witty and well-narrated one mans show with a great grasp of the characters, giving each one a voice all his or her own. He obviously has spent his time getting inside the characters' minds, expressing voices that are believable and enjoyable.  Mr. Dale does a great job of bringing this popular series to life. You might find yourself saying that you will only listen to one or two chapters at a time and the next thing you know, you're through four CDS!  That's how I ended up with all six audiobooks in less than a month!<br/><br/>It is a genuine pleasure to listen to him do what is a one man show. I feel his best character voices include Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, Ron Weasley and his mother, as well as the Dursleys. His take on Gilderoy Lockhart was awesome and hilarious!  In many ways, he sounded like Kenneth Branaugh in the movie role.  I feel he is still developing Harry's voice and it differed a little in this installment, showing us a Harry growing up and maturing. He again pronounces Voldemort's name "Voldemore"; I think this must be the way the British might pronounce the dark lord's name but he adds the "T" sound, beginning in either the fifth or sixth books, perhaps to appease American readers?<br/><br/>Audiobooks are great because you can take them anywhere or do things you couldn't do with a regular book such as chores, go to the gym or for a walk or run, driving for fun or to and from work, going for a walk, spending time with the family listening together and so on. Highly recommended with Awesome packaging and great artwork from the series!  I know once I finish all six of these, I'll want to listen to them again.
 I had never read any of the Harry Potter books before, and I decided since I was going to have surgery and 2 weeks in bed to recover, now was the time.  This box set is a steal if you want to buy all the books at the same time - I think I paid around $50.  They are paperbacks, but not the cheap-o teeny tiny size paperback books you buy in the checkout line at the grocery store.  The covers are very good quality and so is the binding.  The binding HAS to be good to endure the constant opening, closing, bending, and holding flat that especially the books that are 600-700ish pages long go through while being read.  The box itself is a high quality corrugated cardboard with a matte-finish, slick full-color design.  I have loved having the next book at my fingertips as soon as I finished the one that precedes it.  Even though I'm an adult, this series is absolutely addicting.  (OK, confession, I wasn't too enamored with the first book, but read it and then the second one and you will be hooked)  I finished the first four books in 3 weeks and am more slowly making my way through the last three now that I'm back at work.  This set is one that I will be happy to keep around and share with my neices and nephews as they get older.  It looks nice enough to go on anybody's home-library bookshelf, and would make a nice gift.
 love this book series
 I loved these books and can't wait to read them again.
 When completing Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (book six) so long ago, I remember questioning whether everything could possibly be wrapped up in one more volume.  I was trying to determine if I had officially heard there would be but seven volumes or whether that was just a widely held but unconfirmed belief based on the wizard academy's duration (seven years).  I felt the manner in which book six ended could have opened the door to several more volumes.  If there was to be one last volume, I could not fathom how JK Rowling would finish the Harry Potter saga in a tidy fashion.<br/><br/>Shows what I know.  Book seven, The Deathly Hallows, has been confirmed as the final book (at least for now) and it concluded in a most satisfactory fashion.  Questions were resolved.  Back stories were fleshed out and fully informed.  And of course the climactic showdown foreshadowed and expected from the beginning satisfactorily occurred and concluded.<br/><br/>Book seven was not perfect in my opinion, but it did end near perfectly.  I felt the pacing was somewhat uneven at times.  There seemed to be so much yet to resolve while whole new mysteries were heaped on additionally.  Yet by the end, each of these issues was resolved believably if not evenly.  As the series of books progressed I became increasingly frustrated with the characters.  Many of their actions just did not seem reasonable.  I found it increasingly hard to justify their behaviors with any rationale.  Perhaps this is an unfair complaint given that not everyone enjoys similar reasoning ability and some are more dominated by emotion than reason, etc.  But it was frustrating and seemed too contrived at times.  Book five (The Order of the Phoenix) seemed terribly unbelievable to me in this way (in addition to the adult disbelief and misbehavior) and I did not enjoy it much.  Book six was much better but was still tainted in a similar fashion.  Finally, book seven also suffered similarly, but it was so full of action and drama that it was not as glaring.  And more importantly, as I have already alluded to, its ending was so well done I could overlook the rest.  The final few chapters were simply magnificent.  I was sad, angry, anxious, etc.  The book really tapped into my emotions incredibly well.  JK Rowling demonstrated a marvelous adeptness at manipulating the situation for greatest emotional impact.<br/><br/>Wonderful knowledge is gained about both Snape and Dumbledore.  Both of their histories are brought to life.  Is one or the other good or bad?  We are not necessarily told what to think, but we are finally granted full disclosure.  We fully see what we need to see to form our own conclusions.  The veils are removed, and I am terribly thankful they were.  Many other authors have fallen far short of Rowling's achievement in satisfactorily concluding a lengthy series.  Often questions are unanswered or resolutions are too contrived.  This ending, however, seemed to flow naturally.<br/><br/>JK Rowling created a wonderful world, brimming with possibility and imagination.  The saga of Harry Potter was truly a gift of imagination.  Even if the books weren't perfect, the world was vividly and lovingly presented.  It was a great place to escape to for periods of time.  It is sad to see it go.  But if it must go, at least it goes in a very tidy and satisfying manner.
 Grandson loved it!
 Great value, for so many books for the price. So excited to reread the series
 bought this as a gift, harry potter always is a big hit for all ages
 Bought this for my daughter, she loves reading.  First series for her!
 I have reread these every year since they came out, even though I only bought the ebooks recently.
 gift for my Granddaughter for her collection, she loved it.
 Perfect for the Harry Potter fan and will last a lifetime
 Best price on the internet!  My daughter loves them !
 Gave this to granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.
 My son loves these
 Some of the books are dented on the top portion. Also the box to hold the books came with a big tear in it, which is really disappointing because these were a gift and I made sure to buy new so there wouldn't be any damage.
 By far the best graphic novel I've ever seen from a book series! Very well illustrated.
 It's gorgeous! :)
 The Harry Potter Series, in my opinion, is comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's in-depth descriptions of characters, scenes, plots and of course the universal theme of good vs. evil. She ended it beautifully and without giving too much away I will say that I hope someday she continues to give us more stories of the remaining characters, perhaps a new generation of Potter adventures. I was pleased to see how she developed the Snape and Malfoy characters in this final book. What a wonderful read, I can't wait to pass it on to future generations and enjoy it all over again with them.
 it was a replacement for one left on the plane
 I LOVE this product. I couldn’t be happier or more highly recommend.
 Quick services and happy grandchild = happy me.  Thanks
 Kids loved it ..good buy
 Love this series
 I imagine these books were primarily written for children; however, I’m in my 70s and once I started reading, I had a hard time putting them down.  I really enjoyed them.
 Gave as a gift, and they enjoyed it
 Great price for the set! Arrived in perfect condition. My daughter is very happy
 Love this books set ! Great price .
 I have been looking for a new adventure lately and when I couldn't find one, I decided to revisit Hogwarts. I'm so glad I did. To discover that the HP collection was now available on Amazon was great! I have thoroughly enjoyed reacquainting myself with Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the HP cast! Thank you JK Rawling for releasing the collection to Amazon!
 I never thought I'd end up a Harry Potter fan, having successfully resisted books and movies for years. I rented the first movie, just so I could say I'd rented it and hated it, and was instantly hooked. Then I decided I had to have the books, just to see what the writing was like. All I can say is "wow!" If you're a fan of the movies, you'll find lots explained here that was evidently cut in the movies. If you're a fan of the books, this gathers everything to date in one collection. I didn't really care about having a boxed set, but it was a relatively inexpensive way to buy all of them at once -- and provided several nights of extremely enjoyable reading.
 We bought two sets as Christmas gifts for our grandboys and they were a great hit!
 Purchased as a gift; the recipient loved it!
 My books came in great shape! The artwork on the books is beautiful. I am happy!
 These are pure amazing and everything I’ve ever wanted I love the hardback books worth the extra dollars for them!
 Best series ever!! I was a little late to read all these, but hey better late than never!!
 Arrived on time with no defects
 One of the best series of books ever written.
 Such a nice set &amp; beautiful box. My kid was thrilled!
 Of course I love the set of books and they arrived in good condition, but what attracted me to this complete set was the fact they where enclosed in the cute chest..the chest arrived destroyed as though it was reused..not happy..I would appreciate a new chest and then I would be a happy customer!
 Yes I am a Potter head.  Have the DVD, Blu Ray, and all the original books purchased as they were released at mid night.  The illustrations and the quality of the book are amazing.  Just waiting for the next one.
 On time and as described
 Very good product! Happy with the quality!
 Great price and came in perfect condition! Must have for HP fans.
 I recommend it
 Great book! Well packaged, undamaged and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
 The art in the cover of these books is amazing. Well worth it.
 WAS A GIFT. RECIPIENT HAPPY
 Love this book and fast shipping
 Having just finished the last instalment in the series, I have to say that JK Rowling has excelled in her conclusion to the epic tale of Harry Potter. Though I have a few personal favorites in the series, such as HP &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban, HP &amp; the Goblet of Fire, and HP &amp; the Half-Blood Prince, the last of the series is a fitting ending, with all the loose ends tied up.<br/><br/>I loved the focus on Harry's internal struggles in deciding which step to take all through this final quest of his, be it in deciding where to go, or which to focus on, the Horcruxes, or Hallows...we see the true maturing of Harry Potter here, no longer just a boy wizard, but a true, almost adult wizard, a remarkable and potent force of good to fight the dark force of Voldemort and company.<br/><br/>The focus on the ties of kinship and friendship are also explored here most convincingly. The trio of Harry, Hermione &amp; Ron find their friendship tested to the limits, and not always in agreement with each other, and we even have one of the group leaving, though briefly...but always, their loyalty to one another holds them together.<br/><br/>As Rowling had warned there are some familiar, even beloved characters that we bid farewell to here, and some in such an abrupt manner, that i truly didn't know how to react to the deaths. I wish that Rowling had spent a bit more time on these characters, perhaps in elaborating on the specifics of how they were killed.<br/><br/>All in all, its been a great ride, and i am immensely grateful for the story of Harry Potter, his amazing friends, and wonderful world. I only wish it didn't have to end  I am going back to book one and re-reading the series over again!].
 Now that all seven volumes of the Harry Potter story have been published, many come away wondering what the fuss was all about.  Was it all hype?  Was all the attention poured on Rowling's creation (which not incidentally made her very wealthy women) really all that edifying?  Yes, thousands if not millions of children took up interest in reading itself; but, in our new age with other more advanced media, doesn't this no longer impress us as we once thought it should?  It all comes down to the story that is told and the question "is it any good?".<br/><br/>Much of this uncertainty follows in the shadow of the LORD OF THE RINGS movie trilogy.  Much of the public has no taste for this kind of entertainment and would go so far as to hate it.  Thus they look down on THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a very bad fad that is best done with and forgotten.  The fact that Tolkien's magnum opus was published in the early 1950's and long had a growing devoted readership seems to escape their notice.  Nonetheless, much the same attitude is spit out at Harry Potter.  "Get the books out, make the damn movies, and let us forget all this rubbish."<br/><br/>Some people will never be happy with Potter.  But if you have withheld yourself from all things Rowling, there is something to be said.  The Potter saga wasn't written in an isolated instance of prose.  The Romantic Movement in the 19th century loved to embrace the notion that art sprang out of the creator's unique wild dance of passion.  Along with unleashing an avalanche of bad art, it has to be said that the Romantics didn't even follow their own advice.  Artist creation never exists ex nilo.  Creation taps into the organic soup of memory and archetypes which makes writing intelligible not only to the reader but to the writer himself.  Like all good writers, Rowling hugs the shore of the West's love for the spoken and written word.<br/><br/>In appreciating the Harry Potter books, it has to be noted that we in the West have inherited a treasure of storytelling (however dimly remembered) from which most of our contemporary literature draws on. Much of it is pre-Christian, some fantastical, some epic, danger is a common theme, and nearly all of it values courage and cunning. As Christianity advanced across Europe, a different sort of storytelling evolved while the older stories were seen in a different light.  Even so, much of us our primordial memories (if you will) found themselves in the dwellers in dark forests, fishermen on the shores, and the wooden, thatch covered houses in rural meadows.  We love to be told stories. It's in our bones.<br/><br/>Part of our sense of storytelling is that "perfect" characters are not believable or interesting to us. This comes to us not only from our folklore but from the Bible itself. In the Potter books, the over arching feature shows Harry becoming an adolescent, enduring the trials of being a teenage, and finally stepping in the adulthood. In doing so, Harry illustrates much of the charm, problems, and personal shortcomings common to all of us along early life's way. Harry makes many mistakes and does not respond well to several childhood/adolescent challenges. While the Potter books are not "preachy" about it, the reader can see Harry's "misjudgments" for what they are.<br/><br/>The major problem many have with the Potter books is that everything takes place within the world of magic. To some, Potter trespasses into the forbidden world of witchcraft. To others, the book portrays a false world when it should teach our children about the reasonable and orderly nature of the real world devoid of superstition. But most of us at some level recognize the magical world in the books is the setting and metaphor for spiritual war. There is good and evil with all the confusion, mystery and treason we know in between. Throughout the books there is the constant question of which will win out in the end. At times it appears it can go either way. Looking past all the magic, this is the world as we know it.<br/><br/>This is not to say the Potter books belong in the pantheon of great literature. Sometime the writing is awkward and only workman like. The plots tend to drag in the middle of each volume. And many of the characters are not fully developed--odd given the length of each book. Even so, Harry Potter is a great read.  Try to explain the some of the elements of Harry Potter and it sounds childish.  Yet it is compelling on the written page.  This has to chalked up to Rowling's our skill and the fact she takes her story seriously and never condescends to the reader.  It is for these reasons interest and enjoyment for this series will extend long past most of the popular novels sitting on our shelves today.
 The chest that this comes in is cheap! Do not expect this to be a fancy gift, great to have all the books in one place but packaging is not worth the money.
 As soon as I started Book 7, I could not put it down. Sure, it's a little long, and as in her other books, Rowling could stand to tighten up her writing a little..but the plot line is still compelling and there are enough plausible twists and turns to keep the reader interested and unable to stop reading. There will be no plot spoilers here, however, in my opinion, Mrs. Weasley becomes the unsung heroine of the book, especially when she utters her memorable quote in the 2nd to last chapter...a quote not necessarily meant for the young. For those who are upset with the more adult themes in this book, Rowling's writing, themes, characters, and plotlines have all matured along with the readers who have stuck through the entire series since it's beginning. Nice job!
 Sadly, the Harry Potter series is at an end. But what an end!!<br/><br/>J.K.Rowling has done an incredible job on these books, and I highly recommend them to adults as well as teens. (I would not even read them to kids under 12 or 13 - requires a good grounding in reality before they can deal with much of the imagery.)<br/><br/>I won't summarize the series - if you haven't read the book, I won't spoil them for you. Some people, however, are comparing Harry Potter to Aslan! Which makes some kind of sense, especially given the events in the last book.<br/><br/>Well conceived, well written, well completed. All I can say is if you enjoy fantasy, you will truly enjoy these books. The only problem is, they are completed! There won't be anymore. Just RATZ!
 Absolutely beautiful set. Bought as a gift for my best friend, and she really loved it. I'd highly recommend it.
 As always-HP books are amazing and loved the high quality pictures and overall look of the book!
 Bought as a Christmas gift
 I love these books. The look, the feel, the illustrations. I love them!!!!!!!!
 Love audio books
 Loved reading this book. Plenty of intrigue. Wish a few scenes would have lasted even longer. Some great lines to highlight as well.
 Excalty what I remember when it was first released.
 This Harry Potter book was a Christmas gift for my Great Niece. She was very excited!
 Just love it
 Great edition! My kids love the pictures and big font.
 Just perfect
 Classic story, I cry every single time! So wonderful for kids and adults. I read it yearly and it never disappoints.
 I cried... a lot... and laughed... but mostly cried... reading this book.<br/>I think that some people may be a bit put off by some of the deaths that happen because they are so tragic, but if you approach it with from a literary standpoint they were necessary in the 'grand scheme' of things. I don't feel it's appropriate for me to speak plainly about those events merely because it is not my intent to divulge information about what happens in this book for those few who might not have read it yet. I will say though that I wonder what happened to the Dursleys after everything.<br/><br/>It was a little bit of a difficult read the first time around (maybe because I first read it in one straight read into the not-so-early hours of the next day by which point my mental acuity was waning), in the sense that a lot of things happen so fast that it was a little difficult to absorb them the first time around and sometimes I would double back a paragraph or a page to re-read something because my mind glassed over an obscure detail that was then referenced. J. K. Rowling really has a habit of setting you up for things to come - some of her setups are more obvious or more cleverly done than others so you really need to pay attention to minute details when reading her books, and in no other book is that so important than this one.<br/>A lot of the things that happened in this book I expected, or I at least had a hunch about... even the whole thing with Snape and his 'true colors' (though I never imagined the extent of it).<br/><br/>I loved this book and I think the Harry Potter series is such a success because it is filled with wonderful, quirky characters with whom everyone can relate, characters that grow with you as much as you grow with them.<br/><br/>To quote from the TV series 'Scrubs': "...I love Harry Potter so much sometimes I wish I was a wizard..."<br/><br/>I (and millions of others I am sure) just really hope that some day J. K. Rowling puts out more Harry Potter books. I don't really feel like there could ever be a true end to this story.
 Just thought I'd start this review by asking something of you, reader.  Next time you're in a book store, walk by the children's section.  Then, head to the teen section.  If 85% of the books in both of those sections aren't fantasy, I'll eat my entire Harry Potter collection.  Thing of it is, it wasn't like that eleven years ago.  It really says something about the quality of Harry Potter when every children/teen author strives to live up to the status quo made by J. K. Rowling and her wonderful series.  But out of all the fantasy I've ever read, and I've read a lot, Harry Potter is by far (repeat the word "far" about twenty-five times) the best.<br/><br/>Upon re-(re-re-re)reading "Chamber of Secrets" (the second in the Harry Potter series), I couldn't put my finger on why people list this as their least favorite of the series.  "Chamber of Secrets" is an astounding sequel which is just as good as the first and a contender for one of the best mysteries of the series.  While it lacks the depth of the latter books, it's simplicity is, I believe, a testament to the age of the characters.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are twelve years old, and to make this book a complex seven hundred-page tome would be a mistake.  "Chamber of Secrets", like each of the other Harry Potter books, is perfectly, flawlessly done.<br/><br/>The characters are one of a kind.  The book itself is beautiful.  It's heartwarming, smartly plotted, skillfully written, and any other good adverb-verb combination you can come up with.  If you haven't read it, climb out of your hobbit hole and give it a try.<br/><br/>Because there are really only three types of people in this world.<br/>1. People who love Harry Potter.<br/>2. People who haven't read Harry Potter, but would love it if they did.<br/>3. People who choose to hate Harry Potter.  But we don't talk about them.<br/><br/>10/10 Classic.
 My son loves his books
 This was a great series. I'm glad I picked it up. Now I can see what all the hype was about.
 I am so happy that the second book is out. From what I have read so far the pictures are gorgeous just like the first book. Amazon has a great price for this book it was almost twice as much at the book store, glad I ordered it here.
 Daughter loved it.
 For daughter
 Beautiful collection good price quality paperback
 Thank you.
 Great deal
 Such a wonderful series. JK did a great job bringing everything together and gave a satisfying conclusion to Harry’s story. I can’t recommend these books enough!
 Connects better to the reader than the movie did. Mainly due to the significance of so many of the events and how they are conveyed. The movie had to skip and alter many scenes which made them much less significant
 In my view, this seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter series was easily the best of the lot, an impressive accomplishment considering how strong the predecessors were.  I am hard pressed to think of another series that not only avoided the trap of simply petering out, but actually ended strongly.  The book demonstrates that, rather than losing her touch in earlier books, Rowling was just biding her time, using some filler, to build up to this last book.  The movie of this book would be best as two movies--Part I and Part II.  There is simply not enough in this 700 pages that can be cut to make it single feature length.<br/><br/>Gone are the 200 page sideshow events, such as the Quidditch World Cup or the Triwizard Tournament.  Instead, it is the battle between good and evil, period.  Rowling weaves in all her characters--in that way it is like the last episode of Seinfeld.  Unlike the use of the characters in that fiasco, however, this book amazingly puts them all to good and appropriate use--some big, some small, but never forced.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Rowling, and thank you.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THE NEXT PART UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE BOOK.<br/><br/>I say Mad Eye Moody is still alive.  They never find his body, and what's the point of adding that in, if he is actually dead.  Then, when Hermione is disguised as Bellatrix, a man with a bandage over one eye (remember, they taken his "mad eye" to the ministry) attacks her.  That must be Mad Eye, sans eye.  Otherwise the episode seems entirely gratuitous.  Finally, late in the book, Harry thinks a lot about the deaths of Lupin and Tonks, but not at all about Mad Eye.  I suspect that Rowling had a later scene where Mad Eye comes back, but ended up cutting it and then just left these earlier parts as is.  If you have thoughts on this, please add them in the comment section.
 Already in book 5.... good quality for a good price.
 Product is as advertised
 Kids love it!
 If you love reading Harry Potter and love reading Latin, then get both the first and second HP books translated by Peter Needham. I recommend completing at least first-year Latin before attempting to read these books.
 Gorgeous 😍 Case came slightly damaged, so from a collectors point of view, its a bit of a bummer, but I'll probably read the books til they fall apart so oh well. :) also snag it now while you can, Scholastic doesn't carry them amymore.
 Like all the other books in the series, this is a very quick and<br/>enjoyable read.  As the series progressed the themes became<br/>more complex, and the writing increased in quality. Overall,<br/>I think the sixth book was better.  However,  J.K. Rowling<br/>really managed to keep it all together here and deliver a dramatic<br/>build-up and satisfying conclusion to the series.  I enjoyed the<br/>move to high fantasy in the end - it was entirely appropriate<br/>to cap the series.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see how this series holds up over time.<br/>Will it take a place next to Narnia, or will it be forgotten<br/>like so many others?  I would give a better chance to either<br/>His Dark Materials, or the Abarat series, but who knows...
 My whole family is reading the series, so they will be read over and over again!
 This is a great set at a great price.  My daughter is so excited.
 Love the series
 Rowling and GrandPre outdid themselves.
 I was a little disappointed in the second one.  It didn't hold my interest as much.  I found myself almost wanting to skip over some sections as I found myself growing ansy.<br/>But, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy reading it.  Overall, it's a very good book, and definitely worth a read, particularly if you are a fan of the Harry Potter trilogy.  After all, it'd be silly not to read all of them, right?<br/>Having said that, I don't think that it was as good as the first one.  I didn't have that same "Wow!" reaction as I did with the first book.
 The suspense is over--I've just finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a little less than 24 hours after it was delivered by owl...oops, I mean by the USPS. I have to say that the hype leading up to the release was *very* well deserved!<br/><br/>The book is extremely action oriented, with Harry, Hermione, and Ron going from bad situation to worse situation to absolutely disastrous situation with dizzying rapidity. I lost count of the times the trio were absolute goners and then pulled a dazzling escape out of thin air--well, they are wizards, after all, and so is J.K. Rowling, even more so in Deathly Hallows than in any of the previous Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the end except that a lot of predictions of the fandom came true...and a lot didn't! Which is about as clear as one of Dumbledore's instructions to Harry, I suppose...<br/><br/>Bottom line: Read it! Preferably with many, many details of books 5 &amp; 6 uppermost in your mind. It's a wild ride. A fitting end to a historic series, with enough fodder for the-future-of-the-wizarding-world fanfics for the HP fandom to live on and on and on...
 Received my item as expected and in great condition. My daughter was thrilled and I was happy to find such a good deal on the entire box set.
 Read these as a kid and still love them.
 Very nicely packed. My son loves it.
 Loved it

 I have been a 'Harry Potter Fan' since the American release of the first book and have pre-ordered all of the books since Book 2.  This time I pre-ordered the audio book (I have all of the previous books on unabridged audio book as well as hard bound book) but I elected to go to a local book store for the party and hype of the 12:01 release and pre-ordered the book.  It was a wonderful experience - even for this middle-aged mother of grown children - with no excuse of buying the book for a child / young adults.  After spending my time at the party and waiting for my copy, I arrived home at 1 AM Saturday morning and  I started reading - I finished the book early Sunday afternoon (we all need to sleep sometime, LOL).<br/><br/>For my take - J K Rowling did a wonderful job wrapping up the story.  And, while I wish certain characters were not the ones who were killed, I understand her need to show the turmoil the magic community is going through to finally resolve the power of the Dark Lord and his death eaters.<br/><br/>I'm a series reader - whether it's mystery / suspense or fantasy I read series and enjoy the continuity of characters and stories.  From Book One, J. K. Rowling did a wonderful job of character development and her little hints and continuity of plots were superior to so many other series offerings.<br/><br/>I cried at times (though I have been known to cry at some commercials) and I re-read certain chapters - just because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything... Over all - it was a very fast read - well suitable to her continuing story and plotlines - the characters were true to form.  My only is that it's the last one - while I understand her design and desire to complete the story - Harry Potter and Hogwarts provided such an entertaining and character driven story that I will miss not having another book to look forward to next year or the year after.<br/><br/>My sincere thanks and congratulations to J K Rowling (and her family- I'm sure it's not easy to live with a writer during the creative process) - Each and every book in the series was wonderful - faithful to the characters and story line.  If and when J K Rowling writes another novel - it will be on my must purchase list - she is a born story teller and I envy her talent.<br/><br/>If you haven't read it do it quickly before someone ruins the book by telling you the high lights and or the ending.
 Buy it.
 I don't believe there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I enjoyed every page of this book. J.K. Rowling starts this book at a fast pace, and except for the drawn out camping scenes, the whole book keeps up the pace.<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed the previous books, you will enjoy this one. I have been so reluctant to leave the world of Harry Potter that I am starting all over again from The Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>Thank you J.K. for a wonderful book and an even better series.
 I'm quite certain that thousands of people have already reviewed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  It was really funny to see people reviewing this alleged final installment in the Harry Potter saga before the book even came out.  But after reading it through a few times and listening to it on audioBook CDS as narrated by Jim Dale (FIVE STAR PRODUCTION!), I thought I might throw in my two cents worth.<br/><br/>Each time I have read the book or listened to it narrated, I have found more depth and deeper layers than I had discovered in the previous go around.  (It also compelled me to re-read or listen to the other six books!)  I originally was skeptical that J.K. Rowling really had a set plot line for all seven books or that Harry Potter popped into her head fully formed as she has claimed when the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone came out but I can see now that she definitely had a main plot line right from the beginning (even if she made minor changes along the way in sub-plots and such).  I only deeply regret that she didn't emphasize Wand Lore more in the first six books as well as why Albania was important to Voldemort.  I found the Wand Lore absolutely fascinating and regretted that she didn't explore this more throughout the series as the concept of a wizard or witch's wand becoming something more than just a way to perform spells but rather a friend who makes the journey together in the life magical.  The way she had Ollivander speak of wands in the first book and the last book make me wish she had created a "Wand Lore Class" at Hogwarts.  Harry would have been much more prepared for what was to come if he had taken such a class.<br/><br/>Though I loved the book as a whole, I personally found the epilogue weak and very poorly detailed, leading me to believe that J.K. Rowling is most likely going to write sequels of Harry Potter in his adult years and hopefully well-written prequels.  For instance, here are just a few things that I, as an avid Harry Potter fan would like to have seen answered in the epilogue:  What happened during those nineteen years between him facing Voldemort in their duel inside the walls of Hogwarts and the Potter family showing up to see their children off to school on the Hogwarts' Express?  Where are they living?  If Number 12 Grimmauld Place, how do they keep Mrs. Black quiet?  What is Harry doing for a living?  We know Neville is a teacher at Hogwarts but not a peep or hint as to the principle characters except that Ron has learned how to drive, leading me (us?) to believe they are not living in a Wizarding community such as Godric's Hollow.  What is Hermione and Ginny doing?  I really thought Hermione would become a professor but nothing is mentioned.  Is Harry an Auror or did he perhaps follow in Ollivander's footsteps?  Why should Draco Malfoy be allowed freedom?  What happened to Luna?  What happened to his cousin Dudley?  Perhaps he'd end up marrying a witch?  Wouldn't Aunt Petunia LOVE that?  LOL.<br/><br/>So those are my objections to the epilogue and some of the reasons why I feel the series will continue.  I would buy the books!  But the epilogue notwithstanding, I found Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to be a riveting book filled with grand images, contemporary issues that we muggles have to deal with, a range of characters and plot twists that can entertain adults such as myself, teenagers (Chapter one really isn't for kids in my opinion) as well as senior citizens such as some of my family who read the book at the same time I did when it was released.  Moreover, I genuinely felt at though J.K. Rowling truly came into her own in this book as an author and it would be a shame to see her not continue entertaining us with stories of the witches and wizards of Britain!<br/><br/>If you haven't yet read "Year Seven" in the Harry Potter saga, I have tried hard not to spoil the ending.  (I hope I have succeeded.)  Though I was thoroughly well-versed in the Harry Potter universe in preparation for The Deathly Hallows, many of the things that happened took me by surprise.  I believe you will thoroughly enjoy the book.  As an aside, I personally recommend the Deluxe Edition though it is a little more spendy.  It's a legacy item that if kept in good condition is surely going to be worth something far more than what you originally paid for it.  My questions regarding the epilogue undoubtedly give away certain things but enjoy the book, regardless of the epilogue.  I genuinely hope that J.K. Rowling will give her fans more of the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends.  There are definitely dark wizards that weren't dealt with and The Deathly Hallows themselves are now in play for some future "next gen" Voldemort to try to claim for him or herself.  In short, J.K. Rowling has left the Quidditch field wide open and in my opinion, the Golden Snitch hasn't been caught yet.  She should give her fans some true closure and/or allow other authors to pick up where she has left off.<br/><br/>So I commend this book to you as you journey into Harry's seventh year of magical education even if he barely spends any time at Hogwarts during that year.  We can hope to hear about Dumbledore, James and Lily and even Severus Snape in prequels.  And there is so much material for sequels into Harry Potter's future.  But regardless, if Ms. Rowling chooses not to satisfy our curiousity, we can always imagine what the future holds for the characters based upon what she has written.  Enjoy and prepare to be shocked, disturbed, tantalized, confunded, stupefied and even surprised!
 Looks absolutely beautiful and great for young readers to get into these amazing books!! The art work is stunning and the pages looks so nice and crispy. Can’t wait to collect them all once they are released.
 Our Niece was so happy to get the Harry Potter set. Arrived in plenty of time!!!
 This illustrated book is a MUST GAVE for any true Harry Potter fan.
 What can I say about the last book in what has been for me and my family a magical and wonderful journey?  The only thing is simply "WOW".  I had very mixed emotions when I held the last book in my hands.  Happiness that I would finally find out all of the answers, and extreme sadness that this would be the last time I would anticipate what was in store for these charachters that had become very dear and familiar.  JK Rowling has taken us to the final chapter of a great series and did it wonderfully.  I was one of the millions of fans who waited at a store at midnight.  I had already ordered my book on Amazon in February, but I wanted my children to witness the phenomenon of people waiting for a book as though it was a major rock concert.  We even bought an additional copy because my daughter did not want to wait for me to finish.  Although I finished by noon the next day.  Although I loved this book and the CD read beautifully by Jim Dale.  I thought a few of the chapters were a little drawn out, but the final 3 chapters I was reading through my tears.  I had to re-read them to catch what I had missed.  I will not give away any details, since I would not want to spoil it for anyone who has not read it yet.  All I can say is I was very happy with The Deathly Hallows, and am going back and re-reading from the begining.  I hope that future generations enjoy this series as much as we have.  JK Rowling has given us a new classic for everyone to enjoy.
 Thank you for the price! Clean like new
 I admit that I had never heard of Harry Potter until the huge fuss over the release of the fourth book.  I didn't buy into the hype until a friend of mine dragged me to the movie... I admit that I became a Harry believer after the first 10 minutes of the film and wanted more.  I immediately asked to borrow her books and read all four over the next two days.  After reading her set, I decided that I had to have my own copies.<br/>The Harry Potter books are wonderfully imaginative and great for children of all ages (I myself am a 31 year old child!!)  I loved being taken out of the real world and submersed in a world of fantasy and magic.  Some say the stories and events are derivative of other classic "good vs. evil" stories; I don't happen to feel that way.  The attention to detail of both the Muggle (non-magic folks) and the Wizard worlds is staggering and fascinating and unique.  The J.K. Rowling style is also very refreshing and accesible to everyone even with the immense attention to specifics and details.<br/>These books are great and I highly recommend them.  They are so unassuming and pleasant and can teach kids a lot about acceptance, forgiveness, and the true meaning of goodness.
 This was definitely better than the first one.  It was easier to read much more descriptive and the storyline was much better and easier to follow.  I understood the lingo better and the characters were easily recognizable.  If I had to change anything it would be to Hagrid, he comes across as a bonehead.  He should have a more central theme in the storyline and a better closer relationship with Harry Potter.  I also don't feel that Harry should go back to his aunt and uncle, he should stay with Hagrid, or with Ron's family.  His aunt and uncle , that whole thing is a bit too much.<br/>Overall, wonderful book.
 My daughter loves this series.
 It was described as Very Good yet no jacket on the book.
 Great Book and great series.
 J.K. Rowling has yet to disappoint.  In this seventh (&amp;last?) installment in the saga of Harry Potter, she really picks up the pace, leading our favorite sorceror's apprentice from one perilous leap to the next with rollercoaster rhythm &amp; speed.  There are more than a few sad moments &amp; endings, &amp;, in this, Rowling doesn't insult her readers' intelligence with "happily-ever-afters".  Die-hard fans will, I think, be satisfied - I, for one, am looking forward to the film rendition of the "Battle of Hogwarts"!  I know this is supposed to be the final book, but I don't think it's my imagination that an opening was left for the next generation to carry on the battle against the forces of evil.  The final line says it all.  Will the boy-wizard return?  Stay tuned.
 Very fast delivery!  My daughter was delighted when she opened the box!!!
 Fun set of books and the box cover is fun too. Best price ever for these.
 I just love all Harry Potter books, they are very engaging and beautifully written.  Plenty of details describing characters and the magical world, which combined with Rowling's sense of humor make these books a masterpiece.  I'd say easy to read even for a 4th. Grader, but at the same time people from any age will enjoy them.  Please let me put them this way:  I first watched the movies and I loved them, then I read the books and now I am disappointed about the movies.  There is so much detail, important facts, and character development that the movies don't show which makes reading the books a must.  Won't be disappointed about the books.
 The second book in the series continues in the same vein as the first, full of infinite invention of characters, creatures and magical circumstances. The stakes are still not as high as they are to become within the next two books. Voldemort's power is still limited and diluted through the memory of his former identity as prodigious wizard Tom Riddle. My patience wore thin a little with the invention of the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, a bumbling wannabe wizard. His hubris paired with incompetence became tiresome after the second scene and the fact that none of these brilliant wizards, even the genius Dumbledore, could see him for the fool that he was undercut their credibility. Even in a magical wizarding world there should be an internal logic and the continued presence of Lockhart was evidence to me that it was lacking. I saw no reason why, if Dumbledore had seen through him, he would continue to keep him employed at Hogwarts. That is not a major weakness and the book is still quite enjoyable. As I recall from my first reading several years ago, the plot thickens, the doom grows more ominous and the saga grows more interesting with the next volume.
 this book is the equal of all the other Harry Potter books. Often with such a multi-volumn series, the finale is a disappointment, but this is not the case here. True it is the darkest volumn of the series, but this was to be expected. Each story has been darker and more threatening than the previous one as the dark lord gained in strength. I think that it is worth noting that this series is no longer a typical "childrens book". The original audience has grown up along with the stories. As the author has said in televised interviews, the readers who started the series at eleven or twelve are now in their early twenties. The characters have needed to grow with them and it is a sign of the brilliance of the author that she did this seamlessly. Another sign of her brilliance is that in no point in the series does she "talk down" to her readers. The books are clearly written to assume that the readers have an average intelligence or above.  The heroes, from the beginning, use a high level problem solving logic to work out their plans.  Even when they are led off on wild goose chases, they have clearly logical reasons for their actions. None of the characters, even those who are peripheral to the plot, are cardboard.  All show themselves to be complex and higly motivated and all change and mature as the stories develope. One example of this is the character of Neville Longbottom. He begins as a pudgy bumbling target of every bully in the school. As the books progress, he emerges as a quiet, scholarly person with a tragic past, raised by a domineering grandmother, but with a passion for justice. In the last volumn, he  is shown as a  fighter worthy of bearing the great sword of Cedric Griffindor in battle against the dark lords magically enhanced serpent. He then retires back into his scholars life and finishes as a teacher at Hogwarts. This could have been a minor character, bumbling through the books as comic relief. the author has chosen to present him as a fully developed person, as she does nearly all the characters.<br/>This book, like all of the series, is worthy of being read over and over again, discovering new viewpoints with every reading. In this light, this series ranks with Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, Kim, and The Lord Of The Rings as a landmark in the literature of the English language. I hope that the author continues writing, as she is one of the most brilliant authors of this century.
 Without a doubt the best ending for a series I've ever read. I cried and felt as though I was reading a very long letter from a dear group of friends. The deaths were stark and difficult, the ending although expected was a relief and the 19 years later was a joy. I will miss Harry and gang more than any other group of reading friends I've ever known. I shall reread them and continue to share them with others as I find kids and adults that either can't afford them or haven't had the opportunity to read them. Bless you Ms. Rowling for using your time, your wonderful mind and creativity to bring such fun, entertainment and joy to so many of us. Especially those of us who are ill and don't get out to live adventures of our own! Thank you.
 When a book binds you to your young step-son, it is a healing book and it's "magical".<br/><br/>From the very first Harry Potter that I tricked my step-son Thomas into reading, to this, the very last, we've had one thing to look forward to that we did together, that we both enjoyed and that no one else did with us.<br/><br/>In today's reality, we have families with all manner of complicated relationships and potentially volatile emotional situations.  This book, and all that came before, have the power to provide inspiration, hope and healing; for some, even magic.<br/><br/>When Thomas was a little boy and told me that he was 'magic'--that he'd been born 'magic'--I agreed with him.  Each book in the Harry Potter series has been magic for us:  for the simple but touching stories of hope and wonderful possibilities even in the worst of situations, for the anticipation that Thomas and I have enjoyed with each new release, for the power to interest a young boy in reading and for the 'magic' in created in a blossoming relationship between a young boy and his step-mother.<br/><br/>Thanks, J.K.
 Great condition
 Wonderful book series. I'm reading it for the 2nd time.
 When the Dark Lord orders round-ups of "Mudbloods" and even distrusts the "Halfbloods," I couldn't help but think of Nazi Germany's "cleansing" campaign against the Jews.  Seen in this light, Harry Potter and the resistance (Dumbledore's Army) come off like Christians who aided and abetted the Jews during WWII.  HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS (Book 7) has that kind of Armageddon, Good vs. Evil feel to it -- as it should.<br/><br/>Per usual, J.K. Rowling shows she is a master of plot as she pulls many strings together in this series-closing book.  Key to the last tome is her splicing of a new element (the Hallows) with an old one (the Horcruxes).  Also in the mix is Severus Snape.  Look up "ambivalent" in the dictionary and you'll find his name.  Readers have been that confused about him and Rowling uses it to good effect here.<br/><br/>As for the theme of love vs. evil, it has already been at work in previous editions.  Rowling plays her cards wisely and the ending (That-Which-Can't-Be-Named) is, to my mind, brilliant.  Yes, you might guess the denouement, but no, you'll never guess the explanation for it.  So there.  Reason to read through 749 pages -- which practically happens on its own, anyway.  This book should please Potter devotees as well as newcomers to the series.  A rollicking-good read, as they say.  The Hype, in other words, has met its match (and that in itself is magical, in these overhyped days...).
 Great price. They arrived before i had expected them. And they’re in prefect condition. I’ve been reading book two so that’s why it’s a little bent down the spine.
 Good
 This version contains minor corrections to the original story. Doesn't change the story, only allows better continuity. An easier way to carry all seven books!
 I read these books to my son. It is nice to have a complete cute set of them. I wish the print were larger in them but this is what you get with smaller and more handy paperbacks. The hardcover ones for the last 3 books must weigh a ton on people's chests at night! One of the books came with 30 missing pages and Amazon was prompt to change the whole set very quickly. Meanwhile I borrowed the same book from the library to go on with the story. Considering the popularity of the books, there is always one set of them somewhere to be found!<br/><br/>I was very reluctant to read Harry Potter series not caring for witches and wizzards' stories but I must admit the style is so light, rich and believable that anyone at any age would love them.
 Perfect collection for Harry Potter lovers.
 Purchased this book for my grandson. He loves it.
 I love the Harry Potter books and this makes them so portable
 Well my Harry Potter fans, you may be sitting at your local bookstore wondering is you should buy this adventure....YES!  It was wonderful. This time H-Dawg is out to find out who is turning people into stone.  I  mean total stonage!  Harry has to go totally and completely into  "police guy" mode and find out who is doing the evil deeds.  This novel had everything a good novel (and a instant classic) should have.  Great Characters, good plot, good bad guys and a fangtastic ending.  Now be a good Muggle and go out and get this book. *S*
 Amazing collection
 love the Harry Potter Movies love the books
 Given as a gift. She loved it.
 Worth owning if you like Potter
 Brand new book. fast delivery
 Product is just as described. Gave this to my father for Christmas and he absolutely loved the quality of it.
 The first book of the Harry Potter series was a brilliant starter, suitable in my opinion for all ages (i.e. for those who can read). This is definately not  book a for small children however, due to the violence and cruelty that peppers the book. It still is a good fantasy book, well on the level or above of the most of current fantasy literature but its not on the level of the first book. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will definately want to read this, as it provides all the answers, i.e. regarding Dumbledore's death, his past and on how Harry can battle Voldemort. In fact there is a short spellbattle between them right at the beginning at the book.<br/>In short, don't expect the level of Tolkien's writing but you can expect a good fantasy novel with an all-out magical war between good and evil. If you are a HP fan, also prepare for some bloody fights and deaths of many good characters.
 
 Every time I read Harry Potter it’s a new adventure, I found new things I didn’t noticed before and connect the links faster.
 I loved the box and the art of the covers was beautiful, but I would have liked it more if the paper in which the story is were different. For such great edition, I would prefer a more exclusive type of paper (like matte or gloss paper) instead of the regular one.
 Engaging, fun and immeasurably superior to the movies.
 Amazing books that came in perfect condition. Looks very nice on my shelf.
 The Harry Potter Boxed set came right on time. Exactly shown on the photo. In great condition, warb in plastic &amp; Beautiful in person!<br/><br/>Purchase this from US-Savers. Highly recommend!
 I love this book and look forward to listening to it during my long road trips.
 As a children's librarian, I'm always looking for ways to introduce early readers and young adults to the joy of reading. The Harry Potter books are a wonderful gateway to a lifetime of literary curiosity, but I've found that some young readers are daunted by the scope of the series. Even those who are interested in the stories would often rather watch the movies than read the novels. Imagine my dismay!<br/><br/>I've listened to all seven audiobooks and often suggest them as an alternative to parents who have been unsuccessful in introducing their children to reading as a pastime. Kids love the performance of Jim Dale, the reader, and so do I. Jim Dale has won numerous awards for his performance in these productions, and "performance" is exactly the right word. He does not simply read the book; he performs it. Each character is brought to life with a different voice (my favorite Jim Dale performance is Hagrid), and each is so distinct that one rarely needs to be told who is speaking. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy, Ginny, Dumbledore, McGonagall -- they are all distinctive and entertaining. It's a remarkable feat given how many characters populate the series!<br/><br/>Having read these books a few times prior to hearing them on audiobook, I wondered if I'd grow bored listening to the whole series again as an audiobook production. Far from it, though. It was as if I were experiencing the story again for the first time. My recommendation for anyone considering the audiobooks is to buy them without hesitation. If you enjoy them even half as much as I do, it will be money and time well spent. And if you are trying to introduce your children to reading, this is a nice gateway into that world.<br/><br/>I give five stars to the original novels by JK Rowling and another five stars to the audiobook performance by Jim Dale. They are a perfect match!
 Really what can I add? I’ve seen bits and pieces of the movies and from what I can tell they were very true to the book. Of course there is much greater detail in the book, and this adds wonderfully to the story. My only regrets is that I waited this long to read them.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an imaginative, mostly exciting, and entertaining novel.<br/><br/>I'd like to comment on two criticisms of this book.  One was that things dragged a bit when Harry, Ron and Hermione were wandering around Britain.  I would agree.  Another was that the Epilogue was trite.  Here I would mostly disagree.  Perhaps because I'm older, I can recognize great joy in "everyday" life.  Do we always need the bad to appreciate the good?<br/><br/>This book and the entire Harry Potter series are not perfect.  What is?  But I gave Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 5 stars, because it's such a terrific and amazing story.  So much "serious" fiction is rather dull psychologizing.  The primary characteristic of great fiction, in my opinion, should be a great story.  This surely is it.
 Everything was perfect from stem to stern including the book itself!
 a present
 I'm 46 and male who works out and thinks he's macho and I've read this book 4 times. If you have a stressful job like me where you can't relax, read the HP books. They put you in a fantasy world and JK Rowling's storytelling is so unbelievable and descriptive, she's the best. I got this series for my father after my mother passed away. They were married 69 years and he was grieving. This is not his kind of book but after reminding him how much my mother loved them, he agreed to read them and agrees it puts him in another world and helps him gain peace.
 Wanted to add the Harry Potter collection to my library.  Love the Hogwarts image on the bindings.
 Fantastic illustrations for those young Harry Potter fans.
 Something is wrong with the download- entire sentences are missing. This makes for much confusion and although I can figure out what is meant! I have only read a few pages of the first chapter-when the story gets more complicated this will be very annoying!
 I really loved this book. Every page something happened. It was a very thrilling adventure story. I’m sure generations will love this book. I think my favorite character is Ron because he’s full of bright personality. My least fAvorite characters are Malfoy and Voldemort. I can’t wait open the next book!
 I'm pretty sure that most people know about Harry Potter by now.  I'm a Potterhead and could go on for days about how entertaining and inspiring each story line is, how wonderful and well thought out JK Rowling's magical world is, how much care is taken in developing each character, and how I read it every year at least.  Instead, I'll just review this version.<br/><br/>I already own the paperback collection of the Harry Potter series.  I bought this as a Kindle edition so I could take the books with me anywhere with ease with my new Kindle.  The Kindle version is great, and it seems like an incredible deal for all 7 books. Definitely a great buy.  If anyone hasn't read the series, you should buy this.  The books are so much greater than the movies!
 Its hp. Its amazing and wonderous. Even as an adult the magic is transcendent. Everyone should read and reread this series.
 Awesome book! Buy it, love it, share it and move on to your next purchase. Nothing more needs said.
 Came in good condition and obviously it’s a lovely book
 Son loves these
 I just reread this series and found it to be so creative and captivating. The imagery, events and characters were absolutely wonderful. (I'm 69 - it's not just a children's story!)
 At first I wasn't so sure about reading this book. Mostly beause I prejudged this as a young adult book only. This was around 2001. The books at this time were given to my youngest sister (I was 22 at the time making her 16). She read them and then handed them to me hoping I'd read them - little sis knowing I love to read. I forgot about them until the first movie came out. I don't recall if I read the book first or saw the movie. But either way, I learned I was wrong to prejudge this series. Since then I've been hooked to everything Potter.<br/><br/>When the book 'Order of the Phoenix' was released in 2003, I was in the Navy. I was lucky enough to get 'Order of the Phoenix' and later 'Half-Blood Prince' in the Bloomsbury publishing editions. So as of now I currently own all 7 Scholastic hardcovers, 7 Scholastic paperbacks and 2 Bloomsbury hardcovers. As well as 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard' hardcover. And 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' 10th Anniversary Edition  Deluxe Edition]  Hardcover]. I also own all 8 of the movies (all special editions of course).<br/><br/>I am currently 36 years old and I'm still a fan. A fan of all Harry Potter. And a fan of J.K.Rowling - purchased ebook of 'Casual Vacancy' the day it was released.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a very charming orphaned boy who finds out he can do magic. He then goes to this amazing school called Hogwarts. A school even I wish I could attend to.<br/><br/>Harry Potter bless you
 I got the box set for my brothers and they love it. It is written in British English which is to be expected just if you're American like my brothers and I then some of the words you may need to search up. Great book series from an amazing author.
 BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND HE LOVED IT.
 Purchased for our son before we went to universal and he loved reading them!
 The Harry Potter series is great for 8 years old (or 3rd grade) as they start to expand their reading into chapter books. My son became a Harry Potter after reading the set! He has read this book several times. We ordered it to donate to a school in Texas that his classroom adopted after Hurricane Harvey.
 And you will not know who they are until you read the Harry Potter books. I bought these books because my daughter-in-law loves them and my granddaughter was starting to read them as well as various nieces and nephews and I wanted to share the books they love. I thought that by having the first four in paperback that I would finish them about the time the 5th one comes out in paperback.  No such luck - I read straight through them in a couple of weeks and begged my daughter-in-law to send my her #5 - which she graciously did. I read that one in two days. These books are well-written and well-constructed. I am THRILLED that children are reading them. Hopefully these young readers will not only read fabulous stories, but develop an improved vocabulary and much more complex and critical thinking. For my fellow conservative Christians, if you are worried about the "wizardry" in the books, don't ban them but read them WITH your children and discuss them. My granddaughter and I have had fabulous and deep discussions about our beliefs which have been jumpstarted by these books. The later books are probably too dark for pre-teen readers, but if you are reading the books WITH your kids, you can make that judgment based on your individual child. As Christians, we are to be in the world, not of the world. If we cloister ourselves and our children from what is going on, we have nothing to share with the non-Christians and we are living not by faith, but by fear.
 Perfect. Just what we needed. Thanks!
 On the Series Itself:<br/>All my life, I have been an avid reader, having taught myself how to read as a six year-old and ever since devouring books as quickly as I could get my hands on them.  A family member bought me Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when I was in first grade, and I am still hooked (even as I now face college). I have read all of the books as they came out, and I cannot praise them enough.  J.K. Rowling has created a classic. Each of the seven Harry Potter books greatly adds to the story of Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who learns that he is a wizard. Harry is part of a great prophecy that ties him with a villain so horrible (and yet fascinating), and he dives headfirst into a world that is literally, and figuratively, magical.<br/><br/>When reading this series, you will learn about everything from potions to the wizard game of Quidditch, and will cheer Harry and his friends in all of their adventures. Rowling's incredible imagination and ability to tell a story have kept me enthralled for years.  The first two books are whimsical and more innocent, and as the villain rises, the later books become darker and more desperate for the grown-up Harry. I know plenty of people feel the story is against Christianity, but Rowling even quotes Bible verses in the last book! This is simply a children's tale that is so good, it has captured adults all over the world as well. The themes of love, loyalty, hope, and friendship battling against the forces of evil that only know ambition and pain leaves a great message for readers. These books are my absolute favorites, and I highly recommend them to everyone.  They are much better than the movies, and will leave you wanting to explore more of Harry Potter's world!<br/><br/>On the Boxed Set:<br/>I received the box set promptly and in excellent condition. The outside box is nothing special, just thicker cardboard really, but the colorful images and style in which they are drawn is fascinating. Each book is well-illustrated and the covers are quite colorful as well. When reading the books, I found no grammatical errors or pages missing! For $50, this is a wonderful buy!<br/><br/>5/5 stars.
 Came perfectly packaged and all the books were warped nicely in plastic inside the box and looked perfect now bends or wrinkles on covers! Fast shipping also :)
 First off, let me say I loved this series.  I started reading it aloud to my children after becoming aware of "Harry Potter" after publication of the 2nd book.  My kids bailed on the series after book #4 but alas I was hooked and pre-ordered them as soon as it was possible to do so.  I felt the book got off to a good start - then pretty much came to a standstill - but did finally get back on track and then what a sweet ride to the end.  I would give the book 3.5 stars if possible but was closer to a 4 than a 3 - and the overall series I give a 5.  J.K. Rowling managed to capture adults as well as children in this series - she made us laugh, she made us cry - and most of all she introduced us to some characters we will never forget.
 There have been numerous reviews of Harry Potter to date, and  Rowling has racked up many awards for her books.  I’m going to try and stay away from writing things that can be easily found in other reviews from years past. Note that I am now nearly 24 years old and this is my first time reading Harry Potter, which was published when I was in elementary school. I remember my mother reading them, and then my middle brother. I was into other genres, and for some reason I had an unfounded stigma toward Harry Potter. I have seen the first four movies; I didn't really keep up with the latter movies. But I didn't know what was going on because I missed out on so much that was in the books! I wish that I had read Harry Potter as I was growing up, instead of waiting – I feel that I’ve lost a lot of the magic in waiting, and also in seeing the movies before reading the books. The basic premise of Harry Potter is about Harry Potter himself, and discovering who and what he is, where he came from and his quest to becoming what he’s destined to become – a great wizard, with a bond not seen before in the wizard world of magic (i.e. Voldemort).<br/><br/>We already know from the first book that Harry is going to encounter a scary, dangerous situation while at Hogwarts – and it is all about him. (Cue Voldemort.) After Voldemort’s quick and mysterious exit yet again, it’s no doubt that he will return at the worst possible moment and be behind it all. And, seeing as how he used a Hogwarts professor as a means to an end to get to Harry, who’s to say he won’t do the same thing again? Or will he, since he’s already played that card?<br/><br/>Each subsequent book in the series brings additional characters into the life of Harry Potter. And with them come more knowledge, more mystery and more story lines. Young Ginny, Ron’s little sister, comes to Hogwarts as first year…and she has a terrible crush on Harry. It’s quite cute if you've ever had a mad crush before. In the latter half of the book, we learn Ginny and Harry unknowingly share an item that belonged to the student who first opened the Chamber of Secrets so many years ago.<br/><br/>Dobby makes a few surprise appearances, sharing some valuable and thought-provoking information. Harry and Ron get punished for some grievous infraction with Malfoy at the center. Harry is sequestered with Lockhart for punishment and he hears a chilling voice. The words uttered stop you in your tracks and send you running and screaming...which lands them in an empty corridor with some bad juju and incriminating evidence: The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware.<br/><br/>And not only do Harry, Ron, Hermione and the usual professor gang see the threatening message, but the whole student body does so as well. Now the cat’s outta the bag! They are all bent out of shape trying to find out about the infamous Chamber of Secrets...and it just continues from there.<br/><br/>The shared item between Harry and Ginny, a diary, crystallizes Rowling’s style: she sets up a mysterious scenario, with the main characters involved, and a few suspects as well as some hints of evidence. (And of course the worries of an expulsion.) All of these hints and suspicions build up the plot (and undoubtedly cause other side problems for the gang) and give small flickers of light in this dark big picture. But we never see the whole picture until the pitfall, which is quite unexpected…yet, not really. (We know that’s the natural course of the book.) And then all is revealed, and we get that “aha!” moment when the light bulb comes on. I have the sneaky suspicion this is going to be the formula for most of the rest of the series, which is something I’m not a fan of. But, seeing as how I couldn't figure it all out on my own, it’s nice having it explained.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book (as I did the first, and probably all to come), with the exception of the light bulb idea above. If you've never read the Harry Potter series, I highly encourage you to do so. It is truly an enjoyable (and easy) read.
 Love HP.
 Xmas gift for my son he loves fictional books
 Daughter loved them
 Beautifully narrated collection!
 Have 'em all now. Lent some of my originals, didn't keep track.
 Bought this as a gift for my love and he loved it.
 It's Harry Potter, enough said. LoL
 l like read book very much.
 These are my favorite Harry Potter book cover designs! The images are great and they don't look cartoonish like most other versions. My favorite boxed book set!
 Love this book.
 All you need to know:<br/><br/>1) Different but interesting writing style.<br/>2) Good character development.<br/>3) Lags at first, but then picks up and I couldn't put it down.<br/>4) The epilogue was MUCH too short!<br/>5) There are some inside jokes for adults but the book isn't inappropriate at all.<br/>6) I have to wonder HOW this will translate into a movie. So complicated, and so much (appropriate) violence.<br/>7) We would have loved for the book to be 200 pages longer, but I think she presented a great finale to a much-loved series.<br/><br/>P.S. Dumbledore's recent announcement isn't evident or relevant in any of the books, so parents shouldn't make that be a reason for their children to not read the books.<br/><br/>-RLA
 I love this book and the illustrations are beautiful.
 Read this with my kids many years ago when they first came out and had forgotten so much of the detail. It was a great diversion from the news and the demagogue in charge. Oh wait is Trump the new Voldomort?
 Before I started in on Harry Potter 7, I had this idea that JK would leave the door open to write another Harry Potter book down the road, that she just couldn't leave it alone having crafted such a wonderful series. That, after too long a spell of not scheming up a new script, she would be compelled to write one "final" sequel.<br/><br/>But alas, after reading HP 7, I am pretty convinced she's put the wraps on this exceptional creation. Granted, there are a variety of ways new novels could spring from the wizarding world of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the cast, but it seems JK has made it clear to us that she has completed the series.<br/><br/>In so doing, she accomplished once again what she clearly accomplished with Books 1-6: a virtually effortless reading experience with a plot that can be thorougly enjoyed (at different levels) by all ages of readers.<br/><br/>Harry Potter books, for me, produce an awe and appreciation of the author's attention to detail, a truly delightful humor, an opportunity to be personally challenged by the moral choices we make as we move through life, and an inspiration to EACH and EVERY one of us that we CAN tap our creative juices and bring something beautiful into this world.<br/><br/>Note: all HP books are loaded with British expressions. I kept by my side a dictionary that had virtually every piece of British slang that JK used. (The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, available through Amazon, was very helpful)<br/><br/>Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for your tremendous contributions to the world of fiction!
 Good
 Great read and beautiful illustrations. Joy for any kid.
 Fast shipping, great product!
 PERFECT! A little hard to get books back into the box but it's cool
 Great art
 Though darkness and tension built throughout the HP series, it is taken to new heights in Deathly Hallows. I couldn’t put it down. What a wonderful finish to an enthralling saga.
 Gorgeous! A wonderful addition to my collection. I can’t wait for the rest!
 This came as described. Great Books and very special spines picture! Would buy from here again!
 All books in one place
 great
 Came as ordered....and was a gift....as I informed my son in law that all GOOD books must be in hardback as you will read them over and over so need to be durable!! Box was cool to have as well...will be a family keepsake!
 As much as I like my hardcover versions of Harry Potter books, they are quite large and some of them a bit heavy, like Goblet of Fire and the gargantuan Order of the Phoenix. Not exactly the type you'd want to take on a plane. These paperbacks allow me to continue reading Harry Potter when I travel.<br/><br/>Another cool thing about this paperback collection is that if you're a serious collector of the hardcover books (such as collecting first edition/first printings), you can read the paperbacks instead, thus preserving the quality of your hardcover books.
 Good condition
 And the story continues...  Love it!
 This book (and the rest of the series) was exactly what I was expecting. The illustrations on the cover of this black &amp; white edition of the Harry Potter series is beautiful!
 Great book
 Great quality and delivery
 This is a fantastic and beautiful set.  Comes in a cool trunk with stickers.  All 7 hardcover books have really nice artwork and guided lettering.
 Read in one sitting. Fun for kids and grown-ups alike. Looking forward to reading and enjoying the rest of the series.
 The whole series of course came in this bundle, and it's perfect. Nothing was damaged and I was able to put the entire set on display in my living room. As a Potterhead, that's all I've ever wanted
 great books
 Great for kids.
 Great buy! Beautiful illustrations on the cover. Awesome story
 THERE ARE NO ILLUSTRATIONS, NOT GLOSSY, ETC.
 I wasn't sure if I should enter my opinion into this very popular book's review section.Tossing the idea around I decided I would.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this book very much. The story line was compelling and kept me riveted until the end. Maybe I was rushing to reach the end so I could see how the story concluded. Maybe it was because so many had already read the book and knew whether or not Harry dies in the end.<br/><br/>I wont tell you how it ends, I will tell you that the conclusion leaves you feeling complete and happy. Some are angry with the ending but I think that most people find that it was the right thing to do. All in all a great story and fitting conclusion to the saga that has held me for the past 7 years.
 It really seems like it wasn’t too long ago I purchased and began reading this collection. Although there were many areas different from that of the movies, there was a lot of additional information that made things more clear.
 JUST A MAGNIFICENT STORY.
 The new kindle version of the Harry Potter series is missing words, sentences and paragraphs of text. It is distracting and hard to follow the story. I have read the hard bound Harry Potter books several times so I can tell text is missing. I tried to contact Amazon to get the problem resolved but I was unable to get a department to respond. Someone needs to let the publisher know about the text errors.
 Grandson loves these books
 Daughter loved!
 Great
 Awesome set for the collection
 Great book
 This series developed and published during my childhood. I grew up as Harry grew up. It has been a great joy for me to relive his life again through Rowling's words...
 For those who've heard and seen all the hoopla surrounding the Harry Potter books, you may as well take the cost-effective approach and buy books 1-5 in this set as you won't be able to stop at one!<br/><br/>If you've read the books and want to share the world of Potter, this set will do it.  You're not a good person if you get your friends hooked with HP1, then leave them jonesing for 2-5.  Just get them all.  For each new Potter fan, I think we get a toaster...
 Amazing book ‘
 Pages were still crisp due to being in excellent condition!!
 Like this one better than the first too. I cant wait to read the fourth!
 box is cheap
 Fantastic
 This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter and she absolutely love the books and the chest box that it came in.
 This is possibility my favorite Harry Potter book. Extremely well written with characters that feel real enough to jump out of the book. I recommend this book to everyone from age eleven and up.
 Had to have for my kindle so they could go with me.
 Excellent set for a young reader.
 arrived on time with no issues!
 This was a gift. She said it was a really fun read.
 The Harry Potter series is awesome!
 Before the review I just want to say there will be no spoilers! J.K. Rowling has done it again with the seventh and final installment and what a conclusion it is! It's hard to review one book from a whole series, and while they do stand on their own, Harry's adventures must start with book one to get the full understanding. If you've loved the other books you're bound to love this one too, although reactions to the ending are mixed. I personally felt the ending was fitting. Remember, things aren't always what they seem to be at first! The seventh finds Harry, Hermione, and Ron away from Hogwarts for the majority of the book as they search for the horcruxes containing fragments of Voldermort's soul. Along the way, they are hunted by Death Eaters and Dementors and must find cunning ways to continue on their journey in a wizarding world threatened by the Dark Lord. At the same time, there are the questions of who really killed Dumbledore, why Harry has a connection with Voldermort, among other unexplained things. The storytelling is richer than ever before, the action and adventure is thrilling, and the huge cast of characters all play a big part in this final book. Expect the return of earlier characters, and of course the much talked about deaths. Prepare yourselves: there are more deaths than just the two main characters!!Plenty of secrets, magic, and mayhem are packed within the thick novel and one you start, you'll try desperately to stay up all night to get to the climatic end to the Harry Potter tale. It is the darkest of all the novels; it is the most violent. But like real life, the world isn't always the nicest place. What started as a childen's series has become a worldwide phenomenon and the latest subject matter and language hardly seems to belong on a kid's bookshelf. However, the series deserves credit for that very reason. Harry Potter wasn't your average, run of the mill series. It dealt with the issue of mortality and the eternal Good vs Evil scenario like no other adventure/fantasy/fairytale in history. Rowling does not gloss over that the world can be an ugly place, and that is precisely the kind of stuff kids should be reading. The series does no talk down to children or tries to protect them, but in Harry Potter they have found a hero to relate to always. We just better hope there are more series like this one for kids. In an age where videogames and cell phones rule, spellbinding kids into reading like this only happens once in a blue moon. We adults are glad we went along for the ride too.
 I eagerly read the DH in one night and was left wondering why I had waited two years for this. It isn't a bad book, it just could have been better. The book had a different feel to it that the other 6 didn't have, perhaps because it wasn't set at Hogwarts. The end of the sixth book made it sound like Ron and Hermione would be joining Harry at his Aunt and Uncle's house with him (which didn't happen) and I was curious as to why Mrs. Weasley was so against Ron joining Harry when she had to have realized from past experiences that Harry would need help with his 'quest'.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the epilogue. That was the biggest let down of all. JK spent the last two books making a big deal about Harry preparing for life after Voldemort and didn't even have the decency to let us know what he did for a living or even try to let us know what life for Harry was like without the constant battles to stay alive. I realize that marriage and kids are an important part of life but that doesn't define who a person becomes.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the first 6 books but I have a feeling that I won't be bothering to re-read this one.
 My daughter loves this and it's so adorable and beautifully made.
 My daughter can't stop reading...
 Love the books, but the box came all torn up. We didn't return it because it was the posterior aspect which most won't see...
 I am amazed at Rowling’s storytelling ability. How on earth did she keep these characters straight and write them so completely intertwined? It’s as if the stories must have happened. I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity and wordplay. Finished my summer reading series in 12 days! Thank you JKRowling!
 So easy to handle the entire series (all 7 books) as a single e-book.  Best traveling buddy for the holiday trips or layovers.
 I hate having to write these reviews but loved the book, I'm off to thenext one in the series.<br/>Thnk you.
 Absolutely wonderful
 Third read got this for Kindle.
 The worst thing about this series was waitng so long between books. The writing was good, and "British" enough that Amazon probably sold more than a few English/English dictionaries- no one cared because the stories are that good.<br/><br/>Don't start reading the series with this book, go back to the beginning so you'll better understand what's going on. I find all of the books good enough that I really don't (while reading) notice that they've gotten to be 700+ pages long.<br/><br/>This book might have been the most "British" of all in the American edition of the series, I'd heard that the American and British editions were becoming more alike as time went on, with more "blimey" and "bloke" than the earlier books. I thinnk there might be a little more mild swearing than in previous books but the average 12 year old has heard as much or worse even at that. There's a little alcohol drinking here but then a wizard/ witch comes of age at 17, not the muggle 18.<br/><br/>The biggest suprise for me was in the dating given in the text. Harry's parents died 16 years before, in 1981, which would make the bulk of the story set in 1997 the year the first Potter book came out in the UK.
 Fantástic books
 This collection of Harry Potter stories is a great addition to any library. These stories about Harry Potter and the students and teachers at Hogwarts allow the reader to enter a wonderful world of the possible. It's not an ideal world but is much like our own, full of both good and bad, light and dark, desirable and undesirable. Some of the people and creatures you will meet there you will like and want to know better, some you will come to dislike intensely. As with most good literature written for children these stories will delight adults as well.
 Obviously HP is amazing
 Thnx
 My 10 year old grandson had read all of the Harry Potter books and prevailed upon me to read them also, so that he could discuss all the characters with me. I wanted to be supportive to him, so I ordered the boxed set and started reading the books. Imagine my complete surprise when I found that I could not put the books down. I read every single book in the series, back to back, and was so disappointed when I had finished them all. I loved the imaginative story telling and the complexity of the many characters in the books. My grandson is about to celebrate his birthday, and guess what, he is having a Harry Potter themed party, complete with a Hogwarts set up with activities such as Divination, Potions, Spells, Quidditch and lots of food items like butterbeer, chocolate frogs, the yucky jelly beans, etc. He is besides himself in anticipation. All the invitations were delivered via a white stuffed owl (Hedgewig),and the invitees were literally jumping for joy. My daughter and son in law, and grandson read all the Harry Potter books together over the summer vacation as their family project, and now we all communicate about the story lines, the evil characters, and the eventual outcome of the collective stories. I only wish that there were more Harry Potter books to read. I recommend these stories to both children and grown-ups, there is plenty of content to appeal to both.The characters are truly memorable, providing lots of opportunity to fuel conversations with all the Harry Potter readers.
 I enjoyed reading this series.
 Great collection for my 8 year old granddaughter
 I love the potter books.
 Purchased for my granddaughter and she loved the set.
 i bought these book for wife..she loved it so much
 Immerse yourself in this series.
 great books, great holder for all the books
 Grat gift for my daughter.
 exactly as described
 As crazy as it sounds, adults love this book too.  I couldn't put them down...I started late so I got to read the 1st three at once.  I'm a true fan of magic and fantasy; anything that has to do with dragons and wizards.  What I loved most about this series though, is the fact that I can relate to it.  It allows you to really wonder how you would react to being through into to a whole new world, where everything you thought you new was wrong, and now you have deal with all of this on top of growing up. I can't wait for the next one.
 As described.  Great.
 I think this was the best, most action packed Harry Potter book out of the series. It's too bad that we had to wait till the last book to see it. I'm not going to discuss the plot because most who will read this will not have read the book yet. But when Rowling said she tied up everything, with the exception of a few missing details that I would have liked to have, she was not kidding. The last chapter really brought everything to close, answered most questions and the epilogue finished the rest in a neat little package. I almost did not want to finish it because I knew that once I did, there would be no more books to look forward to. A spin off series with the next generation of Hogwarts students would be interesting, but it is probably best to leave well enough alone. But I would recommend this book to anyone, Harry Fans and non. However, if you haven't read at least Book 6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, then I don't suggest you read this just yet. Without reading at least Book 6 you may get confused. Harry Potter is one of those series where you miss alot if you read it out of order.
 I'm simply amazed by this Boxed Set. It's colorful. Beautifully made. The outside box is a little bit fragile, mine came a little bit thorn on the edges. The books are all black, with hardcover, and the dust jackets are adorable. Definitely a must have item.
 OH MY GOODNESS, GORGEOUS! I'm the envy of all my Harry Potter-loving friends. :)
 Its perfect. Thanks
 Wow - what else can I say - the box set is exquisitely presented with all books in beautiful covers and condition - the box is cardboard, and the rope string on either side is very strong. I actually did think that the box was going to be wood, but it's still very impressive nonetheless. It also comes with a little activity kit with some harry potter stuff in it.<br/><br/>A good buy for someone wanting a collector's item - I unwrapped my books, which came in a solid plastic wrap around all seven - but if you want to keep them in collector's condition, I would consider keeping them sealed in if you already have other copies of the books. The box is a nice, snug fit around the books, so there's no damage, room for creasing or snagging. An excellent buy.
 I was first introduced to Harry Potter when I purchased the first three books in the series from a school Scholastic order form that my daughter had brought home.  The two-sentence blurb about the three books sounded mildly interesting, and I purchased the books with the intention of giving them to my daughter for Christmas.  When they arrived, I tossed them in a closet where I promptly forgot about them.  However, one Sunday afternoon I had finished my last library book and if you're an avid reader, you know what a panic-inducing moment this can be.  Nothing to read, and the library is closed!  After rummaging through the bookshelves and finding nothing that caught my interest, I stumbled across the three Harry Potter books and decided to give them a try.<br/><br/>With the first couple of pages, I was sucked in to the world that JK Rowling had created. There really aren't that many stories out there that I have found to be so engrossing.  As we follow Harry on his epic path to defeat the evil Lord Voldemort, so many good life lessons are learned by the characters of the story.  Good doesn't always overcome evil, bad things can happen to good people, and sometimes the bully escapes punishment.  Harry learns that sometimes sacrifices have to be made, up to and including the ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>I admit I was one of those crazy people who would be at the nearest mall, waiting for midnight to pick up the next book as soon as it was released.  I usually bought 4 copies as well, so nobody in the house had to wait a day or two to read it!  The Harry Potter series also introduced my children to the joys of reading.  Neither one read for pleasure until they were old enough to comprehend this reading level and I pushed them to try reading this series.  They both enjoyed the movies tremendously, and after explaining that they were missing so much by not reading the full story, they both eventually read the books.  My daughter is in college and my son in high school, and they have both become avid readers after realizing that a book has so much more to offer than a movie.  I have purchased the entire series of 7 books in hardback and paperback and have more than one full set.  These books have become well-loved and we all return to the books again and again.  I find that I always go back and re-read the series whenever one of the movies has been released, and so do both of my children.<br/><br/>The prose of the stories reminds me a bit of Roald Dahl (James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), and there are some turns of phrase that are definitely British.  However, the books are very easy reads.  If you're at all emotional, have tissues ready when you read books 4, 5, 6, and 7!  Even if you've not ever been insterested in reading the fantasy genre, the Harry Potter series is one to try.  At times I find myself wishing for a magic wand and fantasizing about moving to England...
 Love these books
 This original cover art copy of The Chamber of Secrets is exactly what you would expect it to be.  Loved the book as a kid, and was happy to find the original artwork to match the rest of my set when my first copy was destroyed while moving.
 Great
 Great book.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
 JK Rowling did a very good job linking past books into this one. As always the book was a bit too wordy and most certainly could have been cut in half. I'm 52 and have been a fan of the Potter series since its inception. My only disappointment in the way the series ended is that the author did not say what the original group (except Neville) was doing with their lives 19 years later after the defeat of Valdemort. Other than that I'd say the explanation of Snapes' dislike of Potter from the beginning was believable and plausible, the defeat of Valdemort was brilliant, and the lessons learned applicable to any generation. Life is about love and hope and the Potter series truly delivers.
 excellent product highly recommended
 This book was the perfect ending to one of the most famous stories. I saw the movies first, and they didn’t do the ending justice. I cried, then I was laughing, then I was pacing the floor because of the suspense, then I cried more. JK Rowling is a genius.
 I bought this book BRAND new and it came in today and there’s stains all on the pages and they’re discolored. NOT happy.
 Perhaps it is case of over-exposure but I was a little disappointed in this book, which ends such an extremely popular series.  The plot, at times, seemed rushed - as if Rowling had more to say but not enough time to say it.  Moreover, for anyone who reads a look of fantasy, the storyline seems pretty familiar and one of the things I had thought the Harry Potter books did well was stay away from that typicality.  All in all, it was still a good read and a "must" for anyone that has been keeping up with the series.  The Harry Potter series is cleary wrapped but it seemed to me that Rowling left herself an opening for a new series in this same wizarding world but with someone other than Harry Potter as the lead.  It'll be interesting to see if she returns to it in the future.
 GREAT PRICE FOR THIS SET! BOX SET IS VERY NICE :]
 Awesome  books
 Those of us who have been following the boy wizard through his years at Hogwarts will find Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows a riveting read and one that answers many of the unanswered questions in earlier books.  I was, however, very disappointed that Rowling choose as her final climax,  a Battle of Hogwarts in which the students, just barely of age, joined Harry in fighting Voledemort and his Death Eating followers.<br/><br/> Where's the magic in that?  I felt the book catered too much to mindless  public blood lust for violence, war and death.<br/><br/>Surely it really would be magic to confront the forces of evil and today's market place without the necessity of killing off somebody.
 I have to start by saying that I'm sorry the series had to end, I have enjoyed reading the books and seeing the movies.  With that said, this book grabs your attention from the beginning and never lets go.  It mentions things from past books, brings in all our favorite, and maybe not so favorite characters, and reaches a climax a long time coming.  The final few pages ties the whole thing together leaving the reader with a good feeling of closure.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling should be very proud of what she has accomplished with this series.  It says a lot about an author that can write a book that both children and adults want to read and I for one, thank her.
 I kept putting off reading the series, though many of my friends and family urged me for years.  When I finally decided to buy the books I was so happy to see this packaged set at an excellent price.  I'm just reviewing how this is packaged and it's great.  Well bound, perfect size (not too small for these old eyes) and fits wonderfully on my bookshelf.  My husband and I carried each over-sized paperback book everywhere with us, delighting in their great dual purpose as conversation pieces, and they held up very well, with no torn covers or pages.  Great condition for re-reading should we wish to.
 What a series. And to cap it off the way J.K. Rowling did - truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Harry Potter must set out on a mission with his two friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, to find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes, the pieces of soul that are keeping Voldemort immortal. Only after the destruction of the Horcruxes can Voldemort be defeated forever. In the story, Harry faces difficult surroundings, adversity, persecution, tragedy, losses, adventure, bravery, and most importantly, love.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling has gone to new lengths with this incredible series. You can find pieces of the story littered around all seven of the books. I get excited when I find hints, clues, and pieces of foreshadowing that are later discussed and are essential pieces of the puzzle in the other books. J.K. Rowling is a master at the linking of the story, one which she began writing in 1991 on napkins in the local cafe because of her poverty, to other pieces of the story. She has truly opened up the eyes of all of the doubters and all of the people who once said that such an amazing feat was an impossible task. J.K. Rowling started off with nothing, struggling to live a normal life, sometimes having to go hungry in order to feed her baby daughter. She has become a woman who is the highest grossing author in history.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the Harry Potter series has led hundreds of millions of children to start reading and also gave children, and adults as well, a friend and a comfort in the characters of Harry Potter. It is sad that the Harry Potter series cannot continue, but all good things in life must eventually come to an end. We should all praise the work ethic and efforts of J.K. Rowling, a person who has shown that anything is possible with just a little stroke of magic.
 Harry's adventures (and J.K. Rowling's ingenius writing) continues with this second installment. No disappointments here. Although the story sagged a bit in the middle (just a bit!), this one was just as good as the first.<br/>Terrific plot twists and vivid imagery. It was wonderful to get re-acquainted with some old friends and meet new ones...and as always, I love how Rowling depicts the Dursleys. She has a great sense of humor.<br/>The first chapter will have you in stitches.<br/>Get this one!<br/>Cris
 Good read
 Good condition
 Once upon a time I went to see a Harry Potter movie....the very first one.  I didn't care for it at all.  Who was this Harry Potter and why should I care about him.  The reviews of the books all said the books were better than Wizard of Oz.  How could that be?  A few years passed and Harry was more popular than ever.  In talking to a girl at work I asked her which Harry Potter book did her fan-boyfriend liked best.  She said "Goblet of Fire".  I bought it.  I read it.  I fell in love.  These stories are so charming and real.  So delightful and insightful.  Of course I read the first 3 and then bought the last 3 in hard back.  But I even wanted more.  I now have all on CDs and listen to them at work.  Jim Dale does the voices beautifully.  You can tell who is Harmione, Harry, Ron, Prof Snape, Umbridge.  Jim is a great reader and voice and you hear every word.  Unlike the movies, that are like reader's digest versions of these wonderful stories, you get it all.  And I promise you will enjoy it all.  Warning: The "Deathy Hallows" can make you cry, with joy and with sorrow.  This can be a bit awkward at work.  But life is about feelings and so are these marvelous stories.  Start with any book of the books and you will know the Harry Potter story.  But don't be put off because you don't have time or just don't like to read.  Listening can get you there too.  It's nice to be proven wrong about popular opinion.  I'm so glad I tried to see what Harry was all about.  My life is richer for it and I promise your life will be richer too.
 Gave as a gift, My niece screamed, best aunt award goes to me !
 Great, easy to read books.  My daughter and I are towards the end of the second book.  We are great time reading the stories together.  Already looking forward to the next book.
 Just as described. Given as gift. He loved the collector box they come in
 J.K. Rowling has kept the momentum going since the first book. I cannot express how gifted she is and how wonderfully these books are written. They are pure fantasy, yet, so many day-to-day life experiences can relate to them. Any age can read this, and by this I mean, the older crowd to the younger crowd. This will take you away on an adventure, back to another time. I am almost done reading this book, but wish it would never end. It is a wonderful series, and great read. I would recommend these books to everyone; although, I will say, I have witnessed even the busiest of children,(i.e children than cannot sit still and they are constantly moving...) sit and read her books. I applaud a great mind, and one with such creativity. I only wish there was more...<br/>As this is the final book of the series, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione one last time.
 I had not bought any of the Harry Potter books yet because I was waiting for a final set.  The price is usually cheaper than buying them all separately and I was hoping for some kind of collector's casing.  The "chest" really isn't of collector quality.  It is adequate enough to hold the books but will need to be treated with care in order for it not to be ruined.  The reason I still gave this item 3 stars is because of the price that I paid ~ $115.  At that price this is still a good deal for the books and it's like you get the box for free.  However, it is definitely not worth the MSRP price.  If you just want the books and can get it at that price then go for it.  But, if you are a true Harry Potter fan and want a collector's set I would hold out for something better.
 Although I am a fantasy fan, I was not interested in reading the Harry Potter books because I saw them as children's fiction.  However, my adult daughter read the series, loved them, and gave me a set of the first 6 books at Christmas.  I started reading because I love her. Boy, was I surprised at how entertaining they were for me.  After the first two books (Harry at ages 11 and 12) the story actually became quite dark and intriging. I purchased the last book from Amazon and was really sorry to say goodbye to the characters when I finished.<br/><br/>The books are classic good versus evil with strong messages about the power of love, respect, and kindness, as well as the value of friendship, loyalty, honor and courage, hard work and intelligence. As far as children and young adults, I think the later books could be pretty disturbing in places for kids under 11 or 12, so parents should read with the kids or carefully assess the maturity of the readers.  But a great thing about young people liking these books is that fact that they teach valuable lessons about tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness towards those who are "different".  With all the bullying in schools and on-line, this is especially important.<br/><br/>Having over 3,000 pages to work on the characters was a bonus.  But keeping up the quality of the work over so many years and pages, as Rowling fleshed out her initial vision of how she wanted the story to end is a pretty amazing literary feat.  We have all seen some great series peter out badly.  All in all I am very happy with my Christmas gift. I was skeptical at first, but am truly impressed.
 What can I say that millions of people around the world don't already know?  Harry Potter has to be one of the greatest stories ever.  J.K. Rowling is a creative genius to have created such a imaginative world and great characters to fill it.<br/>If you haven't read any of the books, then get this boxed set.  You won't be sorry!!  It culminates in the 4th book, Goblet of Fire, agruably the best in the series so far.<br/>And just so you know, I am 23 years old and know of many older people that love Harry Potter.  Heck, my father is almost 70 years old and almost likes HP more than me.<br/>Get it already!
 Beautiful! These books are the best. If you have a Harry Potter fan in your family, this makes the perfect gift!
 Im STOKED to have this book. The only negative is that the corner of the book is slight damaged which is disappointing. I wish I had known.
 This is a great set for the price!
 me gusta HP desde niña y recien logro comprarme los libros. La caja es muy bonita y los libros tambien tienen un tamaño de letra apropiado.
 Beautiful books, great Christmas gift for my son!
 Recommended from my son, purchased for my grandson.
 I love it!
 Good book
 Book 7. The end. And really, kudos to Rowling for sticking with making it a finite series. Kudos, too, for writing something that captured the imagination of so many people of all ages. It's incredible how widespread the appeal of Harry Potter is. I'm in awe of her imagination and ability to strike such a nearly-universal chord.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this book--all the wrapping up of various threads, the explanations, tying things together--it was a satisfying conclusion, fitting to the rest of the series.<br/><br/>That said, though, I'm not one of those who thinks these are the Best Books Ever(tm). Sorry, but I'm not. I acknowledge and applaud their popularity and entertainment value, but they're not perfect.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the story already, yes? Basically, it's Harry Potter, boy wizard, vs. Voldemort, the evilest dark wizard ever. And this is the last book, the showdown. Everything else is secondary to that. Right, then.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with Deathly Hallows is the Great Swampy Middle. Harry and only one or two of his friends (see how cleverly I avoided spoilers, there?) spend almost the whole middle half of the book wandering around pretty much aimlessly. Oh, things happen, but it's mostly just by luck or happenstance, and they spend an inordinate amount of time bored and discouraged, and that emotion really gets passed on to the reader. Case in point: I'm currently reading it aloud with my sons at breakfast. We're smack in the middle. At the beginning of the book, they were quiet, hanging on every word. Now, they interrupt, go off on tangents talking about other things--in short, they're not involved in this part of the book. They're bored.<br/><br/>My second biggest problem was the deaths. Oh, come on. That's not a spoiler. Everybody knows there are deaths--people have been speculating for years about who it'll be. I'm fine with there being deaths--it is a war, after all, and people die--but it's the way Rowling writes them. It's very casual, a behind-closed-doors sort of thing, the way some authors treat sex scenes. Which is also okay, in theory, except that generally, even if they close the door, you know the gist of what's going on behind it. Not so, here. I'm all for leaving out the gory physical details, but not the emotional ones. They were so down-played that I didn't even believe them, and that also goes for the previous two deaths in the series--I fully expected the characters to pop up again, because she didn't make the deaths real. I'm not sure I've explained it completely--every time I discuss it, somebody ends up thinking I'm either wanting nobody to die, or I'm wanting blood and guts. I guess the main thing is I wanted them to be more believable, and I wanted them to mean something. Yes, yes, in real life death is often pointless. But this isn't that kind of book.<br/><br/>Then there were the Deathly Hallows. Yes, they explain a couple of things, and answer a question I hadn't even thought to ask, but they seemed to come out of nowhere, and we're still burdened with the Horcruxes that came out of nowhere in the last book, and they really seemed to clutter up the plot.<br/><br/>The "romance" with Ginny was another pointless cluttering. She's hardly in the book at all, except for the occasional wistful thought from Harry, and I'd have been happier without it.<br/><br/>And Dudley. There's a Big Deal with him at the beginning of the book, but that's it. Over. Finished. No follow-through. Reeaaaally annoying.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the epilogue. It was reminiscent of romance series epilogues, listing all the couples from the various books, and the number and gender of their offspring and pets. And it's just as pointless.<br/><br/>But yeah, apart from all that--I did enjoy the book, and I'm glad I read it, and I really meant all those earlier kudos.
 My son loves this book collection.
 And they are gorgeous. I made the decision to buy this hardcover set after picking the books up again to find that, over time, the amount of tape holding them together probably weighed more than the original books themselves. (yes, i've re-read them so many times that my former hardcover "Goblet of Fire" had to have its cover ripped off while it was converted to paperback by copious amounts of masking tape &gt;.&lt; )<br/><br/>While the cardboard box was kind of disappointing (i knew it was before purchase), it was the books I was really after. And really, lets be realistic; if the box were wood, it would cost more than the $114.00 I paid for it. (And im sure with a trip to the local hardware store, someone could get some plywood, some stain and a couple of nails and make their own box if they really wanted.)<br/><br/>The cardboard isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be though. It's fairly sturdy and holds the weight of the books well. The lock was a little hard to unclasp at first but one must remember also that brute force is not the answer to everything. Just gently prise the middle apart horizontally and you'll be fine.<br/><br/>The books are gorgeous with all the original cover art. The stickers are beautiful as well. If you love the books as much as I do and they're showing the strain (as mine still do ^^) then this is a must have. For the price, it is an awesome deal. Buying the hardcover books individually would cost you over $150.00 alone, so this is a great bargain. They are a great collector's item, and I plan on saving them for my own children to read while in the meantime I continue to patch up my old ones :)
 great reading now to give them to my grand kid
 Box in which books are in, arrived ripped and falling apart
 Until recently, my only experience with Harry Potter was in watching the movies with my grandchildren. I loved the movies but never got around to reading the books until a few months ago when I borrowed them through Kindle Unlimited. I loved the books and this was a rare case where the books and the movies were equally good. The books were literate and not at all condescending towards their target audience of young people. At the same time, the books had appeal for adults and held my interest throughout. I decided that I would buy the books as soon as finances permitted because I wanted them available in my library in case they were ever dropped from KU.<br/><br/> I expected it to take some time before I could buy the books. However, a very nice person posted on the price drops forum that not only was a couple collection available now, but was being offered at a ridiculously low price. I quickly one-clicked and did my happy dance.<br/><br/>I love having all of the books in one collection, and as others have noted, it has easy navigation and all of the illustrations are included; there were no shortcuts taken with this set. The set is no longer fifteen dollars, but my review is based on content and not price. The sale price was just a serendipitous occurrence, but even at full price, the collection is good value for money.<br/><br/>I can see people being disappointed and upset because they missed the sale, but that is no reason to give the books a bad review. The regular price is not out of line with what books by other popular authors cost. Besides, thousands of books have price drops every day, some lasting only a couple of hours. I have several ways in which I track book prices, but still, I have missed sales on books I wanted; it is no one's fault.
 Being a Christian, I stayed away from all things Harry Potter.  Then, my kids got interested in him while visiting their father.  At his house, Harry was all that!  So, being the mom meant checking Harry out.  Now, I wish all the Christian world would embrace the world of Harry Potter!  There is much to instruct, uplift, and challenge us.  We loved "Chamber of secrets"!  The imagery is vivid, and the characters real in their response to the circumstances in which they find themselves. We learned from their mistakes and triumphs. Consequently, I have read all the books to date, and have encouraged my children to do the same.  We can't wait until the last book comes out.  Happy reading.
 We enjoyed this book as much as the first. The characters are believable and the story is compelling. We can’t wait to read the next one.
 It's perfect, beautiful drawings outside and inside the books, very sturdy and comfortable in your hands to read.
 It was indeed the complete set of hard cover books, though I was hoping the storage container was actual trunk or some such. Regardless, my sister loved her gift and quickly added the stickers it came with all over the place. I wrote her name and address on the top where the "deliver to: " was which added a personal touch.
 This book was overall very satisfying, but I am sad to see the series end.  I hope Ms. Rowling writes more about our heroes some day.<br/><br/>Even though some parts are a little repetitive, and the dream sequence was a little confusing, there is enough action in this book to satisfy anyone.  I laughed, I cried, and at the end, I sighed with satisfaction.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans, and I most heartily recommend the entire series to anyone with an imagination.  I have personally seen my grandkids and my students reading these books voluntarily and with great enjoyment, when some of them had previously refused to read anything!  From reading these books, many of them have gone on to explore much more literature with appreciation and enjoyment.<br/><br/>I do recommend that any Harry Potter newcomer begin by reading the first book, and read them all in order, as they all mesh perfectly together chronologically, and if not read in order, the reader will miss many subtle nuances that become important later.
 Amazing illustrations! High quality Printing. Fantastic purchase! I bought the first two books, but had to wait 3 months for the 3rd. Worth the wait.
 What's left to say.  This is the classic conclusion to the classic saga and it is a just and fitting conclusion
 Christmas gift.
 Just wonderous.  If only it were real.  Ms Rowling is an unsurpassed story teller. A true bard.  Thank you for this
 Beautiful site, got them as a birthday present for my son and they are much loved
 was a gift
 I have seen the Harry Potter movies, but after receiving The Cursed Child, I thought I'd best re-read the whole series.  I downloaded The Complete Collection as my birthday gift to myself.  BEWARE...I read books on my iPad via the Kindle app.  Every book I've read so far using that app has been read using my iPad in a landscape position, where the books display two pages on the screen.  With The Complete Collection, I would lose text from the bottom of the right hand page to the top of the next page when I "turned" the page.  When I would return to the previous page, it had reformatted itself on the screen and included the text that had been skipped.  When I "turned" the page again, more text had been skipped.  I turned the iPad to portrait position, so only one, longer page displays at a time, and the problem of skipped text disappeared.
 Package came a full 2 days early! Everything is perfect, neat, clean. Only thing I dislike is the container they put the books in. Its a very cheap cardboard material, where the picture looks like it could be made with something a but more high end. Other than that, everything great!
 I pre-ordered this book from amazon, and it was delivered on the release date as stated it would be.<br/><br/>--Now for the review. I don't want to go into much detail about the book, I realize that some people may have read what they thought to have been spoilers on the book, as I actually did read a piece of a spoiler while searching "harry potter" in google. Happily, the supposedly spoiler was not correct, thus the ending was genuine.<br/><br/>--Let me say that I personally think that this is the most amazing book of the entire series. The first 5 chapters of this book, are perhaps the greatest first 5 chapters out of all the books. This book is a lot different than any of the other books, and this book is more of a ending book, "seems that the whole book is the ending" I read this book in 15 hours. I would highly recommend the books over the movies, however if you have read the books and then watch the movies, your knowledge of the books fill in the skipped things in the movies. I would like to thank amazon, for getting my book shipped out on time, and I would like to thank J.K. Rowling for these most touching books, that I now hold a place in my heart for.
 Beautiful collection! The covers are gorgeous and great quality! Slightly bummed that the mini pictures from the chapter headings were replaced by the three stars, but the map inside the cover is really neat.
 My copies were coming apart, I enjoyed reading the collection again.
 yep
 Everything from the books to the cardboard box are all high quality. My Order of the Phoenix book has a bad fray at the top of the book due to, what I assume, a bad cut during production.
 Good stuff
 Just as amazing as it looks!
 I was very late to the Harry Potter rush.  When I had initially heard about the "little kids books" involving Harry Potter, I thought Potter was the author.  Only once the movie came out did I start reading the books.  I literally couldn't put them down.  I read all 4 books in about 3 weeks total.  I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway.<br/>Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic!  As long as you're between the ages of 4 and 114, you will love them!
 Love these books and this was a great deal!
 Great
 Awesome art work. Great book.
 A lot can be said for this book, but the first thing that came to mind was, "she really did it. It is over." What she actually did will not be revealed here, even if others are posting it everywhere. this is not a spoiler. Suffice it to say that she made it clear that there will be no more books about the teenage angst filled wizard Harry Potter.<br/>The book was not as engrossing as the first couple. The first couple I went sleepless nights to finish. I did not do that with this one. I am not sure if that had anything to do with the story telling, or was more just a factor of the daunting appearance of 700+ pages sitting before me.<br/>This was one of the most consistently good series I have ever read.<br/>Enjoy it!
 My boyfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan and was missing a couple of the books. He loves the fact that these come together in a nice, sturdy box! Great buy!
 Probably the most widely anticipated novel in the past century by children and adults alike. It was well worth the wait. While there were a few repetitive scenes roaming the forest that were reminiscent of the never ending buffalo running in Dancing with Wolves, the majority of the plot moved along with "ah-ha" moments. J. K. Rowling neatly tied up almost all the details that you have been wondering about in the last six books. While I cheated and looked to the last chapter before I began reading the book, it was still a pleasure finding out how all the charachters got there. I am just sad that it is all over. I also wonder what happened to the Dursleys.
 Beautiful book.  Must have for any potterhead
 I am 46 years old and when I found out the Harry Potter Books were on Audio I had to have them to go along with all the other Harry Potter stuff I already have.  Actually, my Aunt Bea bought me my first set, Book One The Sorcerer's Stone, about a month ago and I have been addicted ever since. I love the way the reader, Jim Dale, reads. He takes you right into the books and brings them to life with his different voices for different characters.  The way he reads you can tell who the characters are before he even says who's speaking. He is an awesome reader. I listen to the books over and over again, while driving in my car, cleaning my house, working in the yard and even in bed before I fall asleep.  It's like being a kid all over again and having someone tell you a bedtime story. I appreciate J. K. Rowling for bringing the magic back into my life. My 5 year old grand daughter listens to the books as well. She has grown up with Harry Potter. It is a wonderful tale of love, hardship, grief, inner strength, courage, friendship, challenge, sportsmanship, compassionship and much, much more. There are many life lessons in these books that, I think, are wonderful for children, as well as adults, to learn. Everyone should have the pleasure of hearing the Harry Potter books read you them. They will not regret it.
 This book is in horrible condition! How it is considered "Acceptable" is beyond me! The binding is broken in pieces and falling out! The corner up top is ripped wide open. It's yellowed and torn all over the place!
 Son loves it
 I loved all the mystery. Keeps you wanting more! Even adults love these books. They are for all ages., looking forward to the next one!
 After finally caving in and picking up the first Harry Potter, I became hooked, just like everyone else (hey, I like to fit in!).  I think I had even more fun reading the second Harry, as I spent most of the first one getting used to all the wonderful witches and wizards (and some not so wonderful ones).  During the second one, I felt like a proud veteran, who could immediately jump into the action, with a smirk on my veteran face.<br/><br/>Goodness, I didn't think it could get any better!  The story opens with Harry's crazed uncle Vernon, and Harry's subsequent flight (quite literally) to Hogwarts, to start his second year at school of wizardry.  Hissing walls, dark lords, Phoenixes and talking diaries are just some of the delights that ring so true, even if learned people say they are impossible.  Harry is famous among wizards, but that fame gives Harry more heartache than anything else.  But Harry does not back away and confronts everything that is thrown at him, with no pretenses of being fearless.  Harry is as real as any one of us.<br/><br/>It is official now - I am a Harry Potter addict.  I could have quit after the first one, but now that is no longer a possibility.  Looking forward to reading the third one!
 Book as described. A must have.

 These books differ slightly from the essence of the movies but contain a wealth of information and detail that is missing from the adaptations.<br/><br/>See the movies, sure, but READ these books!
 All the ends have been nicely tied, the relationships have been settled in the manner fans would have expected but I felt strangely let down. Perhaps it is the realisation that Harry and his friends will not have a new adventure next year. This of course is as it should be, Harry after all is the ultimate teenager so he wouldn't do to be hanging around in his 30's, 40's or heaven forebid his 60's. Farewell Harry et al.
 I brought this for my niece who decided halfway through the first book she would DIE if she didn’t have her own copy of the series...<br/><br/>I now have a devastated nine year old as for some reason my set doesn’t have the second book in it
 come on Harry Potter .. enough said
 Thanks JK Rowling!!<br/><br/>HARRY LIVES....or maybe not!!! ...inside of us, as do many of the characteristics, thoughts and actions of many of the characters including he who CAN be named...Voldemort! Maybe we can see ourselves better as a result of our journey with Ms Rowling's inescapable world of CONFLICTS AND FRIENDSHIPS.<br/><br/>Does this book or the series really matter? that depends on each of us..... will we apply ourselves to risk and win and lose with our own lives? We all identify with Harry and DA members but what about the voldemort days we have? i have  shed tears of joy and sorrow while on this journey as i have in my own life now 54 years in passing.<br/><br/>GOOD vs EVIL ...internal and external ....master vs slave....yes, i can relate to this struggle not only for myself but for my 21 nephews and nieces and for the thousands of Americans now serving our country overseas!<br/><br/>will we be the same as before HP or apply the healing balm of love to the world we presently live in?<br/><br/>DON'T BE OVERCOME WITH EVIL BUT OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD.....
 This was a well received Xmas gift.
 This was a Christmas gift for our 13 year old granddaughter. She was thrilled!
 Always an awesome read. It's good having all the books together in one place. You will read more than once.
 A well loved gift.
 This is the a fantastic set for Harry Potter fans, my nine year old loved it so much...
 I bought this series for me. I found the books went into so much more detail that the movies left out. U know what they say, the book is always better. I gave the set to my 10 year old grandson for X Mass. He loved this gift!!
 It’s never too late to read Harry Potter.
 Good set of books.  Great presentation.  Being given asa Christmas present
 Great book ordered for my 10 year old.
 kids love but too expensive
 I love these books.  It wish that I had started reading them years ago when my students told me to.
 another gift to the same friend and she loves it
 As stated previously, the books in this collection deserve 5 stars each. I have to wonder what they were thinking when the final decision was made that this pitiful "trunk" was just dandy to house such a phenominal collection of books. I can just see it falling apart over a period of years. Take a look at the "trunk" used for the DVD collection of the first five Harry Potter films. That trunk at least has a real metal latch and is NOT made of cardboard. The publishers should keep in mind that their are plenty die-hard fans that are willing to pay the extra cash for a quality collectible. Forget it! I'll hold out for a swanky collecor's set of books worth a heftier price tag (one of these days you know there will be another and better set to shell out the bug bucks for).
 loved the new harry potter paperback with new illstrating then the old one so when i get ready to reread this serius again when i get to seeing the cover it will get me more into the book to start  the price was good.
 The ending sucked!  I know this review will be lost under the Everest of glowing, five-star positive reviews.  Nevertheless, I thought Rowling did a great job of closing the series, leading up to the final confrontation between Voldemort and Harry.  However, Harry should have died.  Without a doubt, the conversation between himself and Dumbledore could have been the great sorrowful ending I wished for.  Maybe I like Greek trajedy a little too much, but the end of such a terrible evil should be paid for with the lives of some important innocents.  Fred, Tonks, Lupin - they're minor characters.  I wanted Ron or Hermione or at least Harry dead, but Rowling lost her nerve.  She fell under Potter's sway, and he is quite charismatic (just like his dad) but I still have to blame her for that.  For what it's worth, I'll read the next book Rowling puts out because she has a wonderful tone that the reader falls in love with, that will drive someone watching tv to pick up the book and say nothing for hours, rapt in attention to the travails of Harry.  And Snape's memories was a terrific chapter, without it this would be a 3-star review.
 She loved them!
 who doesnt love Harry Potter? :)
 Huge sales! You can't go wrong with Mr. Potter.
 Love it and it's conveniently on my iPad.
 My daughter requested the complete series, in paperback, for Christmas and I complied.  I've eagerly read each book as it has been published and own the hard cover editions myself.  I've come to really love the characters, and to really dislike others, as I believe was the author's intention.  I enjoy the imaginative story line and the many plays on words, such as an alley which only wizards can see called Diagon Alley  (diagonally), or one of the houses at the school, whose members we are introduced to seem mean, evil or slimy -- the house is called Slytherin (Slither in).  A book can portray so much more of a story than a movie.  I disagree with critics who think the series is satinic -- it is fanciful -- it is fiction -- get over yourselves.  As an educator and a believer in the first amendment, I say if the book entices a child to read, it is a great book.
 Love love love this book set. Came as expected
 none
 Granddaughter loved this series
 Arrived in perfect condition. Storage box is a great touch.
 Exactly what i ordered. No issues
 good
 My sons loves it!
 An absolutely beautiful rendition of the original book. The pullout Diagon Alley print is very cool too.
 It's really interesting to see what has happened to the Harry Potter series.  It started out as a classic children's adventure story, and 7 books later it has essentially morphed into a marvelous adult horror story.  The first couple of books mostly focused on being "cute" and here at the end we have one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read.  This is certainly not a criticism mind you.  Each book has become more and more ambitious and also widened their appeal proportionally.<br/><br/>While I started off as a very reluctant Harry Potter reader, I can say that I am now a huge fan.  I can honestly say that the Deathly Hollows is by far my favorite of the series and one of my all time favorites.  What I regret though is that it's all over.  The Hogwarts world has become such a rich and engrossing world that it is difficult to accept that there won't be more stories.<br/><br/>And for those concerned that you'll hate the ending, don't be.  Rowling did a great job with that.  No Sopranos-esque debacles here.  Here we have a writer that really knows how to finish off an epic story.
 Would recommend to everyone who wants to read a good fantasy series or just a series to read over the summer.
 Ditto to all the positive reviews you've read, flawed, but entertaining and gripping until the end. The contents of the book were wonderful, the physical properties of the book were less so, read below:<br/><br/>(Warning - big whiny complaining story follows) My complaint is with the construction of the book rather than the contents. My first copy started to peel away from the glue of the spine during the first reading. It parted company completely and we returned it. The second copy was barely opened when it fell apart. I contacted Scholastic and after some back and forth, they agreed to send a new copy out to me. I don't expect it to hold up any better than the previous two, but we'll see.<br/><br/>Since the Harry Potter series will join the Chronicles of Narnia, the Chronicles of Prydain, the Lord of the Ring series and anything written by Robert A. Heinlein as books I hope that my grandchildren will read and enjoy, I expect better than the shoddy  workmanship shown here. Scholastic's first email said that since they'd had such a big job printing 12 million copies, I should expect defects!
 Great value
 Good product , recommended
 I have followed several series of novels in the past few years and every one has disappointed me when the final book is written and read. Deathly Hallows breaks that mold for me. From page one, the mood is set and Ms Rowling takes you with Harry on his final journey in his epic battle between good and evil, personified in his nemesis, Voldemort.<br/><br/>I was pleased to see how many of the characters have grown and matured through the series, especially a few of the Gryffindors, who are always known for their bravery. As we have "watched" these characters grow, we have indeed become attached to them, and we hold our breaths as their fates dangle precariously by a thread.<br/><br/>As with all good sagas, we say goodbye to several characters, several which were a surprise to me. I will ruin the book for no one, but I will say that a few of the deaths in the book hit me harder than I had expected.<br/><br/>The suspense leading up to the finale and the climax of the book bring the series to a very satisfying close. I believe that "Deathly Hallows" brings closure to the ending of Harry's stories. My one wish is that J. K. Rowling's outstanding series will turn a world of children who have been with Harry since year one into artists themselves, taking quill in hand and spreading their empty parchment before them to write their own stories of adventure and danger. With Ms Rowling as a role-model, we may yet see a new rennaissance of literature in the next decade.
 When I discovered my niece was a fan of J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series, I began searching for the complete set of books - which I thought would make a wonderful birthday present.  However, I soon found that sets at my local bookstores were going to cost approximately $100...and in some cases, much more.  I love my niece, but spending that much money on a pre-teen is not what I consider responsible adult behavior.<br/><br/>Imagine my delight when I discovered this set on Amazon - a brand-new, boxed, complete set of all seven "Harry Potter" books in the durable softcover large size! The price was roughly half what the cheapest price was anywhere else, so I took a chance and made the purchase. Within a matter of days, my books had arrived; they were exactly what I was looking for, still sealed not only in their display box, but also in the protective plastic from the publisher.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this product, as well as Amazon for working with this particular seller.
 J. K. Rowling will keep you spellbound with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". It has all the aspects of the first book: action, adventure, and suspense. I love how J. K. Rowling makes her memorable characters come alive by making you love them or hate them. After I finished with "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" I couldn't wait to get the sequel. Words cannot tell how much I love these books, I mean even my mom loves them. J. K. Rowling has gotta be one of the world's greatest author's and I hope she'll keep the books coming!
 It's Harry. Enough said.
 The plot was well thought out and very imaginative. It kept you guessing to the very end. I recommend it to the young and old alike.
 The book itself is amazing and fabulous! However , my book cover came damaged.
 Kids read more than few times. Good gift for everyone
 Quality product, great books, this purchase has it all.
 A great read for all ages
 I bought and read the books as they came out.  I have also seen all the movies as they came out, then again in marathons.  We recently watched the movies again and I became curious about the books as it has been a very long time since I have read them and I wanted to read them again.  My problem, however, is I now have nerve damage in my eye from shingles and I can no longer read actual bound books as reading causes pain in my eye.  Thank goodness J.K. Rowling has finally agreed to release her books in digital form!<br/><br/>It is slightly sad, however, that since they are all in one, my progress appears to be very slow.  After hours and days of reading I am only 13% through as the book is 4224 pages!  Not a problem, though, just a silly side story!<br/><br/>I am glad I have started rereading them!  I had forgotten just how amazing and fun they are to read!
 Perfect for a potterhead!
 For the most part, I really enjoyed reading this book.  It certainly has its minor flaws and inconsistencies, but over-analysis of any multiple-book series this complex will always yield them.  Other reviewers have mentioned my two main dislikes about this book:<br/><br/>1) The middle drags quite a bit.  It seems like with so much to resolve, the entire book could be used to reveal secrets and plot details.  Instead, we are treated to (what seems like) many chapters of "Harry doesn't know what to do or look for next."  After a while I started thinking, "OK, we get it, Harry and team are stuck on their quest!"<br/><br/>2) The epilogue is weak and unsatisfying.  I think most Harry Potter readers could've written that epilogue themselves.  No epilogue at all would've left most readers guessing that what happened to the characters is precisely what Rowling wrote.<br/><br/>Still, the end was pretty satisfying and well-conceived.  While there were moments where I feared the whole thing would degenerate into a giant Star Wars or Lord of the Rings battle, I was glad to see the story stay a little more thoughtful than that.
 great product quality !
 This final book in the series is a wonderful end to a wonderful series.  After Dumbledores death in the previous book, Harry, Hermoine and Ron must fulfill the wishes of their headmaster and find the seven horcruxes, destroy them and put an end to the rule of "He who must not be named".  This book grabs you from the beginning when you realize that things are not always what they seem, people are not who you thought they were and questions are answered with characters background stories finally being told.  This story is much darker than the previous books, but all that is played out against the tender love that is blooming.
 I couldn't be happier with my purchase of these harry potter books. Like so many other Potter fans I grew up with these characters-- im literally close in age so it was easy to relate to them as I went through my childhood along with my friends. So many bookstores tend to run these box sets for the regular listed price with little to no discounts. But Bought mine from amazon brand new and in fantastic condition. I was so thrilled to see that amazon had them marked down and even better I was able to purchase them with a gift card.<br/><br/>The books are so so good and I couldn't imagine life without them in existence. Rowling allows you to take a trip in her mind to a world that is quite similar to our own and another half that is beyond comparison. No one better could come up with these novels like her...but that hasn't stopped many authors from trying to put a foot in the door for competition.<br/><br/>Reading some of the reviews many are based on the presentation of the box the books come in. Yeah it's made of cardboard, but I have yet to buy a box of books that is anything more. Sure they deserve a good box because they are awesome novels... but if you want one, go buy one to your liking. They most likely would not sell these books at this price if it was all about the box cause the price that is charged is the approximate value of the books inside.I give my rating five stars on 7 lovely novels that I'm so happy to finally have copies of my own.I would also definitely recommend to any Potter fan to purchase this box set if you want all the books such a great price for softcovers and an even better price to those who really can't afford to purchase the much pricier hardcovers. Plus don't buy for the box buy the box set for the books :)
 came in a case extremly nice not cheap case
 This book is great at first reading; it's wonderful as it is reread over and over.  J.K. Rowling does an excellent job of wrapping up the series with this book.  To know that she wrote the last 1/3 over ten years ago is amazing and she integrates it so well that you do not realize it was written so long ago.<br/><br/>Watching Harry grow and mature, to learn what he must learn if he is to defeat Voldemort, is the heart of this story.  Anyone who has started reading the Harry Potter books must save this for last.  Not because it is the last book, but because it completes the journey started when Harry is left on the Dursley's doorstep.<br/><br/>Do not miss this book.
 It's a great book
 Excellent  shape
 Bought books as a gift. My granddaughter loved the books!
 Got this for my little sister for xmas and was super happy.
 Grandson loves it!
 This is my second harry potter collection set and love it!!
 Gift for daughter..she loved them
 I got this for my oldest and she loves it. She loves to read so this was the perfect first big chapter book she is reading.
 I'm 32 years old and originally bought these books for my infant son, thinking (with all the hype going on) this might be cute to read to him at night. We started with one chapter a night, but after the first two nights I couldn't wait any longer and read it all the way through.  Then I got my husband to read them.  We loved it and were hooked!  J.K. Rowling has a wonderful writing style that both children and adults can enjoy.  The children characters are easy to relate with at any age.  A great book for parents and children to enjoy TOGETHER!
 My nieces like it
 After reading the first book I knew I had to read the next three. You really can't go wrong with any of these Harry Potter series. This book covers the life of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. It makes you love the characters more than before and the plot is simply beautiful and creative. I don't want to ruin it for you, but I guarantee if you liked the first, you will really love this one. Make sure you read the first book before you read this one.<br/>This book is a great escape from the stresses of life. I would recommend to everyone. Enjoy!
 gift
 Finally, we know it all...all the answers you have been waiting for since the very first book. This one grabs you from the first page, and doesn't let you put it down. Now you know what really happened with Dumbledore, and Snape, and all the other people you really wondered about. Ms. Rowling did herself proud with this one. Up until this point, I had loved the 4th book for it's fullness and revelations, but the 7th book ends things the way we always thought they ought to, with the exception of some people dying...but we already knew that was coming. Suffice it to say, I laughed, I cried, I LOVED THIS BOOK! It's all we wanted it to be!
 Love the Harry Potter books.  I never had the opportunity to read them when they were first published, but I am thoroughly enjoying each audio version I am reading.
 I recommend this product.
 So well plotted. So well characterized. So well paced. Everything that makes a classic. Will undoubtedly read it again and again.
 it was a gift
 Gave this as a gift and haven't heard any complaints.
 Not so good publishing.
 Summary: 3.5 to 4 stars<br/>Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts is chronicled in the book.  The adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermeine are documents for everyone's enjoyment.  The book is a quick-read, enjoyable and a good follow-up to the first Harry Potter book.  You can tell J. K. Rowling has created an interesting world that you want to know more about.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>The strength of the Harry Potter series is in the new fantasty world created by J. K. Rowling -- a twist on the normal and fey world...magically with humans and beasties vs. non-magical people.  The book does an ok job of describing the world; the scene designers and artists for the movies have done a tremendous job of filling in this world.  If you would not have the context of the movies, the books descriptions seem lacking to me.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>The character development is interesting and decently done through the mixture of the characters actions in a wide range of moral dilemnas and dangerous situations.  The use of consequences for the characters actions is lightly done but it is nice to see that being done still.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/>The plot is tight and well-thought out.  The story is linear but it makes sense for the target age range for the books.  Clearly, J. K. Rowling has developed a complex story line with this just being an element on the storyline -- the develop of background comes through.<br/><br/>Action:<br/>The action is quick and to the point -- a nice feature for a book where you want to find out more about the setting as well as have the characters advance along in school to get more developed, more interesting/multi-faceted and see how the dynamics of various characters evolve.<br/><br/>Prose:<br/>The prose style is clean, simple and effective.  The simplicity vs the effectiveness of the prose shows a good command of the English language and a distinctive enjoyable style.  It is not a great literary work by any stretch of the imagination but one does not expect that from this type of book.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>Setting: 3.5 to 4 stars -- I would give it 5 stars but only because of the world created and desribed in the movies but the book descriptions are thin and not well developed.<br/>Plot: 4 stars -- good for a child's book<br/>Characters: 3.5 stars<br/>Action: 3 stars<br/>Prose: 3 to 3.5 stars

 Scholastic did a great job designing the U.S. editions of the Harry Potter books. The illustrations are outstanding, far better than in the British edition. Unfortunately, the quality of the binding is terrible. I've had to tape the spines of three of my books, some after just a couple of readings.<br/><br/>If you would like to buy an heirloom set, try the Special Edition set still available at amazon.co.uk. (Sorry, but I can't insert a link.) It's significantly more expensive and you have to pay overseas shipping, but the books have genuine cloth bindings with place marker ribbons and come in a nice, cloth-covered case. By all appearances, they should last a few decades. I'm very pleased with my set and plan to buy at least one more set to pass on to my children. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
 Absolutely beautiful illustrations. Very well made.
 The chamber of secrets was was more intense and interesting than the first part of Harry Potter. The level of detail is engaging. Worth reading until the end.
 Great price and in perfect condition!
 Ms. Rowling was perfectly right when she wrote that the sixth volume is<br/>not a finished work. To understand it, one has to read the seventh<br/>volume too. After reading <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Book-6/dp/0439785960/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)</a> no-one understood<br/>Dumbledore's death, for example, and the most logical explanation<br/>seemed to be that he got absolutely senile by old age and did not<br/>know what he was doing. (...)<br/><br/>Another unexplained line was Professor Snape. A logically thinking<br/>reader of course felt sure that he worked for Dumbledore and some of<br/>the most gifted might also have guessed that he had a grievous grudge<br/>against the Dark Lord and a more serious one against James Potter than<br/>the one earlier stated. (...)<br/><br/>(...)  His father and friends were much better skilled than he<br/>can ever dream of (learning to transfigure themselves and the<br/>construction of the Marauder's Map are the best proof). His major<br/>virtue is apparently the one he needed as a seeker in Quidditch: he<br/>does not rest until he has the Snitch in his hand and trusts the<br/>others to fend off the Bludgers. He works for his team, which means that<br/>he has to catch the one that brings an end to the match. Perfect<br/>symbolism. Nicely done. Thank you Ms. Rowling.
 Perfect book for my 7 year old who just got in to the world of Harry Potter! The illustrations are beautifully done.
 I got this set for my husband who has never read Harry Potter and i wanted to convert him into a potterhead. He read all 6 box in a month so great success!
 I have read many reviews, the good and the bad, in this section.<br/><br/>Personally, I love specifically THIS set, for the cover design of each book. I have read the books, but do not own them myself, so this hardcover set if just perfect.<br/><br/>I really don't like the design of the "adult" cover version, or the "children's" cover versions sold today.<br/>Buying specifically this cover design set is only available in this specific set sold here. Others are either that other ugly, in my opinion, cover style, or freakishly expensive.<br/><br/>Of course, one should not judge the book by its cover, those are amazing books, but for the collection that I will keep forever I want to have the set I like. Also, as I grew up I read the books in this specific cover style, so I wanted them specifically.<br/><br/>I don't care about the box, and would not buy another set of hardcover books if I already owned them, just for the box, and then give a bad review saying that the box is bad. Its the books that cost the price.
 Beautiful set, love the packaging!
 Beautiful books. My son loved them.
 The books  were amazing and the case and the covers of the books are very high-quality
 Saving the best for last this book this book sends Harry and his contemporaries off with flare, excitement, and style. In the style of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien, where the best presentations of faith are indirect ones, good triumphs over evil once more. Many loose ends are tied up - some still reamain for the reader to descern for themselves. This book is a page turner for Harry fans though I can't see anyone not totally tuned into the series enjoying it simply for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed this series - which started off as childrens books but did not necessarily end as such.  These stories matured with Harry and once the charm of the fantasy community were thoroughly engrained in the readers knowledge base the stories became more complex.  Thank you Ms. Rowling for sharing your fantasy.
 I have seldom encountered any book that demands the sobriquet "you can't put it down."  This is one of them.  From the shocking chapter one through the climax 30 something chapters later, the story is instense and intensely moving.  Almost all of the questions raised in the various discussion groups were answered.  There are moments that will elicit tears - and not all of them are associated with death.  There are also surprises.  Yes, despite every kind of guess work, JKR manages to pull a few surprises out that are both moving and surprising.  From the battle at Hogwarts, through the moment Harry enters the forest to face He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to the end, few readers can stop reading (or crying).<br/><br/>Some will not like the epilogue.  I found it satisfying and, based on JKR's own comments on NBC last evening, it is clear that there were very good reasons for its inclusion.  NO SPOILERS HERE, SORRY.<br/><br/>(I can say that the one person who was reprieved from death received that reprieve in book 5.)
 I would like to have book 4 mailed to me, as it was the only book missing in the set.
 A gift for my niece!
 Glad I ow can own a set
 Can you write a bad review about HP?
 This was a gift for my granddaughter she absolutely loved<br/>She really enjoyed the picture depiction of the school
 I love the book even if it has someone's name on it.
 The narrator is good.
 Great read.
 Well I'm a little behind in joining the Harry Potter craze. I saw the movie Goblet of Fire this fall and had to get the books. I'm almost finished with the fifth and they are all execellent. I usually find myself too busy to read more than magazine articles but these books are so enjoyable to read I make the time. Whether it is just to myself, or out loud to my boys 6 and 8. We are all enjoying these books.
 I am in my 50's, and casually had seen the Harry Potter movies over the years.  Being a science fiction and fantasy fan, I grew more interested in Harry Potter and the wizarding world as each movie came out.  I decided it was time to actually go to the source and find out what the excitement was all about.<br/><br/>I, of course, started with the first book, "The Sorcerer's Stone", read through the subsequent books, and I'm now in the middle of "The Half-Blood Prince".  Even though I've seen most of the movies, it's like experiencing a whole new story.  In the case of Harry Potter, the books are definitely better than the movies.<br/><br/>The character interaction, histories, and development are rich and complex.  It's not just a story of magic and spells, there are innumerable facets of growing up, facing challenges, loving and losing that J. K. Rowling has written into her novels that make witchcraft and sorcery completely believable, even to old adults like me.<br/><br/>I see now why people have read a complete Harry Potter novel in just one sitting.  It is really hard to put down!  Read Harry Potter rather than watching Harry Potter.  It is so much more enjoyable.
 Nice product, the books are perfectly conform with the description.<br/><br/>Otherwise, great story! for children and adults (the last books aren't really for young children who can be frightened by some thing.. after the 3rd book, there's some rather dark stuff in the story, so if you don't know the story, read it before giving it to your children. Even starting form the 3rd book, young children can be afraid of several creatures appearing in the story. But a really good story! must read (the movies are plain and super rushed compared to the books)
 Excellent
 My husband LOVED THIS
 Great read.
 Daughter loves them
 I purchased this book as a gift and was disappointed that the book jacket was ripped in the corners.  Normally that wouldn't be a big deal but since it was a gift and quite a expensive book that is more of a collectors item I was hoping it would be in perfect condition.
 Good book
 This is a good story. Well paced, well defined, fun. Solid characters that change and grow as they mature. Read it.
 Of course worth it
 books came in, in great condition no bent corners or bends in the binding so i am very happy
 JK Rowling has once again proved how masterfully she has created the world of Harry Potter.  Those of us who believe in the magic of the everyday have a lot to enjoy in this final installment of the series.<br/><br/>Rowling has done a remarkable job of "growing" Harry, Hermione, Ron and the adult characters as well.  I'm re-reading the earlier volumes, partly in result of refreshing myself on some details I'd forgotten when introduced in Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>While some Good may be sacrificed to Evil, believe in what's right.  It's ironic to me that Harry has doubts not unlike Mother Teresa's doubts that have come to light in her letters - it is not our faith that makes us strong so much as faith carrying us through the times when it's most difficult to believe in anything.<br/><br/>Buy the series - buy this book.
 this was a gift and she loves it~
 Loved the set but pages a little thin and tear easily
 The book was intact. Finally replaced my lost one and can read the whole story from book 1 till the end
 I finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on Thursday after the book was released. The only reason it took so long was that I was re-reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. There were many things that I had forgotten. I was so disappointed when I read the last page. This was a real barn burner and I wanted more. One thing for sure, J.K. Rowling did not disappoint. The only thing she did was leave us wanting more Harry Potter. Kudos for such a wonderful work. I am a grandmother and I have enjoyed being able to discuss these books with my daughter and my grandchildren. Please give us more!
 Was a gift - she loved it.
 Christmas gift for kids
 Works Good
 Best set ever! It’s Harry Potter, what else do I need to say?
 When I saw the Harry Potter movie marathon during the holidays, I thought I'd try reading the books. At first, I was skeptical because when they first came out I didn't get what the hype was all about. But now after seeing the movies and reading the complete series, I understand it now.<br/><br/>This book is truly captivating, more intense and frightening than the first. I absolutely loved it! It was both entertaining and funny, much like the other six in the series. It is engaging to read, and I honestly think it appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the days when the border between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the books would keep the modern teenager entranced. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the story may get slightly boring, but don't worry, it gets better. This series blurs the ordinary design of which children's books are written. But most are not always written with the same stylish elegance J.K. Rowling seems to successfully integrate into the plot, and they each carry their own sense of magic, to the point in which the reader can't seem to put the book down! This book is a must read, it is one of my favorites! I would highly recommend the Harry Potter book series! <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-Special-Edition/dp/0747545774/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Special Edition)</a>
 This was a re-read for me, because I have the books.  But having it on the tablet was the big winner for me, cause then I could access it any time I wanted to.  Story I already knew was great!
 I have always wanted this series of books.  I had intended to purchase the special edition boxed set, but decided against it because of reviews saying the the bindings came apart even after the first careful use.  I was disappointed in the lower quality of paper used in the set that I purchased, but if you just desire to have the set for reading, they're fine.  They have the quality of cheap paper back books, but at least they don't fall apart when you're reading them.
 Bought this when it first came out (guaranteed to be delivered the day it was released - and it was).  When I received it, I closed the garage, shut the curtains and blinds, and read the book (it was released on a Saturday).  And I was ready to discuss it with some of my friends on Monday.<br/><br/>Now, please realize, that my friends and myself are in our 50s and retired from the military - so we aren't some kids who like reading.  No, we are even better - we are adults, who like reading and then discussing the book like a bunch of literate kids.<br/><br/>What a wonderful, great, series of books as it follows Harry as he grows and faces all those adventures.<br/><br/>I first started reading Harry Potter when I was a 4th grade teacher.  I left teaching shortly after the first book was released, but that did not diminish my admiration for a well written story and the new books were always bought the day of release.  As I said above, I now work with a group of people, my age, that appreciate how well these books were written.<br/><br/>Too bad the movies (as good as they are, and yes, I have all of them too) couldn't follow the books - but then, the movies would be days long.
 Book two was just as exciting (actually more so) than the first, in terms of the main plot! I felt that I comprehended more even with seven or so new character involvement. All in all, I rank this a 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>Gah, I ought not to spoil anything, so I will do my best to steer clear. Despite the exciting plot twist, I thought it took a bit long to arrive. While I appreciated JK Rowling reviving characters from book one, I felt that some scenes were drawn out/unnecessary between Harry/his crew and said characters. In particular, Harry conversing with Nearly Headless Nick.<br/><br/>As I've said, I liked the action of the central plot scene better, and I loved that everything connected to  finding out who was petrifying the students. It made it feel a bit like a mystery/suspense book as well.<br/>I must say that I was surprised by the point we learn who is the culprit! I didn't expect it, but in a way, I did. I loved meeting the Weasley family, and they truly are lovely folks! Lastly, I most admired Hermione's role in Chambers of Secrets. She stepped out of her comfort zone and *that* change was what impressed me…rather it was her growth in character.
 Ok, I was reading some of the other reviews and I was absolutly disgusted! J.K. Rowlings works are MASTERPIECES!!!! I would just like to warn all those who have read the nasty reviews. They are saying that stuff only 'cause they know that Mrs. Rowling is getting money off this and everyone loves it. It's truly amazing how everyone can make something horrible out of something that's a sucess. I wont tell you the amazing storyline because youve probaly already heard and I don't want to ruin it for you. I just find that to be that ignorant and then say "will you please vote for my review" is just plain stupid. Read the Harry Potter books NOW and if you already have.....errr... READ 'EM AGAIN!
 After all the hype, watching all the Harry Potter movies.....excluding Part II of the Deathly Hallows of course, I decided to read the books which was highly recommended.  So far I am only on the second book, The Chamber of Secrets, and really enjoying the read.  The movies can really never cover everything within the books so you get a better understanding of the stories and the relationships between the characters.  For me, I find it fun to read a book and then watch the movie right after to notice the changes and differences between the book and the way it is portrayed in the big screen.  If you are a fan of the Harry Potter movies you must read the books!  I also paid $43.47 (paperback) which comes out to $6.21 for each book, which is cheaper than purchasing individually.  It comes exactly how the pictures show.
 Love!
 Perfect and economical!
 I used to love this book and felt it was the best one out of the entire series
 Gorgeous quality of treasure chest and books. This is a family keepsake!
 I delayed reading this for 20 years since the original release but I am so glad I did. Harry Potter’s world is full of adventure, suspense, darkness, and love. Highly recommend.
 To a great writer. What an imagination! 💕
 I have already read this final book 3 times, marvelling each time that I discover new subtle details of the story. I am amazed at how well JK has woven together so many of the threads of the story from the 6 earlier books.  The series is so well integrated that she must have made a master plan 10 years ago in order for revelations in the final book to be so carefully hinted at in much earlier books. I believe that the Harry Potter saga will be unrivaled for at least a hundred years for inventiveness and craftmanship.  Many of JK's creations are already entering the English language. To those that scoff that the writing is inferior to the classics, I reply that either they are intellectual biggots or they have not read the books at their deepest level. I have read all the prior books at least 5 times each. Critics need to do the same before they are qualified to give an informed opinion.
 Awesome!
 While I wouldn't read Harry Potter in English I was delighted to get it in Latin. After reading the first book I was really hoping that more would be translated though I didn't really expect this to happen. After all Latin isn't supposed to be very popular! But the success of the first book proved me wrong. I was happy to get this book and it lived up to my expectations. It's an entertaining story written in highly readable Latin. If you liked the first book you'll love this one too.<br/><br/>It was lots of fun reading this book and having it in Latin was a special treat indeed. The translation is great and reading it I felt that the book was written in Latin. The translator, Peter Needham, has done a pukka job at rendering modern language into an ancient tongue, and words such as car (autocinetum) or elevator (anabathrum) seem to come natural. This just goes to show that far from being a dead language Latin has been in use continuously from Roman times right up to the present. New words have been added to Latin just like English gets new words for new things and even though the number of Latin speakers today is much lower than in the past it is still a living language that continues to be used. I wish the rest of the Harry Potter series could be translated as well. It's so much more fun than reading De Bello Gallico, for example, and would a lot more encouraging for students to learn Latin and indeed make learning Latin more fun.<br/><br/>Other great and exciting books are <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Insula-Thesauraria-Latin-Edition/dp/1449562671/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Insula  Thesauraria (Latin Edition)</a>,<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Pericla-Navarchi-Magonis-Latin-Edition/dp/1451564376/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pericla Navarchi Magonis (Latin Edition)</a>,<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Mysterium-Arcae-Boul-eacute-The-Boul-eacute-Cabinet-Mystery-Latin-Edition/dp/1451564228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mysterium Arcae Boulé: The Boulé Cabinet Mystery (Latin Edition)</a>,<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Rebilii-Crusonis-Annalium-Latin-Edition/dp/1449508251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rebilii Crusonis Annalium (Latin Edition)</a>, but especially <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fabulae-Divales-Fairy-Tales-in-Latin-Latin-Edition/dp/1450519717/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fabulae Divales: Fairy Tales in Latin (Latin Edition)</a> is great if you like magic and fairy tales.<br/><br/>See my list "Latin Reading List".
 Love anything "Harry Potter."
 The chamber of secrets has been opened, and destruction is taking place. With all the evil wondering around the school, the school might be closed. Leave it to Harry to figure out how to solve the mystery. I highly enjoyed this book but thought it started off slow. The first book was at a quicker pace.
 Birthday gift for my son.  he LOVED it !!!
 Very nice gift set for grandsons birthday
 bought as gift
 Brand new. Sealed. Exactly like it said in description
 A requested gift.
 the promo image appears to be an exclusive collection of Harry Potter books, which come in a special box and all. it turns out that the books were purchased separately and do not belong to the same edition / collection
 Easy load to my pad and quick access to each book
 I love the Harry Potter books and was happy when I got this set. They are a great price and very good quality. I would definitely recomend this to anyone.
 I finally gave into the Harry Potter mania.  At least the mania in this case is worthy.  These ARE good books.  The first three are relatively quick reads but still entertaining, even for an adult.  The fourth and fifth books are darker but they begin to bring in a bit more complexity and depth.  Let's hope that Ms. Rowling can keep up the quality in the remaining books in the series and not fall into cliched traps so many fantasy authors do.
 Needless to say the book is wonderful. What I'm trying to comment here is the shipping from Amazon. When I pre-ordered the book weeks ago amazon advertised it to be publishing day shipping, which should be 7/21. However, I waited until 7/24 that amazon sent me a email said the book was shipped. It took another five days for the book to arrive. Guessing with millions of pre-order amazon really couldn't keep its promise of publishing day shipping. So if you don't mind about more than one week delay you can buy from amazon. Otherwise if you want the book the second day after it's out try for book stores.
 Daughter loves this set.
 What a fun! I order that after reading the whole series in a different language. Yay
 I am very pleased with the purchase but I had to send it to my brother’s house in NJ and have him send to Puerto Rico. It’s a shame to go for so much trouble to get some things that are not easy to find in the island.
 Before you buy this set, know why you want it.  If your primary interest is in an affordable set of HP books in hard cover, this is your deal.<br/><br/>If you are are looking for that exciting collectible...... well, not so much.<br/><br/>The argument is not about the books themselves (there is no question that they are fabulous.)  It is about *this* set.<br/><br/>I was disappointed.  For the price, I didn't really expect more than cardboard, but I DID expect better cardboard and hardware that was not plastic.  Even a child's cardboard jewelry box has a clasp made of metal.<br/><br/>I received this set as a gift and I will keep it and love it for the thoughtfulness and generosity of my son. If I had bought it for myself, however, I would return it.
 This series means so much to our family.  I read it aloud to my kids starting in kindergarten and read every one aloud to them until this one, by which time they had long outgrown the read aloud on the bed habit.  At the same time, I sent each new edition to my grandmother, age 70s-90.  What a great multi-generational bridge. She and I talked about them, she talked to her great grandchildren about them ... these are a wonderful read.  After watching the movie, I read it (to myself) again for the third time just to recall the details.  These books just don't get old but the best thing about books is that its not just the story you remember but also all of these other things tied into the time, place and manner through which you experienced the book.
 A great set of books. I bought this for my kindle and I loved being able to read anywhere especially while nursing my baby or putting my kids down for bed. These books never disappoint.
 Great book, read the first before a trip to Universal studios so I would enjoy the rides more, now I need to read them all
 YES YES YES!! This book is beautiful!! The illustrations are brilliant. Perfect collectors item, and fun to read while seeing all the gorgeous illustrations. Highly recommend this version of the book.
 Six books, 6 dollars each. Can't beat that. And a nice cardboard box to store them in. Great deal Amazon! My daughter has turned me on to the series and I am now on book 4. The stories and writing are very engaging, exciting, scary, and humorous. Much has been written about the series. This is a great way to get the bulk of the books for an inexpensive price. The 7 book set is also available, but unless you are really finicky, buy this 6-book set, and order book seven separately. Will save you some money, at least as of this review date. Of course these are not the more durable hardback books. But if you or you child is reasonably careful, these should last through a few readers...
 Excelent, better than the movie
 I've lost, misplaced, dropped in bathtub, left at the beach, not kept all (ok fine, any) of the books in the series so I decided to purchase the box set and re-read from beginning to end.  Though I prefer reading my books on the Kindle, this series wasn't available and it's something worth having.  I'm almost 50 years old - and this is one of my favorite book series ever.  I didn't start reading Chamber of Secrets until the 5th book was published so by the time I was caught up Deathly Hallows was published.<br/><br/>This is a nice set of Trade paperbacks - bigger than a regular paperback and smaller and lighter than a Hardcover. They come in a fairly sturdy cardboard case - nothing fancy - very practical. If you are over the age of 14 and under the age of 94, you should read this series.  This is a very easy way to have all the books in one place
 Amazing book series, every one should read it.
 Beautiful book. Great addition if you are a book collector.
 excellent purchase
 Ends the series with a serious bang, a great read.
 Some pages didn’t print and are hard to read. :(
 We got these in time for Christmas. My 11 year old was happy to open them Christmas morning.
 Super
 Having the whole Harry Potter series in one collection is great!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who asked!
 I remember the first time I ever heard about Harry Potter. It was when I was a school librarian and I was having a book fair (supported by Scholastic) and  my students were buying it up like wild fire.  I decided to pick up the first book and read it, and after that, I quickly read the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  I was hooked, and it was then that I understood why my students would fight over getting a copy to check out of the library each week.  Like everyone else who loves Harry Potter, I had to wait each time for the next installment to come out and I was very excited each time a new title was released.  The series is a fabulous series by a very talented author.  This last installment will not disappoint the avid Harry Potter fan.  It is action packed with  a lot of adventure and suspense, and a few nail biting parts that will really make your heart race.  It is the PERFECT end to the series, and I think, provides a good deal of closure for those of us that will be suffering from "Harry withdraw".  Definitely worth the money, and the time it takes to read it.  A must have for anyone who has collected the other 6 in the series.
 Was advertised on Amazon as paperback set, but turned out to be ebooks. Not seller's fault.
 Came quick.  Looks like it's in good shape.  Works for my needs.
 Great audio quality with seamless transitions from track to track. Every single audio track is clean and plays flawlessly. The discs themselves are not the best quality. They have varying thickness causing 35 or so of the disks to vibrate in the drive causing one of my old cd drives to lock up. The art is pleasant and interesting but for some reason they used about 17 discs too many for the content on them but split into each book it makes more sense. Also there is no track data on any disc. No book title or disc number or chapter info. Simply audio files on a cd at the same quality that anyone could produce at home. I recommend these simply for the best available audio quality. Though for the price and success of these books I did expect a better more collectors level of presentation.
 Exactly what I wanted a little more expensive then I thought it’d be but after looking up each book individually I’d say well worth the price
 Great series
 Great special edition. My granddaughter is loving this set.
 Perfect
 I didn't think it would be possible to bring a close to the "Harry Potter..." series that would satisfy both those who foresaw Harry's death and those who prayed he would survive.  JK Rollings masterfully brought all of the frayed edges of her stories together and wove a remarkable tapestry of love and honesty.<br/><br/>I'm a Christian theologian who has studied world religions, including Buddist, Hindu, Druid and Celtic history.  I'm amazed that the easy way Rollings layered her stories with mythology and contempory theology.  She is just one step away from Calvinism, but landed in the center of John Wesley's insistence upon personal choice rather than fate.  While I will one day read all of the stories to my grandchildren, I think that the discussions I have with my own children (now married) are even more satisfying.  We all love Harry, Ron and Hermione (and Ginny and all the others) and speak of them as though they are members of our family.  We are particularly impressed at how Draco's journey teeter-tottered between brash adolescent and frightened child.<br/><br/>We will miss the intrigue of looking forward to another "Harry... book.  However, we find that the end, while bittersweet, was quite satisfying.  Thanks, JK.  You've expanded our minds and given us a real hero.
 As an adult, and a professional, AND a life-long "bookworm", I can only say it took me a while to read these "kids' books" but once I did I have become hooked.  I feel they will become true classics, and that they will stand the test of time.  Nothing in any of them glamorizes satanism, witchcraft, etc, which I know is a concern with some religious people.  The lead characters, especially Harry Potter, are moral, honest and basically "good kids".  Not perfect however, Ms Rowling has made them quite believable, and in each book, where they become a year olde, the growth process into teenagers is quite believable (to me as a mom and as a former teenager!)  I have read all the books, seen the movies, and for me, listening to them in the car, commuting to work, in the CD and tape versions recorded by Jim Dale, has been the most satisfying.  His reading of the books, and command of many different accents, and of "doing" the voices of young and old, male and female characters, is wonderful.  I would recommend the books in any format, but especially in the audio format, with Jim Dale as the reader.
 easy to read
 As with all of Rowling's books, you are able to sit back and let out your inner child.  Simultaneously, the adult in you is satisfied by the exploration of some adult themes.  Rowling is not afraid to kill off some of the Potterites' favorite characters to add depth and reality to a world that is anythung but. This reader, however, is still sad that at this end of the Potter era. Although the book's epilogue gives snippets into the characters' futures, you are left wanting and hopeful that she or others in her style, will one day write stories flushing out the teasers at the end of the "last" book.
 Nice set
 Books are better than movies. Great buy.
 Great Book
 Both kids love it
 Being an aspiring writer, I can appreciate the potential of a good imagination and an excellent ability to put thoughts into words. J.K. Rowling not only created an entire world in her own mind, she was able to project that world in an interesting, entertaining way to her millions of readers. Harry Potter is the quintessential hero who will appeal to adults as well as young children as he battles his way through a magical world of evil villains and befriends a host of unique and colorful characters. Give these books to the most unenthusiastic readers and you are guaranteed to create faithful Potter fans.
 I’ve read and re read this series so many times. It is so wonderful and so well written. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is the first book I enjoyed as a child and and I love the entire series to this day.
 Box set came extremely quick and I’m great shape. My son can’t stop reading them
 My daughter loved the series and all books were on excellent condition
 My daughter loves the art work on the box and cant wait to get started on reading the books.
 As always I love listening to Jim Dale read one of my favorite series of books.  He is a master at creating whole characters by a simple change in accent or inflection of voice.<br/><br/>What I did notice and it through me for a major loop was that Harry and Hermiones voices both changed in this book.  In track 128 Chapter 16D both of there voices suddenly sound like miny Hagrids.  Then just as strangely they both change back to normal in track 136, Chapter 17E.<br/><br/>Let me know if anyone else caught this and if you've heard why it happened.<br/><br/>Long live Harry Potter!
 Can't put this book down. Such good writing that it takes you right into story as if you are one of the characters. All the Harry Potter are extremely well written.
 so cool
 I'm glad that I bought this set, but the chest is flimsy (cardboard).  Also, if you are a collector of first editions, then it should help you to know that most if not all of the books are not first edition first printings.  Fortunately, I purchased first editions of the books when they were published, so I'm using the ones that came in the chest as reading copies and have replaced them with my true first editions.  Overall, the set is a nice conversation piece and good storage for my first editions. Just wish the chest was of better quality. I realize it would have cost more, but I would have been willing to bear the cost of a nice wooden chest.
 Great job
 Nothing to complain about everything I expected
 Everything else was chill except I got two Philosopher’s Stone books and not a Chamber of Secrets.
 Very nice.
 This book definitely lives up to the hype and build-up that preceded its release!!  It was truly worth the anticipation!!<br/>Harry Potter faces the most challenging and dangerous mission yet.  His best friends want to be up to the challenge to accompany and assist him but the stakes are high and their very lives are on the line.  This is the ultimate clash of good and evil, where not only the future of wizardry is in the balance but even the future of a good and decent life may be crushed.<br/>Harry must decipher the clues to the horcruxes and then must determine what it is that he is truly searching for....and why.<br/>"Deathly Hallows" is the most shocking in the Potter series and without giving too much away and spoiling the story, there were stunning battles where individuals that you have come to know and love will be destroyed.  The heartbreaking pages will fly through your hands as you devour this tale to find out the dramatic ending to the final Potter tale!!!<br/>J.K. Rowling, we love you!!!!!
 GREAT
 the books are great. but the decorative box is cardboard. very disappointed in that. save yourself the money and buy the books separate
 No complaints at all—good price and nice covers.
 Finally read it. Couldn’t put it down even though I’m late to the party. The plot is not predictable and the characters are colorful.
 in great shape
 So great! Couldn’t put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Can’t wait to read the next in the series.
 Beautiful illustrated edition. A real collectors item.
 Got theses for my daughter and she loves them
 Fantastic book!
 Wow! I LOVE the Harry Potter books, and I love the audiobooks even more. Jim Dale does a FANTASTIC job of narrating. He does great voices and adds lots of excitement to the story. And amazingly the voices he uses are very similar to the voices used in the movies. I was afraid that after reading the books and seeing the movies that listning to Harry Potter on tape would just be too much and I would start to get sick of it, but I was so wrong. I plan to listen to these books on tape over and over again. I reccomend this for children and adults.
 Great gift!
 Beautiful book.
 Should have read the books before seeing the movies it would have made a huge difference in comprehension of the events.
 Never having read this series, I was interested in finally getting some of these books. I found this box set the easiest way to get all the currently availible HP books at once. I am happy with this purchase and I consider it a very good value for the money, at $27 for five books, how can you go wrong? Now all I have to do is get some time to read them.<br/><br/>  King fan in Maine.
 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone<br/><br/>I had to research a few Briticisms throughout this book, but they didn't seriously interrupt the story flow. What did interrupt were the numerous comma splices. They forced me to re-read many sentences. Having said that, I enjoyed the plot and character development. I never felt bored.<br/><br/>If Amazon had half stars, I'd give Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 4 1/2. Since that isn't possible, I'll award it a 4.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br/><br/>Mystery, humor—and a smidgeon of possible romance?<br/><br/>The plusses: Rowling steers Harry Potter through a mystery with a surprise outcome, sprinkling the tale with tidbits of humor. When I reached the end, I wanted to keep reading and find out how Harry spent his summer with his horrible relatives.<br/><br/>Minuses: Numerous comma splices drew me out of the story, forcing me to re-read sentences.<br/><br/>A solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. I’d award an extra .5 stars if it weren’t for the comma splices.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br/><br/>Twists, turns, and surprises.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this most of the first three books in the Harry Potter series. Rowling steers readers through suspenseful mini mysteries throughout the novel. Astute readers might be able to spot clues that will help them see what happens next. Hint: Pay attention to every detail. The old characters make appearances, as well as a few new ones, including an unexpected friend for Harry.<br/>As usual, I enjoyed the ending and can’t wait to read the next in the series.<br/><br/>Rowling’s comma splices occur far less frequently in this book, which increased my reading enjoyment immensely. I can’t resist—five stars.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br/><br/>The best yet, with intrigue, laughs, and tears.<br/><br/>This book reads like a spy novel. I couldn’t decipher the good guys and the bad guys, and just when I decided someone was one or the other, I discovered I was wrong. Rowling finally reveals how to pronounce “Hermione” (Her-my-oh-nee) due to a clever conversation where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name properly.<br/><br/>Near the end, one of the characters explains how and why many past events occurred. I found it a tad like an infodump. Run-on sentences occur far less in Goblet than in Prisoner, and mostly in dialogue, which assists comprehension.<br/><br/>Now, I wonder how Harry’s summer with the Dursleys will go. His summers always intrigue and amuse me.<br/><br/>Note to parents: One of the chapters (thirty-two, I believe) contains violent scenes that wouldn’t be suitable for young children.<br/><br/>Another five-star read.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br/><br/>With every novel in the Harry Potter series, I find myself becoming more engaged and wanting to read “just one more chapter” before closing my Kindle.<br/><br/>In Phoenix, Harry’s character develops as he grows into a typical angst-ridden teenager—with more reason for angst than most of his peers. Rowling increases the romance factor and introduces a character so vile that I disliked her from her first appearance in the novel. A couple of secrets are revealed, including the reason why Harry must spend summers with the Dursleys, and an intriguing clue surfaces that, I suspect, will play an important part in Half-Blood Prince.<br/><br/>Rowling provides enough backstory so that first-time Potter readers will understand the story, and the run-on sentences become fewer with each novel.<br/><br/>Five stars.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<br/><br/>My optimism about a clue that was revealed in Order of the Phoenix didn’t prove correct. *sigh*<br/><br/>In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore’s Pensieve acts as a marvelous link to backstory that doesn’t seem like backstory. More information about Voldemort appears via Harry’s regular meetings with Dumbledore. We are kept guessing throughout most of the novel, and perhaps will be wrong, about Snape’s true intentions.<br/><br/>Although Rowling doesn’t kill people off with the alacrity of George R. R. Martin, she does dispense with another beloved character. The funeral chapter is well-written, evincing tears and a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>I wonder whether Harry will carry through with his plans. Is he really who he, and everyone else, thinks he is, or …?<br/><br/>Now I can’t wait to tackle Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Five stars.<br/><br/>- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<br/><br/>I withdraw my comment about Rowling’s propensity for killing off characters. However, their demises were necessary in Deathly Hallows; otherwise, the story wouldn’t ring true. Rowling’s masterful manipulation of emotions had me smiling, nay, laughing, in some areas—and tearing up in others.<br/><br/>Without providing any spoilers, I wondered throughout why the photo of a key headmaster didn’t give Harry any advice. Plot hole? In previous novels as well as this one, misleading clues were dropped. Some were essential; others frustrated me because they didn’t amount to anything.<br/><br/>Note to first-time readers: Pay careful attention to clues. You might be able to predict a few twists if you do.<br/><br/>Five stars.<br/><br/>- General Comments<br/><br/>Ms. Rowling’s style did change somewhat as the novels progressed. Annoying run-on sentences appeared less with each novel.<br/><br/>Now I’m suffering Potter withdrawal. Will we ever see stories about the children of key wizards and witches? No, not screenplays written by others, but novels written by the author herself. I would read them!<br/><br/>Five stars for this reading experience, Ms. Rowling, and good luck with future writing endeavors.
 I read the first batch of reviews (posted on amazon) before the book came in the mail, and wonder now that I've read it, if we read the same book.  There was the "you're all going to Hell for reading this book" which made me shake my head and wonder what team the writer is playing for, and then some negative stuff:  "there's nudity in the book" (what?), "Herminone is reduced to a crying girl who does Ron's laundry (Hermione is the same decent compassionate level-headed character who saves the impulsive boys again and again), "Harry doesn't even do anything; its just luck." (Umm, have you read the other books at all?  That would be the pattern for our everyman hero.), "Ginny's just a tramp in this book." (Maybe with a lot of extrapolation in one scene, not key.)  I enjoyed this book.  For the last third, I couldn't put it down.  I started reading these books when my then 14 year old got the 3rd and read it in a day and a half.  Impressed, I asked to borrow it, and she insisted I start with the beginning.  The whole family have since become Harry fans.  Lot's of fun.
 Was glad to find theses we had rest of books but lost 1 to 4 ,my 7yr grandson has fallen in love with this book would recommend this to  anyone who has a great  love of reading and  wonder of advantages.
 my wife loved them
 Received these books and loved them.
 Daughter loves this book.
 Great condition.
 Who doesn't enjoy reading this over and over.
 Great read.
 I've been a Fantasy Fiction addict since I was old enough to hold a book open with both hands.  With formative years spent on pulpy Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E Howard, HP Lovecraft, et al; I became a "literate" Fantasy Fiction addict as soon as I could digest The Lord Of The Rings and re-read it year after year after year from about age 10 to this year (age 60+), and in the meantime there was study of Shakespeare, Beowulf, and all those Gothic and Classical writers of the 19th Century, as a well a continued addiction for the Sci-Fi Fantasy adventures strewn about the 50's, 60's, 70's, and not so much 80's.  Robert Jordan threatened to keep writing his Wheel Of Time saga until they nailed his coffin shut and he was true to his word.  Roundabout the 8th volume in the series I decided I would assist in the hammering of those nails.  Then along came 21st Century "Young Adult" novelist JK Rowling and her epic Harry Potter series.  Courtesy of my adult daughter who liked to read this stuff too, I entered (tenderly and with trepidation at first) the wading pool with the Trade softback issues of each volume of the first three books.  Can't say it didn't grab me immediately.  My first thoughts on this addiction were that I finally found an inheritor to Mary Stewart's Arthurian novels (The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, etc.) or Marion Zimmer Bradley's female perspective take on same (Mists Of Avalon).  Arthur and Merlin are infectious heroes who have a habit of consciously and subconsciously injecting themselves into modern literature, and if you have half a mind, you cannot help but immediately make the connection with Harry and Dumbledore!  It helps that Rowling has an easy writing style that some critics are horsewhipping yet others who are not quite so strict on are calling "literate".  No matter what side of the fence you are on, she has brought young people to books, big ones, with a prose that does not insult adults and is assimilated by children of all ages.  There you have it, Rowling is the new Epic Romance, the Modern Gothic, the 21st Century Elder Edda.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS was so eagerly awaited that I succumbed to purchasing it in hard cover without waiting for the soft version which usually followed 4-5 months later at import prices.  Rowling imbued this final book with some heavy Bronte pathos, you cannot help it, this is the finale of good versus evil and her vast assortment of characters who have not yet been killed off have to come together in a last stand of apocalyptic proportions!  How she kept all of these growing casts sorted over the years is beyond me, but JK gets huge kudos from me for building a network of heroes and near heroes and villains that really had depth and empathy with the readers through 7 ever more huge volumes.  Apocalypse you want, Apocalypse you get!  Harry and Hermione become nearly twins in this last cycle of forging the sword while Ron acts as an almost Gollumesque character who needs to be brought back to earth, all in good time.  The book is so much more in depth of darkness than the movie (can you imagine that?) if you have not read this, you simply MUST.  How to bring two lead characters so close together without creating a romance (and yet nearly doing so but not) and keeping the reader on the edge of the seat (no matter how old the reader) in such a disturbingly engrossing manner is sheer brilliance.  While Rowling has essentially built Harry Potter into a brand name (we must remember we did that, not her), we have to bear in mind that she and Harry are the descendants of Roald Dahl and Tolkien, TH White and CS Lewis, Ursula K LeGuin and Richard Adams, all names whom our children and theirs should become acquainted with now that Potter has grown up.  King Arthur and Merlin are prerequisites to Gothic and Modern Fantasy, they inhabit our universe now and forever.<br/><br/>Finish Harry Potter and go exploring some more...
 So glad to finally get the set at a reasonable price
 whatever it takes!
 my wife love them
 Awesome product!
 This is one of my second favorite book in the series, never disappoints. It’s like going on a endless journey and the only sad thing is when it ends or you have to book down the kindle or the book.
 I have never been bitten by the whole Harry Potter "bug", but my 11 year old son, in anticipation of the latest (last?) book, sat and re-read all the other ones that came before.  He said it made the waiting easier.  I can't begin to understand that, but oh well.<br/>I ended up ordering two copies because my 24 year-old daughter who was going to be in a wedding the weekend the book was released wanted her own copy to read between the rehearsal and the wedding. She then planned to skip out of the reception early so no one would be able to ruin the ending for her!!!!  Now that's dedication!  It was gratifying to see my son (11), my daughter (24) and one of my other daughters (17) who bought her own copy, sit there and discuss in very minute detail, the substance of all the books. But their collective enthusiasm is still not enough to get me to start reading the Potter series.  It's just not my genre of choice.
 Everything was excellant
 I like reading books and writing reviews about them on Amazon but I decided instead of doing it for each Harry Potter book, I would just write one review for the box set. I purchased this set and I have book 7 on pre-order. Im not going to sit here and tell you the whole Harry Potter story. First of all many other reviewers did and second im sure most of you already know the concept of these books, even if you have never read them. Like one reviewer said, "You haven't lived un till you have read some Harry Potter." I totally agree and I also think it is a great collection to own so that your children, grandchildren and so on can read them. Please read these books, you will not be sorry you did.
 I’m probably the last person on earth who has not read them. With the bargain price of the whole set I thought I would give it a try and I’m very glad I did.
 Ordered it during the holidays and still arrived on time! Awesome buy!
 Forget the bible, the declaration of independence, the iliad and the odyssey, huckleberry finn, anything shakespear wrote, 1984, or calvin and hobbs. Best collection of words ever! Only thing even close is the Dark Tower series.
 The cardboard it came in was surprisingly sturdy. Great buy
 Good collection
 This is truly a masterpiece created by one of the world's best writers. I would recommend this book to anyone.
 Beautiful! Love this series and am so happy to have all the books together in one place!
 HP and the Deathly Hallows is one of the greatest finishes to a book series I have ever read.  Now that I have finished the series, I have forgotten the details of many of the novels, but I can still remember the details of the Deathly Hallows.  Ron leaving Hermoine and Harry.  Harry getting captured in his pride.  The escape and the confrontation with Voldemort at Hogwarts.  Wow! I have read several series, but this finish is different.  Usually, the building material is great, but the last novel is a letdown.  This book was exciting and satisfying.  JK Rowling does not disappoint at all.  This series is great and I recommend it to everyone.
 The books were a present for my granddaughter and it was a real hit. It was packaged very nice with its own case and they were great !  Lots of little extras including special stickers. We were real pleased with the purchase and shipping. We will definitely use you again !
 Arguably the weakest in the series, Chamber of Secrets still manages to be a strong children's book that does a solid job of expanding the world of Harry Potter. I  personally enjoyed the humor of this book more than the first.
 Love that it's all together in one book
 Wonderful book
 All of Julie Garwood books are a 5 star rating. I am waiting it seams  like for ever for her next book
 Love it
 After reading book 1 I was excited to dig into book 2 and I absolutely loved it. It was super magical and tons of fun. I literally had such a fun time reading this book, learning more about the world and the characters, getting to sneak around Hogwarts with Harry and friends solving mysteries and dodging teachers. I found that while I enjoyed book 1, I really enjoyed book two and if each book increases in how good they are, I don’t even know what I’m going to do because I already find myself getting super obsessed. All I could think about when I got off of work today was starting book 3.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about this book in particular was the pacing, to me it feels just right. Not too slow, not too fast. The plot and characters develop at a rate that is really enjoyable and keeps me interested in the journey. The writing is simple, easy to understand but is beautiful in its simplicity and there are quotable passages sprinkled throughout the books that give immense feels. I am sure that this increases with every book as well. I haven’t been spoiled by the movies so I’m excited to see where the overall story goes and what all happens to our characters. So far, it has been an adventure! I feel like this series is what I needed to get out of a book rut that I was finding myself in so it was a good thing I started my year off with this book. I am living proof that an adult can enjoy these just as much as kid. It is so magical, so much fun and I loved this book. I am starting the 3rd tonight and I can’t wait! From here, I will be reading for the first time.<br/><br/>I am sure everyone has read this already but if are like me and you started the series and never continued or just haven’t given it a chance, definitely try it out! I gave the second book 5 stars because I just loved it. I’m also reading it with my niece and my nephew (who are young readers, reading it for the first time and just starting to discover the joys of reading ahhhh!) so that makes it extra special to me I think!
 Beautiful set, very pleased. Arrived fast and in beautiful box. Love it!
 JK Rowling is a genius. I loved this book the first time around after the magical entry of her first book. The genius is in the foreshadowing. So many things we won’t understand until the final book introduced here.
 They came exactly as expected
 thanks
 The illustrations are fantastic. I didn't think this story could come to life anymore than it already does but this unabridged version does the trick.
 it is Harry
 Reader thoughts:<br/>I just love Fawkes, even if adding him feels a bit too easy. :) I also like quidditch, although I think too much power is in the seeker's hands. No single team member should be that invaluable.<br/><br/>It's so hard to rate the Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>On the one hand, I really like JKR's writing style and think she put together a fantastic series of books. Everything matters, and her wizarding world is so complex and imaginative. The characters come to life, and there's history and gadgets and rumors.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the characters lie, cheat, and disobey a LOT. And they win battles and triumph because of it, and there aren't many consequences. Also, many of the adults are made to look like idiots, which is not the way we should encourage children to see the world. Even the likable adults often seemed that way (Hagrid and Sirius, for instance). It makes it easy for the characters to consistently disrespect their elders (although I don't mind a bit when it's Umbridge). I just think we ought to be able to look up to book heroes.<br/><br/>Still, nobody is perfect, and there are far too many characters out there who display no complexities at all, or constantly think about the opposite sex, and that's not admirable either.<br/><br/>Writer thoughts:<br/>Harry gets to switch roles in this book. Instead of everyone looking at him like he's amazing, they look at him like he's the villain. They blame him for the petrified students and for the chamber of secrets opening!<br/><br/>It's a neat idea for an author to change things up this way. First, we learn more about Harry's character when everybody hates him. Second, it stirs up the story, makes it interesting. Third, it adds a bunch of tension. Not only do the readers not know the real culprit, we see that no one at Hogwarts is even trying to find the bad guy because they all think Harry did it!
 Deathly Hallows is an excellent end to the wonderful Harry Potter Series.  I shall not however waste my time recommending this book to others to read because frankly by the time you've read book 6 you've long been hooked.  Rowling's world is truly an amazing and well thought out place.<br/>There is only one weak point to this book is that I personally found the hiding in the forest part a little tiresome.  However, the ending is amazing and I truly loved how Rowling pulled off such a satisfactory conclusion.  This is my second favorite Book series I've read and my only regret when I finished the epilogue is this was the last book, but all good things must come to an end.<br/><br/>Enjoy this book, it is quite the journey!!
 This was a really nice set for the price! My local used bookstore was charging the same amount for a used set. My niece loved it!
 My son loves it!
 It Harry Potter, obviously it's good.
 You know what? This was a really great story - not just this book, but the entire series/story as a whole.  I just finished it, and I can't imagine a better way to end it.  Before you read this, think about truthfully how you would most like to have it end - read it - is it really much different?  Before beginning the book, I read all of the negative reviews (not the + ones) - and never once did the negative reviewer's words echo in my head as I read this novel.  It was really wonderful and more than anything I feel sad that there isn't the next Harry Potter book to wait for.  Great ending!  Thank you!
 A wonderful finish to a great series.
 OK.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
 I had not read one single book of Harry Potter, though I have watched the five movies so far. I bought this set, and had to read one book after another, all the way to the seventh, which I bought separately.<br/><br/>The paperbacks were in perfect condition, and besides saving a lot from the individual price, I had them available right away.<br/><br/>As is usually the case, the movies really pale in comparison to the book. After the fifth movie, which I found too dark, I was doubting I would read the book, but it is so much better!<br/><br/>A great buy, in summary.
 Yep, love.
 Love this series
 Great book quality
 And I've read the series several times. Each time I noticed something new I had not noticed the last time I read the books. Rowling knew what she was doing when she wrote this. Forever a Potterhead, and forever a Hufflepuff.
 The best book collection ❤️
 The best books
 If you liked Order of the Phoenix than you will probably enjoy the entire book HP#7.  If you don't like a LOT of self doubt and introspection you will not enjoy the first half of this story.  It reminded me of Frodo in the swamp.  But stick with it.  From the point were the kids are captured it starts to become a good story with all the adventure, action and characture development you could wish for.  I'm glad that Ms. Rowling included the last chapter to "tell us what happened to everyone later in life."  It was a great way to finish the story and the series.<br/><br/>Ms. Rowling really explores what makes a person a certain way.  Are any of us really all good or all "bad"?  Heroes can be full of self doubt and take some missteps along the way.  But being able to accept who they really are and take the action they know in their heart is correct, is what will make this a great book and ultimately make a hero a hero.
 Seriously. Read this  with your kids, read it on your own, just read it. The story is great and this sees the series out way better than the movies do.
 Easy reading and entertaining, if you like this kind of fiction.
 My daughter loved having a paperback copy to read and said how much easier it was!
 I purchased this copy to donate to our school library.  I had a student who wanted to read it,  but we didn't have a copy.  She was thrilled to have the chance to read the last installment.
 Son loves this series... 6th grade
 The Chamber of Secrets is wonderful.  As an adult, it turns on the world of fantasy and imagination that have been put aside in many of our lives.  As a special delight in this book is the wonderful creature named Dobby.  You learn to love Dobby as time goes on.  Also, I loved the flying car and the impact with the tree.  So cute and imaginative.  Mr. Dale, the reader, cannot be complimented enough in how he brings each character alive in this series.
 I have read all the Harry Potter books, but this was the first audio book<br/>I have ever purchased. After hearing Jim Dale's interpertation of Rowlings<br/>work I ordered the complete Harry Potter series on CD.<br/><br/>You will find yourself totally involved in the story telling to the point<br/>you don't want to do anything but just listen. Each character comes alive<br/>with indivdual voices that make you feel you are part of the adventure. I<br/>Also found I picked up things from the audio book that I missed while reading<br/>the book. Very well done!
 i recently received this box set from my best friend when she was so shocked that i hadn't read any of the books. while the diehard fan probably pre-orders the new book to ensure arrival on its release date, the box set is perfect for those who are later to the harry potter craze. they're all paperback, which makes them less bulky, and because they come in a box, you can store them all together. and as someone who thought the harry potter series was childish when it first came out, now that i've read them all (minus the 7th book), it's definitely something that can be enjoyed by all ages
 I highly recommend reading the 7 books, they are amazing. The whole series is highly addictive, I couldn't stop reading
 I ordered this set in July 2005 and it was just that - a set of 5 paperback books in a harder case with an open front.  Exactly what I thought it would be.  I didn't know whether I would like HP or not, and didn't want to invest a lot in the books.  But I love them!! HP is extremely interesting and is a real page turner!! Highly recommended set if you don't want to spend a lot of money.
 Gift for my girl, she squared. Also there's stickers
 Beautiful books.  Bigger than I thought.
 Can't go wrong here
 My sons and are big fans: books, movies, and audio books.  JK Rowling: I am so amazed how on person can have such an imagination and be such an observer of characters as to be able to portray the silly and wise, the loving and hateful, young and old.  Jim Dale (narrator) is so entertaining, offering an endless variety of voice and personality to the characters in the story.<br/><br/>Great entertainment!  After a 14 hour round trip in vacation we still hadn't had enough.<br/><br/>Harry Potter will have been a great family memory when my kids are grown.  We had spent hours snuggled together reading (it was mandatory to finish the books before movie or audio tapes), shared the anticipation of the new movies and books, and now it is closely related to traveling on family trips.  I am thankful to the author for this common bond we will always share and fond memories we have.
 I probably would never have picked up a copy of the books if it weren't for the fact that I had heard so much controversy about them. I decided to read the first one and got instantly pulled into a world full of magic, monsters, adventures. Easily the best book I've ever read; my highest compliments to Ms. Rowling. This is the FIRST book that has ever gotten me offline just so I could read. Yourself, your kids, your friends won't be disappointed when they read this book; which, as good as the movie was, is better than the movie. Because of these books, I'm now a HUGE Harry Potter fan!!!
 Great condition
 After reading book 6, I was dissappointed and felt like JK Rowling was succumbing to the media, and the easy sell of violence and surprise. After reading book 7 I no longer feel that way, I feel like every loose end was tied up and all the charachters were left in a good place at the end of the book. This was by far the best book, but you really have to read them all and have a good memory to enjoy all the little details of this book. I love this series and JK Rowling has done a wonderful service to the world by encouraging children to read. Thank you Ms. Rowling.
 All of these books are so inventive and well written.  I read them to my nephews, ages 3, 5, 7 and they keep all of their attentions.  My mother who I shall say is a baby boomer, also enjoys these books immensely. There really seems to be no age limit. Rowling comes up with new ideas in everybook and the reader gets to learn along with Harry about dragons, potions, spells, and of course Quiddich.  This set was well worth the money I spent on it and it will never be sold at a yard sale.  If you want to read a book that is appropriate for young children but has enough wit and humor for an adult, than look no further.  Pick up the set or at least one of the books and start exploring the world of magic.  Along with Harry, Ron and Hermoine, of course.
 Perfect condition, great book set!
 I love all of her books
 Reviews are misleading. I thought the books included illustrations based upon reading reviews. Definitely a let down for the price of the set as that was what I was most excited about.
 I love my Harry Potter set! The book bindings are great quality and the box for them all to sit in is very convenient and cute.
 Love it
 Mind you, I have never read a single HP book, but since most of my friends give rave reviews and comment, together seeing a good boxset is sold on amazon.com, I was thinking, "let me give it a try."<br/><br/>Well, I give it a 5-star rating for getting all 7 books. Each book costs only about $17. It is indeed a good deal.<br/><br/>But... the cardboard... I'm sorry, but I believe the publisher has already made enough money off from the HP's readers, can't they sell something decent instead of putting everything in a cardboard box? such a shortfall of high expectation. Unless publisher stated ahead of time about the cheap material of the trunk, then I guess there shouldnt be any complains from us.<br/><br/>So, it's a 5-star for the price for the books, but a nil-star rating for the deceptive marketing trick. All in all, what you pay is really what you get :)
 My wife read it and she enjoyed it very much she read the who thing in just over 2 weeks.
 Its harry potter .... Who doesnt love these book!
 I finally got around to reading Harry Potter and it was great. The books were wonderful. The only small problem was that I couldn't fit them all back in the box after reading, but who cares!
 nice
 good books
 Unfortunately I received a misprinted copy and am missing approx. pages.
 Harry Potter's close, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, stands on it's own as a thrilling story about friendship, loyalty, and facing adversity - even death - with courage.  As a close to the wonderful series, JK Rowling leaves avid Potter fans satisfied as she ties up most loose ends, but still leaves the most hard core witches and wizards wanting more.<br/><br/>Harry's last adventure is basically about three friends - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - that set out to destroy the face of evil, while growing into themselves as adults.  No big deal.  Through their journey to find and eliminate Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, they encounter a wizarding world that has put a bounty on Harry's head and Death Eaters at every turn all while facing dormant demons of their own.  They also must learn to come to grips that their own personal heroes are flawed as well.  That the trio's passage into adulthood happens to coincide with saving the wizarding world is no coincidence.  Rowling magestically weaves the trials and tribulations of becoming an adult into a quest to confront our own worst fears and conquer them.<br/><br/>Having read all the Potter books multiple times, I can't say whether or not Deathly Hallows is the best of the seven books -- but I can say, with certainty, that this tome features some of Rowling's best work as an author.  Two chapters stand out - The Prince's Tale and The Forest Again -as possibly the best bit of writing in the whole series.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if anybody unfamiliar with Harry's adventures should start with the end.  Being that this is the curtain call for the series, there are far too many inside references to the magical world that a new reader just wouldn't understand, even if they happen to be a fan of the films.  Although, on it's own, Deathly Hallows is a beautiful book, but it would be like reading Tolkien's Return of the King without reading either of the first two Lord of the Rings books.<br/><br/>I loved the book as I've loved the series and think that anybody that has a passing interest in reading would find Rowling's books both entertaining and perhaps reintroduce what it was like being a teen, without the acne.
 One thing you will hardly ever hear me say is that I should have listened to my brother before. He told me many years ago to read these books and I didn’t listen. I am rather disappointed by that fact. So far, I have been impressed with the books. I do like the first two. Probably more than I should. Let’s go to the review.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Believe or not, the part that hurt this book the most was the Dursley’s hardly being in it. They work out great as Muggle villains for Harry. Not having them in the book for too long only made it so Harry didn’t have anything to do outside of Hogwarts. As of this point I don’t think they are going to be in the rest of the books all too much.<br/><br/>The Bad: Keeping with the characters here, I kind of wish Haggrid was I the book a bit more. He is the best mentor Harry could have. Haggrid does have quite a bit of knowledge it seems that he could pass on to Harry. If I’m wrong about that, just remember that I haven’t read the others as of yet. It’s just my opinion after two books.<br/><br/>The Good: I’m going to detract from the characters a bit from this part, even though I could easily put Lucius Malfoy here. To me the best part of the book was the mystery behind the Chamber. How is it that something like the Chamber could be at Hogwarts for so long is the best mystery of all. Keeping it going to the bitter end worked out well. Seriously, one of the best mystery’s to ever grace the literary world.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Don’t be like me. Stop wasting time and start reading this series, let alone this story. You’ll thank yourself for doing so.
 works GREAT, perfect condition
 I've never read any of the Harry Potter books until now that I've read Deathly Hallows first and then The Half Blood Prince...  But I did have an interest in Harry Potter because I own DVD movies one through four and I'm going to buy Order of the Phoenix once the DVD is out..  I didn't have an interest in reading books one through five because I've already seen the movies so I said to myself Deathly Hallows is the last book it must be really good so I took a chance and bought it... I don't regret one bit buying Deathly Hallows and reading it without reading Half Blood Prince sure I was a bit lost but it didn't take away from me enjoying reading Deathly Hallows.. When I read Deathly Hallows it was like reading a movie, imagining the actors Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliff, and the red head guy doing what Harry, Hermione, and Ron would be doing in the book!! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a very good book to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 great quality books except the trunk is a little flimsy and not sturdy. Otherwise great
 
 Great. I got all 7 soft cover books in a box to store them in. It was exactly what i wanted.
 &lt;3 HP love!
 Just wanted to say that I held out reading the Harry Potter books as long as I could.<br/>  I was less than thrilled with Sorceres Stone and Chamber of Secrets- only because I am an older reader - and the first two books are geared more for children.<br/> But then I got to thinking: Theres a reason why these books are loved the world over- so I kept reading.<br/>  And Im here to tell you- am I glad I did!!  By the end of the Prisoner of Azkaban I was totally besotted with these characters.<br/>  So if you havent read the series yet- do yourself a favor anf pick this up. This is my second set of HP- the first set I gave to a long time fan- thinking I would never read them again.  Well this is the third time Ive read the whole series and I have to say i dont think its going to be my last.
 I loved the movies but the books are AMAZING. I have a 16 month old so being able to read on a tablet or my phone is wonderful. I have marathon read this entire series and I have the last book left to read. You do save some money when getting the the complete collection BUT there are some minor annoyances.<br/><br/>1. It is a continuous read. They are broken up ,of course, by each book but in the table of contents you have to scroll through it all to see where you are and how many chapters you have left.<br/>2. It does not show how many pages are left in the chapter. You will have to go by location or minutes.<br/><br/>Again, these are minor but it would have been nice to have this better laid out.
 Awesome!
 Beautiful set of books, the graphics on the box has such a lovely design.
 This series lies to us...its not for kids.  There are things that I have to go back and re-read because I either missed or didn't focus on enough, and this happens every time I read them.  The Dursleys are more horrible than before, which is hard to imagine.  Lockhart is an insufferable fool who got what he deserved.  Snape is just as mean and nasty as before, and of course there's Dumbledore right in the middle of things.  I want just one teacher like him...
 We are reading a chapter a day and they are hooked. Thank goodness for this set, its was reasonable for our modest budget and its something the students and families are having a great time with.
 christmas gift for 7 yr old she loved the gift
 I absolutely love everything about this shipment. From the Box Set Designs to the size everything was what I wanted it to be and more. I received this in 2012 and it still looks brand new.! #PotterHead for life. Books are LOVE... STOP debating and order now.
 The books were in excellent condition when they were delivered. I’m so so happy with the special edition cover art.
 The last book in the series ... hard to please everyone because we all want something different from these characters that we have followed for the past few years.  The last chapter was unnecessary, but there were many chapters that were brilliant which made up for the epilogue.  Suffice it to say, at our coed book club, we talked for over an hour about the hidden meanings, plot twists, symbolism, parallels to Nazi Germany, the presence of spirituality within the book, etc.  For a children's book, it has some deep meanings, and some stirring outcomes for sideline characters such as Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood.
 My 11 yr old grandson has entered the Hogwarts world.
 You simply can't go wrong with a Harry Potter book, and even after multiple readings, Chamber of Secrets continues to age like fine wine. Ms. Rowling has taken a great idea and turned it into a modern day classic by creating a world and populating it with interesting characters. Heroes and villains alike are favorites of many readers, and Lord Voldemort (for those of us brave enough to say his name) will probably emerge as one of literary's everlasting bad guys, on the level of a Fu Manchu or a Darth Vader.<br/><br/>This book covers Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts. There is an evil that threatens the students, the same as it did 50 years ago. Harry and his friends dig for clues, putting the pieces together one by one, searching for the answer that will solve the mystery and protect their fellow students. As always, the author presents readers with interesting characters and situations. Her style of writing captivates both young and old, as she is able to present the story from the viewpoint of a twelve-year-old boy yet describe everything in a manner to keep an adult interested.<br/><br/>The beauty of this series is that over the years, there will constantly be new readers discovering the wonders of Harry Potter and his years at Hogwarts. Five stars for year two.
 Who can go wrong with the Potter series?? Loved it
 I'd been meaning to re-read this series for a while, and it was nice to have them all in one set so when I finished one, I could put it back and grab the next. A super price for all 7 books, and, of course, it's a really fun read for any age!
 My granddaughter loved the book set.  She can have these forever!
 I am 23 years old and I love this book! I picked it up because the cover was so interesting. I read the book in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I was so glad when I found out it was the second book in an ongoing  series. The characters are so real and the plot was very intriguing. Where  was this book when I was a kid? When much of the books available deal with  troubling adult issues, it is refreshing to go into the lives of Harry and  his friends. As a child, I was convinced that there were schools for  wizards and witches, and I would have given anything to leave my Muggle  school for a place like Hogwarts.Harry Potter has allowed me to finally do  just that.
 The first 4 books were good. The fifth book is missing chapter 14 and part of 15. Very frustrating.<br/>Amazon is replacing the item for us!  Now we can finish the series!
 Great! one of the best Christmas gifts under the tree according to my Daughter- shipping did take a little longer than expected but made it in time
 I loves these books the only thing I wish I could do was zoom into the pictures at the beginning of the chapters.
 Good
 Just started reading this book and there is a misprint ...a random chapter is put in the middle of the book. Very disappointed.
 Outstanding book.  JK is such a good writer.
 Great buy!
 was as advertised
 It's hard to sort out the reviews of the book series in it's various forms, so let me start out stating this is a review of the audio collection. Seven CD sets, for each of JK Rowling's brilliant novels.<br/><br/>I don't often review books because enjoyment of literature and stories is such a subjective thing. I will simply say that I love these stories, my 13 year old daughter loves these stories, and many of my students love these stories. I feel they are well-written and incredibly detailed. Your results may vary.<br/><br/>As for the audio collection, it is no collector's item. The boxes holding each CD set are cardboard and will show wear after just a few uses. I am not interested in how the boxes hold up. I opened them once to transfer the CDs to iTunes to listen to on my iPod. Jim Dale is a masterful orator, and his storytelling makes my daily commute so much more painless. Nearly every character he voices matches my expectations (except Luna, I think he has her all wrong, but I will forgive him that). This audio collection provides hours (days really) of entertainment and can be listened to over and over again.<br/><br/>In short, if you are a fan of the books, you will NOT regret this audio purchase.
 good
 Great book, just finished the series. You need to read all the books, there easy reading. I would recommend this book to all ages. Both on 5 was kind of slow but you need to keep reading it gives good back ground
 Beautiful collection and nicely packaged..
 This book builds on all of the charm of the first book! I enjoyed reading it a third time as much as the first!
 The title says it all. I have never been at the receiving end of a fantastic delivery service until Harry Potter the 7th. All of that is thanks to my membership of the Amazon Prime. So they bumped it up to same day delivery with no cost. I'm ecstatic and eternally grateful! Nothing beats reading the last of Harry Potter series at 7 AM fresh from UPS delivery service. I wish that more product will get the same treatment. Like such is the $5 off bonus at the end of the month that you can combine with the voucher. It will hook more people up, I'm sure.
 Much, much better than I expected. Seeing the movie before reading it was very helpful. It helped me to better understand the story. Very entertaining and suspenseful.
 This book is amazing. Most books I wouldn’t care to review but this one deserves it. It is so much fun, suspenseful and you won’t get any to put it down
 Hermione would approve!
 Reading the books on an EReader was easier and more enjoyable.
 Really loved this series, this book was no disappointment.  The author didn't write it the way I wanted (which I doubt I could even articulate) and yet she managed brilliantly to finish the series and leave me completely satisifed.  I just knew I would read it and be left wanting more.  I don't think I have ever finished a series feeling like that.  That being said, if she ever writes anything even remotely connected to this world of Harry Potter, I would be first in line.<br/><br/>Book 7 review aside, I hated the epilogue.  While it did satisfy curiosity, it was very unsatisfying in every other way.  It was too brief and very cliche.  The quality of the writing seems inferior in every way to the books.  It seems like this could have been jotted down on a napkin and added at the last minute...and they lived happily ever after.
 Packaged perfect keeping the books and the chest it comes in pristine! Made for a perfect gift for a huge Harry Potter fan.
 I'm a school teacher, and my students absolutely love the illustrated Harry Potter collection!
 Love the Harry Potter series
 As a huge Harry Potter fan, I fell in love with this set when I first saw it on Amazon. I was not disappointed at all when it arrived. It is perfectly packaged and the books are high quality. A must-have collectors item.
 Love these books. It shipped really fast, but it did have some very minor damage to one corner.
 I love the series and great way to end it all.
 Christmas present for my daughter. She loves it!!
 Great to re-read!
 Loved the story line, although it is written for grade school children.
 This book series is one for the ages! Highly recommended and very entertaining. I was introduced to Harry Potter through the movies and never bothered to read the books because I believed them to be children's stories but, I was wrong and I've come to appreciate JK Rowling in her writing. She's great at her craft and the books, as always, are better than the movies thought, those were some well directed and acted out movies still. Made it through Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets and both books give you better details about Voldemort's past and a bigger presence from its supporting cast. Now I'm reading Prisoner of Azkaban and it's just as entertaining,if not more than the film it was based on. Looking forward to the remaining 4 books once I'm finished with this one. Rowling has really made reading fun again!! Do not miss out on this!! You won't regret it.
 I did not even pick up a Harry Potter book until the third edition and probally wouldn't have if not for a school project my son had to do but from the moment I started reading I couldn't stop and waited very impatiently I might add for the next edition my son lost interest in them preferring to wait for the movies, I did not, as the day for the release of this book (which I preordered the moment it popped up here) I waited both impatiently and with exitement, but also dread at what could happen and the fact that it was the last book and there would be no more waiting for more, so Saturday morning I was waiting at the back door of my post office for the first employee to arrive to get my book as our post office opens late on Saturday and thankfully they gave it to me, I started reading on the way home which was no easy feat as I did not have my glasses, but I just couldn't wait, so I am stumbling down the road reading and I did not stop until I was done, I laughed , I cried and I thouroughly enjoyed my last installment of my favorite book and I know every Harry Potter fan every where will Thank-you J.K. Rowling for the best set of books I have ever read and I am 50 yrs old
 Cool
 First of all - I really liked the book.  It was exciting, scary, funny, sad, and ... wow... it's over.  It sucked me in, and didn't let go until I turned the last page of the epilogue.<br/><br/>Do I think there are some flaws? As in the other books, absolutely.  The biggest flaw is that it left me with some big questions - I wanted to know a bit more about the outcome of the battle of Hogwarts.  How did it shake up the wizarding world?  What the heck happened to Umbridge? What about the death eaters?  I'd like to know more about the main characters, other than answers about who ended up with whom.  Some folks like the loose ends, but for a book that's supposed to END the series, I'm was slightly disappointed in that.<br/><br/>But, all in all, a worthy way to end the series. Now, I hope JKR DOES publish the encyclopedia she's suggested she might do.
 I love this packaging and the little stickers that came we’re just so cute this brought me back to first time I started reading Harry Potter
 The story seems to wend its way slowly through plot points (or lack thereof--I did agree with Ron at one point in the story, and after reading you'll know what I mean), and the slow-ish plot can sometimes be a bit tiring.  It didn't provide me with a lot of excitement when big plot points occurred, but maybe that was just me.<br/><br/>I won't say anything as to the deaths alluded to before the book's release except that I was sad at most of them; also I thought there would be only two, but there were way more deaths of good characters than that.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed how JK Rowling brought in a lot of details and people from the previous six books--it was like a farewell tv show where they look back on the best times, people who were on over the years, and things like that.  JKR always did a good job of that, but I think it's much more prominent in this book than in any, and I think that was stylistically intentional.<br/><br/>Overall, the book was, I felt, enjoyable and interesting, engaging even when the plot seemed slow or a little directionally challenged, and I was very satisfied with the ending.<br/><br/>Parents should be warned:  the death toll racks up quickly, and the language also is ramped up a bit.  There is use of a couple of "B" words and perhaps a couple of other curse words, so be warned.  I think other than that, language is relatively tame.
 We all already know that the books are fantastic and that they are a must-have for anyone, anywhere.<br/><br/>So let’s discuss the box set.<br/><br/>I received the paper-back set for Christmas two years ago. Based on the photographs provided, it is clear to see that the set is constructed of cardboard. Cardboard is cardboard, people. But this cardboard is not very flimsy—in fact, the box has held up remarkably well.  Before I read the books, they looked very nice sitting in their box. Of course, after reading the series several times, the books have, er, “expanded” such that what once fit into the box no longer does. This, however, has nothing to do with the manufacturer and more to do with personal reading habits.<br/><br/>Frankly, for a new set of Harry Potter books, you’re getting a great price. The books themselves have held up very well, especially compared to some of my other books of similar sizes (Twilight crumbled to dust). You’re getting all the books here for under fifty bucks. Is it cardboard? Absolutely. But you’re getting a great price for the books—so does the cardboard box really matter… maybe not.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to mention that anyone who was disappointed by the hardcover set should’ve reviewed the pictures more closely. This box is also, very clearly, folded cardboard. The checkered lining of the box is obviously paper—there is no texture, and it has a sheen. What is depicted is essentially what you get.
 great book  easy to read  my son loves it and looking forward to buy the next ones<br/>thanks
 What an adventure! This last book kept me constantly wondering whether I was feeling happy or sad. I mean, those last 4 chapters really get to you !
 Ordered this set for a gift, looks great.
 He loved it
 It was really AWESOME!!!!!! I loved it so much!!!!!!!! The writing was really detailed and characteristic! Over all, it was great!!!!
 🤩❤️❤️❤️ very similar to movie but slight differences but I Loved It!!!!
 I love the Harry Potter series. I've read the books over and over for years, but not in the last few years. I've had my kindle for about 4 years and have never bought this series in ebook form. Over the years I've tried to slowly replace some of my favorite books (and series) with the eBook version. The Harry Potter series was just too expensive to do that until now. I got an email from Amazon advertising the whole series for just over sixty dollars including tax. I think that's a pretty good deal for such a great series. I know I'll read these over and over on my kindle just like I read the books so many times they are nearly worn out. (I've also loaned them out to others). I was so surprised how quickly the entire series downloaded. I was a little worried about that but I had no problem at all. I'm ready to read now!
 This is not a perfect book. But then again, the Harry Potter series is not a perfect series. It has flaws, though many of them, particularly the two-dimensional villians, are fixed in this, the (apparently... possibly... probably...), final chapter of the series.<br/><br/>You already know the plot. There's a decent chance you already know the ending. I knew it before I started to read the book, but despite that fact, I found this an astonishingly good read.<br/><br/>J K Rowling's greatest strength as a writer lies in her ability to create a vivid and complete world that exists next to our own. Like our world it has heroes and villians, flaws and successes, triumph and tragedy.<br/><br/>The book itself is somewhat more of a weighty read than the previous volumes. I was able to dash through books 1, 2 and 3 in a single sitting. Book four took me a couple days. Books five and six occupied my time for even longer. This book took four days to read. It can't just be breezed through in one easy go.<br/><br/>This book plays out like grand opera in many ways. Some of the characters we've grown to know and despise are redeemed, and others we have grown to love have a bit of a dark shadow cast upon them. Questions we've wondered about since the first book are answered (and I was particularly pleased with myself for figuring out what was going on with Dumbledore's fate at the end of the last book), and while the new book does raise up a few new questions, it mostly presents a fine ending to the series.<br/><br/>The more adult feel to his particular novel also presents Rowling with a chance to actually use some of the double-entrendes we've all been thinking about since book one (for example a comment about wizards being obsessed with the size of their wands).<br/><br/>The book is not without flaws. For much of the book, it seems like we're on a camp-out with the kids. I also wasn't hugely fond of the very end of the book, though I didn't hate it like many other people seem to have. Plus, of course, the slash-fiction fan in me was disapointed that neither Ron nor Draco confessed their true love to Harry, but, oh, well. I think I'll live. :)<br/><br/>In the end, this is the best of the Harry Potter books. It's a worthwhile and definate conclusion to the series and great reading. The price tag is a little steep, but thanks to Amazon's deep discount, it's not really all that bad.<br/><br/>But really, I'm not sure why I, or anyone else, writes reviews of something like this. The book is bullet-proof. If you've read the first six, you'll read this. If you haven't read them, go back and read them, then come to this one. You'll be happy you did.
 Shocked as an older male reader just how much I am loving these novels. I never read them as a kid, because well I was far from being a kid when they came out. I had always heard from people though that they were actually well written, obviously loved by all the Potter fans. I'm not sure what possessed me to buy these but it was the new hardcover editions that finally won me over. Wow! I'm shocked to say that the first two novels, Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets are my two favorite novels that I've read all year. Completely blown away at how much I loved them. Well then I need to get back to reading but these aren't just for kids, Rowling is a darn good storyteller and she's got some writing chops.
 It’s Harry Potter, what more needs to be said.  I read the series 20 yrs ago with my daughters and it’s my go to when I just need to escape.
 My 9 year old dove into this complex plot full of detail and twists and riddles and could not put it down.  I was the same way.  We passed it back and forth over the course of a week or so.  This was my favorite, though we loved the whole series.<br/><br/>THANK YOU Ms. Rowling for not copping out with an ambiguous ending.  The biggest fans are kids, and you were so good to your readers in putting such great work into forming an action packed, satisfying, ending that made sense, even though it was not predictable.<br/><br/>Awesome read!
 I have to admit, i was skeptical of Harry potter books from when i heard they were supposed to be childrens's books. I couldn't have been more wrong. This series of books are incredible to read, keep you locked in to the end of the seventh book, and make you want to reread them, as i am doing now.<br/>  This series goes into my hall of fame, along with anything Tolkien(i.e., the Lord of the Rings,etc.), Alan Dean Foster's Spellsinger series, Michael Moorcock's The eternal champion series (Elric), Terry Brook's Shannara series, and Stephen R Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series.<br/>  A great purchase from a great company that has been good me ever since i've joined. Thanks,  ...]
 The set was in great condition
 The wizarding world of Harry Potter at your fingertips. All seven books anytime I want! I couldn't pass it up. They even have pictures at the beginning of each chapter just like the paperbacks. As much as love reading and live reading Harry Potter I can't hold a big book for long periods of time like I used to when I was a kid. So having it on my lightweight kindle hdx makes me so happy!!! Not only that but because I have it digital I can lay down in bed and prop it up instead of having to sit up and hold pages open. If you're a die hard potterhead then you need this! Have Harry with you everywhere you go! The options for highlighting passages you want to remember is just icing on the cake!
 Words don’t do this book justice
 This was a wonderful read, and a great part in the series. It is now one of my favorite sequels along with A Tangle of Deception, by Diane Henson.
 Cool book J.K. I love it I think you should do more books than just eight like do Harry as a man with his kids!
 The book looks amazing and I was highly satisfied with the transaction.
 The kids loved it
 From Beginning to End a complete Masterpiece of fantastical fiction.  How I wish the story would have continued instead of stopping at 7.
 To me, I think the best thing about the hype surrounding the release of this book was just exactly how freaking accurate Hank Green's "Accio Deathly Hallows" song turned out to be!<br/><br/>Here we have the final entry into the gripping tale of Harry Potter versus Tom Riddl... er... Lord Voldemort. Tommy has at last started his master plan to control all of wizardom, and the only thing in his way.... is a seventeen year old kid. The premise could honestly be quite ridiculous if Rowling was not A) such a great storyteller, and B) had not set up such a compelling contest between these two that it's become obvious that Harry's a definite threat to the Dark Lord. In the last book, we learned about Horcruxes, and now that knowledge is put to work as Harry, Ron, and Hermione track down the remaining remnants of Voldy's Moldy Soul while staying as far off his radar as possible.<br/><br/>This one has it all. Death Eaters! A raid on Gringotts! Thrilling rescues! Love! Death! Incredible Revelations! The Battle of Hogwarts! And the epic, stunning final confrontation between Harry Potter and the dark wizard who's been hounding him since he was quite literally a year old. Also included, some of the greatest moments from secondary and tertiary characters ever recorded! I mean, Neville's Gran! Molly Weasley! Mc-friggin'-Gonagall!!<br/><br/>Truly an excellent ending to an amazing saga... even if the Epilogue did leave a little to be desired, it was still very sweet.
 First off, I loved the first book!!  I realize that it would be hard to duplicate all the excitement that was served up in the Sorcerer's Stone, but I didn't really anticipate such a big drop off in the quality of the  story.  I still suggest that averyone that read the first book should  indeed buy this one as there are so few quality books for children, but  just don't expect the same feeling that the first book delivered..
 Great pictures my nephew is 8 and he loved it!
 It is a very well crafted fantasy world full of many surprises throughout the book as Harry Potter and his friends uncover the mysterious attacks happening around the school.
 As advertised
 I have enjoyed the magical journey the books have taken me. I confirms my belief that Harry created his "good luck" by having strong friendships, having fierce loyalty to Dumbledore and Hogwarts, risky adventures and treating magical creatures with respect. Voldemort made his own luck and sealed his own fate by having no friends or family, torturing and killing without remorse, separating his soul to inanimate objects, and not recognizing his own limitations. I also would like to express my pity towards Voldemort.
 Roller coaster is not a word that explains the plot twists and the path changes that the story takes.  You have to have read all the previous books in order to complete the story, the movies cut out so much that is relevent to the last book.  The final chapter is almost a let down, as while it is nice to see the future lives and how the circle continues, it leaves the reader who has invested so much in reading and retaining all the information from the previous books, looking for more.  It is akin to the yearly Christmas letter that we get from relatives each year; a condensed, Cliff-notes version of what has happened, without getting any real information.  After reading the book and completing the series, it seems rather unnecessary to see any of the remaining movies, they cut so much out of them.  The only remedeming thing that Hollywood could do is learn to put more in the last two movies.
 Shipped quickly. Item as described. Thanks!
 The last Harry Potter, and, arguably, the best novel.  Harry has reached maturity and must now face his fate- will he be able to find all of Voldemort's Horcruxes?  Will he be able to survive the ultimate fight?<br/><br/>It was with a mixture of sadness and glee that I read this novel.  Over the series, I felt close to the characters and wasn't ready to say goodbye.  However, by the end of the novel I felt complete.  I felt as if everything that was supposed to happen did happen.  This is one of my all time favorite novels.
 Harry Potter has never been accused of being a Nobel Prize contender, but I firmly believe that not every book has to be. Harry Potter is quite entertaining, however. I downed the entire book in one day because I couldn't stop turning the pages.<br/><br/>In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, something at Hogwarts has been turning those closest to Harry into stone. There is an addictive quality to Harry Potter that just sucks the reader in. I kept turning the page, trying desperately to put the pieces together to figure out just who was turning people into stone.<br/><br/>Pacing is Rowling's ultimate gift because she gives the reader pieces of the story puzzle, but not enough where the reader finds the ending tired and predictable. Can't wait to read more!
 I've read these books since elementary school and can't get enough of them. The set was clean and plastic wrapped, no complaints.
 I love the Harry Potter series, and I really enjoyed the artwork on the covers.  A great series for anyone with an imagination to read.
 Came in new
 Grand daughter loved them
 This is a superb quality set of books. It comes very well packaged and ours arrived pristine, despite it weighing about 20lbs.<br/>The books are wrapped in clear plastic inside the chest, which means you can open the chest to look at them once it arrives, but the recipient gets new wrapped books.<br/>The chest is sturdy board, with string/thin rope handles. It has a hard black plastic slide catch, which does look like it will last.<br/>On the top is an address label, with a big "deliver to........Hogwarts" stamp - which looks very realistic and adds a nice touch. You can add your child's name to the label.<br/>This is a real heirloom set of books, which I hope that all three of my children will read.<br/>Although I did not open the plastic protective wrapping on the books, they look to be well-bound and great quality.
 Beautiful boxed set of the series. It came on time and in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend!
 WEll here is my two cents on the most anticipated book in my lifetime...I cannot wait until they make the movie.  Is it just me or does anyone else out there think Jo Rowlings is an good writer,not great.  I absoulutley love the storyline and this book is a great continuation of the story.  But,in my opinion the action and characters only come to life when viewed on screen.<br/>The story goes that Harry and his order of the phoenix pals are battleing Voldemort to the death but some how Harry returns from the dead to slay the evil one.  I am not sure where he went and how he came back but the author really just kind of states the facts and does not explain the how and whys.<br/>Cheers to all who have enjoyed this series and the filling out of the story in movie form.
 After some 1100 reviews, I was loath to add my contribution, thinking it would be like bringing coals to Newcastle. Having read some of the reviews, however, I am somewhat heartened to read that not every review is a five-star love letter either to The Hallows, to author Rowling or to the series as a whole.<br/><br/>As to the observation Rowling needed a stricter editor for this final (some say, bloated) novel in the Harry Potter saga, it's debatable.  However, I take strong exception to one review that labeled Dumbledore a "fraud" with the demand that Dumbledore "be the same as he was throughout the series," or words to that effect.<br/><br/>The key aspect that comes from "HP and the Deathly Hallows" is the human fallibility of all the characters. I suppose it's easy to forget -- considering readers are submerged into the wizarding world -- that Harry and all the other characters (save the fantastic giants, centaurs, and such) are still HUMAN, magical but human. As such, Dumbledore, Harry, even Professor Snape are prone to human weakness, petty jealousies, and even acts of extraordinary courage. Readers are treated to the fact that a young, callow Dumbledore was elitist, selfish, and power-hungry. A young Snape seems to have loved only one woman -- the woman he couldn't have -- all his life. Who'd have suspected that the dour Snape had such a romantic nature?<br/><br/>Yet the adult Dumbledore is so easy to love, to trust. The adult Snape is so easy to hate, to hold in suspicion. In "Deathly Hallows" Rowling points out that all is never as it seems on the surface - a lesson we might apply in our real daily lives.<br/><br/>For this reader, the charm of the novel is finally revealing the feet of clay that all the principal characters possess. More than a tale of wizardry and the eternal battle of good vs. evil, Rowling has painted vivid portraits of the vagaries of human nature, by turns magnanimous then niggardly, cowardly then courageous.
 Loved. Perfect gift for the perfect price
 Brilliant work of art! Feels so surreal connecting the dots now so many years later. If you never read this in your childhood you definitely missed out.
 I love all the books I’m so glad that I could finally read all of them
 Great book.
 As an adult, I thought Harry Potter was 'just for kids'.  I saw the movie, just out of curiosity, and loved it.  So I bought the DVD.  I recently bought the 4 book set of Harry Potter.  It came in handy while I was recovering from minor surgery.  I read the first two books in just a little over a week. Just starting book 3. Great story lines and book 2 was not inconsistant with book 1.  I am not a big time reader.  Mostly magazines and the like, but these books are great.  After re-reading many books I have read in my life.  Some from Jr High(obligitary summer reading then), many have not held my interest like these books have.  As for the OCCULT visage that has been placed on these books, It is nonsense.  Harry and friends stand for all the good in people.  He never uses his 'power' for evil, he helps when others will not.  He is brave when others cower.
 Great value; great quality; great buy!<br/><br/>First of all, as a "library fan" of Harry Potter (i.e. I've read the books, yet never owned them), I've been wanting these books for a long time now. I almost bought this set awhile back, but the fact that I could get them for free at the library (and on my Kindle) led me to defer my purchase. When I finally decided to plop down the cashola (a good value for 7 books, but still a hefty financial commitment), they were no longer available, which made me want them all the more! I say that to make this point: despite the fact that I really wanted these books in part because of my own procrastination, they do not disappoint. The books themselves are of fine quality (both in terms of the physical books and the stories within them), and the box they come (as well as the stickers that come inside the box) in is a nice little bonus. I had fun applying the stickers with my daughter, and now, since I keep the books on a bookshelf, the box makes a nice container for some of my little girl's toys and things.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're interested in these books, I'd recommend pulling the trigger now; you never know when they'll go dark, and then you'll want them that much more!
 Beautiful book
 I know it is only cardboard box however it wasn't that much more exspensive to have the set in this nect cardboard box set then it was to pay for the entire set in just regular packaging at Borders.  Also at Borders it was 86 dollars for the entire set but that was in paperback I much prefer hardback books.  So yes even though the box is only cardboard mine was very sturdy held up well in shipping was easy to open and all of the hardback books are in great condition and I love that each one is individually wrapped in plastic.  The plastic will keep the books dustfree and in great condition until I am ready to read them.  I am a avid book fan and if you are like me I have so many books it could take me 6 months to a year before I even start reading the series and want them to be well protected so they will hold up until I read them.  Very happy and love the set.  Only seen the movies can't wait to read the books.  WE have been rewatching all the movies yes we own all the DVD's we purchased in a box DVD set.  I can't wait for the last one to come out.  However, now I can't wait after the movies are done to see what I missed by not reading the books.  This way I can continue to have Harry Potter to look forward to since she is done with the books and the movies.
 Read this book if you haven't yet and you follow the Harry Potter series. If you don't follow the series, please do so. It isn't just children stories, it's actually better than the movies. I read this book in two days just like everyone else I know who read it. You just can't put it down. All the previous books that left a question in your mind will be answered. Your theories of what really happened at the end of book six will unfold.<br/><br/>Everywhere I go, people are reading it --the subway, bus, on the sidewalk, etc.
 As I am now 28 years old these books came out when I was in my teens. Back then it was very hard for me to read books and it was hard for me to get into a specially this type of genre. But I'm older now and I've decided to give these books a whirl.<br/><br/>I started off with the sorcerer stone and it was a good book but I felt like it was a little childish - not in how the book was written but it was clearly just a foundation for what's about to come in with the second book being the chamber of secrets things are starting to pick up and now I'm hooked.<br/><br/>The writing style by J. K. Rowling is very easy for me to understand and comprehend and this book starts to get darker along with the series. I won't give too much away but the book has a great ending and leaves you with a lot of mysteries that make you wonder what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>Surprisingly this is one of the only story arcs that I have yet to spoil for myself so I just ordered the third book and I can't wait to get through it.
 Great looking set of books!
 The books themselves are beautiful. I love the covert art and the book look and feel.<br/>Very happy with the quality here.<br/><br/>I also like the Hogwart's chest as a container. I agree with all the other reviewers, the<br/>chest is slightly stronger than cardboard and the latch is flimsy, but it does look nice.<br/>I probably wouldn't recommend for kids, as they'll tear it apart in no time, but as a container<br/>to store the collector set, very nice.<br/><br/>Overall, a 4/5 stars. One point removed for the misleading cardboard like chest but overall, I would<br/>buy this set again in a heartbeat, regardless of the chest.<br/><br/>PS. I would have recommended they made a slightly stronger chest and included a wizard's wand for fun.<br/>I would have paid quite a bit more for the addition of these 2 features, just for fun.
 Loves these books
 It's gorgeous and it doesn't even have a scratch from shipping
 Great gift!
 this is the second year for the witches and wizards of hogwarts and the stories and adventures get a little more daring. i feel that this book as i have been told is going to be a very important story line for the future books. all this talk of mudbloods and muggles, the heir of slytherine and such makes for a good background. i have not read any of the remaining books yet, but i do know, to date, this book gives the most background of he who must not be nameed and my friends tell me that you really need to pay attention to this book and the story. i really like harry and ron and even hermoine in the books alot more than in the movies. in the movies all the characters seem to be much more timid and are way too passive but in the books they are always sticking up for eachother and are ready to face any issue that comes their way. people are reading again and this is a brilliant thing.
 Don't get me wrong; there were things about this book that I didn't care for; some of the "revelations" struck me as forced at best, downright out of character at worst. And there was enough death and destruction to keep the book from entirely escaping the "depressing" label. But of course, there had to be some of that in order to preserve a modicum of plausibility, so that's a fairly minor quibble.<br/><br/>In general, what needs to be asked is, "Have you been following the series from the beginning?" If so, obviously, you MUST read this book; all I can say is, you won't be disappointed. The only possible reason not to would be having been put off by book six, which is certainly the weakest book in the series. Don't be; this one more than makes up for it. Also obviously, if you HAVEN'T read the previous six books, it would be a serious mistake to start with this one; the series as a whole is highly recommended (I'm sure you're aware of how hyped the series is; all I can say is, it is NOT over-rated; it actually deserves all the hype!) but by all means, go back and start with book one (Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer's Stone); unless you're somebody who habitually reads the last page of a book first (I'm given to understand that there ARE such people out there) you will definitely NOT want to read this one before reading the others.
 I bought both books new<br/>But the books were not used, but showed signs of wear.<br/>#6 the front cover is bent<br/>#7 the pages are not all lined up

 Came in perfect conditions. The books look very good-made and also are beautiful. The only deception was that the box looks bigger in the image and it's only 21.1 cm tall, 21.5 cm deep and 26.8 cm width.
 Came as expected. Very happy with our purchase! Our son likes to read this series so it’s just another addition to his collection.
 The book was in very poor condition.
 It's Harry Potter. Of course it's good.
 A colleague of mine introduced me to Harry Potter.  After the first book I knew I needed my own set of Harry Potter books.  These books are imaginative and delightful, and they reach such a widescope of people.<br/><br/>If you know of someone who has a hard time getting into reading, try this series on them.  It's worked for my son.
 I don't know why the reviews have all these photos of a nice,  glossy pages illustrated set because that is definitely not what I got. These are not illustrated at all.
 A fabulous gift for an avid reader who someone has not managed to make her way to the Harry Potter books. I was so excited after buying this set that I reread my entire set of hardbacks. Although the storytelling is quaint and charming (although it becomes darker and darker as Harry ages), the plot has some small things that I have to mention - here, where it is likely to go unnoticed. I don't think any of the characters changed (matured) with the exception of Neville Longbottom. It irks me.<br/><br/>Here are another set of complaints (though I disagree with #7): http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6941658/12-things-that-still-bother-me-about-harry-potter<br/><br/>But overall, a wonderful set of stories of adventure, friendship, and magic.<br/><br/>PS I can't understand why people would not want their teenage kids to read this series because it involves magic. It's fiction, people!<br/>PPS Or is it?
 Love this book!.......... I wish the series would keep going with Ginny and Harry’s kids.  Maybe wishful thinking, I guess I’ll just wait.
 I bought these to read again as the copies I first read were my younger sisters.<br/><br/>I was wary to buy used, as I am very picky about the condition my belongings are in, but I contacted the seller (yjdbooks, who also has a shop in Duluth, Georgia) and they reassured me that the books were in good condition with minor shelf-wear.<br/><br/>My package arrived moments ago...<br/><br/>I am just amazed! I bought a full set of 1st printing Harry Potter books (7 hardbacks in total) for only $47 - an extremely good price and even a decent price for a "rugged" set with spine separation, staining, and writing. What I received were 7 near-mint books! As I opened the box and slowly pulled each one out to inspect I just whispered to myself "Oh my god." Simply amazing. Thank you!!!<br/><br/>Now I'm off to re-live one of the most heart-warming and heart-wrenching tales I've ever read!
 If you are the kind of Harry Potter fan that has to have everything, then you probably have considered purchasing the Collector's editions. This Collector's Edition is very similar in binding and looks to its predecessor, Sorcerer's Stone, and markedly different from the last two Collector's Editions, Order of the Phoenix and Half- Blood Prince. It is my honest opinion that if you are looking to invest in a collector's edition of any of the HP books, the first two are the most handsome and display- worthy. The "Box set" feel of the latter two Collector's editions are lovely, however the bindings are no different than the Hardcover editions (although the dust jacket artworks are unique to the collector's editions). The first two Collector's editions are a leather binding, with gilded page edges and have the feel of a true collectable for adults.<br/><br/>This edition of Chamber of Secrets is bound in red leather with a lightweight, translucent plastic dust cover to protect the leather. The leather binding is very tight and clean and the gilded page edges can suffer a fair ammount of page flicking without flaking or rubbing off. It also includes a small piece of jacket art (same artwork from the dust jacket of the hardcover edition) that would be suitable for framing. This edition would be better kept away from the hands of children if you want your copy to stay clean and pristine.<br/><br/>I have to honestly say that my favorite portion of this edition is the spine of the book, which is just beautiful to look at in red leather and gold lettering, and Harry's lightning- shaped scar in gold along the spine adds a touch of whimsey, reminding the reader that, as beautiful as this binding is, this is a book about fun and adventure for all ages.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a Harry Potter collectable edition, this one is by far my favorite.
 Well everyone knows the Harry Potter books are wonderful so I won't go on about that, but this is the first disk set I purchased (I usually buy audiotapes), it is wonderful! Don't look too closely at the drawings on each CD set though, spoilers everywhere!<br/><br/>I have never actually read the books and have only had Jim Dale read them to me, it has been the most amazing way to be a part of this world. He does all the voices and personalities and inflections, he an exceptional storyteller sharing an exceptional story!
 Should have talked more about Hogsmead<br/>I have already recommended this wonderful book to family and friends.<br/>Harry and Minerva McGonagall are my heroes
 We have the original hardbacks, but I wanted something in paperback for him to carry around. He's a little guy, and those are heavy books!!<br/><br/>This is a beautiful set, and we are enjoying the new artwork. It's not a radical reinterpretation or anything...but just nice to see some new imagery. My favorite is the bindings, which form a picture of Hogwarts when they're in sequential order.<br/><br/>Update: It didn't take very long (a month? less?) before the books wouldn't fit into the box anymore. I think the books must absorb just enough moisture that they're wider; and the fit is VERY tight when they're brand new. I've never had this problem with other boxed sets, and would recommend that the publisher consider making it half a centimeter wider. (Doubt if they'll read this, let alone care. But I was bummed to pitch the beautiful box, and pulled a star.)
 Of course it's great!
 Great novel
 okay, we all know that these are the best books written so far this millenium, and that the best parts (of the early books especially) are the descriptions of the giant feasts in the Great Hall.  And that the best parts of the later books are the layers of misdirection and intrigue.  But did we all know that you could get all of that (only about 2 weeks' worth of reading, if you dig into these like I did) for such a paltry sum??  This package is amazing.  Got it for me mum for Christmas this year, as she had somehow missed the boat, and she's loved every minute!<br/><br/>Better written and more intriguing a mystery than most popular adult books released in the same time period (i.e. "The DaVinci" whathaveyou), and there's SIX of them! with the best volume assuredly yet to come.
 Great fiction about character. I enjoyed the books a lot even though I am an adult. Glad I went back to read the books. I could highlight things using the kindle app.
 I am a collector of books, especially Harry Potter ones...I have several sets of the series in mixed softcover and hardcover, but this is amazing. The binding is beautiful, the paper is very high quality....It's great to go on the adventure in such nice quality. I've been a fan of Harry Potter since I was three years old, and now I'm fourteen, and I was pretty emotional when I saw the chest sitting in the living room. Ever since I was little I've wanted to see the Hogwarts letter in my mail (unfortunately the owl is late), and this was a nice substitute. Harry Potter is very special to me, the books have been there when friends have not, and I've been helped so much by J.K. Rowling, even though I know she has no clue I exist. This book set is a wonderful gift for a Harry Potter fan, and there are no words to describe how brilliant this magical series of books is.
 Rowling goes into so much more detail than you get to see in the movie. I always thought Chamber of Secrets was boring until I read the book. Amazing.
 I purchased this set for my son's 8th birthday.  It arrived well packed so as to protect the decorative cardboard box holding the books.  My son loved the set.  We had recently finished book one that we had gotten from the library and were just a chapter into book two from the library when he opened this gift.  He immediately wanted to return the library book to start reading from his "own" copy.  The paperback covers and the box all have wonderful artwork.<br/><br/>We are now into book three and very happy with this purchase that provides a wonderful set of chapter books that are great for me to read to my son and for him to begin to read on his own.
 Amazing series, one cannot just read 1 or 2 books. It's a must to finish the series, everything in the book is so well connected, perfect story. Cannot help but be amazed at J.K. Rowling's vivid imagination and writing the story so well.
 Very pleased.  Thanks
 I’ve seen the movie a few times with the kids but I prefer the books ending than the movies ending
 gave as a gift
 Amazing
 My 7 year old could not stop reading it!
 Okay so I am 37 years old, have a 10 year old daughter and fell in love with Harry Potter books after I read book three (Prisoner of Azkaban).  So I secretly ordered myself the set of 5.  I cannot put the books down!  I am also an MBA student and after I finish a class and have a break I dive into these books to lose myself. The best part is my daughter is now reading the Harry Potter set.  Rachel
 Books arrived in like nee condition!!! Very happy with my purchase!!
 If you've never listened to audiobooks, you have to start with the Harry Potter series.  Narrator Jim Dale gives each character his or her own voice so that the longer you listen, the easier it is to tell who is talking before it is actually revealed.  The Deathly Hallows is the icing on the cake of the best series of books written in recent years.  J.K. Rowling is a genius.  The final explanation of many of the mysteries of the earlier books is revealed in this 7th and best (in my opinion) of the series. Buy it and listen to it on audio, then go back and buy all the others and enjoy them all.  You won't be disappointed!
 After many years I finally caved and started to read the Harry Potter series. At first I was really sarcastic about the whole thing and didn't think the books would be any good. This attitude came from the fact that most people who read the series are kids and I'm an adult.<br/><br/>I'm happy to say though that these books really are great. I am an avid reader and read roughly 5-6 books a week. Now that's just in my spare time. As for this series it really held my attention. I HAD to read them in order, one after the other. No way so I going to take a "break". The plot lines are very complex and I do believe Rowling does a fabulous job and sucking the reader into not only the story but the characters and the landscape.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence about buying this series for a family member, friend, etc. I would honestly say go ahead it get the books. Even if the individual isn't into sci-fi or magic (like myself) these books are compelling.<br/><br/>As for shipping-It was amazing. I received my order within two days of submitting it.
 I love these books.  I love how the target audience shifts and the story becomes more complex as you go.
 My children and I read these wondeful books together.  It makes for great family time with one to two chapters read aloud each night.  They would rather hear this than watch T.V. Plus my one son that was having trouble reading, now reads well thanks to reading Harry Potter on his own over and over... Buy them all you will not regret it!  Thanks J.K. Rawling for creating some real magic.
 Very long read. Good wrapping up of the story. I WANT more.I king of wanted to see Harry as headmaster. Maybe he will be in the future
 Run-ons are a pet peeve of mine, but aside from that, the book had enough action, personal drama, etc etc to keep me entertained.  Rowling does dialogue very well.  The characters came alive with all their flaws and petty tiffs.<br/>Probably the best part of the book and the Harry Potter series as a whole is I can believe in the character.  I can believe he's got his burden to bear and does that at times with ill grace.  He's a teen, struggling with life and love and friendship.  He's also human, so he fails and triumphs.<br/>The twists in the book are excellent.  Hearty thanks to Rowling for sticking in that "I'll explain all" ch, b/c I did not bother rereading the entire series b/f jumping into the 7th.  Maybe one day I'll read 'em all again, but for now, excellent read, well worth the buy.  Long live Potter!
 I love the Harry Potter series.  I think by now, we're all aware of how great the books are and what a fantastic journey you're on with Harry and crew when you read all these amazing and well-written books.  I really wanted to re-read these after having seen the last movie, and I thought this paperback set in the cardboard would make a nice little collection.  Upon receipt, I was more than satisfied with the quality of the cardboard box they're housed in and the books themselves.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this set, it's a great price, as you're saving over buying each book separately, and it comes in a nice little box, and it's a fantastic series of books that can be enjoyed again and again.
 Hey guys,<br/>I bought this set for my oldest son he's 17.He loves Harry Potter he had books the first 5 books but they got destroyed.I borrowed the 6 th. book from our local library and,he read it in like 3 days.we have all the movies that are out on d.v.d. I bought the 7 th and,final book for him for his birthday then found 1-6 here on Amazon.com and,bought them for him for christmas.He's updating me on what's happening as he reads them.Thank you Amazon.com for making my son very happy!!<br/>  Thank you,<br/>Sheila Lance
 Good
 Yes, with most things, you either love it or you hate it; I really love this series and I love this book,  I love how it settles most of the storylines and how it provides redemption to characters.
 Amazing! Just an experience you gotta have in life. The whole Harry Potter series are excellent to get out of reality in imagination and live through the characters.
 Outside:  Attractive covers, more colorful, more exciting, more juvenile, less elegant than those of the Signature edition.  Artwork is clearly inspired directly from the books though with a few concessions to the movies.  The cover to book one is particularly interesting in that Ron and Hermione's faces aren't clearly seen and the way they are drawn they could easily be Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, though on the back of another volume you see the characters clearly, and they are based simply on the books (a tall and lanky Ron, for instance).  My only real criticism is that in a few of the pictures Harry looks more like a girl than a boy, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The paper covers themselves have an interesting texture that I haven't encountered before, sort of velvety.  When I first touched them I thought my fingers were leaving unsightly fingerprints/smudges on the strange material, but this was actually just the moisture from my hands which quickly evaporated.  Like most boxed sets the books are pressed tightly together, hard to get them in and out when they are all in there, but not as bad as a Hobbit and Lord of the Rings boxed set I own.<br/><br/>Inside:  Font is about the same size as the Signature addition, slightly larger than the Scholastic edition most Americans are familiar with.  Like the Scholastic edition the lines are spaced more widely apart, making for more comfortable reading but larger books than the Signature.  The font itself is an unusual one, but quite attractive and easy on the eyes with the exception of some of the punctuation.  Most punctuation marks are strangely diminutive in size and shape.  This works fine for colons and semicolons, but the quotation marks look severe, the tiny exclamation marks look odd, and the weird little question marks are almost unrecognizable.  The Signature edition by contrast uses a very standard font.<br/><br/>There are no illustrations at the chapter headings other than some little stars, but the letters, signs, and such that Harry comes across are rendered like illustrations.  They aren't the same as the Scholastic ones but it's the same idea, better than the Signature edition that just provided them in italics, without even signatures reproduced on the letters.  An interesting new element is a map of the Hogwarts grounds and immediate surroundings at the front of each volume.  This is entirely unnecessary and could be interpreted as spoilers for people just starting the series, but I think it's pretty cool anyway, giving the books themselves a more classic fantasy feel.  On the other hand the back of each book is packed with lame ads for related products, webpages, etc.  You won't find that junk, and just a minimal amount of those ubiquitous "praise" lines for the books/author, in the Signature edition.<br/><br/>Language:  The differences between the British and American versions go beyond spelling and punctuation conventions or even sweater vs. jumper sorts of dialect.  For example a fair amount of food/candy has been changed in the American version to make things more familiar for American kids.  And of course there is the infamous changing of the Philosopher's Stone (a real piece of folklore) to the "Sorcerer's Stone."<br/><br/>For an adult reader all this Americanization and dumbing down in the Scholastic version is inane and distracting, and even more so considering the inconsistency of these changes across the series.  I for one would much rather read the book as the author herself wrote it, even if it means looking up a word now and then.  Granted, there are a few things that might seem a bit irritating to an American, like no periods after "Mr" and "Mrs" and a tendency to say things like "Gryffindor are the best House" instead of "Gryffindor is the best house."  Again, I'd rather see the author's own choices and culture even when it feels wrong to an American, but it's a personal choice.
 This book is missing pages 375-380
 The story ran a little faster toward the end.  Can't wait to get the next book in the series.  It should be good.
 Yesterday I finished Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows.  It was bittersweet!  On one hand I tried to pace myself, as this is the last chapter of the boy wizard and his adventures.  I just couldn't put the thing down!  I am still amazed at how engaging this writer is.<br/>My parents taught me to read at the tender age of three.  My Mom passed down her love of the written word and let me lay around with her at night and read my own little books. My Dad, despite the fact that he doesn't really get into reading books- read to me every night as a young child while my Mom made dinner.  I have read thousand of books over my lifetime, yet this unassuming children's tale has captivated me from the opening line of the very first book.  I didn't pick up the series until a few months before the first movie came out.  Oddly enough it was the artwork on a pack of Harry Potter edition Uno cards (which I now own) that attracted my interest.  I ordered the set and read the first four books in less than a week.  I have been like a rabid beast awaiting the final three books in the series.  Amazon was great, delivering the last installment by 1:00 on Saturday.<br/> The book was astounding, a feast for the imagination.  J.K. Rowling is truly a witch, her words are pure magic. The book takes us through the final battle for not only the Wizzarding World, but for the Muggle world as well.  The Characters are flawed and wonderfully human.  I am so emotionally invested in the lot of them that every death is like a physical blow.  How wonderful is it to be so in love with an imaginary world that you are a part of the adventure! I would never dream of giving away plot points, as this is a story that you need to follow to the end.  As the story unfolds, little wisps of information connect the books.  Suddenly, miraculously it all falls into place.  While certainly a heart wrenching tale, it is so full of heart and sacrifice that I can't help coming away from it feeling a bit of a better person for being a part of it.<br/>J.K Rowling and her beautiful world of witches and wizards have changed our world.  An entire apathetic generation of children has been awakened to the magic of letting their imagination soar through reading.  I think that we are going to see many wonderful new worlds coming from this generation, and I can't wait.
 I had never read these books before--they came out when I was a kid, but I thought I was too good for them with my Animal Farm and my Brave New World. How wrong I was!<br/><br/>I am only giving this four stars because I ordered a paperback copy--which I've since double- and triple-checked, and the order DEFINITELY said "paperback"--and I got a hardback. I know that seems like a totally stupid complaint, but hear me out: I am a tiny lady, and I like smaller books that I can easily bend with my child-sized claws I like to call hands. I like my books to be easily taken into the tub. In the two days it took me to finish this one, I spent a majority of my reading sitting at my kitchen table, which was kind of irritating and cold, but dammit I wanted to finish this damn book.<br/><br/>I just like paperbacks, and now all my copies don't match =/ but I feel silly because I paid paperback price so I really shouldn't complain.
 Great books in nice box
 This I have to say is one of the best books on the planet.  Rowling writes as though you are there in the very same room as the characters.  The action parts are flawless along with the so many other genres of the story;  romance, humor, and horror.  The reason why I gave this book four starts instead of five is because I felt that there could have been a bigger bang in the end (but that could just be me because I have become a very fast reader compared to when I read HBP- so maybe I just read it too fast).  But either way you will NOT regret reading this book.
 Well, this is it, this is where it all comes to an end as Harry Potter and his merry band of miscreants saddle up for one last adventure - to kill Voldemort by destroying those darn horcruxes that divide up his soul. Very little time is spent at Hogwarts until the climax, countless characters die (including the villain), but a happy ending is eventually had.<br/><br/>All in all, a nice cap off to the Potter saga, even though JK Rowling completely and utterly failed at making Harry's romance with Ginny (Ron's sister) believable.
 I liked the price and the speedy delivery.
 It's Harry Potter first of all, need I say more!! But no really the chest of books is a neat idea and keeps my books stored nicely.
 Harry Potter evokes feelings in me that other books can't quite reach. At the end of every book, it is so hard to come out of the world that she created and move on with everyday life, wondering what will happen next to Harry and his friends.<br/><br/>So it was with great trepidation that I picked up this final volume. Would she end it horribly? Would it be too sappy or too violent? How could she possibly tie everything up satisfyingly?<br/><br/>Well, she succeeded. While this book is far too scary and violent for younger readers (I cried through half of it and found my heart racing through much of it), she hit the right balances for me in wrapping things up. The ending didn't feel contrived or fake, there was heartbreak and joy throughout the book, and we got to see all our old favorite characters and watch them come together in flesh and in spirit to fight for goodness and all that is right in the world.<br/><br/>I'd think that books 5-7 would be too hard for kids younger than 12 to take, though. If you are planning on letting children or young teens read these final books, you might read along with them and be sure you can discuss the scary parts with them. This book is done well enough that it brings up a lot of philosophical thoughts about our world today and things that have happened in our history, and it would help younger readers to be able to talk about it all with a grownup who can help explain, support, or put it into context.<br/><br/>Overall, I really couldn't have hoped for a better ending to such a beloved series. Thank you, JK Rowling.
 Great product!  Huge Harry Potter fans!
 The quest is finally complete. Having just finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I can say that if nothing else, I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>Did things go exactly as I expected them to go or even the way that I truly wanted to go? In some cases yes and in others no, but that's why we read, right? J.K. Rowling has done a very nice job wrapping up loose ends and explaining the previously unexplained in this culmination of her much heralded series.<br/><br/>Of all of the books, this one is by far the most complete; leaving the reader feeling sad over the fact that there are no more Potter books to come, but at least a little fulfilled and with a lot less questions than before. Yes, there are tear-jerker moments in the book and things that Harry and his friends could have done much quicker if only they would use their brains. But, overall it is a grand story and the pacing from beginning to end is fairly fast and furious.<br/><br/>I give Rowling an A+ on her efforts and look forward to whatever worlds she decides to take us to next.
 I enjoyed reading all of her books. There are so many twists and turns.  I would suggest all her books for people that enjoy great wrritting.
 Each time I pick up a new Harry Potter book, I am barely able to put it down.  The same rings true for almost anyone I've met that took the time to sit down and read these fine books.  There are the cynics, but they are the people that haven't read the books, or have only seen the movies. The books are 1000 times better than the movies!!!  Read the book first!  Another great thing about Harry Potter?  It gets kids reading.
 I was a little late to the Harry Potter craze having seen the first movie only. However, I heard everyone say the books were better than the movies, so I embarked on reading the series. The first one I liked, but it was a lot of setting up the story. This book already had the background done, and so u were able to immerse yourself in the world. For a children's book, it was surprising how many times I was on the edge of my seat with fear, or waiting with abated breath for the danger to be over or to see what would happen next.  I thought this book was truly amazing.
 I'm so excited to reread the Harry Potter Series. I've always had a fondness for used books, and this set is perfect! The books are in great condition and were accurately described.
 Great boxed set.
 Doesn’t seem to provide any tips on actually becoming a wizard so was a bit disappointed. Other than that everything was as expected.
 Beautifully crafted tale that is better with every read. Everyone should read this series. The only disappointment is getting to the last page and craving more...
 My husband absolutely loves his book set. Cayman great package in perfect condition would purchase again if I needed.
 I have been waiting YEARS for this book to come out!  I did nothing but read from the moment it came until I finished it, and I must say it was indeed a great book.  The thing I love about the harry potter books, is that you can read and read and read for hundreds of pages and not get sick of it.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the afterword-it was a little too "happily ever after" for me....it could have ended in dumbledore's office and left me the happiest reader in the world.<br/><br/>One more quick aspect, I love taking books and relating them to christian history.  Harry Potter is definitely one of the best comparisons I have been able to make.  This book is right up there with the Narnia series and LOTR.
 I used to own all the Harry Potter books in paperback and they began to fall apart, so when I noticed that I could buy the 7-book hardcover box set I went ahead and bought it. I can't complain for the price, it's cheaper than buying everything separate and I get it all in a decent box to carry around the house if I need to move it. The books are the same hardcover books you would find in stores, about average quality so as long as you don't abuse them they should last. The box however is cheap. It's nothing but cardboard with a plastic clasp. I didn't care much for the box itself and I could see the appeal in children (It comes with stickers and a spot for your name), but it's not high quality by any means. If you are like me and just wanted to buy all the books, this would be perfect for you.
 Great story, beautifully written...As enjoyable to read today as it was when it first came out, but with the added bonus that you now you can binge read!
 It's exactly what I wanted, and I've been dying to buy this set, the illustrations are my favorite and I didn't think finding this set was possible. I'm beyond happy!
 Very, very happy with my order. Actually got hardcover when I was expecting all paperback. I would definitely order again. I might do it soon. Thanks. My family will get a lot of enjoyment from these.
 I got  it for my grand daughter.I hope she likes the books.
 I recently bought the latest Harry Potter book because I was in a bookstore at midnight with a sister who buys each one as it comes out. Though I've seen the movies, I have only read the first book. When I saw the great price on Amazon for a set of books 1 through 5, I got them. Now I can read each one and lead up to the latest.<br/><br/>They arrived quickly, they were all there, they were all new. That's as good as it gets and I'm very satisfied.
 I love this series I've read it many times and rereading it is so much easier when I can go from my phone to my work computer to my kindle from anywhere I may be.
 So easy to have all the books in one file, meant I could take it with me everywhere without having to carry all the books! Good quality.
 This is amazing for any one who loves Harry Potter.
 This is one of my favorites in the series.
 My daughter loves it!!!
 Arrived on time, good quality!
 In todays fast paced world of video games, cartoons and television it was refreshing to read such a delightful Children's book.  I love Fantasy works by many great authors and as I read the second of the Harry Potter books I  again found myself slipping into his world.  Ms. Rowling has created  delightful characters, enough plot for the audience the book was intended  for (young readers) and great lessons on how to remain calm, use good  judgement and to believe in one's self.  Parents should not worry that  their child is going to jump out of a window on a broomstick (unless you  yourself was the child that played Superman from the roof as a kid)  Parents read the book with your child and live the adventure with them.  Very well written, a great beginning to an old art...reading for enjoyment  as a child.
 I believe it was my favorite of all seven books.<br/><br/>It was terribly, terribly sad in many ways, with so many good characters, some of whom I obviously REALLY loved, dying. But I think the balance was good. She didn't kill so many characters that it felt gratuitous, but she killed enough characters, well loved and often important characters, so that it wasn't trite. After all, they are fighting a war. If no one but "red-shirts" died, it would have seemed stupid and false.<br/><br/>And though it shocked and saddened me at the time, I was also glad that not every death was the result of some amazing act of heroism or imprisonment by "the enemy" and such. As in real life war, characters die just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with no rhyme or reason or ability to say "yes, but they died fighting" or "they died for what they believe in". Some times there's nothing to comfort yourself with.<br/><br/>My favorite things about this book was the fact that it felt more 3-dimensional to me. We've always know, or have learned a decent amount about some characters' motives, like Harry and Voldemort. But other characters have been very flat - divided into good or evil as though those things exist in a vacuum. In this book, she really tells us more about a number of the characters. She explores the fact that no one is all good or all bad, and that sometimes our perception of people is drastically mistaken, both for better and for worse, because we don't know how they arrived at the place they are at the time we come to know them. We realize - if we had been faced with similar situations as they had been, how differently would we ourselves have been able to act? The world and characters just seem some much more real now that we can see their secret redemptions, as well as their unsuspected flaws.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the way she dealt with destroying the Horcruxes. Not so much the method as the.... "circumstances", I guess would be the best way to say it without giving too much away. Again, I thought it resonated perfectly with the theme of the book about being careful to judge things in black and white terms - good versus evil, hero versus sidekick, teamwork versus going it alone, etc.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful, if bittersweet ending to a wonderful series of books.
 was not as described. did not come in the collectors case.
 Arrived perfectly
 I bought this set for my 23 year old for her birthday. Two of our other children enticed her into reading Harry Potter. She really wanted the set and so the entire family pitched in to get it for her. She loved it. She was so excited. I have read the Harry Potter series myself except for number seven, which I am going to do soon. The entire series deserves a five star rating. Ordering from Amazon was easy, fast and efficient. The books were shipped promptly and were everything Amazon said they would be. I love ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future.
 It took me a while to get into the whole Harry Potter thing. As an adult, I figured it was just another kid fad that would pass. Then last Christmas, my mom borrowed the first three Harry Potter books from my cousin. I picked up the first one and began reading out of boredom rather than intrigue. I was immediately hooked. I literally could not put these books down! I read all four in a week and a half and am anxiously awaiting the fifth. I rented the dvd when it came out, and it was good, but they left so much out that I was nonetheless disappointed. Anyone who liked the movie should definitely read the books. I would recommend this series to everyone, especially the first and fourth books, which were my favorites.
 This is the second book in the Harry Potter series. I just love the world that J.K. Rowling has created for this series. I love the characters and the things that she puts them through. The way that she has set up the series with each book being a different school year. I love that you can grow up with the characters. In this book, Harry Potter is in his second year at Hogwarts and he finds that he has the ability to talk to snakes (due to a connection with Voldemort). In this book Harry Potter and his friends must figure out who or what is petrifying all of the students one by one. In the end he must save Ron's little sister Ginny from the Basilisk, and Tom Riddle. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who read the first Harry Potter book and who likes witches, wizards and magic in their stories.
 Well. for me the book should have ended in the Forbidden Forest.  But it goes on.  Why, I don't know because the book rather goes down hill from there.  it is worth the purchase...and those of us at my workplace that read the book, can't believe it continued after That point.  we have our pet theories on why she had it continue on past that.<br/><br/>Basicly, its a 3 hour book. start to finish un interupted all those pages.  one of the others made it in 5 hours. so your actual reading time may vary.<br/><br/>it was certianly more action packed then any other book, explained very little and left you wondering, "okay I've read 7 books and I STILL have no idea why we're all in love with them" and then your thought goes to "I wonder how they'll screen write this book to movie"
 The pictures are just as great as the first book 😍
 This by far was the best book of the Harry Potter series.  Everything is finally tied together in Book 7, and it was a great finish to a wonderfully detailed story line.<br/><br/>For those of you who are unsure of having your children read these books, do not be put off by the "magic".  The cold hard truth is that there really is a battle of good and evil in the world, and good always wins. As with anything you need to talk to your child and explain the difference between fantasy and reality.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a character who stands up for what he believes in, shows loyalty to those he loves, and teaches readers about strength and courage and integrity.  There are alot of great lines that Dumbledore has said, the general idea of which is that love is the greatest force in the world.<br/><br/>Great lessons for every age!
 I loved this.  I usually read romance books but tried and really enjoyed it<br/>  I read it at the gym while working out
 J.K. Rowling continues with this follow-up and its more of the same: rich in story, character and setting, Chamber of Secrets sizzles. The Harry Potter world feels real...almost. I have only a few concerns that stop me from giving it the famed five stars. As in The Sorcerer's Stone, Rowling's world goes to far at times and then not far enough depending on where she wants to go with the story ,for example, magic can repair broken bones and not a broken brooms. And of course there's the flying car and angry tree at the beginning, a lot of fun, but I don't know whether to be scared or thrilled...probably both. Is Harry really ever in any danger? I mean, after all he is the chosen one isn't he?<br/><br/>I will say that the movies do the novels absolutely no justice. The movies often seem like only excerpts from these vividly told stories.<br/><br/>John Darryl Winston
 The books themselves are amazing, but it was the condition I got the box set in that warrants not giving 5 stars. The back corner of the box set itself was crushed inwards and there was also a small rip on the back of the box. As for the books themselves, the pages are okay, but there are small spots on the binding. Unfortunately, I looks like it was handled quite carelessly. They are a good read though, and I can't bring myself to put them down. That's the only reason I didn't want to return it. If you want a pretty and brand new box set, just be careful because mine was not shipped with care.
 The book arrived in excellent condition. As a Harry Potter fan this book is a great addition to my collection of books.
 I am the type of person that was skeptical about Harry Potter... maybe because I loved the Narnia saga and thought nothing could be as good as that... or maybe I was simply too old for such magical childrens stuff. So it took me some time till I saw a couple of movies and still didn't fall in love with Harry.<br/>But it was when I read Harry Potter that I really became trapped in the story. I read one book after the other addict style, I saw the movies in between, and even bought a Ministry of Magic t-shirt.<br/>The books are fantastic! The Prisoner of Askaban is my favourite. And this boxed set is top! I enjoy reading paperbacks too because they don't weigh in the hands and you can read them lying, sitting, or standing in the train...<br/>If you are a kid, almost 40 like me, or even 60 give yourself the chance to enjoy these books as much as I did!
 I would recommend this to any age group. Names are difficult to pronounce if you're not a proficient reader.  I look forward to the next one
 What is there to say that hasn't already been said?  J.K. Rowling has created a masterful series with the 'Harry Potter' saga, and has given it a glorious and befitting ending.  The very first wonder and amazement that took hold of readers when they read the first book has continued throughout; the world that Rowling created was just as important as the characters who populated it, as all the stories and details come full circle in the end.<br/><br/>At the end of the sixth book, many were left wondering how everything would be resolved in book seven.  Was Severus Snape, the man who just killed the beloved Albus Dumbledore, the pure villain Harry believed him to be, or was it just possible that there was more to his story?  As the seventh story unfolds, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hunt for the horcruxes that are the key to Voldemort's downfall, while the Dark Lord is busy taking over, in an all too real and reminiscent way.  The wizarding world is at war, and anyone who is bold enough to stand against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters must pay with their life.<br/><br/>It should go without saying, but this is a fitting end to Harry's story, and perhaps the best one in the series.  While the story sags a little in the middle under the weight of Harry's frustration, it begins and ends with a bang that keeps readers hooked.  In the other books, the necessary deaths were shocking and difficult to read; the sheer number and frequency of the necessary deaths in "Deathly Hallows" is just as shocking and perhaps even more numbing.  What a marvelous world that Rowling has created for us muggles to visit again and again, even if we know how things will work out in the end.
 There's really nothing to dislike about Harry potter books. It's a great story with great characters . I've read the whole series five times.
 As much as I love Harry Potter books, it was a tad bit of a disappointment.  There were parts of the book that I almost snoozed, others where I couldn't care if Harry dies or not because he was making me mad.  Well, I guess that was the point of it? He's human? He's still a kid? OK, I'm a parent...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun read and yes, you will want to know what happens to Harry and friends! I don't want to give up any spoilers for those who still want to read it and don't know the ending.
 It took me a while to read the entire series. It was worthwhile to invest the time it took. Highly recommended.
 Allow me to begin by saying I refuse to spoil any part of any of these books for anyone for any reason.  If you haven't read the books, stop here, buy them, read them, return...<br/><br/>That being said, instead of detailing the book (as I normally would in a review) I'll recount my own experience:<br/><br/>I pre-ordered this book when it first became available to do so.  At that time, I had not read any of the books, but had seen the first four movies based upon the books.  I promptly purchased the 6 books which precede the Deathly Hallows and read them.. the Order of the Phoenix I read three times, the Half Blood Prince I read twice and completed my second read one week prior to the release of the Deathly Hallows.  I was intent on reading the series and this final book before anyone could spoil the ending for me.  You see, I had already learned the fate of ... some of the characters involved in OOP and HBP, because there are people in this world who live off of the pleasure of ruining things for other people.  I was determined to read the series and this final book before some loud mouth jerk could ruin it for me.  I succeeded.<br/><br/>With one week to go for the book release I began thinking that perhaps all these questions swelling inside of me - is Snape friend or foe?  where are the horcruxes?  will Harry live? - and so many other questions did not need answering.  The magic of this series was in bringing out the discussion, the last few months (well over a year, actually) have had fans on the edges of their collective seats, casting about all kinds of theory and conjecture, ideas born of the tiniest details about mundance things.  The magic - the true magic of it all - was in bringing together generations of readers in discussion about one of our era's literary masterworks.<br/><br/>One week to go to get the book, and I was telling myself that I'd rather not read it, that I'd rather put it neatly on a shelf, so that no matter what happens to who, the magic would always live on, the dicussions would never end, the theories and conjectures would continue to bind readers together.  A very noble, yet unrealistic notion, I agree.  I had my fears that certain characters would die, and in not reading this book, I theorized that they would live forever if I never read about their deaths.<br/><br/>The evening prior to the book's release, my daughter attended a Potter party at a Barnes &amp; Noble book store.  She is not a fan - she likes the movies, but she's not a fan of science fiction or fantasy, and has refused to read the books.  Okay.  She's entitled to her tastes.  But she attended the party because some of her friends are Potter fans.  I sat home, jealous that I wasn't a teenager and therefore way too old to attend a Potter party.  I should have gone, I regret not going - the last of the Potter hooplas, the last Hallow's Ball.  At any rate, my daughter brought home a wand and some Potter glow-in-the-dark eye glasses for me. I would like to have gone, but how sad is it to see a 40-something woman dressed as a witch for a Potter party?  Perhaps not sad at all, but I feared being the oldest witch at the party...<br/><br/>At midnight, I leaped from my seat and counted down the 60 seconds to the 12:01am mark of release of the book.  My husband, who is use to my insane moments such as this, simply looked at me and nodded off.<br/><br/>The next day - delivery day! - I cleaned every square inch of my house waiting for the UPS delivery van to pull up and bring me my book.  I started cleaning at 8am... the book arrived at 4pm.  A full day of scrubbing everything around me in a vain attempt to make the time go faster so that the book would finally arrive.  I knew that once the book did arrive, nothing would get done.<br/><br/>I had two hours to read the opening chapters of the book, because we had planned to make an excursion to a drive-in movie theater that evening to see the Order of the Phoenix movie.  I very reluctantly put the precious book down for the evening.<br/><br/>Sunday, July 22nd:  the day I was able to spend every waking hour with Harry Potter and Co.  I gathered the book, a bottle of water, a blanket and pillow, and headed out to my backyard where I have a hammock which hangs by a stream, overlooking a deep patch of woods.  My own Forbidden Forest, of sorts.<br/><br/>It is now Tuesday afternoon, and the book is completed.  I spent some time re-reading chapters before completing the book, just to make sure I had fully absorbed everything.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful book, it answers just about everything you'd want answered.  There are some questions which are left open, and perhaps JKR did this to keep alive the discussions, or perhaps these questions are answered already (and the books need to be re-read).  But mostly everything you'd want answered is indeed answered, albeit some things are way off from what many of us believed.  Some, however, are right on.  I recall several times yelling outloud, "I knew it!"  There were MANY times when I sat here with a hand over my mouth, in stunned awe at what I was reading.  And still, there were plenty of times I burst out crying.<br/><br/>No disappointment in the way this book was written, the way the whole story comes to its fruition, or the way the characters who survive, survive.  And that little "crack" that JKR says she slipped in there incase she wanted to return to the 'wizarding world?'  Yes, I even liked that (I don't normally).  It works.  It all works.  It all makes perfect sense, and it could not have ended any other way.<br/><br/>Thank you - thank you - thank you - JKR.  Thank you for such a wonderful fantasy, a wonderful world and this awesome, incredible boy, Harry Potter.  Thank you.
 Good read!  I've watched the movies but first time to read the book.  The book has much more background than the movies!
 A little slow at the begging but at the end it turned out to be very clever and surprising. I really liked it!
 Jim kay did it again with amazing illustrations. He really catches the feel of the book and i love his renditions of the characters.  I like the way that some chapters are white text on black pages.  It really brings a irienrss to the spooky parts of the book.  I can only imagine what it would be like to read these stories for the first time with these illustrations; it would be so much more engaging and suck me in even more than the amazing story did.
 So much fun to reread this series again. I love that the illustrations are from the original books. Having all the books together as one is great for binge reading!!
 If you're the emotional type the first 80 pages will have you tears, there is death, not all of it human, but you feel the genuine danger, frustration and hopelessness that the characters feel.<br/><br/>Then the books slows to a dead crawl. Rowling separates Harry, Hermoine and Ron (leaving Ginny out of 99% of the book) after an attack at the Weasley's. This seems to trigger a sort of quest sage for the young wizards to find the horcrux's, but alas, no. They stumble around boringly for the first third of the book, arguing and snipping, falling into traps and barely doing anything other than being foolish and getting on each others (and our) nerves.<br/><br/>Reading the books you'll notice that a battle between Harry and Ron / Ron and Hermoine is at the center of every book. This is partially because Ron and Hermoine are in love and to annoying to admit it to each other, partially because Ron is jealous of Harry -- although wasn't he supposed to have gotten over that in book 4? No. Oh well. In this case the kids take turns wearing a horcrux that they don't have the means to destroy, but it, in turn, makes the wearer mean and paranoid.<br/><br/>When the three finally unite in peace and set out to work the book finally finds it's pacing and we're off!<br/><br/>Rowling digs deep into Orwellian territory here as Voltamort and his Death Eaters set out to control the ministry and with the help of one Umbridge of the pink persuasion, set the stage for what could become a Mudblood holocaust. Ever vigilant harry has a rare moment as a powerful wizard when he stages a off-the-cuff breakout for those accused of being muggle-born.<br/><br/>When the book picks up its ground it's following a daring escape and a death that finally knocks Harry into movement. But there's some deep, dark secrets to find out first. Mostly that Dumbledore isn't the saint Harry thought, nor is he the evil Rita Skeeter makes him out to be, turns out, he's just as flawed as everyone.<br/><br/>The revelation fans have been waiting for, Snapes true story, is at the end of the book, just before the final confrontation with Voltemort. If you've been reading carefully, especially the end of Half Blood Prince, and make note of the very, very careful dialogue Snape uses you can guess where this is going, although some things about Snapss childhood are revealed you couldn't guess.<br/><br/>The finally is well, final.<br/><br/>Don't hope for an epic duel between the Dark Lord and Harry, it does come. As usual, it's not about power or skill, it's about who Harry is and how badly Votamort has screwed up.<br/><br/>Over all Rowling ties things up in another true page turner, including a "19 years later" epilogue where you learn the names of all the kids they are going to have. Another "after volty" chapter however would have been nice to tie up the present. After a moment with Dudly in the beginning of the book, you might miss that there's nothing else about the Durselys at the end. There's no doubt about it, this is not Lord of the Rings, there's no 180 page journey back after the finale, however 20 or so pages dealing with the repercussions of the final battle would have been more satisfying. After seven books, fans deserved a little more at the end.
 Following are some of the numerous comments on this book that I find truly accurate about this final and truly fantastic story by Rowling.  You'll laugh, cry (both from sadness and from joy) and in general be COMPLETELY surprised by this final book ...a real masterpiece of story telling that you'll never forget .... I have followed these books for the last 10 years and marveled at their popularity ... there is a reason for that .... excellent storytelling .... at 55 this book is one of the best birthday presents I have ever had ...<br/><br/>The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise.<br/><br/>I am going to terribly miss these characters. Over the years, they have become much like my favorite comfortable blanket. I hope that in the future, Ms. Rowling might consider revisiting the world of Hogwarts and some of these beloved witches and wizards. But even if she does not, I hope Ms. Rowling continues to write. Such wonderful talent should never go unused! Thank you, JKR, for years of incredibly unique and smartly written entertainment. I am now going back to the beginning, and reading them all in order. I'm just not ready to let go quite yet. ; )<br/><br/>A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. --Daphne Durham
 this was a present and the person loved it
 I was seriously excited about the last and final chapter of the Harry Potter Saga. When I recieved the book, I dove right in and didn't stop until I had finished. At the end of the book, I had a sense of completion and closure, but also a small sense of disappointment.<br/><br/>There seems to be one thing about the story that made me sad. I see that J.K. made the story line end in the way that we would expect. I didn't want to expect the ending, but I did. This made me slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Also, her writing isn't the best I have ever seen. The reason that the book and the characters and the story are so good is because of the underlying theme and the strength of character.<br/><br/>Although there were some things I didn't like, overall I still loved the entire series and I will probably read them all one more time.<br/><br/>I recommend it for everyone.
 The last Harry Potter was very, very well thoughtout, and I was scared to read it at first in fear that too many people will die who are main characters, and even though people did die, it was very reasonable and I understood it had to be done, though it was saddening. It was complicated but I love the way Harry won victory, and the truth was finally revealed, and all your questions were answered. A great book, and I love how Rowling wrote it. Spellbinding and wonderful. Rowling has such a big imagination that you will come to admire in all Harry Potter books, but especially in this one. To me, this was my favorite Harry Potter book and I felt like hugging it after reading it. A long but worhtwhile read! Words can't express my admiration for Rowling! I LOVE HARRY POTTER!
 I am lucky, i don't  have missing pages. It arrived quickly
 I bought the set as a birthday present for my mom and she absolutely loved them. They also arrived earlier than I expected.
 This review is intended to help those who have not read many of the HP books, and want to know if the series as a whole is worth it, or for those who enjoy a little stats in their reading :)<br/><br/>Ok, right off the bat, I bought all of these books separately, not as the box set. However, the price for all 7 paperbacks in this set is well worth it, so I'm not going to worry about the cardboard packaging that some are complaining about. The entire series for 50 bucks is a steal. Secondly, I have not personally read all 7 books, only the first 3, yet are completely enthralled with them already. And you don't need me to tell you how fun the books are, there's thousands of reviews for each book to peruse. What I'd like to do with this review is give a little glimpse into how other readers from forums across the internet rate the HP books from Best to Least Best ;) I was pleasantly surprised to find that readers enjoy the series as a whole, it doesn't peter out or lose it's steam after the first couple books. Quite the opposite, actually!<br/><br/>I tabulated ratings from readers who listed the books in order of preference, giving their favorite 7 points, their second favorite 6 points, etc., with the last getting one point. I then counted up the points for each book to come up with an average rating for each.<br/><br/>Here are the ratings that I averaged from worst to best:<br/><br/>7. Sorcerer's Stone  Yr. 1  (2.84)<br/>6. Chamber of Secrets  Yr. 2  (3.15)<br/>5. Goblet of Fire  Yr. 4  (3.74)<br/>4. Half-Blood Prince  Yr. 6  (4.00)<br/>3. Prisoner of Azkaban  Yr. 3  (4.35)<br/>2. Order of the Phoenix  Yr. 5  (4.39)<br/>1. Deathly Hallows  Yr. 7  (5.52)<br/><br/>Notes: All books were listed as someone's LEAST favorite at least once.<br/>All books EXCEPT Sorcerer's Stone (7) were listed as someone's MOST favorite at least once.<br/>Prisoner of Azkaban (3) and Order of the Phoenix (2) are practically tied for 2nd place, differing by only one point in a hundred!<br/>Sorcerer's Stone (7) was picked LEAST favorite by more voters than any other book.<br/>Deathly Hallows (1) and Prisoner of Azkaban (3) tied as MOST favorite by the same number of voters.<br/>Deathly Hallows (1) and Order of the Phoenix (2) tied as 2nd MOST favorite by the same number of voters.<br/><br/>The consensus seems to be that the first 2 books, while good, are the weakest of the series, with books 3-6 all being a general step up in quality, while the clear favorite of the series is book 7, the largest and concluding volume. Statistically, this series only gets better as it goes (in a general sense), and is NOT a series that fails to live up to expectations. I can vouch myself for the fun, if light, introduction to the series in the first 2 books, and the beginning of darker undertones in book 3. I can personally say that I am hooked on this series and look forward to finishing the last 4 volumes in the near future.<br/><br/>I hope this review has been helpful, or at the very least interesting in it's approach to reviewing a series that's already been praised more than any other in recent memory that I can think of. Highly recommended!!
 The last Harry Potter is in many ways the best of the lot, showing what a great craftsman Rowling is. She has drawn together all the threads of the various subplots of the prior six books in a graceful, never forced way. The epilogue feels a bit much, unfortunately, and it is not of the same caliber as the prior pages, but this is a small quibble. Overall, I'd recommend it highly. I had to ration my reading to 100 pages a day, otherwise, I would have read it straight through in one sitting - rather like eating a whole box of Godiva chocialtes in one sitting. Savor this book, and enjoy wondering what Rowling will write next!
 One of the great aspects of the first few Harry Potter books is that they could be shared by both children and adults but on different levels.  Since book 5, this had ceased to be true.  The latest and final book, The Deathly Hallows has more violence than a season of the Soprano's. Increased violence also seemed to have made the humor that we have grown to love, absent which was sad because it was an integral part of the success of the books.<br/><br/>Who among us doesn't feel a sense of loss that the last book has been written?  I sure do but with the exception of Book 5, this was the toughest one to get through.  Yes, there were parts that kept me up hours past bedtime but there were also parts that were a chore to read.  I have no problem with the long books but I didn't find it necessary to say what has already been said a thousand time over.  As a whole, Harry Potter has made an unprecedented positive impact on the publishing industry and in our hearts.  As many, I love Harry Potter but I have to be truthful - just swallowed some Veriserum (sic)and state that this was not quite the experience I wanted from the last HP book.  Yes, it was full of adventure, and a few satisfying conclusions but there was also something lacking.  Without including spoilers, I won't go into specifics but it is quite a story and if you've been through the journey thus far, there is no way you won't travel down the last road in the realm of HP.  Goodbye to the unparalleled Harry Potter series.  We won't forget time well spent.
 So beautifully illustrated, worth every penny.
 I was really excited about this set as I had books 1-6 in paperback and wanted to have the whole set in hardcover. True, this set did wind up cheaper than buying the books seperately, but I am still VERY disappointed. I was not expecting some magestic hardwood trunk, but at the very least I expected sturdy cardboard or paperboard, well covered with some form of covering to make it LOOK like a trunk. The corners of this "trunk" look like your average file box, and they are already tearing. All I've done is take the plastic off the books! Seriously, people who have purchased this set deserve an apology, and a sturdy replacement box, free of charge. Just buy the books by themselves, build your own box, (or put all your books in a file box and let a 5 year old "decorate" it for you and you'll have something compareable to this set.)
 Absolutely loved it!
 Read this book because it was on a list of books you should read to make you a more well rounded person. Was hesitant to do even with all the hoopla around thes books because I don't like fantasy books and although I know adults read them but there primarily geared towards kids. My daughter gobbled them up.<br/>Anyway really a good book plus when you were reading it you didn't feel you were read a kid's book. Excellent story and character development. If your kids haven't read this book, I would recommend they do because Harry stands up to two bullies in a nonviolent manner and triumphs which would be a good message for kids to hear.
 I cannot say enough about this series.  I am 50 years old, have always been extremely into children's literature- most of the children in my life receive classics from me for birthdays and holidays.  The Harry Potter series is one of the best I have read.  Each book is special in its own way and each allows us to know the characters a little better.<br/><br/>Every parent should be reading through this series with their pre-teens and teens.  They are an absolute delight that every child should experience!  Wonderful!!!
 Out of my WHOLE book collection (over 175 books) Harry Potter is the ONLY series I have finished all the books.  This series is my favorite series of all!!!!<br/>  This is my ranking of the series:<br/>  1. Prisoner of Azkaban<br/>  2. Half-Blood Prince<br/>  3. Order of the Phoenix<br/>  4. Goblet of Fire<br/>  5. Sorcerer's Stone<br/>  6. Chamber of Secrets<br/> Even though some of the books are in low spots they are still VERY GOOD!!! You can tell ALL of these books are good because all of the movies follow them so well because if they didn't they would get bashed.  I give this whole series 5 stars out of 5.<br/>  Upcoming Harry Potter<br/> 1. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix movie (July 11)<br/> 2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Final Book (July 21)
 Finally reading the books after being a hp fan for over a decade. Thank you for writing such wonderful books JK Rowling!
 I got my book on the release date (Sat. 7/21/07), and could not WAIT to delve in. However, being it was my husband's birthday and we had dinner reservations, I could not begin as soon as I had wished!<br/><br/>It took me a total of 12 hours to read the entire book between Saturday 7/21 &amp; Sunday 7/22 - I have not read that fast since High School (mind you, I got up to use the facilities, stretch, and enliven my numb bum every few hours!) and have not enjoyed a book so much as the other 6 HP books.<br/><br/>If you are an adult that thinks Harry Potter is silly, boring, not your thing, a waste of time - THINK AGAIN! I am 38 years old and do NOT have any children. I did not start reading the HP books until I found #6 in the bargain bin at the grocery store while on vacation. As soon as I got home from vacation, I read the other 5 volumes and then re-read #6. I then put myself on the pre-order list for #7.<br/><br/>Book #7 is the coup de gras - AMAZING!! Others say there's something missing, or she didn't keep her word (about revealing things she promised to from the other books) - BUT I DISAGREE TOTALLY.<br/><br/>From the first page until the last page of the Epilogue I could NOT put it down. The twists, the turns, the decisions, the emotions, the losses, the gains, the friends, the enemies. WHEW!! It still confounds me how JKR transmuted all those things from the pages to me - I actually felt all of it in my own body and mind like I was actually looking thru a window witnessing the environment first hand.<br/><br/>Yes, I am sad to see the series come to an end.<br/><br/>No, I will NOT beg for more - well, OK, I DO hope JKR publishes a companion book (like a dictionary) of spells, terminology, creatures (with pics I hope!), etc.<br/><br/>I, as a muggle, can't seem to remember when, where, and which page I read about certain charms, etc. I think a companion book to the series would be most celebrated and invited.<br/><br/>To all nay-sayers I offer this tidbit of advice: Love this series and finale for what JKR gave us. Her creativity and imagination brought me into a world I could have never fathomed. What a wonderful gift - to bestow someone with their imagination again!<br/><br/>Long live JKR and Harry Potter!
 As usual, JK Rowling has outdone herself. To be honest, I miss the silliness of the first books (Howlers, Rembralls, etc), but the way she ties everything together is amazing. It makes sense that the books get darker and more serious as Harry gets older, and now that he's an adult, the 7th book is serious, but still with great imagination. She also shows how life really is, even in this fantasy world, there are good people gone bad, and bad people who do good things. It can't be read without reading the first six, but anyone who hasn't read them should read them just to read Deathly Hallows.
 Very nice set with a very nice Box it comes in
 I really like this book and all the action. Personally since I'm only a kid,there are some words i don't understand. But everything else is great. Thank you J.K Rowling fo making these books that inspire us.
 I’m late to the Harry Potter party but so glad I joined in. These books are fantastic. I didn’t expect any of the twists and turns. Can’t wait to read the next one!
 I'd been wanting a U.K. version of the Harry Potter series so that I could do a bit of a comparison of the vocabulary differences between the U.S. and British version.  The books and font size was quite a bit smaller than the American version, but it was easy to read.  The books came in a cardboard case that was damaged by whomever sent it...looked as if someone had dropped it before packing it in the mailing box.  One side of the case was torn open, which limits its functionality as a storage container.  This is why I knocked a star off my rating.  For what I paid, the storage container should have been intact.  Plan to repair it with book binding tape rather than pitch it, which was my initial response to its condition.  Other than that, I am pleased with the product.
 OMG I love Harry Potter, and this book is so amazing, as are all the books. I heart JK Rowling, woman genius.
 Second year of Hogwarts, and we are learning more and more about Harry's back story. Mrs. Weasley was a standout in this novel for me. Making breakfast for her children, and Harry all while scolding her boys and giving Harry extra helpings was so comical to me. Harry learning he knows Parseltongue was an a-ha moment, and going into the chamber to save Ginny was wondeful. I feel like I should watch the movies after I read each book. I am having so much fun being in Potter world.
 Fantastic book, thumping good read. Deserves 6 stars but I cant give it that. As far as dislikes there are none it's to good and I will recommend it to everyone I meet
 So glad I was able to get this set. I've been wanting to read these books for awhile. Decided to get the whole set because waiting around to buy the next book when I've finished the previous one just sucks. I'm very pleased with the condition. There corner of the box that the books sit in is slightly smooshed, like it was pressed against something too hard or for too long in the warehouse. It surely didn't happen during shipping since it was packaged in a large box and surrounded by bubble stuff. Not too worried about it. It's cardboard, not much can be done about it. Over all though, this is a great product. Love the design on the outside of the box and on the books. Now as for the books..well we all know they're amazing, intriguing, just overwhelmingly great.. READ 'EM. Get this set. Totes worth it.
 Easy read! Awesome story! I love Harry Potter books! Can’t wait to read the next one! Hagrid is my favorite character.
 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" - Book - Fantasy Epic<br/><br/>Final Grade: 9.75/10<br/><br/>Plot: 9.25/10<br/><br/> Ladies and Gentlemen, the long awaited and vastly and incredibly marketed seventh book of the Harry Potter series is here.  And boy, does J.K know how to make an entrance.  As veterans of the series can attest, this book series has been one in which the reader grows up with Harry.  The first book may have been a mostly light-hearted tale with a taste of good verses evil in its pages, but each book progressively got darker, more complex, and more adult.  The child reading book 1 will inevitably not be the same child by book 7.  Just like real life, we come to find out that not everything is perfect.  Not everything is happy.  People die.  Accidents happen.  Friendships are tested, and people you think the world of aren't always as saintly as we believe them to be.  For all the magic of the world of Harry Potter, it is ultimately the very real emotions and relationships and characters that make this such an incredible book series.<br/><br/>(...)<br/><br/> There are some hiccups along the way, as some of the narrative leaves some plot points unanswered, or occasionally even worse, underwhelmingly answered.  The other major complaints, that of the high, and as some have said, unnecessary, body-count and the very gloomy attitude of the middle chapters are all still very appropriate for the subject matter, that of a very destructive, very real war.<br/> But other than those little hiccups, the plot smoothly accomplishes what it meant to do, and builds to a climax that is as massive and awe-inspiring as any I have ever read.  The book series may be over, but it's magic is the kind that lasts long afterward.  This is one of those few that demand to be read over and over again.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10<br/><br/> There isn't a single character, aside from perhaps a few of the Death Eaters that don't have very deep and complicated psychology and emotion. They could all be living breathing people.  From the very complicated characters of Harry, Snape and Voldermort, to further breaking down the barriers of what we think we know about Dumbledore, Kreatcher and so many more, everyone is more than the mere cardboard cutouts they might have appeared to be at times in book 1.<br/><br/>Creativity: 10/10<br/><br/> I consider myself a rather creative individual, but Rowling must have an imagination the size and bounds of which I could only guess at.  How she could not only create one of the most colorful and dazzling, wild and wacky, worlds ever to exist in fiction, but then to give it a scope, breadth and depth that equals the best of any genre is truly an astounding feat.<br/><br/>Writing Style: 10/10<br/><br/> Rowling's style has grown with the author and what started out distinct and unique has only gotten more so.  While her writing is imminently readable and simple, it also remains entirely her own.  Any given paragraph could be taken out of context and still be identifiable as her style.  And it's a style that I love to come back to.<br/><br/>Writing Skill: 9.50/10<br/><br/> As her style has matured, so has her skill in weaving a tale.  As is usual with most book series, the first book is the least skilfully made, eventually ending up a very skillful finishing book.  The fact that she leaves some plot threads dangling after promising their return is a bit unpleasant, but it is hardly anything to mar the rest of the very enjoyable book, in which she has certainly matured her skill to a high degree.<br/><br/>The Magic Touch:<br/><br/> While we see and become involved in what may be initially interpreted as as simple battle of Good verses Evil, we eventually see the complexity and hazy gray that real life so often thrusts our way.  The battle between Good and Evil is still there, and still the focus of everything we've come to know, and Love and Hate are still the monumental center points of conflict, but we see the humanity in the most vile characters, as well as the kindest.  Book 7 is a much darker book, a much scarier book and a much more mature book than any of the others.  Yet it is just as much more magical, uplifting and insightful for all of that.  There is a magic in this story that is found in the depths of every heart, and that is why I believe this story will stand the test of time as one of the truly great epic fantasies anyone has ever written.<br/><br/>Repeat of Final Grade: 9.75/10
 The set came just as described, I love it.
 Harry Potter's story has followed me since they first hit stores. I can honestly say, for me and for many of my friends, this is a life-changing story. I wouldn't have the friends I do without the help of the young wizard. So, I owe a lot to this series. I've bought it in American Paperback, American Hardback, the new British paperback, and audiobook. Now, finally, I can read it on my kindle. I picked this up specifically because I was tired of mutilating my copies every time I read them (I like re-reading them as often as I can). This version is great because it's all in one file. You can pick which book you want to read, or you can read the story continuously in one long go. Plus, you get the artwork of the American versions of the book as well as the beautiful new kindle covers. I missed the sale all of the other reviewers are talking about, unfortunately, but I still think the price is worth it. It's cheaper than buying all of the books individually and if you love the story or if you've never read it before, this is a great collection to have.
 Getting exactly what you expect. Books were new and unopened and box to protect in transit.
 It was just what we expected!
 Great to reread the entire Harry Potter series after so many years! Very handy to buy the set for my Kindle and just read one after the next over the last 3 months.
 Somewhere around 10-13 years ago, my younger sister received Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for her birthday. I had never heard of it. She got through the first 2 chapters and never picked up the book again. I am much more of a reader than she is, so I decided to read the first few chapters to see what it was all about. From that moment I was hooked! Never has a book or series held me captive like this one. I could not wait for subsequent titles to be released, I read and re-read all of them. Well, except for Deathly Hallows. I did not want the story to end, so I didn't read that one for a couple years after it's release. I all know is that I need more books to come out! I am nearly 30 years old and I am about to re-read the series for the umpteenth time. I have watched most of the movies, but I enjoy the books much more. If you have seen the movies, don't let that deter you from enjoying a great series!
 The final installment of the Harry Potter series has been absolutely the best one of all. I just could not put it down and I had to keep reading it because I needed to know what was coming next. I have not finished it yet because I just don't want it to end. I still have about four chapters plus the epilogue left to read and it has been difficult for me to start again because I know the next time I pick it up it will all be over. For anyone who has not read these books yet I highly recommend them.
 I have followed the Harry Potter series from the very first book and have loved every word that was written.  I just finished the seventh and final book and though it was very good reading, I feel sort of empty inside like I didn't get my complete Harry Potter fix.  There are several characters that aren't mentioned in the very last chapter that it would be nice to know what happened to them.  What is Harry Potter doing?  What is George doing now that Fred is no longer there.  What about Bill and Fleur?  There are several heart wrenching scenes in this book, i.e. Mad Eye, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks and Fred.  The most moving part of the book for me was when Harry walked into the Forbidden Forest to die.  I'm sorry to see the Harry Potter series end because like I said, it just doesn't feel complete.  This is a definite read.
 As a fan of the Harry Potter movies, I am a latecomer to the series of books.  As an adult, I thought that they would do little to hold my interest.  I am the first to admit that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Miss Rowling is a remarkable author.  Reading the books only enhances my experience of watching the movies.  The books fill in much needed details that are missing in the series of movies.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful set at a great price.  Hardbacks are the only way to go.
 This is one of the few books that I've read that is difficult to review with a star rating system. I think I could easily write a five star review, as well as a one star one. Does that make it three stars? I ended up with five stars. First of all, if you are a Harry Potter fan, of course you are going to read it. If you've never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the one to start with. You would be totally lost.<br/><br/>Since it had been a while since I had read the other books, I started by reading them all again. There were so many little details that I think I would have missed had I not done that. As an adult, I enjoyed the books the second time as much as I did the first.<br/><br/>For me, the detractions from this book are plot related, things I didn't like. But, that could be personal preference and have nothing to do with the merits of the book. Nothing can change the magic that J.K. Rowling has created over the years with these books.<br/><br/>This book is violent, in fact, there is way too much death and violence in my opinion for young children. That to me is a shame, they were such an inspiration for children to read. I won't give away any spoilers (which makes the book hard to review!) But, I feel that in most cases the deaths that happened served no purpose in the story, it was like the author was seeing who she could kill off to shock people. Of course, I didn't like the turn the story was taking at the end of the last book when that character was killed. That could prejudice my views on this book.<br/><br/>It is odd to be critical of a book that I've given 5 stars too. I do think it could have been a better book, but it had to end in some manner and I can't take away from it just because I didn't like the twists and turns in the story.<br/><br/>Thanks J.K. Rowling for a wonderful series and for sharing your imagination with us.
 Good reading
 I was interested to read the Harry Potter Series given the incredible hype they had received.  I expected them to be on par with the Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, and The Hobbit, which were the classics I read as a child.  While I enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series - they are fun and a quick read, they really didn't compare to the other books I just mentioned.  The writing is simple but entertaining, and I liked the world she created.  However I have to say that I was disappointed at the end of each book because there always was a quick resolution that lacked a more intricate unfolding. I think its great that kids of all ages are excited to be reading - but if you liked Harry Potter, I STRONGLY suggest trying the other books - which are more sophisticated in plot and message.
 My niece loves the books!!!
 This series is so wonderful that I wanted to listen to Jim Dale narrate the stories all day!<br/>Beautifully done!!
 I don't recommend reading these stories back-to-back (even though that's exactly what I'm doing). The cost of such an adventure is that the first chapter or two or three mostly equates to "previously on Harry Potter".<br/><br/>If you can push through that you get a story as good (probably better) than the first. However, there is also part of it that comes across as formulaic.<br/><br/>It's therein where the real trouble is. I can't decide if it detracts or helps, especially given that familiarity might be worthwhile for a younger audience.<br/><br/>I found myself able to forgive this because book 2 tale also begins to introduce much greater violence and romance when compared to the first. This reaches a crescendo of sorts at the end, and it was a pleasant surprise. That is, seeing an author that's not only growing her characters in a mature way, but the story itself (not just the plot) as well.<br/><br/>Overall you really can't find a better grouping of page-turning plot, or a better look into adolescence. There are a lot of clones, but Rowling got it right long before the others. Not perfect, but not much is.
 Ok
 Looks amazing and I was so happy until I pulled out the 5th year for the first time and it was already ruined.
 Bought for my 10 year old grandson!  He loves them!!!
 everything as described.<br/>Thank you very much
 I have seen bits and pieces of each movie and have had several people tell me just how good this series is.  I was not let down, and as usual book was better than the book.
 It was a present
 Bought for the whole family, some get to read for the first time, others a few more - but we all enjoy
 Knowing the series would have to end, I always wondered if J.K. Rowling would go for a shock ending or just sweetly wrap up the story with all the bad guys dead and everyone else living happily ever after.<br/><br/>Instead she showed the loss and heartache that such a victory would entail, the cost to families and friends, and how even the bad guys can survive and go on with their lives.<br/><br/>Well done and farewell to a great series. I hope to see newer and equally fine books from this most favorite of my authors.
 The book came damaged
 Wonderful terrific book as are all of them in the 7 book collection by Rowling.  Again it was ordered as a birthday present for one of the family children and he was mesmerized by it.  We all were, once he finally let the rest of us read it. "Grampy" actually got to read it secondly, right after this child did.  We were all so grateful to have this as well as Book 1 and Book 2 that Grampy could read.  He was elderly and knowingly at the end of his life during those 3 years.  It was so amazing to have these books to share and talk about together.  Grampy was fascinated to say the least and he especially loved being able to speak with the children about it afterward, all of them equally excited over every chapter and discussing it together.<br/>A truest blessing for all of them together and the most perfect time that could be. Thank you, God!
 I love them the story is wonderful i decided to read them before I let my son read them and I actually turned into a harry potter fan these books were wonderful and condition was as described.
 Harry Potter is now our favorite bedtime reading.  We love the characters, and Ms. Rowling does a great job of developing a sense of place.  Incidentally, "we" are two kids in our late thirties.  Friendship, loyalty, and bravery are appealing at any age.  We bought the hardcovers - I plan to re-read these a few times while I wait impatiently for the next 3 books.
 All you Potter fans will relate when I say that I'm having as much fun as my 7 year old when I read this to her.<br/>This is my daughter's first novel series. she's completely hooked, of course. She is a bit on the sensitive side, so before we started reading it to her (age 6 when we started), we explained there were going to be some scary parts, but that Harry would be ok. That helped a lot, as she hasn't complained about it being too scary.  After finishing a book, we let her watch the movie version.
 I bought the hardcover boxed set that comes in a chest with stickers as a birthday gift for myself. I was torn between buying this version or just buying the paperback boxed set. I made sure to look up unboxings for both types on youtube before I bought one. I wanted to see if the hardcover version was really worth 100 dollars. It definitely is.<br/><br/>I started reading the Harry Potter series last year since my religious parents wouldn't let me read them when I was a kid. And I absolutely love it. I plan on making sure these books are well taken care of so that I can give them to my future kid. (If I have one that is.) All of these books have American first edition covers, which I thought was awesome. It also comes with another box inside of it for people that decide to put them up on a book shelf that can't fit the chest. I highly recommend that people buy this version of the books if they have the money.
 The first two books - the first book especially, can be somewhat childish, but once it gets going, it gets going into the magnificent world of J.K. Rowling's HP Universe. The HP Universe is a beautiful one indeed.
 Liked the readability and formatting. Minimal illustrations. This item could use a color code glossary for reference to earlier books in the series.
 I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone a lot but Chamber of secrets is twice as good!!! I Love This Book😃
 Enjoying reading each book then watching the movie there are differences, &amp; I really like the extra details in the books so far!
 Love it! Great set of the Harry Potter book series! My son is loving it! He is soon to be 10 and just now we started reading the first book. I admit I had not read any of the HP or watched the movies as it was just not on my radar at the time when it came out. Now that my kids are old enough we have finally taken the dive. It is turning out to be a fun series so far, but we have a ways to go yet! As the set goes it comes in a lovely box set with the standard paperbacks. This is great because it allows you to keep the books together and set them anywhere. If you don't have space in your bookshelf directly this can set atop the bookshelf or in or on a nightstand or wherever you need it to go without being confined to a book shelf. The illustrations on it are lovely and bold.
 The perfect gift for a Potter fan that didn't get any of the books.
 They were a Christmas Present for our Granddaughter in California. And she loves them.
 The books themselves are wonderful, content-wise, but I already knew that before I purchased them. I love everything about Harry Potter - the books, the movies, the nerdiness - I mean, I'm enough of a Harry Potter nerd that I enrolled in the online Hogwarts classes they just started offering! I've been waiting a long time to finally own the set of books, because I wanted them in hardcover; I wanted them to be something durable and long-lasting, and since I take VERY good care of my books I didn't see this as being a problem. My only concern is with the condition of the books I received. Granted, I did order the set used; however, I didn't receive what was advertised. I copy/pasted the following directly off my order page:<br/><br/>'Condition: Used - Very Good<br/>No box!!! . Complete 7 books with dust jackets. First edition. books in very good condition.'<br/><br/>True: No box.<br/>True: 7 books.<br/>True: Dust jackets.<br/>True: First edition.<br/><br/>False: Very good condition.<br/><br/>These books are NOT in 'Very Good' condition. There are stains on multiple pages in multiple books, one has a cracked spine, more than one book is scuffed, and there are numerous tears in one of the dust jackets. Obviously I expected some wear and tear when ordering used books; unfortunately if you're a seller and advertising books in 'Very Good' condition, this level of wear and tear is much worse than expected to be delivered to a customer. Very Good? No, as a former librarian - more like Very Disappointed. The condition of the set I received was much more along the lines of what something advertised as 'Good' condition might be.<br/><br/>And even more regrettable - Hermione Grainger isn't a real person, and she can't help me repair them with a swish of her wand.
 I LOVE THIS SERIES! I have only just got it but i cant put the books down already done with the first and now on the second and it feels like my hands are superglued to this series.
 Excellent
 I love this book because it is funny. Harry Potter has to face so many difficulties in the muggle world and the wizarding world
 Finally the seventh book!!  It's a great book. I'll try to be careful not to give out any details of the story. There is quite a bit of rambling in the middle of the book, it appears that JKR might have had some writer's block or didn't know how to make the story progress.  A lot of back and forth and waiting around for the characters.  JKR could have used these pages to explain more and answer Potter fan questions about the septology.  A lot of questions and mysteries have been answered but there is a bunch more information that has been left out, I guess this way she can keep it alive and write an after Harry Potter book and make even more money.
 Exactly what I expected.
 Excellent Set. Gave as a gift,  was well loved.
 Perfect set of paperback HP :)
 Wow!  This was an amazing book.  Of course, the whole series has been such a joy to read.  The way the author ended it all was very gratifying, and yet there was a sadness that it was over and there would be no more Harry Potter to look forward to in the future.<br/>My 4 yr old son has just taken an interest in Harry Potter.  We are starting at the beginning.  Each night I am reading him a few pages from the Sorcerer's Stone at bedtime.  As I read it, I am amazed at how well it ties in with the seventh book...like Ms. Rowling really does mean it when she says that she had the whole series plotted out from the beginning.<br/>At least I get to enjoy these books again now, through the brand new eyes and ears of my young sons.
 Purchased for a Christmas gift at an amazing value. Very quick delivery and books arrived in box in great shape.
 Beautiful illustrations!
 Love it; had already bought the first 3 books solo but wanted the case it came in as well. Happy birthday to me.
 Great pictures, daughter enjoys it.
 I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan, but let's face it - not all of us can afford to drop $100 or more on a collection of hardcover books. At $100 for 7 books, that averages out to around $15 per book, which is probably the better bang for your buck, but still hard on the wallet. Finding this paperback collection seemed much more justifiable to my conscience because it's more like paying $7.50 per book. Despite being the "cheaper" books, the stories are the same and that's all that matters to me.<br/><br/>All in all, it fills my Harry Potter need without requiring me to spend a large sum of money. Definitely a good purchase for those who don't mind paperbacks.
 The covers are awesome
 I think JKR did a very good job wrapping up a 7 book series into a readable book.  Many people are screaming about unfinished story lines, but if she'd closed absolutely everything she ever wrote about in the first 6 books, this final novel would have been larger then the rest combined and completely unreadable.  What is important is that she closed the major story lines for all of the major characters.  And look at it this way, she left things open just enough to not leave you hanging, but for there to be the possibility of future books in the series.<br/><br/>As for the many people I see whining about how there was no 'true love' in the book.  I think they should recheck their definition of true love.  No, it did not have 'true love' as you see it in Disney Princess flicks.  What DH did show is the true love that can develop, without any romantic attachment, between friends, collegues, students and teachers.  And that is the true type of love this world actually needs more of, not the fairytale romance loves of Disney.<br/><br/>I only gave her four stars, though, as I was a bit dissappointed with a couple of facets.<br/><br/>I think the romance blooming between Ron and Hermione could have been better written.  But perhaps JKR is not comfortable with writing romance, and that is why it takes such a back seat.  I would hate to have to try and write a believable love story with such developed characters.<br/><br/>I also think the very small amount of swearing that was in the book could have been left out, and was used as a cheap shock tactic (most specifically Mrs. Weasley's line towards the end).  But as JKR did not go overboard with this tactic (I only recall it being used two or three times), I did not think it pulled the overall value of the book down too much.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable read and a good wrapper upper to a very long and complicated series.  Of course, not everyone will be happy, but as long as the majority are, that's what counts to an author.  Grammar and syntax are not everything, it's the sharing of creativity and new ideas that makes a fictional book a good read.
 The set is as described but it is a very low quality box set. Great to have the books but the pages easily tear.
 I liked the last several chapters.  I anticipated several of the things that happened and I was quite pleased with how the story wrapped up.  I think the ending was fairly powerful, albeit somewhat compromising, but probably the only way appease the most readers.  I believed it worked well.<br/><br/>The main body of the book felt a little disjointed.  I found far too many irrational convenient coincidences that had me rolling my eyes several times.  To me, it felt somewhat forced.  "Oh, yeah, right," was my common muttering.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way Rowling intertwined elements of all the books to bring the story "full circle".  It gave me the feel of closure to a great series.
 A must have for anyone who loves HP
 I thought the last installment was great! It was an extremely fast read despite the number of pages and a lot of mysteries were revealed. We learned the truth about Snape and Dumbledore and were given greater insight into their characters.<br/><br/>The only thing that irked me was the suddeness of the ending. I wanted to find out more about what happened after the battle and I felt that an epilogue of 19 years later was too large of a gap.<br/><br/>This was still probably the best series ever. =)
 For years now, I have looked forward to the next part of the Harry Potter story. This is the last part of his story. I will not post any spoilers here. This book was as exciting as the previous six, although at the end of this book you know that it is the end and that it is final. Ms. Rowling does not waste any time getting into the the action of the story, and I found it very difficult to put the book down for the first several chapters. I hope that all that read this book enjoy it as much as I did. And if this is your first Harry Potter book shame on you. Do yourself a favor read the previous six first. It may sound like a daunting task but it is well worth it and goes a whole lot faster than you would think. ;)
 Great book set at a great price. Thank you
 It's as advertised. It's all 7 Harry Potter books combined into one useful digital package.<br/><br/>I have the unusual experience of not having read these as a kid. My first experience with Harry Potter comes as an adult. (I haven't seen the movies either) And I can confidently say I really didn't know what I was missing. Even as an adult I found these books highly entertaining and enthralling. Being that I may be the one guy in 2017 who didn't know ANYTHING about the story prior to reading it. (except the 3 main character's names) I was able to go into it blind and I couldn't stop reading. I read at work, home, on the train, at restaurants almost every spare moment I had. I slammed through all 7 books in about 2 weeks. Loved it. I will gladly revisit these books in the future.
 I read the Harry Potter series when it first came out in hardback. I hated the hardback editions because they were so big. I was young, and I felt like I didn't truly grasp the essence of what this series of books presented to me. Now, at age twenty-four, I am re-reading the books in their entirety, having only read up to "The Half-Blood Prince" and I have not yet read "The Deathly Hallows." I ordered this set of books months ago and have been so pleased with them. The cover illustrations add a touch of whimsy, but what I like most about this set is that the covers are soft and pliable so that the spines don't crease, which is nice no matter how many times you've read them. It really is worth it to me to pay a little bit of extra money to get a good quality book. Like many people who have written reviews, I enjoyed Harry Potter for what it was, but I can admit to being not a huge fan of the books or the movies until now that I am old enough to appreciate this series. The books dovetail the movies so nicely, and vice versa.
 These books were in mint condition-- better than expected.
 This book is GORGEOUS!!! Everyone needs this collection. Even the packaging is neat!
 Higher quality than I expected.
 Jim Dale reading the final installment of Harry Potter. It doesn't get any better than this.<br/><br/>Jim Dale is such a great reader that I listen to his audios, even if I'm not so sure about the book he's reading.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is the best fantasy series writting in the last decade or so. The richness of the stories and characters and their ties into folklore and mythology are wonderful. That this standard could be maintained across several novels is fantastic.
 Am I too old to love Harry Potter? No!<br/><br/>I grew up reading this book, and I'm reading it again. The new design is awesome. Just because the covers look different, does not mean there were any changes to the texts or images in the start of each chapter. Everything else is the same except the cover.<br/><br/>The feel of the book is cool; almost like rubber. My exboyfriend spill his drink on it, and the drops rolled right off. Nice :) Pages do stain though, like any other normal book with normal pages. Damn him and his coffee!<br/><br/>Came in as a box set for organization and convenience.<br/><br/>5/5 stars all bias aside, everything about this product is great.
 I was very nervous about reading the final book.  I wanted (still do) Harry Potter books to continue forever.  J.K.Rowling writes his life and world so well that I wanted to live (all be it briefly) in all aspects of his life for years to come.  I was sure I was going to hate the book and never want to read it again.  But J.K.Rowling pulled it off.  Another Excellent book.  She pulled all the pieces together nicely.  I treasure the entire series and I will read and reread all 7 again and again and again.
 Read this entire series. Amazon did a great job.
 Chest is just right to hold the hard back of all Harry Potter books
 I've been waiting to read this ever since I began the series! I absolutely loved this book, &amp; while I believe it to be the best of the series overall, I did have one or two problems with it.<br/><br/>First, the pacing at the end was a little rushed. There were several important characters that died at the end &amp; their deaths were hardly mentioned in the book. It was mostly a few brief paragraphs. I thought that the characters deserved more of a mention than a sentence or two. There were also plot points that would have been missed if I hadn't went back to re-read the last few pages.<br/><br/>Second, not all of the revelations are as "stunning" as was promised by JK. While most were pretty gasp-worthy, many were just briefly brought up &amp; given a half-hearted explanation. Again, I think that it could be explained by the rushed plot at times.<br/><br/>I really wish that JK had made this series into 8 books instead of 7 (for each Hogwarts year). It would have given her more of a chance to expand some of the minor mysteries &amp; storylines of HP. Overall, I loved the book &amp; will make my remaining friends &amp; family members who haven't read the series read it. I still wish that the last book had been fleshed out more.
 Good price as well.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows is terrific read.  It only took me roughly five hours over two days to read book.  J. K. Rowling is to be commended for how satisfactorily she has concluded the Harry Potter saga.  I did not know what to expect and avoided reading any news articles that might give any detail away.  I only knew that several characters would die.  It was really sad to see Dobby the house elf and Fred get killed.  The twins were always larger than life and found so many business schemes that I thought they would live a long time.  Poor Harry really had a tough time losing these two friends as well as Lupin and Tonks.<br/><br/>It was a fascinating ploy to have Voldemort and Harry sharing parts of each other.  It is hardly surprising then that Voldemort hated and feared Harry so much.  I was not surprised that Severus Snape was Dumbledore's agent instead of belonging to Voldemort.  The films made it too obvious that he hated Harry.<br/><br/>At last Neville Longbottom came into his own.  I always suspected that he was not as clumsy or lacking in magic as he was portrayed in the first two films and in the books.<br/><br/>Harry really learned the true meaning of friendship thanks to the many who fought for him and those who died believing him to be better than Voldemort.<br/><br/>The final duel between Harry and Voldemort was exciting and sobering.  Harry showed his maturity and how much he had learned about magic in not sneering at Voldemort but instead calmly, quietly explained the things that Tom Riddle/Voldemort never learned about the power of love.<br/><br/>I was delighted by the section titled Nineteen Years Later.  I had hoped that Ginny and Harry would marry as would Hermione and Ron.  Their assorted children certainly sound interesting.  I wonder if J.K. Rowling will leave the Potter world alone or if at some point she will write about the adventures of the Potter and Weasley children at Hogwarts.
 Prompt delivery. Set in great shape with all the original cover and chapter art.
 A must addition to your Harry Potter collection
 While not a brillant author in a conventional, award-winning way, JK Rowling doesn't disappoint with her Harry Potter conclusion. She does a good job of weaving a tale and bringing back details forgotten in previous books. After 5 deaths in this one, I lost count. However, don't let it discourage you - Rowling manages to scare you, delight you, make you laugh and cry and has deftly completed this series without any questions. I highly recommend this read to anyone who has enjoyed her book series as it makes a terrific end to a wonderful set of stories.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Boxed-Set-The-Complete-Collectioner/dp/1408850753">Harry Potter Boxed Set: The Complete Collectioner</a><br/>I was kinda nervous when I ordered this because the reviews had pictures of the common US edition of the books (the trunk box) and there were no other pictures that would confirm that this was the Bloomsbury edition I wanted. But I took a leap of faith and I got exactly what I wanted!! these books look incredible and they arrived 45 days earlier than what amazon said they would!
 I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. I can't wait to keep reading the rest of the series.
 I didn't think this was as good as the first book. It takes longer to pick up the pace, and much of the first few chapters is wreathed in review, to inform the readers who might not have read the first book. I think that was a mistake, because the first few chapters just don't seem to be very well written. Once the book gets going, it does regain that "can't put it down" feel of the first book, but Rowling seems to be inconsistent - Harry and friends oscillate between telling all of their discoveries out of excitement, and telling nothing out of fear of being caught... The problem with that? Well, they hide information from their family and proven friends (weasleys, dumbledore, mcdougall, hagrid) while "spilling the beans" to characters they wouldn't likely tell (lockhart, ernie, riddle, etc.) I'm all for suspending reality for awhile, and I don't look for this stuff, it just seemed a little thick in spots.<br/> While seemingly written with a mature child or young teen in mind, the series is quite creative and captivates adult readers as well. This book was a little disappointing, but I'm hoping the next two regain the charm of the first one. It could be that I'm looking for stuff that is a little more adult and sophisticated, but I didn't find any faults with the first one, so I don't know.<br/>It doesn't have the breadth, beauty, or sophistication of Tolkien, but it's got a simple but still clever thing going on.
 Wonderful illustrations.
 I bought this product new, no sale price.  It should be flawless!!
 My 9 year old is reading the series and loves it!
 It is a very good book. Once you start reading you will feel as if you can not stop reading. Definitely will recommend to other people.
 Having pored for hours over the last 6 books and having spent so much time reading the theories on Mugglenet, there were still enough twists in the last book to keep me enthralled. Some of the theories came close to the truth, only because JKR had given us several clues in the previous books, and some fans guessed better than the rest of us.<br/><br/>This book more than others showed us clearly that everyone has shades of gray in them given their motivations and the circumstances that surround them. That is what I like about this final book, it is clear in this book more than before that none of her heroes or villains are perfect, they are given to doubts and misgivings just like the rest of us. The outcome is determined through the choices her characters make at each point and through the trust they choose to place in others. JKR does not condescend to her younger tween audience to show a black and white world of good and evil, instead she gives them a glimpse of the murky grayness that lives in every character and  demonstrates how our choices finally make us who we are. Books that I read before I was high school age helped shape my thougt and morality, and I applaud the philosophy JKR puts forth in her books as a parent.
 I like that the book arrived in tact. No tears or broken binding.
 I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED the second I open the box with huge expectation. The box, which is nothing like the picture, is made of cardboard and not even a high-class kind. Harry Potter series means a huge fantastic part of my childhood. I was always looking for a way to fulfill the collection. That's why when I saw the fancy picture of a "wood made" box with so called "sturdy handles and privacy locks" I bought it without a second thought. Turns out it is just a cardboard box with a plastic hook. In a word, everything looks so rough and cheap made. I totally don't think this set worth the price, and worse, it's taking advantage of the fans and doesn't even bother to show basic respect on their expectations. So disappointed!
 My other grandkids (6 and 8) are the ones who began reading/listening to these books.  I then bought the first of the series for my 7 1/2 yr. old grandson.  He loved the book, and his dad read a chapter each night.  He was so excited with the first book that I decided to get the whole set as a keepsake.  He was so excited when the set arrived!  It is actually less expensive to buy the set than to buy the books individually.  The book holder is a nice way to store the books.  My grandson's dad was going to leave for a business trip on the first day of school.  One of their activities the night before was to read 4-5 chapters and finish Book Two!  My other grandkids have been able to read some parts of the books, but my grandson continues to look forward to the nightly reading.  The words and names are not too difficult for them, and their understanding of the stories is excellent.  What a wonderful way to welcome children to the world of books!
 Absolutely beautiful! Must have for HP lovers.
 Bought as a Christmas present for my wife. It came as advertised and she loved it. Only wish the 'chest' was a little higher quality.
 The chest was a really great idea; but thank God Amazon had the set for cheaper than retail.  I would have truly been irritated if I'd paid anything more than what the books could be purchased for individually.  The chest is really cute, but not very good quality. Had a FANTASTIC time reading all the books though.  I am 35 years old, work a "full-time" job, and still managed to read all 7 books in 3 weeks.  I had to!  I have 4 nephews and a niece who were bound to let the ending slip.  Super stories, sad to see the end.
 I had to order this as a replacement because I ruined a friend's copy when I borrowed. The book came to me in perfect condition, and my friend is happy.
 This was a great purchase, really happy with the quality
 There are a lot of reviews here, so I'll keep mine brief. There are a few things I'd like to mention that stayed with me after I finished the book:<br/><br/>In this book Harry reaches his 17th birthday, which basically means the protectve charm that has kept him safe for 16 years will break. He is now fair game for Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Therein lies the premise for the entire book. This is all about how he, Ron and Hermoine plan to track down the Dark Lord and defeat him. Other characters (some we have met before and a few new ones) are drawn into the plan, and yes, a few of them die. As shocking as the deaths were, I was moved by the characters strength and allegiance to Harry. Contrary to what some have to say here, overall I found Rowling's writing to be superb. No one can weave a story the way she does. There is so much emotion in this book. You are put right in the midst of the action, and it really doesn't let up until the very end. Yes, there were some editing blunders, but so what? I am not a nitpicker, I just want a good story and I feel I got my money's worth here. There are some explosive revelations in this book as well...wait until you here about Dumbledore's past, and Snape's true nature, and the truth behind Harry's past. I loved it -- if you're a Potter fan, or if you want to know what the hoopla is all about, check it out (although I would not recommending starting with this book - you can start with Book 3 and catch up).<br/><br/>Enjoy...
 I read the book over 15 days. A few parts brought tears to my eyes, not because of a character's death, but due to the discovery of certain emotional truths. Love and respect is shown to another character or someone discovers a great piece of wisdom. An important aspect of the story is good versus evil, and the proper fighting tactics that decent people use that show they are morally superior to the others.<br/><br/>Harry barely escapes capture or death many times. A lot of characters are killed off, including good and bad wizards and witches and also several muggles. There is a focus on the life of Albus Dumbledore.
 This was a gift for my daughter and she was delighted with it!  It was shipped within the specified time requested and I am pleased!
 Arrived in great shape. No problems.
 If you're a Vonnegut fan, you'll recognize those words as they were used to describe Kilgore Trout; "His writing was dreadful;only his ideas were good." Such it is with Ms.Rowling-- her use of the English language is simplistic at best, uncreative at worst. But oh, those IDEAS. The characters, the plot twists and turns...can we forgive her the lack of word diversity, the descriptions that lave one's mind and entice the senses that are found in the works of more eloquent authors? I found it difficult to put the books down with a single page unread, yet once I put them down I wanted more. They read almost TOO fast (I suppose that's why they have so many pages) and leave one with little to savor after. They entertain without challenging; tasty, but not ultimately satisfying. Does this mean that I won't read Volume 5? Hardly. But then I'm hooked on fast food, too-- even though I know it's not necessarily good for me.
 these were in fantastic shape for used books!!

As expected !! Can’t wait to revisit Harry Potter  universe !
 I was really satisfied with the ending. I was really praying that JK Rowling will not kill Harry Potter in the end. I was amazed at how the author really linked every single event from the very first book to the last, giving the readers utmost satisfaction.. like why Harry, having the eyes of his mother being important in the story, how Wormtail was affected by Harry saving his life in the third book, etc, etc. This  last book is really full of interesting bits that I hope this will not be shortened in the film. I hope the film makers would divide this book into two chapters so as not to loose the important events that will make the story complete and satisfying to the movie goers who did not read the book. I would like them to be as satisfied as we readers do.
 Got it for my granddaughter for her birthday. She loves to read and has the whole collection. She read it in 4 days.
 Loved this set!
 I love this series and I am so happy that I purchased a box set. Came quickly with no damages.
 Gift for my husband and he loved it!
 Good read
 Great books
 Love Harry Potter and this collection is perfect!
 Love these books!!
 I enjoyed all of it.
 These books contain all the same words as the original books. 10/10
 Another great illustrated version!
 Book condition description was “new”, but the book jacket was slightly worn and there was a child’s name written on the inside of the cover.
 Book arrived on time and was as advertised. Glad to add it to my collection.
 I purchased the the hardback, red boxed, collector edition of the Harry Potter books that are published by Bloomsbury in the UK. This is the most stunning set of books I've ever set my eyes on! The bright red box has a gold dragon embossed all the way around it with a magnetic front closure. The covers of the books are fabulous. Even if you're not familiar with some of the terminology used in the UK, most meanings are easily figured out using the context. There are also websites dedicated to deciphering the Harry Potter UK edition books. If you want the true Harry Potter experience or if you are a collector, I highly recommend this collectible edition!
 Son loves them!
 I own the entire set of the Harry Potter unabridged audio CDs and have listened to the earlier books many times over.  I have always been impressed with the way that Jim Dale keeps all of the voices for the characters straight from book to book.<br/>He finally slips up in this one though.  For some odd reason, he has Dean Thomas and Lee Jordan speaking with an Irish accent.  I know it's a little thing, but it just hits my ear wrong.<br/>Other than that, a fine job reading a wonderful book.
 Perfect, thank you!
 I absolutely love these books.  I started reading them several years ago, not really expecting much, and it was a wonderful surprise to discover such endearing beautiful books.  I immediately became hooked and a BIG Potter fan.<br/><br/>Since, back when I started reading these books, I didn't even know if I would like them, I bought paperback editions in different languages.  As I got hooked and discovered the Scholastic editions, I thought about buying the complete collection on the English Scholastic Hardcover edition (once the 7th and final book came out) and re-read all of the books again.<br/><br/>This is why this boxed set became an ideal option for me.  I really wasn't expecting much on the packaging, although I admit that the packaging gives much to be desired.  It is poor quality cardboard. I'm sure I will dispose of it very soon.<br/><br/>I give this collection 4 stars.... 5 stars for the books minus 1 star for the packaging.  (sorry)
 Harry Potter in pictures! What's not to love?
 Exactly what I hoped for!
 Book is great but cover was damaged and it was to close to Christmas to return so I taped it and kept it
 I was VERY disappointed to break into the box that I've had on preorder for months and months to find a cheaply constructed cardboard box with my books inside.  The shrink wrap doesn't even completely cover my books so there is a large gap in the plastic, therefore my books are only mildly protected against, dust and aging.  I was glad to see that the box inside the box is removable, however due to the poor/cheap construction of the "collectors" box, I was concerned about trying to put the secondary box back inside, as it may split the seams of the outer box.  In addition, the "hinge" if you can call it that, is nothing but a fold in the construction of the outer box, which means that you really can't open/close it too many times before it begins to crack and split, itself.  The plastic clasp, as previously mentioned by another guest, was indeed cheaply made, and not easily opened the first time.  I, too, almost broke it trying to open it and you must also pay close attention when reclasping it, as it doesn't line up well on its own.  I am very disappointed in the presentation of the set.  I am very glad to have the whole series in hardback, that was the reason that I ordered this set, but to pay such a price for this set, and to wait for it for months and months, only to be disappointed when it finally arrived...I expected  better quality and value for something considered to be a collector's set.  I suppose I've learned my lesson, regretfully.
 Good
 I will always love Harry Potter. I will pass it on when I die. Harry is a classic no matter what haters say. I read a poor review about how the ending was horrible because it relied on Snape explaining missing pieces. That was that part of the review in a nutshell; I thought it was a work of genious on Rowling's part. You haters only write on here because you know how we feel about the books. O'Reilly thought that Rowling is a provacateur; I think most of you haters are provacateurs. Provacative words are not bad in themselves; however, you persoanlly assault me in this case. Harry is the Boy Who Lived, Jo is the Woman Who Lived, and the stories are the Books that Lived. They--the books and the characters--lived. All of the deaths were personal to me as if family or friends died. My friends. Millions of people shared these friendships.
 It was a gift and she has loved it
 Beautiful cover art, with the classic chapter art within. Absolutely love this set, and of course the series is as wonderful as it's always been. 10/10 would recommend!
 The package was beaten up as well as the book themselves but my sister like them so that what matters most.
 Glad to see that it made it to kindle. Worth he wait!
 This is a great book and the new illustration is magical.
 This set came in great condition. I was very pleased as was my nephew as I face them to him as a gift. Very happy cystomer😀
 Nice set good quality
 My Son likes it a lot
 Love Harry!!
 Best way to enjoy the entire series.
 Absolutely amazing. Beautiful illustrations!
 This Harry Potter Paperback Box Set met all my expectations. The books are big and delicates just how I wanted it to be.Plus it came few days earlier than expected.
 I was looking forward to this book for soo long and am very dissapointed by the outcome.  The book was very interesting but the end was very dissapointing the way the left the characters and really not much on information on the characters that we have grown with and loved.  It is like she spent so much time writing so much detail in the book and then the epiloge sucked.  Just my opinion and I am hoping she will oneday write more on the series, maybe even their children.
 This was my absolute favorite book series I have read so far ❤️ wish I would have read it sooner!
 Easy to read, and really fun. Sometimes I forget I'm reading a book and will feel an urge to go back to where I was sitting in case I might miss a scene.
 Pre-order this back in February
 Beautiful illustratuons
 My son love the set
 Such a beautiful book! Truly amazing, can't wait for the next one!
 The books weren’t in as good of shape as the description led me to believe
 I am a passionate fan of J.K. Rowling's, and like most of her readers, I waited with bated breath for this final installment of her wonderful series!  I knew early on that Rowling was writing Christian allegory, so a few of the surprises were expected.  Without ruining these twists and turns for others who haven't had the pleasure yet, I'll just say that Rowling remains consistent with her allegory, and yet she wisely chooses not to perfect it, allowing her characters to retain their humanity.  The writing has a little bit of a hurried quality, as if, having worked so hard to reach this point, Rowling really wanted to just have it over with.  And I was a bit disappointed with the ending for a few of the characters I'd become attached to, as they didn't get quite the attention that I wanted to give them.  But she gives us a solid conclusion to all of the major storylines, and wraps everything off nicely.  I highly recommend this book and the whole series - it definitely deserves a place beside the Chronicles of Narnia and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the annals of classic Christian writing.  Those who have demonized Rowling were completely off the mark.  I do think that there are some legitimate concerns that young kids reading these books might be attracted to some of the occult arts talked about in the books, which are forbidden in the Bible.  But I also think that Rowling is, ultimately, speaking Parseltongue, using the language of serpents to speak to those who would never listen to doves.  I commend her, and hope that her efforts bear fruit!
 That's the best word I can come up with the describe the book.<br/><br/>I resisted, see.  My wife always wanted me to read the books... I preferred to stick to more 'mature' books, such as Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, Tolkein of course, Jordan's Wheel of Time, the many story arcs of Fiest's Midkemian crew, and some of Brook's and Farland's books.<br/><br/>I resisted.  I watched the first 3 movies, with my wife of course... I mean, I wouldn't want her to go to the movies alone, right?<br/><br/>And then, in secret, I read the Goblet of Fire.  Incredible book.  One of the better ones I've ever read.  Intersting.  It seems I wasn't giving the author enough credit.  She can spin a tale, yes?<br/><br/>Then I read the order of the Phoenix.  Decent book, felt a bit unfocused to me... I attributed it to the fact that I was just glimpsing into the world, not truly a rabid fan.  Over a year passed.  I bought my wife the next book, and she read it, but I wasn't really interested... so time passes until... last Friday, I went out to see the movie, Order of the Phoenix.  It really was a good adaptation, I felt.. for being as compressed as it was, it presented the story quite well, with a few(troubling) differences that I didn't really understand.<br/><br/>I came home, and the next day our preorder of the final book came from Amazon.  I opened it up and looked at the cover... but I couldn't really read them out of order, really..  The Half Blood Prince was staring at me on the bookshelf.  So I  read it.  In one setting.  Took about 7 hours.  Great read.  I then took a moment for a bite to eat, and started The Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>I lost consciousness about halfway through, and just finished it today, while 'sort of' watching the British Open.<br/><br/>Brilliant read.  The books has everything in it.  I won't breathe a word of the plot, but I have to say, hat's off to you, Rowling.  Good show.  Thanks very much.
 It doesn't matter if you're eight or eighty (or anywhere in between), a trip to whimsey with Harry Potter won't hurt a bit - may, in fact, put a smile where there is all too often a line of concern with just the struggle of living from day to day. That being said, sometimes we all need a break from our usual reading choices to either appreciate them more or to adjust them for the better. There's a lot of reading material out there that's best described as needing some serious effort at improvement in order to be classed as junk. But, there's also a lot of literature, too. I think at the very least, the Harry Potter series may open a few minds to venture into the classics. Wouldn't that be a treat?<br/><br/>Jack
 We love all of the Harry Potter stories. Masterful writing and incredible narration by Jim Dale!
 Amazing stories
 It is a beautiful collection of the Harry Potter Series, I definitely think it's worth it to purchase if you love the books.
 Wife is gonna love it
 naturally I LOVE this!!
 It was a gift for my grandson and both he and I loved it! Thank you
 This Harry Potter complete set will be enjoyed by most young Harry Potter fans. The seller could have made it even better by having made available the child's name and chosen address written on the box's shipping tag done by an experienced calligrapher, and even perfect if each book would have been autographed by the author, with perhaps a special letter from her to the child. Most parents or grandparents would have been willing to shoulder the extra costs of making this item a treasured heirloom for years to come.
 I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book. I read slowly to savor it so I could experience it longer. Of course, by the last several chapters I found I couldn't "savor" it any longer cuz it just got too exciting to put down! The author does a spectacular job of wrapping up the saga. There are no loose ends! I hope she writes another series! I've read many other fantasy books and they just don't have the magical touch of Rowlings! She's a genious!
 These are the freaking best!
 My wife and I have enjoyed listening to the whole Potter series on CD.  While the first one worked well, in book two, the narator Jim Dale really comes into his own.  With his destinctive voices, dramatic florish and excellent sense of comic timing he brings the book to life for the listener.  Though I found the books a little dry as a read, they make a wonderful performance and I would urge anyone who enjoys books on CD to add this and the rest of the series to their collections.
 I watched alll the movies then started the books. As I finish a book, I re watch the movie again. Looking for clues I missed that the books clarify.
 It's Harry Potter. What's not to love?
 HARRY POTTER
 I read this book to my 3 year old every night before bed. We both love the story and it has made bedtime easy and enjoyable.
 My daughter loves this!
 My kids loved getting this boxed set for Christmas!<br/>Although a bit pricey all at one time, this set is actually a real bargain. These seven books have been read over and over in our home. The kids have truly enjoyed having the whole set. They are able to finish one book and move on to the next eagerly.<br/>The cardboard box keeps the books all together in a neat fashion. And the kids are particlar about keeping the books in chronological order within the box. They all take great pride in this set. And they are always proud to show their friends that they have the "boxed set".<br/>I would not hesitate to recommend this seto to my Harry Potter loving friends. Who knows? This set might even become a collectors item and become more valuable than what I paid for them in the first place.
 I received my order at least one week late, but I was notified via snail mail and that was OK.  When I finally received my book, like a kid with a new toy I made sure I had no interruptions and only had the time for my book.  It only took me 3 afternoons of time to finish but I was not surprised by the results.  Lots of drama for Harry and his friends, the plot was more adult in content than usual but that was fine with me.  I am most happy with the ending.
 I enjoyed reading it very much and I believe it measures up to the other books in the series, but I don't think it surpasses any of my expectaions.  As I read this book I found myself missing the earlier books in the series, because they were easier to follow and did not involve tons of sidetracking events and dry filler.  Much like the other later books in the series, Deathly Hollows has some dry spells in it that you need to force yourself through to get to the good stuff.  Also, much like the later books, the last few chapters provide too much information and excitement to absorb in one read through.  Loose ends come together too fast to be appreciated and sometimes events in the last hurried chapters bring up more questions than answers.  I have to admit there were things that were touched upon in this book that I thought would be significant later, but were never mentioned again.  Some feelings of closer were lost because of this.  One thing I was not expecting was the fairytale ending.  I personally feel this was done to please the readers, but it was quite predictable.  Even having said all of this, I still enjoyed the book overall and will start to read all of them again as soon as possible.
 Okay, I actually work in a bookstore, so I knew what these were before they were shipped out. However, I had already placed the order here since they were actually cheaper than what my store was selling them for. When I placed the order, the description DID actually say the books were coming in a WOODEN BOX which was mostly why I reserved a set. Of course, I also wanted a complete set of the hard back books all together. But as I've read in other reviews, it is VERY disappointing (and cheap on the publishers' side) to give CARDBOARD boxes like this! So, if you want the whole set of HP books in hard back, I'd suggest just buying them seperatly. It's probably cheaper and you won't have to look at a rather crummy looking cardboard chest.
 I got this and the other 5 books for my mother for the holidays because she is a huge HP fan and loves audio books. I have never seen her so happy. She was just like a kid: sitting there lining up the boxes and rearranging and admiring them (they are packaged attractively and thematically). Getting the whole set was expensive but damn is it worth it! The performances, by Jim Dale, are spectacular. He does unique voices for each and every character - some aren't what i imagine they would be but are all rather well done and rarely annoying, if ever. If you're a Harry Potter fan this is a must have!!!<br/><br/>Good luck getting these suckers on your computer so you can play them in your ipod or mp3 player; the books are on between 7 and 23 CDs each. It took me 3 days to load them all on my computer.
 For JK Rowling's writing style, characters, and plot, of course, I would give this set 5 stars.  Unlike the box set of books 1-6, this set does not appear to be missing pages or chapters.  I've only read 4 of the books so far, but the others appear to be complete.  I'll update as soon as I've finished the series.<br/><br/>I considered giving the set less stars because the paperbacks and their box are not as well constructed as I had hoped.  The book covers and corners of the box are creased and sloppily glued.  I still gave the set 5 stars, though, because it is less expensive than purchasing the paperbacks separately, and it comes with a nifty (though slightly cracked &amp; rumpled) display box.<br/><br/>Having all seven books in a paperback box set is so exciting, that I expect everyone will run right out and buy this set, despite any cosmetic issues I have noted.  I hope your set will look better than mine!
 LOVE IT!
 Duh! 10 Stars
 Bought as a gift
 Wow, all I can say is Jim Dale really brings J.K. Rowling's text to life. So much so I purchased every one of the series because he narrates all of them for Listening Library. These are by far the best audio book narrations I have listened to (and I travel a good deal so I listen to allot). If you are familiar with the series, you know the large volume of characters residing in the HP universe, all of which he reads in a unique voice and inflection. Superb!
 Nicely illustrated book
 Beast series ever!
 I was about 10 years old when the first Harry Potter book came out and it has been delightful growing up with the series. JK Rowling does a wonderful job in building suspense and weaving a wonderful tale and finale for our beloved hero and those we have come to admire along the way.<br/><br/>There are a few inconsistencies within the chapters, but I don't want to give too much away and spoil the plot for others. I'll just mention one part where a main character states that he/she used a memory charm on someone, but later sincerely says they never cast it before. It is a complex tale and it is understanding that the author and editor could have overlooked such a minute portion of the text without picking up on it. I felt rather put off by the epilogue as well, along with a couple instances of crude language, a few minor curse words that I feel should have been edited out for the younger readers, regardless of the escalating tension within the storyline at those moments. While it was nice to know what happened to some of our favorite characters in the epilogue, too much time has passed for several crucial details being left out - I finished reading it and had so many questions, which makes me wonder whether Rowling did so on purpose in order to write a side story later (one can always hope!).<br/><br/>I am a critical reader though, and enjoyed the ending and the enthusiasm Rowling demonstrates as she finishes telling Harry Potter's story. Buy it, read it, re-read each installment in order, see the movies and compare it to the books...future generations will enjoy it over and over. She's re-established a standard for modern writing in the fantasy genre and has joined the great works of C.S. Lewis and Tolkien. I give JK Rowling credit for stimulating the imagination of many who are overwhelmed by the easy fillers of our technological world.
 Couldn't put it down. Better than the movie with a few twists and insights that the movie left out! Can't wait to read the next book!
 I saw this set while reading my Entertainment Weekly. I grew up reading the Harry Potter series. I'll admit, I'm a Potterhead. I was 6 when the first books came out, and even at that age I was able to read them. Every release date was spent standing in line for midnight to come with my mom in a bookstore while wearing my pajamas. I've got the set in hardback and on my kindle as well, but when I saw these I knew I had to have them. The price was absolutely reasonable. You're getting SEVEN books. The covers are well thought out and portray the book representing them well. The case they come in is beautiful as well. My husband bought these for me as a birthday present. My parents are in their late 60s, and I was so excited to get these that I made them look at the covers after I got them. They're in my office right now, sitting on their own beautiful shelf. I'm too afraid to read these because of ruining the covers, but they're so awesome and fit well with my collection of Harry Potter.
 I thought I purchased a new book and this has clearly been used. It isn't a big enough deal for me to return it, but I'm not stoked that I received something other than I purchased.
 In my opinion The Chamber of Secrets is better than the first. Not only does Harry once again fight against those who would do him harm: but he gets to outsmart a giant snake. In this book we get to learn some more about Hermonie, Ron, Harry's family, but we learn that something was passed on to him, the night he got his scar. If you have only seen the movies based on the series, you are missing out. The books go more in depth on the characters and the plot. The movies (although very good) tend to skip over parts of the book. My suggestion is to read the books first, then watch the movies. I hope this helps.
 I wanted to start reading the Harry Potter series. But I didn't want the hardcover ones because I go to school year round and the hardcover just adds weight to the backpack. So I was browsing and found this offer, and I was like "Great!". Great books. Great price and fast service.
 I had read all of the Harry Potter books borrowing them from friends because I wanted to wait until the series was complete, so I could buy the inevitable box set. I have no complaints about the books themselves. They are the nice hardback volumes I expected. Of course, the books themselves are also a wonderful collection of stories that I highly recommend to anyone who likes magical tales. My complaint is with the box itself. It is made of cardboard and plastic. It will take quite a bit of care to keep it looking nice for any length of time. If this is purchased for any but the most fastidious child to keep in his/her room, I would expect the box to be in tatters within a few months. I suppose that for the price I shouldn't have expected more, but I am not sure it there is any point to buying the box set other than its value as a collectible item.
 1st) the books were not all in the condition as advertised.  Out of seven books, about half were as advertised the rest were a little more worn with dirty pages. I feel I was mislead'<br/> 2nd) More importantly, they were horribly boxed for shipment. The box was not suitable for the weight of the number of books shipped The box had burst open causing some additional damage the books.For what I paid for used books, I would think that the seller could have bothered to invest in proper shipping containers, or at the very least split the shipment into two parts.<br/>I am extremely disappointed and will not use this seller again. This experience is a deterrent to purchasing pre-owned items from unknown sellers
 Really nice paperback books, all pages are there, nothing missing
 What a great book!  I really enjoyed how everything came full circle.  Of course there are things that I think I would have written differently but then again I am not the author and she wrote this book for all of our enjoyment!  It was a little slow in the middle but that was part of the character development and no reason to ding my rating.<br/>This was the first book that made me cry and gave me a newfound respect for a few characters that we know and may or may not love.<br/>I am so sad it is over but now I can share these with my kids as they grow up.
 i don't know how the book was, we purchased it for our nephew. we found out he was coming to visit four days before his arrival. we knew he did not have the book ordered so we tried to buy it locally but our local "big bookstore" told us it was too late to pre order so we could come in on the day the book was available and wait in line. we went on line and placed the order with amazon and on the day of release the book was delivered to our door making a young boy very happy.as usual a great job by amazon.com.... thank you!!!!
 Excellent product. Books are really nice. Only thing to be considered is that the box is not rigid as it seems but made of cardboard. Not that it is bad but it was not what I expected.
 Just incredible... that's all I can say.  As a avid fan of the Books, there have always been spoilers and security leaks and no matter how many you hear or come across, they're quickly forgotten as soon as you get the book in your hands.  Most spoilers are terribly wrong anyway.  This book was great, and even greater was that in interviews, JKRowling answered any additional questions fans had.  Just a great series.  I'm sad to see it end.
 GIFT WARNING!!  The brown shipping box that this item is delivered in says on the outside - HARRY POTTER BOX SET 1-7, DO NOT OPEN UNTIL OCTOBER...  So a word of advice, if you buy this for a gift, have it shipped to yourself or somewhere they won't see it so you can wrap it later.  (-1 star)<br/><br/>The books are great.  Having all the hardcover editions in a collectible box set is what every fan craves.  But this?  This is box set is just embarrassing to display.  It would have been better if it was just a normal box set cover, but to add a cheap lock and cheeky packaging?  (-1 star)<br/><br/>Other than that, the hardcover books are still nice to display on the bookshelf by themselves.  I recommend this for any fan of the series, as long as you know what you are getting ahead of time.
 Beautiful!! I stared st it for a while! My husband got me this as a gift and I cannot be happier with the product!
 I didn't get into Harry Potter when it first came out, I was hooked on other books. While I have listened to the audio books (Stephen Fry is brilliant) and watched the movies, I never bought a set of books because I wanted just that - a set. When I heard that Kazu Kibuishi was doing the art for a new set, I knew right away that was the one for me. My son and I love his books, Amulet and the others, and his artwork is just beautiful. The covers for this set are no exception, the spines all line up to make an image, and the artwork on the back of each book is not just an afterthought, it's a beautiful image in and of itself, a theme carried across each of the novels. I am really happy with this purchase.
 It’s amazing!! I bought this for my sister and she loved it. It was well packaged and arrived safely. Thank you so much!
 As described, quick delivery
 The Chamber of Secrets is the second illustrated book to be released.  Just like the first, the text is not written the same as the US released version but, it is nothing short of amazing.  I love that this is the FULL book and not a shortened or altered version.<br/><br/>The detail and precision in this book is unmatched (I didn't think it could get any better after the first book came out but they did.)<br/><br/>I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read or reread the books. We use these to read to our kiddos and the pictures keep their attention while still getting the full story.<br/>If you found this review to be helpful, please click the helpful button below! :)
 Wonderfully packaged and high quality hardback books. Well worth waiting for.
 Nice pack
 I almost didn't want to read the seventh book. One, I couldn't stand the idea of the story finally ending. Two, I had heard the rumors and wondered if they might be true. After finishing the tome and talking with many other Potter fans, I realized the story ended on a perfect note. Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for a wonderful tale about a boy who grew up to be a wonderful and multifaceted young man.<br/><br/>Kevin Gerard - Author of Diego's Dragon, Book One: Spirits of the Sun
 Love it!
 Best series I have ever read. Amazing author! I read all books within weeks, and I'm a busy person. Definitely dive in!
 five stars
 Our granddaughter loves it!
 great
 I purchased the books when they were first sold. I wanted to know what all the kids were talking about.  Yes, I was an adult standing in line at midnight to be one of the first to read books as they were being released.  This purchase is a Kindle purchase to reread the series.  I have found some new or forgotten parts to the story in this read through.  These books and story will not go out of style, a wonderful way to spend time reading.<br/><br/>Just a note: these books do not download as individual books.  Each book continuous one right after another.
 Both my son and I were completely captivated. This is a gripping, tense, and moving final installment to this epic series.
 I'm asked by people who have not read any of the Harry Potter books what I thought about the 7th book.  I liked it, I can't say that I love it as just the 7th book.  But I do love the whole series.  I love in the 7th book how she answered all the questions and she superbly made me want to reread the whole series all over again to catch the little tidbits that she used to wrap up the answers to the big questions.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain this series to someone that's never read any of the books....  Most book series are hard to follow, most authors don't follow a good timeline.  They jump around in ways that don't make sense.  They try to bring in new twists that don't make sense to the previous books.  I have repeatedly stopped reading other series of books because they lost their original shine, their attraction, or the motivation that got me to read the next book of the series.<br/><br/>But JK Rowling is completely different.  Her series is masterful!  It's as if she sat down and wrote the whole series out before sending out the first book (which we know is not the way she did it, it just appears that way).  Each book builds onto the other, things that were barely noticed before, show their importance later (you remember that she pointed something out at the time, but you weren't sure why until later).  And the way she does it makes sense - it doesn't come across like she went back through her books just to find a tidbit that she decided to tie into the big picture at the last second.<br/><br/>In the course of the series, she tackles very important issues: taking responsibility for your actions, taking your punishments when you knew you were breaking the rules, gender inequality, race discrimination, hero worship and then finding out that the hero made mistakes too, jumping to conclusions before learning all the facts, - the list just goes on and on.<br/><br/>To think that the first Harry Potter book was the VERY first book that she ever wrote - it's just mind blowing!  Most authors write a dozen books or more before getting their first book published.  Here, she wrote her first book, got it published and rightly it's a best seller that's truly worth all the hype.  There are only 3 authors that I have bought the books in hardback, this is one.  Not only that, even of the 3 authors, this is the only author that I have pre-ordered, then quickly read to completion.<br/><br/>I'm very picky about books that I recommend and this is a series that I recommend whole heartedly.  This is not just a children's book series, this is a series that all ages can enjoy.  To me, the movies don't come anywhere close to doing this series justice.  Anyone that just watches the movies doesn't know what they're missing not reading the series!
 I purchased the UK version of Philosopher's Stone (mostly for the "Philosopher's" instead on "Sorcerer's" on the cover), but preordered american version of CoS. While Chamber of Secrets title is identical between US and UK versions, cover is still a little different. It has different fonts, and also UK version paper cover has some kind of velvet feeling when you touch it, while US version is just a regular gloss paper. Not sure if I will be replacing this with the UK version yet.<br/>Inside I think they are completely identical (since text was not americanized). Illustrations are just perfect, these are one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen.
 Best series ever, sad this is the last book
 I just recently got into Harry Potter. Like many adults, I had avoided watching or reading anything about HP for years because I thought, oh that's kid stuff! But I couldn't have been more wrong. This series is fantastic, full of adventure, mystery, frights, and funnies. The characters are so well written and the stories so enchanting, that you simply can't help but care for each of them. But be warned, once you start, it's VERY hard to stop, and once you've read 'em all, you can't help but crave the next "fix"...if only miss Rowling could write faster!
 Excellent illustrations! I'm so glad I purchased these books!!
 Got the set as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves the chest the books came in.
 Obviously people like this book so there’s not much I can add here. Sad it’s over but happy to get my free time back
 This set is missing the first book. It’s still in its plastic wrap and you can clearly see it’s missing!
 Great illustrations
 A beautiful way to bring the story to life.
 Have loved the movies for years and finally decided to read the books. Definitely better than I expected. More details and other things that were not included in the movies.
 My wife and daughters will love it!
 Bought the box set for my fiance, who had somehow missed them while they were coming out, and now that it's finished, wanted to catch up.  She got to book three, and found a chunk of about 30 pages missing!  Amazon set us up with a return mailing label and immediately shipped a complete new set at no charge.<br/><br/>She was still obsessively reading book 5 this morning on the train, so I think she likes it...<br/><br/>Kudos to Amazon for great service.
 Enjoyed reading this as a kid and still do to this day. Can't wait to re-read the whole series. Happy reading!
 he loves them
 Promptly delivered. The Kindle version allows me to have access to the whole series wherever I am without having to carry lots of really big books
 There is nothing I can say about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that hasn't already been said previously. I loved the book. It is a great ending to a very strong series. My only complaint is that it should have had more Luna Lovegood, but she's been my favorite character from her debut, and I have thought that there should be more of her. I would give it 4 stars but for those few silly people that seemed to have forgotten that it is about the journey, not the destination. And that is saying something since the destination was amazing.
 I love Harry Potter and this box set is my favorite!
 I love every single one of the Harry Potter books, but the one where he and Voldemort finally go head to head is the best one!
 Quality hard cover book
 The seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series fully lives up to all of the hype preceeding its release. It is a fun, easy read, and it answers all of the questions that the followers of the series have had for quite some time.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, this is not a "bunnies &amp; fluff" book, there are some truly hard moments in it, and the terrible loss of some beloved characters. But the overall tone of the story is adventurous fun! The book is action packed and moves with speed. There are some really great twists and turns in the plot - all of which fit and make perfect sense.<br/><br/>This has now become my favorite book of the series; with book #3 in second place.<br/><br/>Enjoy!
 bought for nephew great book fast shipping
 Grandson (8) thrilled with item
 Great
 Got for a raffle basket
 Exactly as expected!!! So pleased!!
 This book is not for you if you haven't read books 1 through 6. (And I heartily recommend that you DO read them.)<br/><br/>All previous books in the series begin with Harry preparing to go to Hogwarts, meeting or reuniting with his friends, uncovering a mystery, and build up to an exciting episode of danger and triumph. The final book has a different beginning and is filled with many episodes of real danger. It is more violent and contains more deaths than Books 5 and 6. Rowling skillfully incorporates a review of happenings and characters in this fast-paced epic. (I appreciated this because so much time elapsed between Book 7 and Book 6.) Character development continues; we see growth in characters as well as surprising revelations about some.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful read. I have mixed feelings--satisfied with the "loose ends" being tied up, and sad because it is the end of a fascinating series.
 The illustrations are wonderful! I've got the 3rd one on my wish list.
 my gr4and daugher loves
 I love reading and rereading this series!  I was tempted to buy it for my kindle, but Harry Potter should only be read with physical copies where you can turn the crisp, starred pages.<br/><br/> After always having to borrow these books from friends and libraries for years, I decided to splurge and buy a new set of my very own, and I was not disappointed!  I proudly display my box set on my dresser.<br/><br/>Second best part of this purchase (since the books were clearly the best part)? Receiving the shipment in a Scholastic box, just like the boxes I remember elementary school teacher's receiving whenever I ordered books through the monthly catalog.
 Best series ever!
 I ordered this book for my daughter age 11 so that she could read the book being she has enjoyed the movies.  For most movies the book is better and can go into more detail.  I am 40 + and really enjoyed the book as well.  I found this book to be highly entertaining and again Harry must put his life in danger to save others who are important to him. J.K. Rowling has introduced us to some new characters in book two. We meet a magical elf, Dobby, a new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart and finally Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who joins the famous trio.<br/>CHAMBER OF SECRETS shows, more than anything, that the success of PHILOSPHER'S STONE was not a fluke accident, and it is with this novel we get the first real rumblings of the Pottermania that was about to take over the globe. This book is easily as readable as the first, and most readers will fly through this novel.<br/>I liked this book because it was a true page turner. As the reader you can search for possible clues along with Harry, Ron and Hermione. I would recommend this book to anyone over seven years old. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job on this book because it's exciting and full of adventure. I have learned from this book that life is full of tough challenges and problems. No matter how hard it is you have to be brave and trust in yourself to do the right thing.
 Great condition. Well delivered. Love it!
 a gift
 Amazing book but the paper quality of this Scholistic publication paperback is really bad.
 I got this as a gift for my sister. It's a great price and the set was in great condition.<br/>She loves it.
 Okay, I just like to say that to tick off those who haven't read the book yet.<br/>The final book has wrapped things up nicely. Thoroughly enjoyed 9/10's of the book. Kind of dragged in parts, but Rowling mostly kept me glued to the book into the wee hours of the night. Blurrey eyed and sleepy for the three days of plowing through the book were worth it. The last 200 pages were thrilling. Rowling did not disappoint.<br/>Spoiler: Potter dies...
 This is my favorite series of books since the first one came out so I waited to buy the entire set just so I can read it over and over again.
 These were the best price I found. Arrived sooner than expected.
 Compared to "Sorcerer", I like the word "Philosopher" more thank you very much
 Love the entire series!! Bought these books on my Kindle so I could reread them again.
 Such a great story and illustrations are beautiful!
 Wonderful for the price! Artwork on the covers, binders and box are original and wonderful. 10/10 would recommend.
 Perfect
 I got very confused by pictures I saw posted. This has NO illustrations.
 These were a Christmas gift.  I love them.  I am an avid Harry Potter reader, and though the movies have their own charm, the books will always be better-- subplots, anyone?<br/><br/>Well, after having read each of my original set dozens of times each, they were looking pretty bad.  My husband got me the boxed set, and it's been great having crisp, new copies to breeze through on my down time.<br/><br/>The box is nice.  I feel like it's more for kids than for adults, but I'm happy to have somewhere secure to store the books, and it works well for that.  It keeps them all in one place and they don't get dusty.  It came with some bonus stuff that I haven't used, but would be great for a young HP fan to enjoy.
 Read all
 New and just your basic book, no problems what a ever!
 Book series was for my granddaughter for Christmas, she was all smiles.
 Beautiful!
 I don't need to spend time writing about how the Harry Potter books have impacted my life, or how many times I've read them. What I can say for this set is that it is an excellent collection that is sure to last a lifetime, no matter how many times they are cracked open and read. The chest, while not "real", is a great case for the books, and looks great sitting on my shelf in my "library", but it also protects the novels from wear and tear. This really is a collection you want to have in hardback, and this is a great choice to go for because it's a decent price for what you're getting.
 No, this is not great literature.  It's often quite silly, and at times morbid as well.  The story line seems to drag on forever.  Much of the time, one is clearly in the presence of an author working out her neuroses and petty quibbles about the British class system, her education and so on, on paper.<br/><br/>But... who knows precisely why, every kid under the age of 14 who lays hands on these books is mesmerized.  My seven year old girl is in a multi-age school, where she rubs shoulders with older kids every day.  Once they turned her on to Harry, the jig was up.  We now read HP from these paperback editions at bedtime every night of the week.  These cheap copies are perfect for young kids, no sweat if they get dogeared and stained and lost, and when she outgrows them, as I'm guessing she will, no tears about giving them to the library, a neighbor, or the recycling bin.<br/><br/>Questionable as this stuff is as literature, I find that listening to the stories and struggling to read these books has enhanced our little one's reading and comprehension abilities enormously.  She can rattle off every little detail she's heard.  She makes up guessing games to play with us about the most obscure characters.  The books are at a reading level far beyond her years, but she is motivated to press ahead trying to read them on her own.<br/><br/>Word to the wise, however.  The Harry Potter movies are definitely NOT for young children.  There is quite a lot of violence in them.  They have enormous visual and sonic impact.  I watched a few to see what was there because our girl insisted she had to see them.  They were a bit much for me to watch. I'm quite certain she will not be prepared to do so for some time to come.
 Good book.
 What can I say? Harry Potter, excellent.
 AMAZING! Just as beautiful as the first one.
 Now, I'm a Harry Potter fan--I've read all the books, seen all the movies, espoused the entire mythology surrounding the saga, and championed the series as a pivotal development in YA literature. J.K. Rowling might singlehandedly be responsible for getting teenagers interested in reading again. I admire her and the series for their ability to excite kids about literature, assuming--that is--that their fondness for reading propels them beyond books of the Harry Potter sort (as a literacy educator, that is my hope).<br/><br/>So it was with great anticipation that I delayed my reading of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final installment of Rowling's epic masterpiece. Perhaps no novel can live up to the hype surrounding the publication of this last Harry Potter opus--when it was published, there was enormous publicity, and fans raced to buy it and read it the moment it hit the shelves. We all knew what was coming--the apocalyptic battle between our hero and the Dark Lord, Voldemort himself. I waited to read this one--I knew it would be my last chance to experience a new Harry Potter novel, and I was hoping that this final part of the series would be the magnum opus, quite literally the Harry Potter novel to end all Harry Potter novels. I wanted this novel to somehow epitomize all the wonderful and wondrous aspects of the series that have made it so popular and so enchanting to millions of readers. And, alas, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The story itself was rather satisfying. It all ends pretty much as you expect it would, and Rowling throws in a couple of clever twists. We learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, and we finally learn of Snape's true motives. As a finale, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" does everything a finale is supposed to do--answer the big questions, tie up loose ends, showcase the final epic confrontation between good and evil, and provide a fitting ending to a charming saga.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, it lacks some of the elements that have made the first six Harry Potter books so quintessentially Harry Potteresque--the overwhelming majority of the action does not take place at Hogwarts (which deprives the story of the strong anchor that setting has always provided), Dumbledore is of course absent from all but a few chapters, Hagrid makes only a few cameo appearances, and Harry spends a lot of time brooding. I usually rip through a Harry Potter novel, but this one felt more like a chore than an adventure. I began the novel sad that my Harry Potter adventure would soon end, but I finished the novel grateful that it did.
 Good quality and nieces love it
 With all of the hype over the supposed last book in the Harry Potter series, I did end up buying this one. (pre-order! It's the way to go!) I'm glad that I did. While it did have a slightly different feel to it than the others, it was still a good read. I was slightly disappointed during the middle of the book where J.K. Rowling filled the book with pages of what the book could have easily done without. Nonetheless, in the end, I have to say it was a great book. I won't ruin the story for you- read it for yourself.
 Beautiful, just beautiful!
 Books are obviously great, but there are some printing issues. Certain pages are a bit faded, or there are a few words that are blotched over.
 It is the size of ab textbook
 Lovely edition and a great price!
 Like the other books in the series Harry Potter  and the Deathly Hallows is another prove of the amazing imagination that author possess. This book has everything you expect and more, it has action, drama, friendship, love, life and death. I'm strongly recommend the whole series as a must read for children, teens and everyone who is interested in the amazing universe created by J.K. Rowling, and if you are like me learning english in your adulthood I think is a nice way to introduce yourself to english literature, because of its easy reading structure.
 Great Christmas gift for kids.
 This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old and she absolutely loves them.  These are paperback and come in a cardboard box, not a collector's edition.  Amazon had the cheapest price and neither my daughter nor I cared if the covers were the new or the old art.  She is already on the third book and neither of us have any complaints.  The first three books have held up well even after being thrown in my daughter's back pack day after day.  The bottom line, I wanted the cheapest price for a great story/series and I am just happy to see my child read willingly!
 My son loved Book Set, read them all in two weeks
 I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.I read it because I want to finish the series before I finish fourth grade.Harry's birthday is coming,he can't wait to go to Hogwarts,but then a strange creature comes and tries to stop Harry from going to Hogwarts and stops Harry's friends letters.The creature makes mischief and Harry is caged but he finds a way to get to Hogwarts.  Harry has to face a new seeker in Quidditch,a strange spirit in the girls bathroom,a new defense against the dark arts teacher,go to a death day party,and there are strange things happening in Hogwarts.All the muggle borns and squibs are getting petrified.Who is trying to destroy Hogwarts?My favorite part of the book is when Professor Lockhart lets the pixies loose.They lift people by their ears,make mischief,and take professor Lockhart's wand.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves magical creatures or anyone who wants to finish the Harry Potter series.
 These books are perfect!!!
 I have read all three books, and all I want is MORE!  I haven't read any book this fast since Star Wars: Episode I and The Hobbit!  The only regret I had after finishing each book was that there wasn't more book to read!  These books are absolutely great, and are one of the best ways I've ever  seen to get kids to read (nevermind the demographic who's actually buying  the books, which is just about everybody)!  I really hope Rowling writes  FOUR MORE!
 great series
 Love it
 I needed to finish last book before watching the video.
 Take the wonderful musings and writings of JK Rowling, add the fun of Harry Potter and his cohorts, mix it all together and have it read by Jim Dale and you have a sure winner.  Even though I had read all 7 of the Potter books at least 3 times, having them "read" to me was just as exciting as reading the books for the first time.  If I'm not mistaken, Jim Dale won a Grammy for the reading of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - he did all the voices - over 100 of them for that book.  But in all the books he not only uses his inflection to tell the story emotionally, but through the use of different voices for different characters, the stories come to life. (The voices of Hagrid, Professor McGonagall and Mundungus Fletcher being my very favorite!)<br/>Although the collection may seem a bit pricey - it's worth every single cent. (Especially since once you finish listening to the first book you can't wait to move on to the 2nd...immediately!)
 I stood in line at midnight on July 21, 2007 to get this book.  I took my (then) 12-year-old daughter and her best friend home and we all began reading while sitting in my sunroom at 2:00 in the morning.  Over the next couple of days, I savored this book from beginning to end - putting it down if I wasn't fully concentrating on it since I didn't want to spoil the experience.  Just a few days ago I picked it up and re-read it in anticipation of the last movie coming out and I have to say I enjoyed the experience all over again.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to review this book independently of the series since story threads and characters run throughout the series of seven books.  What I will say is that the entire series of books captured the imaginations of millions of fans for a reason.  The creativity and storytelling are hard to match especially in the world of YA fiction.  At the time of the publications, most of the YA literature was either too serious for its intended audience (winning lots of awards handed out by adults, read in the classrooms and largely disliked by the students themselves).  Over the years the material available to this age group has taken a decided turn for the worse particularly as it relates to young women/girls --- there are just too many books about girls behaving badly and making poor choices which are inconsistent with the values many of us want to instill in our daughters.  Harry Potter is (and was) a refreshing change from all of that.  It's good versus evil and brains (particularly Hermione) over brawn over and over again yet told so incredibly well that the lessons aren't even that noticeable.<br/><br/>Books that will appeal to young readers as well as older ones, the final installment does the series proud.  I actually enjoyed it more the second time around as I was better able to notice the nuances versus just trying to find out what happened.  It was like a tapestry where the individual threads are all woven together to form a masterpiece which is most appreciated in its final form.<br/><br/>A wonderful series, a wonderful book and thrilled I was able to go along for the ride!
 We’re huge Harry Potter fans. Reading to our 10 month old now.
 Great Books , good delivery. I will be proud giving these books for a gift .
 Great product!
 From the first few pages I knew we were in for a treat and that Rowling would truly amaze us with this her last effort in the Harry Potter series.  I was not disappointed.  Where the first 6 books showed some action and hinted at a ton more, this 7th book packed the action in virtually every chapter.  I will not reveal any of the plot, although virtually everyone probably knows it by now, but I will say that the raw emotions and feelings that this book evoke are just amazing.<br/><br/>Some authors drag on their series and end up writing horribly by the end, having used up their stock of scenes.  Rowling certainly finished her series with a bang and a flourish and showed us really and truly why her series have sold so many books.  Not only did she write well but the plot and storylines present through all the books came through and tied up perfectly.  For this I am grateful, not only for her writing, but for what she was able to do in creating something so powerful that millions of people, people that would otherwise not read, would read, talk and become excited.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows is her best book by far.  You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>5 stars
 "To Kill A Mockingbird" until now, was my favorite book of all time. I say that to let you know, I am no "spring chicken". In all fairness, "Deathly Hallows" power lies in the fact that it represents the entire series. Having said that however, that's also what puts so much pressure on it to deliver - and it does. By now, everyone has probably read a synopsis or review so I'll spare you that but will suggest, if you're having withdrawal and looking for reading to help, try Douglas Adams "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" Series.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Ultimate-Hitchhiker-s-Guide-Five-Complete-Novels-and-One-Story-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0517226952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide: Five Complete Novels and One Story (Deluxe Edition)</a>
 The books condition is pretty good. The only thing is there is a few rinkles but that doesn’t really bother me too much.
 Gift
 I really, really enjoyed the book. I feel it moved at a good pace, had good plot development, and she definitely went on killing spree. Definitely a great coming of age book though. I feel Rowling really did a great job finishing the series, and tying up a lot of the loose ends. I feel she answered a lot questions I had about the series too. Also I think it really shows how much she had planned from the beginning as well. It was just very entertaining, and I definitely didn't really want to put the book down.
 Good for the soul. Good Vs evil. I read these books to my grandkids and they love them.  Family bonding time.
 Nice to have the set on my kindle app. Fun lunch hour read
 Totally worth it!
 A+
 My 10 year old and I both love this series!!
 Really liked the books been a fan and these are the set besides the paper cover it's 5🌟
 OK here it is, my wife already owns three complete sets of Harry Potter.  My family and I love the Harry Potter books and movies.  So I wanted to provide her with something that she would charish and save for years to come.  So I thought purchasing this bookset with an authentic looking Harry Potter book case "WHAT APPEARED TO BE REAL WOOD!!" would have been great.  I am deeply upset that the box is made of cardboard.  If I had known this, I would not have purchased this set and would have made a box.  I cannot find where the company has misled us in writing, but clearly the photo makes the box look like real wood.  The company should make this right and either purchase wood chests or have them made.
 I loved all the Harry Potter books. I have to have these illiustrated ones also! The pictures are so beautiful!
 J.K. Rowling didn't just finish the story of Harry Potter by simply carrying us to the end with all the secrets we longed to read.  She added new and interesting concepts to the ongoing story, as well as wonderfully intense mystery elements for a combination that makes the book more pleasing than the rest.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the perfect ending to one of the greatest stories of our time.<br/><br/>This book is magnificent because of all the solid work that went into every story, every character and every line of all seven books.  J.K. Rowling is an amazing storyteller, and I hope she continues to turn out great books in the future.
 I waited for this book to arrive with excitement and with dread because I knew it was the end.  Even after it arrived, I put off reading it for almost a day because I knew after I started it I would spend every waking moment reading it and then it would be over.<br/><br/>Rowling did not disappoint me.  So many questions from earlier books were answered and loose ends tied together.  I do wish I had reread the whole series before DH arrived.  I had a little trouble remembering things that were referred to from earlier books.  The last few chapters left me in tears.  I don't think I've ever cried over a book before.  It was that powerful emotionally to me.<br/><br/>I would love to see JKR come up with another series but the sheer genius and magic of Harry Potter will probably never be equaled.  Thank you, JKR, for taking us with you on the journey of Harry Potter.  I'm looking forward to starting the series in a few years with my son.  He's just turned six and ought to be ready for the first book in a year or two.<br/><br/>In case you couldn't tell, I highly recommend this book!
 great set of books. my nieces loved it. our family has proper potterheads in the new generation now. :)
 LOVE
 I loved this book! It was my second time reading it, because I am obsessed with hogwarts and it was even better!
 I was pretty pleased with the way the series ended.  I was completely hooked throughout the book and I liked that many questions I had were answered, but that the author left some things to the imagination.  If everything had been tied up too neatly I don't think it would have been as good a book.  My only compliant is that some parts were a little cheesy to me, but I could easily get lost in the story so it wasn't that big of a deal to me.
 The 7th Harry Potter book could have been a let-down, but it wasn't. This book was quite possibly my favorite of the series. This is timeless fiction for all ages and will surely continue to thrill new generations of fans, just as Tolkein and C.S. Lewis have done.
 I waited until my daughter was ready to read theses books,  and never realized what I missed.
 The best ending ever in a harry potter book eh disk snacks disk disk disk disk is j John poop
 Books came as advertised, all 7 with jackets in excellent condition... my daughter is excited
 Note: This is a review of the set of paperback editions with illustrations by Kazu Kibuishi, not of Harry Potter itself. It goes without saying that I am a big fan of the series!<br/><br/>I have all the hardbacks of the books, bought as they came out, but when I saw this set I knew I'd end up ordering it. And ultimately, I'm glad I did - it's worth it. First, a brief word - if you're buying these for collector's purposes, you may want to order offline. I purchased mine straight from Amazon and still have some bent and beaten corners.<br/><br/>The illustrations are wonderfully done, taking inspiration from the books rather than just from the movies. The classic Mary GrandPre drawings are still present for the individual chapter images, but Kibuishi's art is on every other surface - the back and front cover of each book show memorable scenes (my favorite being the back of OotP - Harry and friends in front of the deserted doors of the Department of Mysteries, eerily lit). Then, of course, there is the image of Hogwarts spanning the spines of the books. The box itself has more illustration on all three sides, and peering at it, one can really see the care the artist held for these books. The trio, Dumbledore, Hagrid, and the Hogwarts Express are instantly recognizable figures, but in these scenes from Hogsmeade you can also spy a little Malfoy and cronies, Luna being, well, Luna, the storefront of Zonko's Joke Shop, and students from various houses (and yes, the Ravenclaw scarves are blue and bronze). Even the very top of the box isn't left plain, although there aren't any drawings on it. I think these illustrations will come to be just as treasured as GrandPre's.<br/><br/>The quality of the set is, for the most part, good. The covers of the books are rather unique, coated in some velvety, matte material with a nice drag to it that feels durable. The embossed 'Harry Potter' on each book is shiny and stands out well. (I confess to just 'petting' the books at times.) The box is sturdy cardboard, not easily bent. However, there are two problems I have with the production. One, the paper is quite thin, and seems like it might be prone to warping, which is a shame. It's not thin enough to see other pages through, but it's just not sturdy, and feels even thinner than the generic paper I'd use in a home printer. To be honest, it reminds me of what you'd find in a mass market paperback, just less grainy and whiter. Second, getting the books in and out of the box can be a chore! I'd recommend storing them out of the box if you plan on picking them up and putting them back frequently. It's just a tad too small, and this, combined with the high friction from the cover material, means the books need to be forced and finagled in, which would not be kind to the corners over time. (A tip - slip them all in part of the way, then turn the box and let gravity take care of the rest all at once, rather than trying to put the last one in by itself.) I don't know why they made the box so small - when all the books are in, the sides bow out. It's just not practical.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of the series and would like a beautiful set, I'd recommend picking this one up - at Amazon's pricing, it's a pretty good deal; less than $10 a book. Just be aware that the paper quality is lacking and that the box, while lovely, is not an ideal storage solution.
 It’s Harry Potter... you can never go wrong with it!
 perfect gift
 I finished watching the latest Harry Potter movie, Order of the Phoenix.  It did not demonstrate respect for fans.  Many touches that should have been there were missing.  Actor or director, I don't know, but the movie missed much of the magic and wonder that we expect.  I was unsure if the last book would leave me with that same flatness.  No.  Ms. Rowling came through.  More wonder, more growth, more twists and a double ending that felt right. I'd made predictions to my son as to the fate of some characters, whether Snape was Dumbledore's man or Voldemort's, and who was involved in the first theft of the lake horcrux - often rather generally, such as, it will be this type of character who accomplishes this.  My  predictions were fulfilled, always more creatively and definitely more specifically than my general thoughts.  She remained consistent, which is difficult over the space of 7 novels.  She respected her readers enough not to make this merely a wrap up.  She gave all of us a gift.  I enjoyed it, and after reading through rapidly, went back to re-read it in more detail immediately.
 It's a very beautiful set.
 I love this book.  I can't tell you how it ends but as a Harry Potter reader it was a great book.  If you haven't started reading this books you should start.  I'm more of a romance novel reader but this book kept my attention through all of the years of Harry.
 Usually in series or in a triology, the first book is very good and then the second is good and the third is not bad and so on, but here we have a sequel which is as good as the first book. I dont know why it is placed in the childrens section , a must for all people of all ages, anyone with a  little bit of imagination
 People get "collectors sets" for the extras and pretty packaging. Yes, the books are amazing, but the "pretty box" is junk with a cheep plastic latch. I saw this here months ago and was just miserable because I was too broke to buy it. It looked so cool in the picture that I almost went ahead and put it on my credit card. Boy am I glad I didn't! The other day I saw they had it at Borders so I had to go and see and...<br/><br/>CARDBOARD?!<br/><br/>Like other people I didn't expect it to be stained hardwood, but did it have to be this chintzy, flimsy cardboard? It has all the durability and quality of a Happy Meal box and the display pic has clearly been digitally altered. Bad form, Amazon and Rowling! I so won't be buying this piece of junk. Just buy the books.
 Amazing photos, great layout! Books I already love in an even easier format to share with my children!
 Love the packaging and great for gift.
 When I saw this package advertised in July I thought it would be perfect to keep and never read. I already have all seven books and from reading them I have slightly damaged them. The box looked fantastic online. The reall product however was pathetic! Mine is dented from delivery and ofcourse not worth a dime! How could they ever think to call this a collectors item? I honestly feel I should have gone and bought new hard cover copies and put them away in my own box. The older books are cheaper now that the newer books are out and I would have saved, if not a lot of money, some. I like many others bought the collection for the box. Which looks only slightly like the picture advertised.
 as described
 Enjoyed it ! We love Harry Potter !!
 Wonderful books. I am on the third book and I am thoroughly enjoying this set. I recently had surgery and decided to read the series and see what all the hype was about since I had the time off. I am glad I did. I don't normally read fantasy type books, but these are super. The author is a very talented writer and keeps your interest up. A fun read for anyone. I am 57 years young.
 I only read these books because my sister is an elementary school teacher and she told me that as an high school English teacher I should read them for learning purposes.  I have to admit that after reading the first book, I couldn't wait to read the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and when it comes out, the 5th.  Although these books aren't the most well written (compared to some other children's classics) they embody the things that people, children and adults alike, deal with on a day to day basis.  As a teacher, I can use themes from the books to teach social issues in literature class.  The best part is that the high school kids have either read the books or WANT to read them.  Getting them to read is a challenge...but they want to read Harry Potter, so I'm all for it!
 I admit when I first started the book, I still liked Half-blood Prince better.  As I read I found that I could not stop reading.  This book by far exceeded any expectation I had.  It was written well and answered the questions that were raised throughout the whole series.  The last 3 chapters were worth the price of the book.  With the exception of the Lord of the Rings, this book brought closure to the end that we rarely see in literature these days.  Buy it...the book is fantastic!
 I found this book to be on par with the most recent set of books in the series written by J. K. Rowling. As I read through we went through slow portions (about 150 pages in the front half of the book) as well as areas completed chocked full of action and critical events. Reading through, I found there were many times that I could not stand any of the characters and other times where the characters would do endearing things.  I really appreciate the variety of emotions I feel about the characters, as it gives the main characters some depth by letting them make their own decisions instead of being the saints that everyone thinks they are. If I had to fault any of the time spent on the characters, it is the lack of Draco Malfoy. His character is missed in much of the book as the previous antagonist, playing completely second fiddle to the unadulterated evil of Voldemort. In fact you spend so much time with the main three that you might even get a little tired of them.<br/><br/>So in the end, this is a fitting conclusion to a series that bordered on serious and silly, but created a rich world that you could almost believe in.
 There's nothing bad about Harry Potter, I never read it when I was younger and the book has great quality
 What more can I say about Harry Potter and his world?  It is absolutely amazing as you become engrossed into each book, each chapter, each page, each word.  The books have helped rejuvenate the reading monster that laid dormant within my soul for the last few years.  I read all 6 books in 3 weeks.  I started Order of the Phoenix on a Friday and finished it late Saturday night and started the Half-Blood Prince Sunday morning to complete it by Monday afternoon!  I recommend all of these books to children, teenagers, and adults alike.  There are those out there that are hesitant about the books and solely see the movies.  I was a skeptic.  I am a former College Quarterback and had heard great things about the books, but never considered it.  Then one day I took a leap of faith and began reading and I've never looked back.  Thank you JK Rowling and I love Harry Potter and his world!
 Most fantasy series have trouble ending.  They drag and leave the reader feeling unfulfilled at a rushed conclusion.  Just look at any of Robert Jordan's books.  Or, they last forever like R.A. Salvatore's books.  J.K. Rowling has done something amazing in how she ended this book.  She satisfies all of your expectations, and leaves you content that the book has ended.  I mean, I'd prefer more books, but Rowling has truly ended the series.
 Exactly what I expected. I was worried about missing pages, but I flipped through. Everything was there!
 Must have if you enjoy Harry Potter.
 Harry at his best!! Even reading it multiple times! JK Rowling a very gifted writer! Always a joy and comfort to read her stories!
 Sorcerer's Stone and Order of the Pheonix were both missing about 50 pages, I would order a different set to try and mitigate mistake.
 Beautiful boxed set. Fast delivery.
 Daughter loves them
 My 11 year old daughter found the magic in reading with the help of J.K. Rowling. After reading the first book, The sorcere's<br/>stone, my daughter was hooked, it was the first time she had finished a "big book" she is so into the story. It makes my heart sore and my eyes water when i go into her room an hour after she has gone to bed to tell her to turn her light out, put the book away and go to sleep, and she pleads with me sayin<br/>" ohh mom just one more chapter please!"<br/>the story and characters are so alive. You become drawn into the magic.<br/> I owe a huge bit of gratitude to J.K. Rowling. She has gotten my daughter away from the TV and into the world of reading.<br/>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
 These are not the illustrated version!
 Great gift for my 10 yr old son who simply loves reading
 This book is the greatest ending to the greatest story of all time. Voldy is now moldy and I can live a happy life.
 This book was so worth the wait. J.k. Rowling did an amazing job taking us through Harry's final journey. It was a gripping, exciting, happy, and sorrowful story full of so many surprises that it kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole tale. I am just so sad that it was the final book in the series but will be anxiously awaiting Rowling's next series of books. Bottom line- an absolutely awesome read!
 I read and re-read it all the time. Fantastic! My all time favorite! Thank you J.K. Rowling for Harry Potter.
 This book had all the suspense of Mission Impossible, as Harry and his supporters are put through their paces to stay alive--let alone find and destroy the missing horcruxes set up in Half-Blood Prince, while evading capture.<br/><br/>Of the many deaths and lives destroyed throughout the book, the one that carried the most poignancy was for a non-human character.  I don't want to say more, as that could be a spoiler.<br/><br/>On a down note, description for some of the action in the final chapter was confusing; I had to re-read and still not sure I get it.  Also, the epilogue was equally confusing, trying to keep track of all the names thrown around with little context.  In the end, I don't think the epilogue really added anything for me.  HOWEVER--that's not to say this isn't a great book; it is.  Well-written, packed with enough stories and adventures for 2 books, strong, believable characterizations and moral complexity that adds much to the story.  After re-reading the first book a few weeks ago, it's hard to believe how skillfully Rowling pulls off the evolution of the tone, from something appropriate for a 10-year old to something as rich as DEATHLY HALLOWS.
 I write this review not in hopes that people will read it and be suddenly inspired to read Deathly Hallows, for all those who are Harry Potter fans will read his epic final tale regardless of what I have to say. I write this review as a sort of closure for myself, a true potter fan since the beginning.<br/>This last tale, like its predecessors, was enthralling, witty, suspenseful and to say the least, magical.<br/>Despite that just about every single Potter fan had a theory on the series' ending, I payed attention to only what I believed would result in the final chapters. While I won't be revealing any details about what that final outcome was, (just in case there is someone reading this who hasn't already read the book) I would like to say that Rowling left us with something incredibly true to the book's story line and its characters.<br/>Just like 2 million other Harry Potter fans, I pre-ordered the book and immediately ripped it open after recieving the package. Throughout the following four hours it took me to read, I have to admit I did spend a lot of time in tears. Because I have grown up with these books, every time a character died I felt as if someone close to me was gone. The overall vibe I got from the novel was that of sorrow that the series was finally over.<br/>Just by reading each book in the series a ridiculous amount of times, I feel like I know each and every character, just as I am sure many of the Harry Potter fans do. However, that makes me wonder as to just how difficult this finalization has been for Rowling, the creator of not only each individual character, but of the entire wizarding communtity and world.<br/>Even though I consider Rowling to be a fantasy-writing genious, I doubt she nor anyone will be able to top these novels for years to come.<br/>I am left with a bittersweet taste in my mouth. I love these books, but I don't think that I will be able to revisit the world of Harry Potter for quite some time.
 Great book set. My granddaughter was ecstatic!
 As a Harry Potter fan, I was looking forward to book 7, but at the same time, I didn't think I was ready for the end of the series.<br/><br/>I must say that JK Rowling did not dissapoint me at all with this book.<br/><br/>There was so much to take in and feel for every single character in the book. It was non-stop all the way through and I feel a little drained from reading it, but it was well worth it.<br/><br/>I can say that it was absolutely spectacular, a true literary adventure, and I am very content with how it ended. I feel happy, yet very sad all at the same time.<br/><br/>All hail JK Rowling because she deserves it. I tip my hat to her.
 Very pleased with my order. The books were in excellent shape. Will be buying again from this seller❤
 Got this set for my sister for Christmas and she loved it!!
 Best series of all time. Love every story line in these books! Its gripping from beginning to end. Must read!
 I gave this as a Christmas present and my brother absolutely loves them. He says that it's a great read.
 I had never read the Harry Potter series before seeing all of the movies. However, my fiancee read them before each movie, and she has been encouraging me to read them for awhile.<br/><br/>I am glad that I did! I do not always believe the general assumption that "the book is better than the movie," but it is the case with this series.  There are a lot of little side stories that the book adds that the movie did not have time to play through, such as the ghosts that appear in the first movie, which play a bigger role in the other books but not the movies.  To be fair to the movies, they have stayed pretty true to the books whenever they did not leave things out, and the few divergences are usually to add humor.<br/><br/>Regardless of age, I definitely suggest the series.
 Jim Dale, who reads/preforms all of the Harry Potter audio books, is an extremely talented reader.  He does realistic voices for each of the different characters, in varying accents (English, Scottish, etc.) that are incredibly genuine.  I've read all of the books at least twice, but I feel like I get so much more (if that's possible!) out of the audio versions because Jim Dale's acting is so accurate.  His inflections and timing are perfect, and he is very articulate.  I listen to the HP books over and over in my car on the way to work, and (after at least 50 combined playings) have yet to get sick of them.  A must have for all HP fans and lovers of literature.
 Bought this as a gift. I learned that my brother and sister-in-law had never read the story. I was shocked.
 I pride myself in encouraging my children to read.  I also like to know what they are reading.  Thus I picked up their book of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets after reading the first.  I must say these books are very well written and are so visually discriptive I can actually picture what the surroundings look like based by J.K. Rowlings words.  Yes I have seen the movie and I am very proud of how well they kept to the book, mostly.  I am now reading the fourth and plan on reading the whole series with my children.
 The time it arrived was a huge disappointment. One of the corner was already ruined during shipment (the package box apparently was way too big for the book set).<br/>So I called costumer service for exchange. They were very nice and agreed to make a specially replacement to make sure it won't happen again. And they used an overnight delivery for the replacement! So I forgave you amazon.<br/>This time everything is so perfect. It is a very beautiful edition of harry potter. But be aware that the only change of this edition is the covers for the books. Illustrations for each chapters are still the same.<br/>If you are buying this as a gift, be aware of the risk of shipment damage.
 The set looks lovely in its box. However... the books are not as well-made as I'd thought they might be in this special edition.<br/>Up sides:<br/>Heavy-duty boxed set<br/>Beautiful artwork and covers<br/>Paper "feel" is pleasant<br/>Down sides:<br/>Books fit VERY tightly in box; you have to shake them out and very carefully replace to keep from damaging the covers<br/>Book binding/glue is tight and stiff, making it hard to open the books very far<br/>Page paper is extremely thin<br/><br/>I would recommend this set for collectors who are not terribly picky about having the highest-quality set. It's a fine set, but it's not going to be a family heirloom.
 The only things better than reading Harry Potter is listening to Jim Dale's narration, and the variety of voices that bring the story to life. You will not be dissappointed. My only caveat is that the tapes will probably wear out if you listen to it as often as my family does. Next time I'm going for the CD version.
 Nice Set.
 Over my years I have become captivated, as many others have, by the Harry Potter Series! From the books, to the movies, to the paintings, and posters, and so many more lovely keepsakes, this book set is one of the best! The art work on the box and on each of the book's covers is amazing! The art on these represents the series very well! Most of the people who have left reviews are complaining about the "un-sturdy" box the books come with. The box is not the highest of quality but it is sturdy to hold 7 books! I purchased this set for $58 which is a great price for all 7 books and the box! I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to read the Harry Potter Series!!!
 Great value for the set of books
 This advertised as coming with a chest to contain the books. I never did receive one.
 I decided to finally read the Harry Potter books and I am glad I did! Can’t.Stop.Reading! Highly recommend to everyone no matter what age you won’t be disappointed
 Personally, I think this is my favorite book of the series.  I only hope the producer of the newest film doesn't get the job of doing this movie!!<br/><br/>The book does have the drawn out part of them on the run, after Ron left it just felt that it was going on forever....BUT it more than made up for it once things got on a roll.  WOW  is all I have to say for the second half of the book.  I absolutely adore Rowling's writing style and she does not let me down!<br/><br/>The only thing I have to say about the ending....SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT!!!<br/><br/>I don't think that she wrapped all the loose ends.  Had I not read it in an interview, I would not have known what Harry did for a living.  That was such an intrical part of the other books, it was always being mentioned.  That I felt we should have been told a bit more about what he did.  I, also hope that Kreacher made Sirius' house a home for him and Ginny!!  I love thinking of them raising their kids there.
 rowling pulled off the almost impossible by coming around with a suitable conclusion to her series.  well written, well detailed, totally in character, with definite hints as to the political parallells of today and yesterday.<br/>  the battle at hogwarts is still one of the all time best moments... i found myself getting teary about a house elf....<br/><br/>  overall a suitable ending. it does not disappoint.
 J.K. Rowling is a great story teller!  I'm just sad that this is the last HP.
 My 12 year old step-son now has the complete Harry Potter book set in hardcover.  I purchased an excellent copy through Amazon for a third of the retail price at the local bookstore...and it was delivered to my front door.  What a deal!
 There are spoilers below so please stop reading is you don't want to know what happens.<br/><br/>I first read this final book in the Harry Potter saga the day it came out.  Read it in one sitting.  Needless to say, I don't remember much.  It was a late night of reading.  So I've read it again.  I remember Rowling stating that 3 main characters would die in this book.  However, I felt there were more.  Death hits right of the bat with Hedwig, this was very sad, poor owl.  Then Mad-Eye, Fred Weasly, Tonks, Lupin, Snape, Voldermort, Dobby, and Harry.  The Horcruxes were much more understandable and Albus' black hand was explained as well.  I recommend you read the books one right after the other.  All the Horcruxes and other little things from the previous books come together in this book.  It's a very moving book as Harry has to face his own death.  Once the story of Snape is revealed, it's hard to hate him completely.  Everything he did for love of a woman.  Rowling did a great job with Snape; nasty as he was he turns out to be a bit of a hero.<br/><br/>Once Voldermort is killed, the book then shifts into the Epilogue which takes place 19 years later.  I wish there was more to this.  Draco and his family survived and he and Harry meet each other on platform 9 ¾ when sending off their children.  However, all that is exchanged is a nod between them.  I'd like to have seen more, after all, a big part of the last book and this book revolved around him appointed to killing Dumbledore.  It would have been nice to know what exactly Ron and Harry do now that they are adults.  Who's the new headmaster of Hogwarts, and what of Luna?<br/><br/>I've read on the net Rowling is going to write another book in the series, but it could be 10 years from now.  I'm eager for another book on Harry Potter as I do truly love these books.  Movies are pretty good too, although the books are better (but that's normal for movies made from books).
 I have to say after watching the Harry Potter and the Order of Phenix movie, I was a little disappointed. The movie simplely cut off a lot of the details that I think are important for the movie viewers to understand how the characters grow in the stories afterwards. After reading the book, however, I am very satisfied with the story. The plots are VERY nicely put together. I expecially love the chapter that Harry Potter finally confronts Lord Voldermont. I also applause Rowling's efforts into the writing of Harry Potter series. It brings the people back to reading!!! If you are a fan of Harry Potter and his magical world, you have "GOT" to READ the book.
 Liked it all it is a great book I wish j.k Rowling wrote more books I enjoy reading her books so much😁😁😁😁
 Be careful, some spoiler!! I like the book I lot but I was expecting more. First, Harry never showed to be better than his friends, the 3 main characters were the same level for me but Harry always took the credit. In the sixth book, after Dumbledore dies, I was sad but I thought it was necessary so now Harry was going to show how powerful wizard he was because Dumbledore was not there to help, but he didn't. So his dead didn't make any difference. Harry was, as Snape once said, always helped by luck and by cleverer friends, I was hoping for a change.  Even when I think her idea makes sense, she plotted Harry as a mistake done by Voldemort and not as a real hero. In the other hand I have to admit that Harry did have many good qualities but again, Hermione was as honest and selfless as he was and even cleverer. Second, Rowling didn't said what Harry's parents did for living and, what about Harry's relatives from his father's side? The deaths were no so touching because she didn't explain how they died, not even who killed them.  The hallows, the title of the book, was not a very important part. I guess it was an important part of Dumbledore's story and weakness, but not a main point for Harry. I think it would have made more sense if she said that Harry survive the second to the last of Voldemor'st attacks because at that point he was already the owner of the three hollows. Finally, did Harry become an Auror? He always wanted this and I was so curious to know if he did it or not.<br/>In the other hand I like what happened with Snape, I didn't expected a lovely reconciliation between Harry and him because there was so much bitterness in their relationship and for me was surprising how much Snape helped Harry. I like that he knew about Snape in the pensieve because a conversation between them was going to be too simple and nobody else was going to be able to tell the truth but Snape himself.<br/>In general I like the book so much. There were very good situations and battles. Even when I don't agree with the way things happened, I think she can make sense of them. The seven books were excellent and I have to say that she is a really good writer, but nobody is perfect!
 As advertised, they are books.
 As in the other Harry Potter books, the reader is totally absorbed into the storyline. A great read!
 a beautiful picture on the spine and such a great story. always.
 Gift for my GF and she absolutely enjoys it.
 I am a college student reading children's books for one of my classes.  I had heard so much about Harry Potter from one of my younger cousin's I had  to read it.  This book was wonderful. I love to read and thats what I'm  going to school for is to be a reading teacher.  I would recommend this  book to anyone.  The reason I liked this book so much is it kept my  attention and I couldn't put it down.  The content was wonderful and it  made me laugh along the way.  I am going to read the whole series now. If  your looking for something to read this is it.  It doesn't matter how old  you are.
 I got hooked right from the start on this series, desire the fact that I am in my thirties and the series was "ment" for kids. I guess it goes to show that there is a kid inside all of us and mine is doing quite well thank you.<br/>I loved this book just as much as the first, what with Harry seemingly defeating Riddle aka Lord Voldermort yet again. All the characters I am growing to love, living and growing before my eyes. :) On to the next!<br/><br/>Favorite quote: "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Page 252 Prof. Dumbeldore<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling's got an amazing way to get right down inside you, how can you not love this series?
 ...as the day when it came out. JK Rowling wrote an incredible story that has stayed with me for years.
 Book was in great condition.  My son loved it.
 Love the books. And the movies. Wish she would write more potter books. Hopefully she will add more after the cursed child.
 This book was difficult to read, I didn't want the series to end and that flavoured by reading. I enjoyed every page and found myself (once again) laughing with the characters, crying w/ pivotal losses, and feeling satisfied at the book's end.<br/><br/>JKR has done a fantastic job of getting in the characters' heads and conveying the teenaged angst regarding schoolwork, friendship, relationships, fears, and love. This book was more young adult leaning in some passages, but the characters are now young men and women and felt appropriate---they've grown and so their banter and train of thought has.<br/><br/>I was despondent with certain deaths and found myself having to stop reading momentarily and then hungrily go back to the book. I know that JKR has been criticized for her writing, but I think those criticisms are unfair. For instance, her use of adverbs and the criticism stemming from this is really unwarranted. I think that the critics have not closely read the book and realized that JKR is writing in the voice of a tween or teenager and they often are melodramtic and flower their conversations with adverbs. Everything is so intense to them, remember!<br/><br/>I wish there was someway for JKR to write more in this series, prequels?
 I haven’t seen the HP collection as it was sent directly to the recipient, however she was thrilled at the gift. It arrived safely and expediently.<br/>Thank you.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a fitting end to the series that J K Rowling introduced us to the young orphan who discovers that he is the son of wizards.  The pace of Book 7 is much faster than the previous 2 installments and makes it hard to put the book down.  Although a much darker book with death and violence every other page, it truly does let Harry "grow up" with his friends and ties a lot of the loose ends back together. But, Ms. Rowling, although she has said this is the last Harry Potter book, certainly has left herself an out to leverage this series into another possible series or even a follow-up to this book.  A great read and a fitting conclusion (if it is the end!!)
 Nice edition.
 I have to admit that I saw the movies before reading the books. Although people have recommended reading the books first, I have always been picky about books I read. If it does not suck me in from the minute I begin to read, I will not read the book. JK Rowlings has done an excellent job drawing readers of all ages into the series. I received the books in the mail 3 weeks ago and I am almost done reading the 7th book (which is good considering how busy my summer has been). I will begin reading "Tales of Beedle The Bard" when finished with the series. There is a great deal more (obviously) to the books than the movies, which I love. If you haven't already read the books do so.
 My 7 year old and I have been borrowing these books and reading them together when I finally decided to purchase my own set.  I was really excited to see that a 7-book set was offered at such a great price! $115 for the entire series is so much less than what you'd pay to for the books individually at any book store.<br/><br/>I read the reviews about the disappointing "trunk" that the books come in, but I didn't buy it for the "trunk," I bought it for the books.  I have to say though, I don't think the quality is as bad as some people made it out to be.  Is it cardboard? Yes. However, mine is a pretty sturdy, thick cardboard that easily sustains the weight of all 7 books when lifting it by its handles.  I also think that the stickers are a fun addition and I'm sure my 7 year old will have lots of fun decorating it.  The box itself also serves a great purpose of preserving the books, so no complaints here!<br/><br/>The quality of the books themselves is just wonderful!  The pages aren't too thin, the binding is impecible and the jackets are crisp and new. I'm excited that I now have a set to call my own and read over and over and over again!
 I ordered this book in advance and Amazon guaranteed the shipping receipt date. However, Amazon was unable to meet that date. I should be angry and livid, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Amazon notified me immediately that they were unable to get my copy to me by the date guaranteed and they are refunding the full amount of the book. I'm delighted with the service that Amazon provides! I have been relying on them for several years now for most of my gift giving and personal shopping needs. This only further enhances my opinion of them.<br/><br/>As to the "...Deathly Hallows"...? Gripping, chilling, and thrilling are three great adjectives to use describing it. I believe it is a fitting ending to a wonderful series. Rowling has done her level best to not cheat the readers and to reward them for their dedication and alligience.<br/><br/>I won't say more since so many others have elaborated far more extensively.<br/><br/>However, since this is an Amazon review site, I thought my purchasing experience with this eagerly anticipated book warranted praise as well as the fine tome which I've only just completed.
 Very well made!
 Perfect for the Harry Potter enthusiasts. My 11 year old has been devouring them.
 With how popular this book was, I had to "rush" reading it so I wouldnt hit spoilers.. I read one and was very upset, and then someone "told" me another one after I said I didn't want to hear spoilers.. so after the first read I said "it was good but I didnt like X, Y and Z". Second time I read it it was WAY better I think because I enjoyed it more, took in more and didn't "miss" as much from rushing. It was great!
 I was skeptical about Harry Potter when my wife insisted I read it. I was amazed at how wonderful the book was! This is not just a childrens book. And as the books go on they get better and more advanced. I love them all. Wonderfully written and addicting. A must to anyone who has a heart for magic and mystery.
 This last installment of Harry Potter is my favorite.  The author answers all of your burning questions and ties things up quite nicely.  Action, magic, mystery, tragedy and love - this book has it all.  WOW, what a way to end an epic.  If I say too much, I may give something special away.  If you have never read Harry Potter, start with the first book and read till the end - you won't be disappointed (well, you may be when it ends).
 While this is my least favorite harry potter book, it is important to read it for the series.  It does contain a lot of important information for the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Many people do thoroughly enjoy this book in the series and for good reason.  Like all of the Harry Potter books, it contains action, drama, and a touch of humor.<br/><br/>I do recommend it to complete any Harry Potter Series.
 I got this as a language learning tool, to work on my Chinese vocabulary and grammar over the summer (during a break in my Chinese classes). I was given the idea from a language-learning fanatic, who said that reading a foreign version of a favorite book can do a lot to enhance your study, especially if traditional language-learning methods bore or fail you. I was going to buy the first book in the Harry Potter series, but this one was a little less expensive, and I enjoy it even more than Sorcerer's Stone anyway. It's been a great tool so far, especially comparing Chinese grammar alongside the English copy.
 I, too, cannot believe that the whole thing is finally over!  What a bittersweet feeling it is, to have all the loose ends wrapped up in such an IMMENSELY SATISFYING way, and yet at the same time experiencing a sense of loss because it has at last come to a close.  I found myself just staring, glazed over, at that scarlet inner back cover for a few minutes when I was done.  I know I'm not alone in feeling like I've just said goodbye to a dear friend.  And yet, I can't wait to reread the whole series from the beginning, knowing now what the "whole picture" is.  Still, the feeling of "not quite knowing" for all these years was so delicious!  This series is among the most epic fantasy series of our time, and appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.  A rousing toast to JKR!
 Who doesn't love harry potter?! Well I put off reading them for along time after they were out. If you love books at all you will love the harry potter series. The movies do not even do the books justice. The character development is just amazing. JK Rowling does a great job of writing from the perspective of an 11 year old boy all the way until he is 18 and gets the mentality of harry and his friends spot on for their ages. The books come in a nice box set shrink wrapped. Great set for anyone that likes books to own. And just a side note. These books are still so popular it is very difficult to find them in a second hand book store.
 perfect
 Halfway thru "The Order of the Phoenix," and have found at least a half dozen pages extremely faded.  One of them, I was unable to read entirely.  Would very much like a replacement for this book.  I posted 1 pic of a good page (for reference) and 3 pics of the faded ones I've found thus far.  I was hoping this would be a keepsake for when my kids get old enough to read, but the print quality of this one puts a blemish on an otherwise awesome series.
 Well, congratulations to Ms.Rowling, she really did an excellent job, not only on this book, but in captivating millions of people all around the world, with her incredible wit, heart, and imagination.<br/>That said, this book is excellent, the only reason why I left off (1) star is because it's not complete (she said we'd know EVERYTHING, no you won't), and the last chapter seemed to be tacked on to a already "finished" book.<br/><br/>To describe the book without giving it away, it's dark, much darker than any of the other Potter books, if you can imagine. It's the journey, not the destination that is the darkest, you learn more about Albus, Severus, Lupin, the mind of "He Who Must Not be Named", Ron, and countless others.<br/>Some parts definitely made me cry, and others made me scream with joy, and others made me mad @ the author, but even then, I understood her point.<br/>*Semi-Spoiler warning*<br/>"He who craps on you may not be your enemy, and he who wipes it away may not be your friend."<br/>Pardon my language, but you'll get it when you read the book.
 This book is a bit darker than the first book. It was okay, but it almost made me lose interest in reading the rest of the series, but I think I'll continue on with it anyway. I liked the parts where Harry speaks Parsel Tongue, but I hated the giant snake altogether. Rowling did a great job with description because I had no trouble imagining the snake and it's sounds; it's just not my cup of tea. I like Harry's relationship with his friends and I'd like to know a bit more about the lives of his enemies. I look forward to finishing the rest of the series because I really want to read Deathly Hallows.
 I love the entire Harry Potter series.  It transports the reader to a fantasy world full of mystery and intrigue, yet is appropriate and enjoyable for all ages.  To have this book in a leather-bound collector's edition makes it even more special.  I only wish all of the volumes were published this way.  This particular edition is leatherbound with gilt-covered page edges and comes with a protective clear sleeve cover.  I found my experience with the seller on Amazon to be very professional and pleasant.  I appreciate the fast shipping and quality customer service.
 This is perfect. Its a nice neat box with all the books.  Its a boxset, and I knew it wasn't going to be some treasure chest made of wood and metal, like some other people who reviewed the item must have thought.  Plus, there are pictures available on amazon to view the thing.<br/>Its AMAZING how different books are from the movies that are based on them.  If you like the movies, GET THE BOOKS. They explain so much more, give more insight, and things just make sense (for example, who the heck is Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs, who made the Marauder's map?)
 If your into Harry Poter, worth the money
 This is awesome. I love them. They are in great condition.
 these are so much cooler than i had expected; makes for an amazing gift
 I love reading and re-reading the Harry Potter series. I'd bought the books as they were released for my youngest daughter and have read them all many times. I just decided that I wanted the complete set for myself.<br/> The issues I've read about with the 'box'.. I can see where some might complain if they were wanting more out of it. I reinforced the corner areas and applied my stickers and am just overjoyed to have my very own set of books at a great buy!!!
 A commercial super success and  “Nothing succeeds like success” comes to mind.
 I own all of the Harry Potter hard cover books and now also have the soft cover. silly right? not for me, I have read those books at least 3-4 each. I have all the DVD's and also the talking books. I am, I hate to say it, but I am I guess they would call me elderly, arrrgh! But I love those pbooks and I  think that the author did a fantastic job and I am waiting for my grandson and daughter to be a little oldcr so that hopefully they  can enjoy  them as much as I do. Of course I am an avid reader. Just to show you how mch I love Harry Potter, we live in Lake chapala Mexico. the set of paperbacks cost $39.95, I paid a lot extra to get quick delivery and wouldnt you know it, I was charged 530 pesos, thats about $53 dollars USD, in addition to the original cost for customs fees, but it was worth it for me. Stupid huh? I thik that these books should be read in sequence, so that you know the people and the events when they are discusssed in the new books. cant wait for the last one.
 They included 3 extra books. One of the best deals I've ever had. All the books were better than described. Definite recommend!
 J. K. Rowling has wrapped up her Harry Potter series with a vivid tale of life on the run for a young boy who isn't quite sure what he's supposed to be doing. The story has many moving moments and Harry displays the heart and courage we always suspected him of having. The explanation at the end for why one seeking total power is going to ultimately fail and be miserable is quietly convincing... I must imagine that someone like Stalin, or Hitler would have been paranoid and cruel as Voldemort was... They can't know love and cannot trust anyone. He cannot find any real happiness in their power...<br/>Mostly this was just a fun read, however the darker more emotional moments really carry the story... Harry's sacrifice isn't all that convincing in itself but is still well done.<br/><br/>I do hope this is the end, because I love this series and would hate to see this piece of work diluted. I also can't wait to see what new territories and stories Rowling may venture into next...<br/>to new horizons Miss Rowling and thanks for the wonderful world of Harry Potter.
 I was very happy with this item until I reached books 6 and 7. These copies of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are very poorly bound. Every time I pick one of them up to read, it feels like the cover is about to come off. I love everything else about the set, so I don't want to return it, but I bought it to replace a very-well-loved set of the series which was wearing out. So I thought I should let you know that book 6 and 7 of the series, while previously unread, are actually in worse condition than the copies I bought them to replace.
 Hard to put dow.  Thanks to J K Rowling for compelling story.  I will now watch the movies.  Thanks again.
 It arrived in perfect condition.
 Arrived Early. My 9 year old loves the books and thought it was the perfect christmas gift.
 I have been watching this item on amazon for a year or so.  By some miricale the price dropped WAY down and I grabbed it.  I have seen a lot of less than great reviews for this items because its a cardboard chest.<br/>I still find that this is a pretty sturdy case, yes it would be amazing if it was wooden ( a possible project down the road) but, for the the price and the books this was an amazing deal.<br/><br/>I am already a huge Harry Potter fan, so owning these was a must have. Prior to this I had eBooks and I did not have the space for the actual books.<br/><br/>I would definably recommend hardcover books over the paper back, for longevity.
 I love this book! Very beautiful!
 This book completes every cycle, ties off every loose end, and packs enough emotional jolts to keep veteran Potter fans stunned chapter after chapter.  It not only answers the big questions that have been let hanging after the past couple books, but wraps up several small throw-a-way clues and references from every book in the series.  Far more fat-paced and intense than the others, the ending should satisfy even the most jaded reader and critic.  The only downside is the realization that, after almost a decade, it is totally and completely over...
 The complete set in a box.  Perfect for any Harry Potter fan
 I didn't realize it was without the case/ cover.
 beautiful
 There is a lot of action and twists and turns.  Everyone that Harry has had contact with in the last six years has to be dealt with and resolved in some way.  I think Rowling did an excellent job of remaining true and still giving a sense of realism to a fiction book.  Not everything turned out neat and clean and some of our favorites didn't make it, but that's life, whether you are at Hogwarts or in Muggle world.
 One thing that annoyed me about the early HP series was the run-on sentences and odd punctuation. The books got deeper and more clever as the series went on. I think that Book 7 just exemplifies how J.K. Rowling has flourished. This book isn't completely predictable and the thought patterns are just amazing. I was really impressed that a novel that has thus far been geared toward young adults could take such a giant intellectual leap in the last book.<br/><br/>In short, it's not as simplistic as the other books (while I do celebrate the entire collection). Very engaging read for all ages.
 This is clearly not a review for the books as they are fantastic. This is for the cheap cardboard box they arrived in. I read many reviews that lash out on customers who "expected too much" and I guess I am one of them. What the 5 star reviewers don't understand is that this box set was represented as a collector's item and many people who bought this item bought it for this reason and not necessarily for the books that they/we already have. For someone who does not own any of the books I agree that this is a very good deal but for the rest of the people who are interested in a collection item this is simply the worst purchase you will make (or already did).<br/>Very disappointing.
 S o good everything comes together and it is all absolutely wonderful however you not love this amazing book dudes
 Fantastic. Just beautiful illustrations!
 Awesome box it comes in looks great
 I am a long term fan of the HP series. I have all of the books, but I had some damaged by water and through moving. I decided that I wanted a complete, hardcover set and decided on purchasing this set.<br/>I had some packaging issues, but this was on Amazon's side- the trunk/books were not damaged at all.<br/>Upon opening the inside box and pulling out the trunk, I noticed the same thing that others had complained about- the trunk is made of cardboard and it doesnt feel the most secure. The side handles feel very secure and support the weight of the books. The little plastic clasp does look kind of cool and it keeps the trunk closed.<br/>Upon opening the trunk, the upper cardboard insert was not properly connected and did not move with the lid. (See picture)<br/>All of the books look to be the high quality that you would expect- no pages bent, the covers look good. It looks like brand new books! (Which was the main reason I bought this set.)<br/>I gave this product 4/5 stars because the cardboard trunk was a bit more flimsy than I would like, but the books and stickers seem to be high quality.
 I expected the trunk to be more ... sturdy but other than that great product .
 The books arrived in perfect condition and on time. The box and the covers are beautiful and all is as good as advertised.
 Beautifully illustrated!
 Cannot wait to give this to my son.
 If you have not yet read any of the Harry Potter novels then I can only assume you live under a rock! I myself resisted joining the bandwagon until all of the first four novels were written. While in college I decided why see what all the hype was about and I was hooked after the first paragraph of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". These novels may have been written with kids in mind but they also appeal to the adult who is willing to have a little fun and experiment with a little magic!
 There really isn't much to say about this set. I will not comment on the content of the books, just on the set itself.<br/><br/>It contains all 7 of the Harry Potter books in paperback, what more do you need to know? The books themselves are all of good quality with good bindings. The box for the set is not really elaborate or special, but I didn't expect it to be for a paperback set. If this were a hardcover set, I would probably complain about the packaging, but I wanted an inexpensive copy of all the books that I can take with me anywhere, and that's why I bought the paperbacks.
 I love my books and from a Harry Potter fan this are perfect to have.
 I've loved this series. I've had a few issues with it, but it was mostly formula things that are not unique to Harry Potter. Chief of those complaints is that adults are either actively neglectful or antagonistic to the hero children. If an adult is supportive of them, they are generally powerless characters or characters that are publicly labelled as 'bad' people like Hagrid or Sirius. Again, this is nothing new. Think about <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/The-Wonderful-Wizard-of-Oz-100th-Anniversary-Edition-Books-of-Wonder/dp/0060293233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 100th Anniversary Edition (Books of Wonder)</a>. The same thing happens there.<br/><br/>Regardless, the series is a LOT of fun. I've read each one straight through like most everyone else on here. I've been to every movie. I've even gotten supplemental books. I think it's a great story for any age reader. I love the fact that it addresses lots of issues that most 'children's books' tend to avoid, like death and Harry's relationship with his guardians. I think these could easily be used to help bring up all sorts of great conversations with children above and beyond discussions of Harry and Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Now, this book. I was sad to see the series end, but really respect the fact that Rowling had a vision for 7 years of school and 7 books...and stuck with it. Maybe future books may come out, but it doesn't look like it. That's really great of her for not compromising for a buck. Everything pretty much gets tied up in this final novel, but that's really my only problem with it. Everything gets tied up. In order to do that, some things ended up feeling a little forced. I'm glad we didn't get left wondering "but what about..." but some of the resolutions left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. Still, there's lots of action, plenty of adventure, and will thrill anyone who's been following Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
 The box set was a favorite birthday gift for a 9 year old!!
 Has everything you'd expect. Not too difficult to go back and look up something from previous books. Pretty good deal for seven books in one.
 A must read for everyone
 Love having the whole collection in one Kindle book.
 This is literally the reason I live. Lol not really but I love this series so much. My favorite stories.
 Perfect! My daughter loves them!
 I have to say that this book is very appropriate for the ending of this extraordinary tale of the Harry Potter series. The story did explained and covered the holes that appeared throughout the series. The contents of this book is so rich and thick because of the loads of events that occurs during each chapter. They are no longer at Hogwarts, as many of you know, so their adventure is just filled with adventures, not how it used to be at Hogwarts. They no longer have to use the Invisibility Cloak just to sneak off into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to brew Polyjuice Potions. This book is just very different. It doesn't have the whole security of the Hogwarts castle to protect the characters in the story; any of them can die. I guarantee many tears while reading this book. I will spoil nothing here, seeing as I hate spoilers and I wasn't spoiled (thank goodness).<br/><br/>It is just worth the read, it is truly an amazing book that readers wouldn't forget too soon.
 I had resisted this series for 10 years, thinking that I didn't have an interest in children's books, and because I didn't find other fantasy stories, like Lord of the Rings, interesting.  Finally, thinking I should at least read the books since they're such a cultural phenomenon, I bought this box set.  I am extremely happy that I did! - I was sucked in immediately and read Books 1-6 straight through, one right after the other, and am now eagerly awaiting Book 7.<br/><br/>At about $30 for 6, this set is a great deal.  I am surprised that anyone would say that they are low-quality books - they are sewn rather than glued, and I find them to be very durable, paper, bindings, and all.  I'll admit that now that I am somewhat obsessed with the series, I wish I had the hardcover versions (or even the "adult" versions which are available in Canada) and I wish that all 7 of my books would "match."  But these are high-quality paperbacks.
 I finally got around to purchasing the last Harry Potter book and that gave me a good reason to sit and reread all the rest of them.  I don't know if it is because of reading all 7 books in a row or not, but there were parts of this last book that seemed to drag a bit.  However, I absolutely love the entire series and still feel as I did when I read the first book:  They are totally delightful -- and I'm a senior citizen. I certainly do not see why these books were ever classed as children's literature, although kids enjoy them also.
 We of course love the story and are blown away by the illustrations.
 I feel like the series started great and only got better with each of the first four books.  But the final three books, to me, were an unwieldy road to The End.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sits with Order of the Phoenix for me as my two least favorite in the series.  Burdened with the weight of too much going on, and hindered by too many complications to ever gain momentum, this simply wasn't a page-turner for me.  However it did all lead to a very satisfying, and suitably grandiose, ending for the series.<br/><br/>I may not the be the only one who, as much as I loved these books, am glad it's over.
 Very pleased with my purchase!!
 Has original artwork! Chest box is kind of flimsy but didnt buy it for that personally
 So maybe I was the only person on earth that had not a single one of the Harry Potter books on my shelves, but now thanks to this wonderful set I have all seven, and in hardback!<br/><br/>The quality of the books is a given. All seven volumes in original hardback with original cover art. What's not to love.<br/><br/>It showed up in the box that it was shipped from at the manufacturer and inside is the collector's chest. Not really much more than a Point of Sale container in my opinion, but a decent effort was put into the art work to make the experience of recieving and opening it fun. I keep my books in the case just for kicks, but it should certainly not be the reason you decide to make this purchase, especially if you already have all the books.<br/><br/>Each book was individually shrink wrapped inside the chest and it also included a fun sticker book that any kid under age 7 is gonna love.<br/><br/>great value, great product, amazing stories (I am only half way through the 1st book, but already in love with the characters)<br/><br/>J.Vaughn
 Sverything excellent
 I love this series. I already own it in Hard back. Bought this copy for my niece.
 Good good good why do I have to keep typing out words. The book is good now can I stop typing?
 This book may have been written for children but it should be read by everyone.  People have lost the capability to use their imaginations.  The Harry Potter books take you away from the chaos of real life temporarily and draw you into a world of unforgettable fantasy.  Deathly Hallows is a page turner that grabs you from the start.  Highly recommend for all age groups.  I'm sadden to hear it's Rowling's last Harry Potter book.  It would be nice to expand this story into the character's adult-hood.  Hopefully, Ms. Rowling's will consider it.
 Book arrived early and brand new.  Arrived next day after ordering, great!
 Doesn't get any better than this. Your childhood all wrapped up in a perfect collection of pure nostalgia love it.
 JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, Roald Dahl and now JK Rowling.  A series of books the likes of this - passionate, exciting, popular, culturally changing, critically acclaimed - comes along once in one or two generations. I am proud to be a part of this generation's 'read' of these books (I am 42! LOL)...There is no comparison. Words cannot describe this book(s)...So many of you have said so many things wonderfully and on target in your reviews so there is littlemroe I can add. DH is by far the best and brings the series to a circular close of sorts, but leaves you knowing the strength of life and (cliche) power of love as it 'begins' again (you'll see when you read the epilogue...)<br/><br/>These books will be on the shelves of children, adults and families for generations to come. Very few authors have this ability to span generations and Joanne Rowling has accomplished that. I look forward to her future books and will always have a special fondness and affection for Harry Potter as will millions of parents, their children as will THEIR children.
 I purchased 2 sets for Christmas gifts. The recipients were very happy.
 Made a great gift
 I was so excited to unwrap my HP boxset! The box it comes in is cardboard, but it is sturdy and keeps all the books together for an easy display. Definitely worth it! The only thing I wasn't thrilled on was the fact there were a couple nicks in the top of the books (especially #7, pictured) but I figured I'd be reading these all anyways and they'll start to look worn once that happens, so it wasn't the greatest deal.<br/>If you are looking to get the boxset for a long time potterhead, or someone who's new to it all, it'll definitely be something anyone would be thrilled to open!
 I bought the 4 book hard-cover set as a gift for myself for Christmas.  I highly recommend this as a gift for a Harry Potter fan of any age.  It's the ONLY way to read Harry Potter.  The hard-cover books are durable and come in a case that keeps them neat and protected.<br/>I've read each of these books several times and will probably keep reading them over and over again.
 Bought this for my son at Christmas. Good value, but I need to resolve an issue with a bad binding on one book.<br/><br/>My 10-year-old has read all of them - more than once, in fact. After watching "The Goblet Of Fire" movie, I read the whole series too. The stories will stand the test of time and I'm sure they'll still be popular years from now. That's how I justified the hardcover set vs. the paperback set.
 Book received as described. Fast shipping. Thanks!
 *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series.  So, take your sweet time and soak up this last book and all those charms you've come to know throughout the series.<br/><br/>If you've been a loyal fan of Harry Potter, then you pretty much know what has been accumulating in regards to the battle between the magical community versus Lord Voldemort.  Rowling doesn't disappoint in this book because she sprinkles revelations throughout the book.  Some of them, you might have already known or suspected and others were a surprise.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing that I didn't like was the epilogue.  I will refrain from stating why so that I won't spoil it for others.  I just felt that the last sentence in the last paragraph was perfect.  The epilogue kind of tainted the series a tad bit.  So, I'll just pretend that I didn't read the epilogue.<br/><br/>Other than that, it was a good series that has captured the attention of the world.  It'll be a while before something like this occurs again.
 I had the time of my life reading all of the Potter books together.  It was scintillating reading from the first page until the last.  I also have the Half Blood Prince.  I must recommend these books to everyone as pure wonderful stories and as perfect examples of excellent writing.
 A true sequel that sets up the rest of the series, and delivers on every single page
 The perfect gift
 Like the quality
 I love Harry Potter
 What better gift for a Harry Potter fan than a set of six hardback books in a nice container?  I don't know, maybe all seven!  The box in which they come is well crafted, but it seems like they should have waited a bit longer and included all seven books.  We bought this as a gift and had to give book 7 separately, which in the big picture of life isn't a big deal.  But it would have been nicer if they had a seven book collection for sale.  Hold out for that if you are not in a hurry to get the books.
 Great quality! Love these books!
 Didn't like
 I love this so much.
 A fitting end to the saga, tying up all the loose ends. Elements come together as Voldemort's crowd make their move, and the Order of the Phoenix and allies slowly strike back. Many questions are answered.<br/><br/>On one level you could call it "everything you never knew about Albus Dumbledore and were afraid to ask". Dumbledore turns out to have somewhat of a shameful past. You learn a lot more about Snape, too.<br/><br/>As rumored, there are a number of deaths along the way. Some, in what might be considered minor characters, are particularly hard.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowlings famously said she wrote the final chapter long ago. That turns out to be less important to this story than one might think, as it is an epilogue, placed many years after the events of this book. And, while this book was supposed to end it all, making it impossible for the author to wrote any more about her Wizard world, there's actually lots of room for adventures among the younger generation, just not against the overhanging threat of Voldemort.
 This series has been very good. Some books may have started out slower than others but they always picked up. Deathly Hollows grabbed me from almost the very beginning. Excellent book and a great ending to an awesome series. It's a little sad to say by to Harry and Friends, but it is going out with a Bang and not a whimper. Big book but an easy read once started. My children and I have all become big fans.
 I used this product to educate my brain on the subject of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World
 Weirdly,  all the books don't fit in the box anymore
 My 8 yr old granddaughter is entranced with this book!!
 Great series with a great ending!<br/>Ms Rowling has the rare ability create a universe and characters that totally engulf the reader. Each book was an addictive personality's nightmare.<br/><br/>Every time a new book came out I sat down with it in great anticipation. I would save it and savor it, clearing the everyday clutter away and snuggling into the book.<br/><br/>Please tell us, Ms Rowling, that you aren't just going to rest on your bags of money (which you deserve). Tell us that there will be more books to come. I am not talking about the Harry Potter, but something! Another series, something more....please?
 This book is in decent shape. No dust cover. The spine has been loosened up by what feels like 3 - 5 reads. Pages show only the slightest tinge of yellow, but are crisp and show no marring. The corners of the hardcover show obvious wear.<br/><br/>The seller had my item shipped within 24 hours.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I'm glad to have the hard copy of such a delightful book. You don't have to be a child to enjoy the story. In fact, reading them as an adult adds that extra bit of nostalgia to the experience. Even if you are not into fantasy, there are very powerful messages in this story that transcend the genre. The first three novels are very light reads and can be quite therapeutic at the end of the day.
 Great set for my classroom
 I've loved these stories ever since I was little.
 great book
 Absolutely amazing product.  My wife is a huge fan of Harry Potter and lost all her books when she was younger.  This was the perfect replacement and made a great Mothers Day gift.  From other reviews I was nervous about it shipping in a box that said Harry potter on the outside, however, Amazon added their own box so it shipped discretely.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the collectors case she wasn't totally sure what it was until she opened it and saw 7 mint books shrink-wrapped together inside.  There was not a ding or scratch on the collectors case or inside.  The Harry potter shipping box was double thick heavy duty cardboard and Amazons box was quality as well.  The actual collectors box was not sealed so I was able to print out a Hogwarts style letter and set it inside to read once the box was open.<br/><br/>Things to keep in mind when considering this as a purchase:<br/>The collectors box IS cardboard, but good quality, and adds a certain inclusiveness being that it resembles the Hogwarts students trunks.<br/>The books come in another cardboard box inside the trunk that resembles typical box sets of books, and it is removable so you could put the books on a shelf and use the trunk for other Harry Potter memorabilia.<br/>These are the hardcover books that were released over the years.  As far as I know there is nothing special about them, so other than the trunk it may be a waste of money if you already own the books.<br/>It does come with a sheet of stickers.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a phenomenal product at a seriously great price considering the price of the hardcovers individually.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for anyone that does not have a copy of the series or is looking to invest in hardcover copies.
 Now THIS is the way to end a series!  The darkness and sense of foreboding that has been building comes to a dramatic end (no point in skipping ahead ... things are revealed gradually as you proceed through the book), the entire cast of characters from the previous books make an appearance (in one capacity or another), plenty of plot twists keep you on their toes, questions and gaps in the plot from the previous 6 books are all neatly tied together, and an epilogue shows us what happens "after."  You can't ask for a classier way to end things.<br/><br/>The ending is bitter-sweet: it is sad that the series has come to an end, but J.K. Rowling has done a truly magnificient job in concluding things - all questions are answered, depth and details of the past are revealed, and justice prevails.  Thank you, J.K. Rowling - its been a treat to follow the story.
 Wonderful
 I love the escape the Harry Potter series allows this middle-aged professional. Rarely one gets to re-capture the magic of childhood and still be enthralled by wonderfully entertaining characters exhalting the values we all want in our lives - friendship, integrity, sacrifice, success, teamwork. I just love the reader, Jim Dale's, ability to give each character their own individuality and with such precision over time. It's a LOT of characters to develop and remember. He is truly an artist. A series where each book grows in it's depth and character development and have been some of my all time audiobooks. Treat yourself to the series and share them with any one needing to remember the magic of childhood.
 Awesome read especially the 2nd time. Being drawn into the world of  Harry Potter is a great deal of fun.
 This is an amazing read, and all the books are in one place! No need to go searching for the next book!
 It's always a worry when you start on a 7 book journey...Will all the books be good?  Will they all grab my interest?  Will the last one end properly, so that I don't feel like I wasted my money?  I for one, can say that I think it ended quite properly, and it was satisfying and warm and wonderful.  Everything is so clever and well thought out, you can tell that not only has JK Rowling grown up as a writer but has considered the fate of her characters carefully and lovingly.  An excellent book.  Very few people in this world will be dissapointed with this wonderful ending to a great and clever story.
 This is actually a Christmas present but I loved the case and it looks to be a very nice set!
 Never read these before. Starts off sort of slow. But keep reading!
 Arrived when expected and everything was perfect. Great buy and a hell of a deal.
 I'd rate as high as I could! This is the best book in the series, which considering each books' quality is really saying something! Harry, Ron, and Hermione have aged so well, and (CAUTION, SPOILERS!!!) the argument in the woods where Ron walks out on the group is a marvelous stroke of storytelling genius, where J.K. Rowling really keeps her writing in tune with the character's personality. As for the names of Harry and Ginny's children...what a beautiful sentiment. Lily, James, and... Albus Severus!! I want to name my kid that. :) A perfect end to a fantastic series...we will miss Harry, but for the rest of my life copies of all 7 books will be well-loved and cherished until they are past on when I do.
 I absolutely love this series and I seriously recommend reading them if you have not already. This was a great ending and really capped off the books!
 To have all 7 books available on my Fire is awesome!! I have now read three of the books and am a true lover of the Hogwarts Experience!!!<br/>It took me a long time to get into the world of Harry and friends but I am so glad I'm there!! If you haven't been introduced to Harry's world, please jump in. One thing I think I will do is go back and re-read books 1 to 3. When I started reading, the story was somewhat confusing with names and places that, now that I know who the characters are and how they figure in the story, I think it will be very worthwhile to start at the beginning again!!
 After the rather murky and somewhat actionless Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, the last installment in the Harry Potter series moves along at a briskly satisfying pace.  Though most loose ends are tied up by the time readers reach the end and final battle between Voldemort and Harry, certain story threads are not, in this reader's opinion, sufficently explored--most notably the fate of the Malfoys, who appear to bow out of the story with little more than a whimper.  That, however, is mere nit-picking.  This books will be among fan favorites in the series and is certainly the best since the Goblet of Fire.
 Super fast shipping! Great condition, my boyfriend loved the case.
 I love it plan and simple
 The books are better than the movies!  As hard as it may seem, they really are!  Each one is easy to follow, affordable in this paperback option (reasonable in hard cover as well), and has great illustrations and takes the reader so far away that it is almost impossible to put down.  If one's attention isn't "grabbed" during "The Sorcerer's Stone", he/she will be captivated by the second book, "The Chamber of Secrets" (my personal favorite).  Keep in mind, as the characters age and mature, the stories tend to develop a darker tone as this is essentially a good versus evil series.  Fans will cheer and cry but will never be disappointed.  I guarantee it!
 My grandson loved these books for Christmas. It put a bigger smile on his face.
 The book &amp; series could have ended without the Epilogue, which tarnishes the abundant creativity in the rest of the books. The only thing missing from it is having all the characters who died, smiling and waving as the scene fades to sappy music. Does Ms. Rowling feel that her true audience are children who cannot understand anything other than a stereotyped fairytale ending?<br/><br/>If you haven't yet read this book, skip the Epilogue. You won't miss anything.
 This is an excellent collector set!<br/><br/>I see a lot of people complaining that the chest is cardboard...<br/>But personally I think that cardboard is the perfect material, considering that it is descent quality and thick cardboard.<br/><br/>I'm certainly glad it's not some cheap plastic, and the set already weighs 20 lbs, so wood and/or metal case would just be silly.<br/><br/>If you want an expensive case, then go have one custom made.<br/>For the other 95% of us this is a great product.<br/><br/>It is by far the best packaging for a collector set I have ever purchased (and I've purchased quite a few)<br/>I'm definitely happy with the see, it is exactly what I want...<br/><br/>Amazing books in a great package.
 It came hard covered. I was expecting a paperback one also the book was very ruined.
 I love this. It is so great. I did find that I have some of the similar problems others have found... Places, mostly corners, where the paper covering the box is pealing even though I just bought it and the cloth map is blurry. However, I am rather crafty and have turned the refurbishing of it into an art project that I have found fun thus far. I also, bought the set during black friday sales and got a ridiculous deal. I love all of the stuff and secret compartments. I have worked my way through most of the blue rays and they all work find, haven't made my way around to the DVDs though yet but I don't expect to have any problems.
 Love What they did with it.
 My granddaughter was thrilled to receive this gift. The books are high quality.
 Our grandson loved them.
 ATTN: SPOILERS…. First of all – who is this Harry Potter?!  This was recommended to me once I finished reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  I didn’t know until half way through that this was the second book in the series.  That would have filled in a lot of the blanks for me, but nonetheless…mind blown.  I haven’t felt this way since Apple removed the head phone jack from the iphone 7. Like what?!  A hidden school for witches and wizards to train! Dark Lords! Ghosts! Snake language! Elves! Owls that deliver mail (warning, doesn’t work in real life #disappointed #feathers everywhere)! What more can someone ask for… This is like Alice in Wonderland meets Hocus Pocus meets Twilight meets Mean Girls (Crabe, Goyle, and Malfoy). I cannot wait to read the first one and come to find out there are several more!  What’s going to happen to Harry Potter and his friends?!  The anticipation is killing me!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a page turner, edge of your seat adventure.
 Best series ever written
 I read all seven books to my grandsons while they were growing up with Harry.  I actually read all of them twice, as I read ahead for myself and then read to them.  Rowling is an enviable writer with am amazing imagination which she uses in conjuntion with an educated mind from which she extrapolates names, situations, etc. in the lives of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  I loved my journeys into that alternate universe, imagining that I, too, was living under the stairs, visiting Hagrid, learning from Dumbledore, and facing all the dangers and adventures this trio and their peers faced.  I don't think there will be the like of this series for another few lifetimes.<br/>Ah, Hogwarts!  I miss you.  Wish I could be an auror!
 Happy with this purchase
 I received my boxed set today, and I was not too disappointed. The whole package weighs a whopping 19lbs, so it's essentially a box of lead. The box that holds the books is cardboard (as expected), and is a little cheaply put together. I didn't buy the set for the pretty box it came in though, and inside the box itself is every book in the series, beautifully printed and bound and covered with their dust covers and all shrink-wrapped together. Being as the books are going directly on my bookshelf, I wasn't too peeved about the box that they came in. I has small string handles that don't seem completely adequate to bear the weight of all the books (Although they worked fine during transportation), and the backing of the top kind of fell apart. The entire thing is a great gift for any child, and I'm sure they'll appreciate having a neat box to put the books in (which might encourage them to take more care of their novels than I did at a young age). I'm overall pleased with the item, its packaging, and its price. If you don't have the complete set, this is a must-have.
 A must for all who are 9&amp;3/4 seeking Harry Potter and  love &amp; friendship that is and always will be stronger than evil!
 Beautiful illustrations that bring the story to life.
 Loved the size of these books. Great for our 9 year old to hold.
 This series of audiobooks has opened a whole new genre for me.  The narration is the best I have heard so far.  I almost didn't continue the series after the second book, but the audiobooks rekindled my interest with the series and I went back and started the series over in audiobook form.  The book itself finishes the series well but leaves you wanting more.  The series has had its ups and downs, but this book is defintely one of the better ones.  I like the audiobooks much better than the movies.  Even though the movies have stayed true to the books, the audiobooks tell the whole story.  I will probably listen to it again and that has happened with me only with the Half Blood Prince.
 Very very good and detailed! Not sure how I can say what I disliked about this book - if there was anything, that is.
 Awesome an wonderful An so detailed an amusing truly the most detailed account of the famed An loved Harry Potter
 Actually, my 17 year-old dauughter purchased this as a birthday gift for her 18 year-old friend who had never read any of the Harry Potter books.  Both of my kids have read - and re-read - all of the Harry Potter books and we have all seen ALL of the movies.  I read part of this book (sorry, I just needed to see how it all ends!) and I loved it, too.  My kids say the books are even better and much more detailed than the movies, and when we see the movies, my daughter explains things to me from the books to give me a better understanding of what is going on in the movies, so we highly recommend the books, especially the first one and this last one!
 I was a late Harry Potter fan to the series an I just had to read this book before the 2 final movies come out. Plus I was dying to know what happens at the end. The 7th book in the series by J.K. Rowling, while over 700 pages, keeps you in constant suspense while Harry, Ron and Hermoine are on the run from Voldemort and hunting down Horcruxes. I could not put this book down. Every chapter seemed to having something new that helped bring together all the events from the previous books. All Harry Potter fans will love this book as did I. It is a must have for your book collection.
 I like this book because it was such an adventure to explorer Harry Potter. It was very interesting. Harry Ron were best friends throughtout the book! Ron was very helpful. All the characters were funny,out going, villains,and all sorts of personalities. I absolutely love this book, I  want to read the next one! I rate this book 5 stars because it was  excellent!
 The art is beautiful! Can’t wait to buy them all!
 The second year at Hogwarts gets better and better, and as one who has read the entire series several times, I appreciate Rowling's foreshadowing and literary ability while keeping the series (so far) a great one for children as well as adults. Interestingly, in order to complete the task set for Harry in the first book, he needed friends Ron and Hermione almost to the end of the quest, when he needed Dumbledore's direct help. In this second book, Ron accompanies Harry to a point and then he is on his own, until he needs Dumbledore's indirect help. The development of the plot and characters are brilliant. I love these books.
 This is a final masterpiece of exceptional plot planning.  Ms. Rowling draws up new plot twists and ties everything up in an explosive ending. It is helpful to have read all the books because some of the context draws from the first book.  Even if you've watched the movies--read the 6th book and you'll prepared for this adventure.<br/><br/>Watch your pulse because you may find that this read is a race to the finish!
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows was all I thought it would be, a fitting end to the saga that didn't disappoint.  Having listened to this last book read by Jim Dale, I now plan to go back to the beginning and listen to all of them as recorded books.  Mr Dale is a masterful reader.  You truly can imagine all the characters through his ingenious characterizations.  I recommend this book highly!
 I grew up reading these books and I am happy that I have the full set again.
 Such great adventure
 I would recommend this book to all new reader off Harry Potter it is fun and exiting and good for all you potheads
 I am an avid reader. I love fantasy, sci-fi, horror and really any good fiction. I put off the Harry Potter series for a long time. My son read them when he was younger, he was about 9-10 yrs old when the first one came out. Perfect Harry Potter age, he enjoyed them and when he moved out i told him to leave the books and i would get to them one of these days. I finally decided to tackle them right when the Deathly Hallows movie came out and it got me excited to finally start them. Well, I was not disappointed. Book 7 being the only book my son didn't have in his collection, I quickly ordered it right after i started 6. I now know what all the fuss was about. It wasn't about jumping on the bandwagon, it was because this was probably the best series of books I have ever read. Plain and simple.
 Wow, this book really makes up for any slowness in the other ones. It is fast paced with plenty of action. JK wraps up the plot very neatly, despite the body count. I wish she did more of a background story on voldemore. Why exactly did he become evil? But other then that the book helps explain many mysteries that were unexplained. Dont look to me for an answer, go pick it up and read it!
 A must read! A fun adventure for all ages.
 Love this bookset! Can’t be thankful enough for this delivery.
 That's amazing story for everybody!<br/>"After all this time?...Always!"
 Got it for my sister for her birthday, she never had her own books because she always borrowed mine. She loved them!
 I've read many books and I must say that the first two books by JK Rowling have kept me enthralled as no book ever has.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I must recommend to everyone older than probably nine years of age.  The characters have matured and so has Rowling's imagination.
 Great low price
 If you by some strange chance have not read each of the books listed in this boxed set and want a page turner or a gift that is sure to delight and engage then this is the boxed set for you! Double points if you are a Harry Potter fan and want to share the joy.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a><br/><br/>I have never approached reading a book with more anticipation and anxiety as I did Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  The six previous books had been a wonderful adventure, one that I wanted to share with two my sons when they were old enough.  Would J.K. Rowling end the series in a manner that would taint my experience of Harry's world?<br/><br/>Not for an instant.<br/><br/>As the climatic installment of a seven book series, the book yields no respite.  The book has moments full of fear and dread, loneliness, joy - it draws tears as well as laughter from the reader.  Surely, the millions around the world that consumed its 700 plus pages in a day or two is a testament to the summons of this book to be read voraciously.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows has a feeling of inevitability throughout.  The beauty of Rowling's final installment (and a tribute to her skill as a writer) is that in Harry's world, the inevitable is never redundant, predictable, or trite.  Events that seemingly must occur do so with a magic that is fitting the fantastic world in which they happen.<br/><br/>Just as with any epic tale, the conclusion is not the real reason for telling the story.  The importance of the tale is the journey.  This is one journey that has left me pleasantly satisfied, and eager for my boys to appreciate the magic of Harry Potter.
 i absolutely loved the 7th book, but as expected somethings did not add up in retrospect.  if you can over look minor details that sway/change from one book to another, it's a great book.  i don't know how someone can write 7 books in a series and not get info mixed up more than it was.  but mistakes are minor.  i've read it 3 times now just to make things sink in better and i loved it the 3rd time just as much as i did the 1st time.<br/><br/>the most disappointing part had nothing to do with the book itself.  i almost gave the book 1 star but my disappointment in Amazon is not Rowlings fault.  Amazon said they would offer the best price, which i took to mean the absolute lowest price even with shipping and handling inclueded, otherwise you're getting gypped.  i pre-ordered my book because of that.  my local wal-mart had the book cheaper, and then i would not have had to pay $2 shipping and handling, and i could have picked it up a midnight, and my wal-mart was giving away rubber, hogwarts wristbands/bracellets.  i thought, "oh, wow, this must mean Amazon is going to do the same just to keep up with the competition."  nope.  for somethings Amazon is great and i could swear by it, but i don't believe in swearing.  sometimes it's just better to shop ebay or wal-mart, and Harry Potter 7 is just one of those cases for now.
 Good set
 Ready for book three. Read them years ago, but forgot a lot of the details. Fun to read them again.
 I love my set, which I got some six months ago. They are absolutely stunning to look at. Of course, I have never read this set, as they are purely for decoration, but they are beautiful all the same. I use the box to hold all of my "reading copies" of the same books. The set comes with bright stickers for decorating your very own "trunk" which show the different places mentioned through out the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>The only problem I've had out of this product is the fact that the latch doesn't work. In fact, it broke off after the first use. However, it snaps back on fairly easily, but you must be very careful when handling the box.
 As many times I have read these, I still enjoy them. It takes me out of my reality and into a world of fun.
 I have repeatedly listened to all the Harry Potter audio book sets as performed by Jim Dale, and they are all excellent.  Mr. Dale has a unique voice for each character, and they are all very recognizable. I especially enjoy Mr. Dale's voice acting of Dobbie, Hagrid, Dumbledore and Snape.<br/><br/>These are great for enjoying the world of Harry Potter universe while doing other things such as driving or working.
 Brilliant, fantastic, and sad to see end.  This book was excellent and answered questions, gave affirmations, and was hard to put down.  I feel like I'm leaving some friends behind but that we will always have some connection.  In a time of video games and bad tv it's so good to see books like this captivate both young and old.
 What a joy to own. I had borrowed the books and wanted to own my own set - I bought these for the completeness of owning them all. What a joy to see their beauty! Each books cover is soft! I am not kidding. You just want to sit and hold the books (sorry e-readers you lose!).<br/><br/>The price is well worth it. For less than $60 you own 7 beautiful books. Couldn't beat that! Thank you Amazon.<br/><br/>If you love Harry Potter or know someone who does - this is the set to buy. Impressive on a bookshelf. A joy to read. I am 33 and one of my children who is 11 - is enjoying this series with me.
 excelente producto , buen material y la caja de guardarlos libros es muy bonita , recomendado 100%
 Came as expected, great series of books for kids and adults.
 This was not my favorite book in the Harry Potter Series ("Chambers" was), but that's all relative, because the whole series has been fantastic. When was the last time that literally millions of people in the U.S. and the U.K. all bonded together around a book series? (Hint: Never.) I'm very sad to see the series end. However, I have to believe that J.K. Rowling is already hatching ideas for a fresh new story, perhaps with entirely different characters. I'll be among the first to buy whatever new books she writes.
 I'm glad my daughter likes the story. Missing pages in book 7 is annoying.
 It's a great series
 I think most people are disappointed simply because its the end. But what a good end it was. I think Rowling must be a big John Lennon fan because all I kept thinking was "All you need is love..." Love is the greatest redemption of all; what saves us, what makes us human. What drives us, what makes us do the right thing, and occasionally the wrong thing. That friendship is crucial to survival. That forgiveness is a wonderful gift. And that family--whether by birth or circumstance--comes above all. I was enthralled. yes it dragged in some places--but I think that was intentional! So that we could feel how they felt, frustrated, confused, and uncertain. The gray areas that exist in life, in people--the paths we choose and the ones we are forced down. I wish everyone would read harry potter. It speaks of tolerance and fighting for what you believe even in the face of great adversity. there is beauty in these pages. Evil is certainly not rewarded...
 I have read every book, seen every movie and am still in awe.  I finished the entire book within hours of receiving it, I was gripped in the land of magical people, back with friends, enemies and classmates.  I was in a world where some things were not as they seemed, but then some things were exactly as they seem.<br/>I will not give out any plot points but to say, as many others have said, that Ms Rowling ties up all loose ends, answers all questions and ends the series in the only way that made any sense to people who have stuck with the series.  I agree with others that this book is darker than the others, but anybody who has read the series knows that each book gets progressively darker and more violent.  At the end of book 6 a war was starting, at the start of book 7 the war has begun.<br/>I think it would be a good idea for anybody to reread the series from beginning to end, put aside a block of time and just reread it.  I think that this is one of the most amazing series ever.  I think you will too.  Anybody who gave this less than 4 - 5 stars just, probably doesn't understand.
 Exactly what I ordered.  exactly what was expected.  Great deal!  no complaints at all.  I would recommend this to anyone.
 Well, I purchased these a couple of months ago.  Nothing seems missing or visibly wrong with the books.  The binding on the bigger books cracks easily, but that is understandable.  I don't like the box they came with; it is really cheesy.  I would recommend this set to others, but if you plan on keeping them in mint condition, don't read the bigger ones.
 This set is great for my 8 year old who loves to thrash books.  Not that he means to but he gets so involved and starts folding corners on pages, dropping the book, etc.  They have held up great!  I think the hardback series, as nice as they are, would have been awkward and heavy for bedtime reading. Did I mention that the story content is amazing to him. He is glued to this series and now on book 4.
 The pages' quality is poor! But the story is one of the best that exists.
 So. As an 11 year old 6th grader, I've always heard of Harry Potter this; Harry Potter that. I've never taken a single look in the books, I hadn't liked fiction in the past and never thought that I would be such a hardcore, Harry Potter fan. But recently, reading the first 3 books had caught my interest and I decided to buy this whole set. (I hadn't own any books because I've only rented them or checked them out at the local library.) Reading few reviews here and there had made me anxious of wether I would be missing pages and other ridiculous junk but lucky enough, there were no faults or anything of like to that. The books had come in a somewhat sturdy cardboard box. The art was great. Had a cute postcard titled "Delivery from Hogwarts." The books were in fantastic condition with it's original art style and not like the newer 2014 models. Plastic casing covered the books in order to fulfill it's prime condition. I'm vastly excited to read the rest of this amazing series.
 The Harry Potter series is an amazing phenomenon.  Aside from being a great read for all ages, it has created a resurgence of reading in the US.  Each book stands alone as a complete story, but read in sequence they create a wonderful suspence.<br/><br/>At the end of book 1, we see Harry returning to his muggle aunt and uncle.  Dumbledore is determined that Harry is safest there.  The only thing that makes this summer a little easier is that Dudley is afraid he'll end up with another pig-tail!<br/><br/>But as usual things cannot go easy for Harry.  Something horrible is brewing at Hogwarts this year and someone is convinced that Harry must be kept away!<br/><br/>As the year progresses, Harry discovers hidden talents and his sense of right and wrong are put to the test.  Even Hermione cannot solve this one by going to the library.<br/><br/>Now that there are six books, we know that there is a very important clue in this book.  The first glimpse of how Voldemort has been keeping himself alive for all these years since Harry's parents were killed.<br/><br/>Will Harry make the right choice?  After all we know that what matters is whether he does "what is easiest, or what is right."
 As with the last 6 books Jim Dale does an amazing job! I read the book on my own of course, but I loved having this on CD to listen to in my car or in my walkman at work on my lunch break.  Excellent and well worth the cost.
 So happy that Harry Potter is on Kindle.  I reread them and as always I enjoyed them.  Thank you
 I thought it would be seperate files one for each book. I have not found a good way to find the start of each book.
 Very pleased with my purchase. Great packaging! Same day delivery! This will be my first time reading these books so I am glad to have them all together :)
 Great
 Perfect. My 9 yr old son loves the Harry Potter series.
 I've had my issues with the writing of this series--literally, with how portions of it were written.  They could have been stronger, better, shorter, longer...  I don't like a lot of the details of where JKR took things in DH, but ultimately she gave Harry what he needed, what we have protectively fostered in him from the beginning:  a sense of himself, his own power.  For that I give JKR cheers for sustaining her momentum over 7 books, the infrastructure that created a new archetype emblazoned in the consciousness of millions.  Along her pages we have grown.
 Comprising seven sequential novels, the Harry Potter series is likely to retain a literary position near that of Lord of the Rings. Harry, a young wizard whose parents were killed by the evil Lord Vodemort when he was one year old, has been raised by his non-magical aunt and uncle and knows nothing of his past, present or future. Recruited to attend Hogwart's School of Magic at age 11 to be "trained up" as a wizard, Harry meets best-friends Ron and Hermione and many others, along with rival Draco and other foes at the school. The stories develop both the characters and the world of magic during a series of adventures that Harry encounters, all moving towards his eventual confrontation with Voldemort. Hogwart's faculty provides plenty of supporting characters, notably professors McGonagle, Moody, groundskeeper Hagrid. and headmaster Dumbledore. Of course, there is also the nemisis professor Snape, who provides an eventual ironic twist.  Each character is well developed and can be related-to by most readers in non-magical ways. Reading the thousands of pages takes some time, but is well worth the adventure.
 I'm not sure whether I received a different boxset than some of the other reviewers, but I have no problems with the packaging of the set (and I am pretty picky when it comes to the quality).  You get all 7 books for just $50. These are the same paperback editions that retail $11-$15 on their own. The box is made of very heavy cardboard(which does not seem flimsy at all), with a pleasant albeit unremarkable design on it. Some reviewers complained that the box fell apart, but I don't understand how it could, unless you purposely disassembled it (well yes, of course it is going to fall apart then), constantly carried the entire boxset around with you, threw it against the wall, or sat on it. You get what you pay for. If you want all 7 paperback editions in a reasonably priced set of good quality, then you should get this boxset; it is a great deal. If you want a glorious eyecatching collector's piece that will look just great sitting on your bookshelf, then don't get this set--quit being so cheap and plunk down $200 for the hardcover set. Many of these reviewers seem to have unreasonable expectations for the money they pay.
 What makes Harry Potter just so good is a combination of good writing, fun themes, a fully realized alternate world, and (everyone pay attention) the author's efforts to pre-think out how the series would end so that everything built up to it.<br/><br/>Epic stories where the writer doesn't know how it's going to end (The Gunslinger, Lost season 2, Smallville, every thing written by Roger Zelazany) just can't compete with a focused storyline like Harry Potter. I'm not trying to knock them, they are entertaining in their own right. But everything just "feels wrong" when you get to the end finally because the destination never mattered, only the journey.<br/><br/>With Harry Potter the destination is as good as the journey, and the world just "feels right" for it.
 Great way to end the series!  Were YOUR predictions true? Did you pick up on the clues along the way?  This book is action packed and, like the others, will keep you guessing and reading.  One part is reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings.  However, it quickly/thankfully goes in its own direction. The epilogue is a bit hokey, but entertaining none the less.  You'll feel satisfied when all your questions have been answered, for better or worse. I was worried this last book would be a disappointment. I was very pleased as it was a joy!  Bravo to Amazon for getting it to me on the release date!
 Its beautiful
 JKRowlings has written the perfect 7th book.  Put that together with the voice of all the Harry Potter books and you have what can only be the best possible "read".  Jim Dale once again brings each charactor to life in an extraordinary way , weaving the story with elegance and grace that puts you right in the middle of it.  I know that I will wear out my copies.  No Harry Potter fan should be without either the book or the CD's and for me it is both.  I would say more, but would hate to give anything away if one has not already indulged &gt;
 If you have any clue as to what Harry Potter is about, then you know that the movies don't do the books justice. Even though I'm a huge fan of the movies, I love them all; I knew I was missing something. So after I saw the HBP in theaters I went home and ordered the box set. I was tired of being `out of the loop.' Once they arrived it took me about two weeks to read them, my job kept getting in the way, lol. They are awesome! But I don't need to tell you that. The packaging they came in however is not so awesome. I've seen pizza boxes withstand better delivery. But what can you do when so many people love Harry Potter? For those who do not like the wizarding world or the Potter mania, that's cool, it is not for everyone. But for those who do, you understand, you know. I can't wait for the last two movies to come out, it will be bittersweet.
 It finally has ended and with that comes the conclusion so many of us have been waiting for... for personally it was a disappointment in many ways.  Her set-ups are not as strong as in the past, there is way to much information given in this book that could of been planted better in other books and the deaths that do happen don't feel like they should have the most impact that they could of.<br/><br/>3,4,5 are her best books to date - 6 is good but lacks in time as does this one.  The opening action is good and when they do make a movie I think it might be a cluster mess like 3 was unless it's split into two halves.
 Good book. It is a shame you must leave 19 words, when "good book" will more than suffice. Good book.
 I was really looking forward to this book because I thought finally Rowling would give some resolution to all the bad that Harry has been through.  Instead she could have cut the book in half, she kills off three of the more interesting and vital characters right at the end  without literary justification, we never know what happens to Luna, and the way Harry defeats Voldemort and comes back from the dead is convoluted and definitely needed a rewrite.  Finally the closing seemed too "cheery" and cut and dried for the rest of the series, like the author didn't know what to do.  I realize that this is a children's book, but the darkness and reality of the series (e.g., the sheer number of people Harry losses) puts it in the league with adult fiction and is what makes it interesting, though a bit depressing.  I would say, read it just because, but in my mind, the series ended with Book 6.
 Came as expected
 I have been dying forever to be able to buy this cute collector's edition of my all-time favorite book series. I finally got it because of my husband (who I cannot thank more). :-) (And top of this he also bought me the DVD Collector's Edition of the movies! HP MADNESS!)<br/><br/>I was absolutely thrilled when I opened the package and carefully took out the trunk full of Harry Potter hardbacks. However, much to my disappointment the trunk is made out of cardboard and is a bit flimsy. I opened it to admire my books and lovingly stroke them, when the part in the top of the trunk came lose and I had to glue it back down which is no biggy really, just another little disappointment.<br/><br/>However, despite the poorly made trunk, the stickers are awesome and I crazily slapped them on the trunk and the books are in perfect condition. This is the most perfect gift I could have ever gotten and I wouldn't trade it. I might trade the trunk for a better one, but really. I have all the hardbacks to the HP series for little over 100 bucks. Each hardback retails at 35.99. Tell me this isn't a steal despite the cardboard trunk! I think it is. :D<br/><br/>Anyway, I love it. It makes me super happy and I can't wait to snuggle in bed with my husband and dogs and read Harry Potter all over again and experience the magic that helped me become a "reader".
 Before TV, before movie theaters, before radio, there were books!  Long after many people had given them their eulogies, books are back and popular once again with children of all ages thanks to the Harry Potter series.  Don't let your child be the only muggle that does not know how to put Fluffy to sleep - the Harry Potter series is a must have.
 This book was in really good condition. My wife was pleased with it.
 This was exactly the product I was looking for, since I had pre-ordered and received the final book when it came out. I had borrowed the rest of the series to read and wanted a set of my own, but didn't want an extra copy of Deathly Hallows. This product was perfect, nicely packaged, and exactly what I wanted. How can it get better than that? (plus it was pretty reasonably priced)
 I have to say it, J. K. Rowling needs a good editor. There are parts of Deathly Hallows that drag on needlessly, and with another polish this book could have been much tighter, much stronger and much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>When Deathly Hallows is at its best it captures all the magic we've come to expect from the Harry Potter series, but it's only at its best about 60% of the time. Rowling is capable of better and her earlier books reflect that fact.<br/><br/>It's actually quite problematic to judge Deathly Hallows individually. In many ways it exists more as a series capper than anything else, and in that capacity it does its job fairly well: all questions are answered, all conflicts resolved and at the end of the book you get the satisfaction of having gone through this long journey.<br/><br/>I wasn't crazy about the very end, but it was a sobering reminder that this indeed IS a children's series. And while it definitely appeals to adults, the core intended audience is kids and teens.<br/><br/>If you're a Harry Potter fan, no review is going to change your mind in any way about this book. But if you're new to the series and looking to 'check it out', don't start with book 7. The first three books in this series are by far the best.<br/><br/>So farewell Harry, we'll miss you. That is until the next movie hits screens and there's Potter fever all over again.<br/><br/>One final note to whoever publishes J.K. Rowling's next book. Rowling is an immense talent with a fantastical vision. But she's just a writer, and like even the best writer she needs and editor. Someone to call her on her bad habits, help her keep her prose focused and bring out the best in what she has to offer.
 It's so beautiful!
 Loved getting the whole set nicely boxed and my son really loved them
 My grandson was very happy to get this set for Xmas. Great condition.
 j.k. rowling has brought the potter saga to a wonderful conclusion. though the story at time lumbers slowly, it does pick up steam . the characters that we have followed and lived with are given more depth and feeling and as you near the last few chapters you begin to dread the finish because you really don't want to know who will die, and you just don't want the book to end. a very satisfying epilouge that also leaves an opening for a return to the wizarding world, should rowling ever feel so inclined. this is a series that can be reread over and over, and will take it's place as a literary classic!
 Amazing illustrations!
 I've lost count of how many times I've read the hard copy of this series through, but I haven't had time in the last few years since our daughter's birth. My husband got this Kindle version recently, &amp; I've already read it through twice. It's perfect while I'm nursing our son! It's been impossible to get my Harry Potter fix until now, &amp; I'm loving it! I don't think there's a better series, period, &amp; this format is perfect for those times when you can't handle an actual book. The only slight negative is that there are a couple of places where there are typos &amp; missing text that aren't in the hard copies. However, it's not overwhelmingly detracting &amp; doesn't affect my joy at the end of my Harry Potter drought!
 This is by far the best book ever. Along with its extra artwork and full size chapter imagines in the back it makes reading the last Harry Potter book a delightful experience. The book is in such great quality made you can read it, reread it, and pass it along friends without having to worry about its spine coming apart. I definitely recommend this edition of the book, it makes the experience much much better.
 Love the boks
 My children and I arrived to get our reserved copy of Harry Potter right at 11:30 p.m.  By the time I got home and settled into a good read, it was 2:00.  My poor husband woke up to go to work at 7:00 to see me wiping my eyes and closing the backcover.  Not wanting to spoil it for him, I could only say...it didn't last near long enough.<br/><br/>What a wonderfully complex book!  There was one section where Harry is so focused on retrieving items (not saying what!) that seemed forced and thrown in there at the last minute.  It just did not feel fleshed out.  Overall, however, the book was paced (not too fast, not too slow) and seemed to give the many characters a chance to shine each.  I sniffled over every death and wanted them not to have occured but it is a war and that is what happens in a war.<br/><br/>About the end...all I will say is I want more details!  For those of you who have no idea what I mean...READ THE BOOK!  *G*  Enjoy!
 I loved everything about them. They came in quick and the box is sturdy and the books are in perfect condition.
 Fantastic books for the Harry Potter fan!!!
 I don't want to spoil anything, but this book puts an end to the Harry Potter series and it does it in a spectacular way.<br/><br/>There are valuable moral lessons on how to face death and on the intrinsecal mortality of the characters. Everybody can die in this book. Books III and VII are my favourites. Deathly Hallows must be read instantly following The Half-Blooded Prince; if you don't read it you'll forget about a lot of events from the previous book that are relevant to this one.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see this book turned into a movie, the descriptions and the narrative are impressive.
 Of course 5 Stars! Come on, it's Harry Potter! I bought this set because I'm trying to force my kids to read them with me.  So far, no luck.  Punks.  However, one day. One day they'll get into them and mom will prevail.  Until then, I get this awesome box set at a fantastic price! This is exactly what I expected it to be, and the box set is sturdy and looks really cool on my shelf! If you're like me and trying to force the next generation to get into Harry Potter, this is definitely a good purchase!<br/>  Seriously, kids these days.  Who doesn't want to read Harry Potter?!
 I am reading the Happy Potter books because my 14 yr. old grandson recommended them to me personally.  He assured me that he thought I would like them.  I bargained with him.  I asked him to be sure to read the book I had just given him, THE YOUNG TRAVELER'S GIFT by Andy Andrews.<br/><br/>The SOURCERER'S STONE, was delightful.  I liked the way the author gave tender loving care to the underdog.  The fantasy parts were handled well, not too much, just enough.<br/><br/>Fortunately, since I am an adult I wasn't overwhelmed by the suspense.  I can imagine children not wanting to be interrupted.<br/><br/>I haven't read other children's books for children who can read to themselves since becoming an adult, however I was challenged to do so when I read THE HAPPINESS PROJECT by Gretchen Rubin.  Shortly after that Stirling, my grandson, suggested this series.<br/><br/>I look forward to discussing the books with him the next time we are together.  He is in Seattle and I am in Alabama.
 Got this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves the books
 Delivered quickly as exactly as pictured. Kids absolutely loved it!
 Bought as a gift. They enjoyed it.
 While people were standing in unbearably long lines to purchase the first copies of the newest and final "Harry Potter", a UPS truck was making its way to my Granddaughter's home with a copy that came in really cute packaging and arrived in the early morning hours before most of those people in long lines even got back home to crack open their own copies!<br/>Thanks Amazon for coming through once again!!
 I can't believe it's finally ended.  I was curious as to how she would weave the story together and tie up all the loose ends.  I'm nearly 60 years old and I loved every sentence of the book.  Like a fable there are lessons to be learned about life, love, true friends, fighting for an idea or cause, sacraficing for your friends, and so many others too numerous to mention here.  This is surely a story that every parent will have to read to their children at bed time for all future generations to come.  Harry Potter is a hero, and will be the model we would all want our kids to follow.  I'd like to believe that Harry Potter lives in all of us.  How can J.K. Rowling create another story that tops this? Thank you J.K. for writing such a wonderful story.
 Love the box set.  The books are better than I remember.
 J.K. Rowling writes in a way that lets your imagination flow.  Her words take you away, painting pictures in your mind.  Few books provide such satisfaction and it is disappointing that the series isn't continuing.  Her attention to detail completes the experience.  I was not a fan at first and thought that the books were for children but, aside from a few parts, the story appeals to all ages.  There is some teenage angst but we all have those feelings at some point even in our adult lives.  This review is written by a former skeptic, someone who let his guard down and gave the books a chance.  If you enjoy reading and using your imagination, you will enjoy these books.  Read something that you like, don't base all your selections on their literary merit.  These books will become classic, why should you wait until then, enjoy them now.
 Daugher still reads these to this day.
 I really wasn't expecting the ending to be what it is...the way the book is written really led me to believe in certain other events to occur.  Overall, it was a great surprise and a great ending to the series.  The only disappointment was there are a few obvious unanswered questions such as what happens to certain characters, what do they eventually do in the future, etc.
 Just as good as I remembered.  Having all the books in a single volume is convenient.
 I bought this from Amazon less than a month after the book came out, so I thought it would be hard to find at a decently discouted price.  I was very pleased to find it listed as new at such a price, and when it arrived, it was still in the shrink-wrap and everything.  Same exact thing I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or even Ebay for 70+ dollars, but for like $20 less.
 Starts out great in the first few books - last couple are kind of disappointing.  Long and drawn out.  I really was entertained the first few books though.
 Having spent the last day and a half reading "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" and not having the energy for a midnight pickup, I've avoided pretty much everything online to avoid spoilers, this review is written with the desire to have no spoilers, so I'll get right to the point.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling was right in the interviews-- all the questions are answered, the backstory is filled in, and it all fits together.  Perhaps more importantly, the narrative is fantastic, a rare capture of continuing the increasing darkness of the previous books but never losing that shining beacon of hopefulness.<br/><br/>As someone who's read each the three previous book on release day, I certainly wasn't disappointed.  "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" lives up to the promise of the series.  I suspect no one needs it, but this book certainly gets my recommendation.  The only downside is that there's not another one to look forward to.
 This is a Christmas gift for great grand-daughter and has not been opened yet.
 Just what I needed in great condition
 To start with I loved this book and am well over 13, actually a grandmother.  I just love the names in these books and say them outloud, relishing each one: Hogwarts, Gryffindor, Quidditch.  How about the names of the characters?  Don't you just want to hiss at a name like "Draco Malfoy from Slytherin"?  Or how about the slightly ditsy Luna Lovegood, or Moaning Mytle who haunts the girls' bathroom.  It is just such fun read.
 The books are worth buying they are exellent  conditions and covers are beautiful it worth the money.
 I was so excited to get this book and read it. I sat and did nothing but read and read and read. I was so wrapped up in this one, just like all her other's before. It kept me interested, needing to keep going to find out what happens. A must read. Loved it all. I've so enjoyed her Harry Potter books that it saddens me that this is the last one. She did a grand job and you won't be disappointed in any of her books. This book too I highly recommend, but please start at book 1 and read them all to get the full effect and all the stories. Well worth the money and time.
 Don't even think for ONE minute that you can just go and watch the movies and understand it all!! I was one of those fools that thought I could do that!  One of my friends told me I could not talk Harry Potter with her until I read the books.  I decided to buy all the books after that.  I read these 6 in 11 days and found how different they are and that there is SO much you need to know from the books to be able to understand many things in the movies!  After reading the books, MANY, MANY things made sense to me from the movies that I never even thought about before.  So many symbolical things which I am not going to ruin!<br/>However, if you have NOT read the books OR seen the movies, I recommend these books for an amazing read!  I got my best friend who was completely anti-Harry Potter HOOKED!  Now we're always talking about it whenever we see each other!
 Perfect! Great quality and beautiful artwork. Will cherish forever.
 Ahh, this purchase made me so happy! The books are in great condition!
 Bought as a gift for my 8 year old grandson. He loves them.
 The most amazing series I have read and will ever read. Never gets old no matter how many times I read it.
 Excellent book. Highly recommended!!
 I have followed Harry on his journeys since I was a little girl. I remember getting the first three books for Christmas when I was in 4th grade. I grew up alongside the trio, and this series is one of very few I pick up to read again and again. The story never loses its magic for me and I intend to pass the love of these books to my children. Magic is one thing that has drawn me in, and I can do nothing more than thank Ms. Rowling for enchanting my childhood with Harry and his adventures.
 I ordered, it came, on time, just as it said it would. Worked out perfectly!!
 What else can I say?  What started for me as a whim (to read the first HP novel) grew into an insatiable need to read the conclusion to this masterpiece of storytelling.  Rowling is pure Genius, and I'll happily read any further novels she writes.  I HIGHLY Recommend that before you read HP7 (is there anyone left who hasn't?) start over &amp; read all 7 novels in succession.  You will not regret putting off HP7 for a few extra weeks in order to bring all the details from the first 6 novels back into focus.  It's easy to forget important details from the previous novels (or worse, corrupted from the movies..).  Savor your time reading the whole series, as you'll never read a better story in your lifetime.
 When I was told about the Harry Potter series this was the year that i saw on the shelf and I tried to understand it but no go.<br/>but when I had read it after i had read year 1 it was really an excellent adventure and I think Harry really faced some challenges that are bigger than him and i really have to give the author a standing ovation. Terrific adventure harry potter has at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.<br/>go right to the top Harry Potter<br/><br/>RYAN<br/> ...]
 Some of the tracks cut off in the 5th book I have noticed.
 I want to preface this by saying that I love the Harry Potter series and was excited to finally be able to give this series to my young niece as a birthday present.  However, when the package arrive this weekend I received a mixture of paperback and hardback books.  It WAS NOT a paperback box set.  My husband jokingly said that I in fact received a box set because the books were delivered in a shipping box.  Needless to say, this item was not clearly labeled and I will be returning and purchasing a true paperback box set.  Hopefully it comes in time for my nieces birthday!
 What an amazing story and an amazing series!!! I came in late to the Harry Potter fan club (just now reading the series) and all I have to say is: So while I was late to the party….what a party it was!!! What was I thinking? Not reading these!? A Sin! I have to say Rowling’s writing is amazing! I loved how she tied the series together. I also was quite in awe with the detail these books have and although I am heartbroken (Snape’s story line literally hurt me) this last book was amazing! There is nothing I can say to add to these reviews other than I am a Gryffindor for life!
 Received this set promptly.  I never dreamed I would receive this set as well as  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows on the day that the latter was released.  I did not expect that expeditious mailing since I had used Super Saver.  I thank you so much to ensure that I received the six volume set as well as the last volume!  It was very kind of you. Love doing business with Amazon.

 Christmas gift for 11 year old daughter. She loved them.
 I read some previous Potters, but was not familar with all of the named characters. A cast of characters would have helped. Also, with so many kinds of creatures a description would have helped. With the early Potters I didn't want them to be over, but here I was impatient to reach the end. I must admit I was caught in the adventure in the end. But alas there wiil be no more.
 Why buy new when you can purchase used and get books that look new! Saved a small fortune on this set and the kid loves it!
 At first, I thought Harry Potter books were little kids' books and didn't feel much interest in them. Then I saw lots of people talking about them, and bought the first book out of curiosity, and started reading it.<br/><br/> I was hooked!<br/><br/>I bought this book (HP &amp; the Deathly Hallows) awhile ago and have read it three times (along with the whole Harry Potter series of books) - and enjoyed them all as much as the first time! I'm now a Harry Potter fan, and I think the books and the movies are among the most fun and entertaining books/movies I've experienced. After finishing the series, each time, I was left not wanting the story to end!
 I enjoyed this last installment of Harry Potter, it was fantastic! Loose ends were tied up, and all of my questions were answered. I couldn't have hoped for a better ending!  J.K. Rowling truly is a great writer and has a gift for being able to capture the feelings of the characters very well.  I will continue to treasure these books and re-read them whenever I'm looking for a bit of magic to be added to my daily routine.
 The first time i read Harry Potter I was 12 now I'm 19 and I still love every book in the series. The final book does not disappoint at all. J.K. covers everything that needed to be covered answered every question I had and helped to understand why she chose to end the book the way she did.If you are contemplating whether or not you should buy this book for your child or yourself....I believe you should buy it because there will never be a book that will open up your child's imagination and propel them to live a life full of happiness like Harry Potter will.
 we love it!
 Awesome
 Love it
 Visually delightful.  It makes reading the story more magical.
 Daughter loves it!
 This is a beautiful collection. The books come in a sturdy box, mine came with a little scratch on the interior of the lid. The books are black with gold writing and the paper jacket is beautiful artwork. The books are definitely the UK version. This means that the title of the first book is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
 So beautiful, well packaged, fast delivering. I'm so happy 😁
 Received it in perfect condition!
 Very good! My friend was very happy. Thank you.
 I like the overall design, this was used for a Christmas hift
 Bought them as a gift and she loved them immensely... Great..
 To get the full experience of the book I read it while listening to the Audio book.  I had ripped the CD set to my iPOD since I no longer own a portable CD player.  I found something interesting, certain sections of the book is missing.  When I play the CD on a CD player, the section is there.  I guess this is some form of Digital Rights Management.  Keep this in mind.  It is too bad that other audio book formats are not supported.<br/><br/>The book is the best one JK Rowling has written, I cried and laughed.  Jim Dale does a great job capturing the characters.
 beautiful graphics that help young readers
 I've reread this series many times.
 My 8yo(who reads on a 6th grade level)  has FINALLY embraced Harry Potter which in my late teens and into my mid 20s was the highlight of my life since I have always been a PotterHead so when she asked for this set for her upcoming 9th bday and a HP themed party in just tickled to death. Every child should have,this series. I started reading,to her at birth and she,was put into a kids inc program at 3 so she has came to share my,love of reading and I couldn't be prouder. Read,to your children. She's already read the first 2 so she,is,gonna have a good summer reading.
 One of the very best plots but of course all Harry Potter books have incredible plots and outstanding prose.  I like this one as it is early in Harry, Ron's and Herminie's attendance at Hogwarts still young enough to have fun discovery new aspects of the castle and new characters. My favorite line is when Professor Dumbledore (Professor McGonagall in the movie)  says to Ron expecting to be expelled for driving the flying car and damaging the Whomping Willow "Not today, Mr. Wesley".  It' a great line to use to yourself when you do something wrong, stupid or fail that ends up OK. I have said many, many times to my self.
 I like it!!  Its good quality and can't wait to read all of it.
 I am so impressed w/Rowling's ability to not only build a suspenseful story, populated by complicated characters, within each book, but her talent for having built it throughout all seven books.  The writing style also grew-up with the books, to match the anticipated aging of her audience, culminating in a very mature book seven, with complex, adult themes about loyalty, love, sacrifice, fear and longing, hope and despair.<br/><br/>And, amazingly, she finishes the entire series with a very satisfying ending.  Something nearly impossible for most novelists, even those with a much shorter series of books.<br/><br/>As a writer, I am astonished at her accomplishment. Kudos to Rowling.  I thank her for keeping me entertained, mesmerized and generally glued to my seat.<br/><br/>I miss Harry, Hermione and Ron already...
 Great book! My 9 year old son loves the Harry Potter series.
 Perfect condition,  and exactly what I wanted!
 J.K. Rowling had a formidable task ahead of her when she wrote the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. Was it possible to write an ending that would satisfy everyone or would she endure the wrath of her dedicated legions of fans? Probably not, but I think she came as close as she possibly could. Like many readers, I wished we had spent more time with certain tertiary characters we have come to know and love and a few plot developments felt somewhat contrived. That said, Book 7 was a thrilling read which drew me in and captivated me for its duration.
 Excellent for Harry Potter fans!
 Such a great buy. I had seen all the movies that have come out, but I wanted to read the books. I am an avid reader, but I thought the books were going to be more for children. I was wrong! I am so glad that I allowed myself this little luxury. The movies make more sense now and I can pass them on to my daughter when she is old enough to read because I know they will still be in great shape.
 It came on time and had everything it was supposed to, for me that's 5 stars
 Always loved this book from the time I was young. Still holds up as one of the best series of all time!
 Very nice Harry Potter box set with gorgeous new cover art.
 As a grandmother of a boy the same age as Harry in the first book, I wanted to share the stories with him.  I gave them to him for Christmas and urged my son to read some to him out loud as studies have shown that to be an excellent way to aid good reading habits.  As an adult working in a school, I discovered Harry early enough to get each book as it came out.  First class literature and wonderful values taught- friendship, working together for good and "it is the choices you make in life that make you what you are.
 If your reading reviews you probably already know that the books are good. So what Im going to do is review the packaging it comes in. The books are the hardcover versions that you can buy at any book store. So there is nothing different there. Everyone is complaining about the cardboard trunk that they come in. Yes the trunk is cardboard but it is tough enough to support the weight of the books easily. People shoudn't complain because I paid $115 for the set. Thats roughly $16.50 per book and that is cheap. So when you factor that in the carboard trunk they come in is essentially free. It also comes with a sticker sheet that has all the crests of each house and a few others. Overall this set is a deal and any fan of the series should like it. I am completely satisfied with the set.
 To be honest, I've got all the books now hard cover, but, because I'm moving, and I don't believe hard covers last long. Finding a soft cover book set, for this low a price..FANTASTIC..Nice sturdy box, it was originally $50..<br/><br/>I've been a big HP fan since the first book, and now the seventh is out and just..wow..if you need to read, read this, if you want to read, read this. If you want a good mixture of fantasy, mixed with emotional bits and pieces, pick up Harry potter and read books 1-7.
 Loved the illustrations!!!
 I don't know why this one has this unbelievable cheap price.<br/>This book is the real and luxury one.<br/>Buy it!
 love it  excited all over again while passing this series to my young reader<br/>I have six more required words
 At this point I don't think the Harry Potter books themselves need a review, so I'll focus on this particular digital edition.<br/><br/>First, this is one ebook that contains all seven of the Harry Potter books.  It does not include the new Cursed Child story.  The table of contents is really useful on this one.  Each book is listed and has a drop-down menu that lets you choose a particular chapter in that book.  It's much nicer than some collections I've purchased where navigating between different books is a nightmare.<br/><br/>All of the images from the original Scholastic publications are included and look pretty good.
 It almost had me at hello... but then it said good-bye.  And tried to say hello again, before saying good-bye and coming back for a final hello.  There were a few times where I thought it should have ended before it finally did.  To each their own - I know a lot of people who thought this was the best one yet, I thought it was the least well done and tried to please too many.
 I have not read Harry Potter, but my grandchildren love the books. One of my grandsons wanted all 7 books for his birthday. I saw this set and decided to order them for him. I like that the books are lighter in weight than the hardbacks, making it easier for my young grandson to hold them. The cover art is beautiful as well. I can't talk about the plot or the characters, but I can say that my grandson was very happy with them. I recommend the set for anyone who loves the books and wants a nice set of them at a reasonable price.
 ok. on time
 After having read other reviews on this collection and it's disappointing "cardboard trunk", I STILL decided to make the purchase.  As expected, the trunk held true to the other reviews, CHEAP.  With that said, I'm still very happy with this set!  I purchased this set for my son and I don't think you can beat this deal.  If you purchased these books individually, you'd pay alot more and not have ANY kind of storage box to keep the set together.  I DO recommend this purchase for anyone wishing to have an affordable, complete boxset of the Harry Potter series.
 Every book JK Rowlings will grab your attention and send you down the spiraling stories of Harry. Each new addition makes you more attached to each character and you fall more in love with all of them after each book. A true fan will absolutely adore these hard or soft cover sets.  Worth the money and definitely worth the time to read.  You will wait on pins and needles for the final installment in July.
 Everything was as I exspected
 I wanted the "Harry Potter Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-5)" because they are lighter and will be easier to re-read than the hard cover. I had to put off reading Book 6 due to some other commitment, but am finally almost to the end and plan to start at the beginning of the series again when I finish "The Half-Blood Prince". Harry ROCKS!
 I'm slightly confused why this box is getting such bad reviews.  You're buying all seven Harry Potter hardcovers in a fun box, regardless of the box's construction.  This set was what I expected.<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying that the material, the books themselves, need no introduction.  This set includes the million-seller hardcovers you could find in any used bookstore: these definitely aren't rare books, and you're definitely NOT getting a collector's item, as these boxsets can be found in any bookstore.  There is, however, a more expensive first edition box set (at almost three times the cost) that may end up being a collector's item.<br/><br/>That being said, I was delighted with the box.  In contrast to all the bad reviews, the box is decently detailed and includes decals to affix to the outside.  It is cardboard, but has a relatively sturdy inner box to lend support (as it does contain a few thousand pages of story).<br/><br/>As for the books themselves, they are the original hardcovers in all their Potter-fanatic glory.  Admittedly, the only book in the series I purchased prior to this set was book 7; the first 6 I listened to Jim Dale's excellent audiobook reading.  You're getting all seven hardcover books for less than $17 a piece (at this writing) brand new, which is a pretty good deal, given that they're incredibly imaginative books.<br/><br/>The books themselves are nice hardcovers: colorful dust jackets with thick, nicely printed paper.  As I mentioned, these are most likely the same hardcovers you could get anywhere; someone else may be more of an expert at print quality than I am.<br/><br/>And, as a bonus, you get a pretty cute little box to keep the books together.  I'd say it's a pretty good deal for a set of well-bound hardcover books in a box.
 My husband convinced me to read the books after he saw and LOVED the first Harry Potter movie.  The books get longer and more complicated with each title and they are just GREAT.  We couldn't put them down.  We've already pre-ordered book 5.  We hope to see these books on reading lists for kids in schools.  They are good, clean fun and really stir up the imagination.
 As always, JK Rowling did a marvelous job with the book.  The ending is not what you would expect.  A lot of good reading and just when you think you know how it's going to end, suprise, another twist in the plot.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed all of JK Rowling books!!
 After you've read the first 6, it'd be pretty dumb not to get the last installment of one of the best series ever. I'm sad to see it end.<br/><br/>I thought the book was very good. I got lost a few times but that might be because I was reading it at 2 or 3 in the morning. I cannot wait for the movie to come out.<br/><br/>Very good. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.
 I can't believe I'm Harry Potter-less. No more books to look forward to.<br/>I ordered the last one (Deathly Hallows) in the Deluxe edition and decided I wanted all the books in Hardcover. This is an awesome set. Packaged beautifully.<br/>Harry Potter books are something to be handed down from generation to generation. I don't think we'll ever see such an amazing set of books like this  ever again. God bless J.K Rowling for creating such a wonderful world.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it brought together many of the outstanding questions from the other six books and was well edited an written.  Spelling and grammar mistakes tend to jump out at me as I read them but I cannot recall a single occurrence of these types of errors in the book.  There were a few sentences that I had to read a few times to get the meaning right but they were not errors, just a tricky way of saying something.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a spectacular end to a phenomenal series.  I look forward to any future work the author may produce.
 I have read many books in my day including all Harry Potter books and Beedle the Bard prior to reading the Deathly Hallows.  Never, never has any book kept my attention as much as Deathly Hallows.  You will "actively" feel every emotion while reading this rivoting book, and I mean "actively".  J. K. Rowling is one great and gifted author whose imagination rivals the Brothers Grimm and Aesop.  I wait impatiently for the next two movies.
 This book is a fitting ending to the series, and a page-turner. I was sorry to see some of the characters die...some were complete surprises, others I was expecting. The only thing that stuck out to me as a bit silly was the whole "you can't magic food" thing - that seemed strange to me, random, like it was added in to make Harry's struggle more difficult. Other than that, it's an excellent read, a modern psychological mytholology in and of itself, and one that's sure to last the ages.
 (This is a spoiler-free review)<br/><br/>I feel lucky to have started this series so late in the game, and so lucky to have gotten into it just in time to enjoy the final release of this title, along with the rest of Potter fans around the globe. Respect must go to Amazon, for getting it to people's doorsteps on release day, and with the treat of some special packaging that really made the occasion all the more special.<br/><br/>What more can be said about this book other than it's a very sad thing to see the series end, yet very necessary. We've seen many things with this group of characters, and Rowling's universe--like our own--is filled with people who have courage, good, evil and a little bit of everything inside them in a way that pulls us all in.<br/><br/>This book is a very satisfying read, an obviously a must-own title for anyone who likes to read books that take you on an adventure. Like The Davinci Code, and other page turners, The Deathly Hallows is hard to put down--and with good reason: this is the end. My only disappointment is that this book (despite its size) feels too short in its ending. Not to say the story is not finished in a satisfying manner (because it is), but rather that we can't once again delve into Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, or any of the other fantastic places that have become so clearly etched in our minds, and don't get some additional exposition that might have made it even more satisfying.<br/><br/>That being said, everyone has their own opinion about a book, and I think most will agree that this is simply a masterpiece. Thanks for all the pages J.K. Rowling, and for a story that will be passed down with other classics.
 These books are soooo good. Any Harry Potter fan needs to own them. I am so happy that I found them for a great price. Thank you so much!!
 The most gripping of the series.  Very well written
 Nice box set - as expected.  My daughter was happy !
 They are very good books and good quality.
 The CD version of the book is excellently done.  Jim Dale adds a dimension to J K Rowling's work that makes it even more enjoyable than simply reading it can bring.  Dale is talented and seems to have endless voices for all of the different characters he portrays as he reads.  I will miss not having future editions of Harry Potter!  It ended all too soon and left some characters and subplots unexplored and unexplained, in my opinion.  But overall, I say it is an excellent body of work that has a timeless quality, so I can continue to enjoy it over and over.
 I am one of those people who have to read the end first to find out what happens to Harry, but I won't spoil it.  Even having done that, the book was a joy to read; all the little threads of stories coming together in a tightly knitted piece.  Ms. Rowling's ability to write has grown over the years and there are passages that I reread just for the sheer joy of her use of the language.  Well done, Ms. Rowling.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a>
 Got this for my granddaughter for a Christmas gift and I know that she loves to read.
 Wonderful set!
 Lots of action from the get-go; a real page-turner.  Some characters are fleshed out in a more satisfying way; no spoilers here about who that might be.  Let's just say that not everyone is as they appear.<br/><br/>Only one negative, really; the story rambles a fair bit before coming to what feels like a rapid and perhaps too neat conclusion.  I would've preferred the great revelations at the end to have been more nuanced and spaced out in the story itself.  But that's a minor quibble.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable story from beginning to end.
 Love Harry Potter it is quite an interesting story even if you read it 7 times already it will always bring back memories.
 Jim Dale has delivered the final Harry Potter book with his usual superb delivery and has not left me disappointed.  Although I read the book first, hearing it on the audio version has brought it to life in a whole other light.  He is consistent with voices and inflections, and has been since book one.  I highly recommend both the book itself and the audio version.
 What can I say about the books. Simply one the most captivating and unique stories in literature and Rowling has a way with words that makes it near impossible to not binge read these books until you realize that it's 5 am and you have work in a hour! I bought the hardcover set and it came promptly in perfect shape. No problems here as others have suggested. Just make sure you are buying the right edition before the purchase and there should be no problems. Overall very satisfied with my purchase
 I got this for a Christmas it is perfect.
 The climax is incredible.  JK Rowling has an unbelieveable wild imagination and a talent at story telling.  As a writer myself, I am floored at how incredible a writer she is.
 I missed having them available to read and annotate at will, so bought them again for my own amazement. &lt;grin&gt;
 I think that the best part of Harry potter and the Deathly Hallows Book on CD is that its unabridge. I have not bought many books on CD before because they were abridged, meaning thay had parts cut out so that it could fit on a smaller number of cds. This cut cost but also cut the heart of the books out. I am so glad that the Harry Potter books didn't go that way.
 They came in perfect condition no creases
 Well read and always enjoyable. The movies were good but the books are great.
 This book is about Harry Potter in Hogwart school for witchcraft and wizardry the second year. In this book, all the muggle born students are not safe, it included Hermione, Harry's best friend! Now Harry's have to discover what's happening to these students, so in this book he and Ron had to find out what's wrong.<br/>Great book that is.
 My mom bought this book and I love it. It has everything I want!
 I am super happy with this product. It arrived right on time, and all of the books are beautiful. I am very satisfied!
 I purchased the series so my fifth grader could improve her reading skills by following along with the CD's.  I also purchased them because we were going to Canada and would be in the car for 12+ hours.  The price was by far the best that I found.<br/>I found the narrators voice to be very annoying at times, especially with certain characters.  It was almost too much to listen too with certain characters.  When we listened to it in the car, my family were so distracted by some of the narrators voice characters, they couldn't listen to the story and wanted it turned off.<br/>Although, I found that the more I listened to the CD's, the better it got and the more I enjoyed it.  He won an Emmy for his work and I can see why, due to all the characters and voices he does.  He is very talented, regardless if you like his voices or not.  After a couple of books, I found that I really enjoyed the CD's and was able to enjoy the story.  They are worth getting if you want to listen to them in the car (as opposed to always watching DVD's in the car).  They are also a great tool to help young readers follow along with the books.
 I ordered this entire set for my granddaughter who THOUGHT she was only getting ONE of Harry Potter's books.  Since she lives out of state her parents put their cell phone up to her when she opened the package and I heard her go out of her mind when she saw she had the entire set!  They are her most treasured possession!  She's 11 and she reads them over and over and over again!  Thank you for helping me make my most precious granddaughter SOOO super happy!
 This book was BRILLIANT!! How she tied it all in I don't know.  I read it in 2 days, and if I didn't have kids to take care of I could have easily done it in 1.<br/>She takes so many twists and turns in this one.  Just when you think you have it all figured out you find out you don't have a clue!! She answered all of my questions.  I love what she did with Snape and the Malfoys.  I thought the ending was great!!  I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I will just say it will not diappoint, anyone who says otherwise must not have read the same book.<br/>This book in an instant classic and a MUST READ!!
 As with all Harry Potter books, this one as amazing. HP7 satisfied me until the end, and it did not disappoint me. Rowling however does leave many questions left unanswered. Some apparent grammar mistakes near the end also left a slight bitter taste in my mouth, but overall it was highly enjoyable.<br/>Although if you've been reading Harry Potter, I doubt that any of these reviews will actually change your mind.
 I am specifically reviewing the illustrated edition.<br/>This was a gorgeous edition. I am a teacher, and I brought this to school. I found that my students with reading disabilities such as dyslexia or other similar disorders had a much easier time reading out of this edition than any other. I have no idea why, but that was a huge happy surprise.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone. My biggest complaint is that the corners were damaged slightly in shipping due to the box being too large.
 I have read every single harry potter book and I absolutely love all the books. This book has a lot more action in it which is a plus, I was at the edge of my seat because some much is happening inside the book the way j.k. Rowling tells the story is unbelievable. I like how in this book we get to see more of dumbledore's past because he has always been some kind of mystery to us readers. Also we get to learn more about snape's past also because he was also a mystery. With all the rumors going on you'll be surprised how the book ended. my only problem is that the book can lose its affect by being too serious sometimes. it make me wonder what ever happened tot he harry potter that used to be happy and have fun with his friends.5 stars..2 thumbs up and all of everything.
 I was SO impressed with this story!! After having read the entire series, I was very pleased at how Rowling tied all the stories together so neatly. I also thought it was clever of her to leave just a teensie bit of leeway in terms of an opening for future related works. Although, I have a suspicion that nothing she will do after this phenominal modern classic. I highly recommend this book to all Potter fans. You won't be disappointed.
 This book set was an amazing deal,sure it's not the complete series,but I was able to buy the 7th book elsewhere used...so overall it was a very incredible value. I skimmed through each book to make sure it was intact,I was.For being shipped and probably sitting in storage,the set was in very good conditions,corners were worn slightly but that's invitable. Being paperbacks,it's much easier to read in any setting. I rarely ever sit to read,I'm usually in bed or something.<br/><br/>As for the series,I read books 1-4 back in elementary school,but then unfortunately went through I phase where I thought Harry Potter was nerdy and uncool. As an adult now, I cannot believe how foolish that was. The storyline is beautifully sewn together and the character development is terrific. They develop into adults realistically,even though placed in a fantasy series. The way the author writes is incredible, as you start reading the words just seem to vanish and you're then placed in an incredible imaginary world. This is a very special book series!
 I already have the hardcover version of this. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for a while, and the books just keep getting bigger and bigger, but I don't mind. I have to say, though, the paperback version is definitely easier to hold. I'm trying to take it slow with reading it so I get everything, 'cause I read the hardcover version in one day when it came out, and now I think it's time to read it again, especially before the new movies come out. Hardcover books are nicer looking, but paperbacks are definitely more efficient. It's really just personal preference, and that's the main reason why I bought the paperback.
 I am not a foaming-mouthed Potter fan, though I like the series. I only just read it last year. I started in Dec '06 and finished when the new book came out. In fact, I read books 4,5,6 and 7 in like one month (For a slow reader like me this took a miracle. Either that or a few slow days at work....heh heh, ah it's the American way....)<br/><br/>Book seven is fantastic. It is far and away the best book in the series. Rowling seals the deal with the most intricate plot, the biggest battles, and the most spectacular surprises. If you haven't read this book by now you probably never will. Either that or you live on Saturn and your Amazon shipment is only now arriving...
 Grandson loved this
 I thought this last volume very well done, although I noticed a number of details that got overlooked. For example...  What are the prinicipal characters doing in their later lives?  Who is the new headmaster of Hogwarts?  the book contains both drama and pathos, tragedy and heroism.  It also clearly borrows a bit from modern culture, as noted in some of the dialogue; see the clever reference to the movie "Aliens" near the end of the book.  The center section dragged a bit, but all in all,it is a masterful work.
 What's there to say? It's Harry Potter.
 It's a bit annoying that you can't buy the books individually for Kindle now. I'm not a huge fan of these "complete collection" roll-ups. It makes it harder to navigate, makes a mockery of time-to-read, and means you have to spend a big chunk of cash to get books you might not want.<br/>I have all the books in physical form, but wanted an electronic copy to read to my children. This was the only way I could get the books, but I doubt I'll ever go past book four as a book at bedtime because the later books are less suitable for young children.<br/><br/>I imagine if there were separate books, this would be cheaper, but why? Because they can? It's just a way to keep profits up on a series that has already made a fortune.
 It's a really good book series. I bought them for my daughter and she absolutely loves them
 I held off reading this series for years because i just knew I would love it~<br/>and i was NOT disappointed.  Amazon had it on sale for $15 and I bit... worth every penny and then some.  EXCELLENT READ and well laid out.  My ONLY complaint is that while reading you can't tell which book you are in, as the top of the page always says "Harry Potter the Complete Collection".  That made it hard when discussing where I was with friends to know exactly what book I was in without them having to guess.  This would not make me change my mind in purchasing if I had to do over again.
 ordered for my daughter and she loves it
 Perfect! This book arrived in extremely good condition.
 The banter between the characters is wonderful.  The first time I read the books, I paid attention on how it would impress a young man. Rowling makes Harry's feelings and actions believable and there are things one can learn, such as how bad attitude and "cheek" are improper and good actions are rewarded. As the books progress, one sees how friendships change and that there will be times when you have confrontations with your best of friends and at other times your friends will need your support. The books provide a perspective from both a boy's and a girl's point of view, to provide a better understanding how the sexes differ and how each needs to compliment them. The Deathly Hollows really deals with personalities and friendships as the fight between Good and Evil comes to its conclusion. Where good gives evil their final chance to change and even then Harry does not do the killing curse but allows Lord Voldermort to go to his own destiny.  It's a wonderful series and the chest is a great way to keep the books together, especially, if you don't have room on your bookshelves.
 I MUST NOT TELL LIES....I rarely find that final books, movies, etc. live up to expectations, especially ones generating such a mainstream buzz. But after nearly a decade of devotion, as a reader introduced to the series early, I am content with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This is also exceptional because of the sheer enormity of the body count on this one, like the 2 books before it, most of the fallen turned out to be my favorite characters.  The author  had released before the release that two major characters who die. This is an understatement. Of course, plenty of death happen "off screen," TEN deaths are "major" players in the sense that they appear in 4-7 books!<br/><br/>While J.K.Rowling avoids making this the largest novel in order to answer all the questions and plot requirements, she does do the finale staple in the referencing or return of many, many, many concepts, characters and catch-phases of the past 6 books. Settings, spells and special guest appearances are all welcome additions to HP VII.  Things big and small appear with parts to play: For example Dedalus Diggle, a very minor player, was the first wizard to appear in Book 1, and he is the first to do so here in the final story. Other characters returning in person or as a passing reference include the likes of: Mr. Ollivander, the surviving members of the Order and the D.A., the Malfoys, the Weasley's Ghoul, Stan Shunpike, Grindelvald, Nearly-Headless-Nick, Norbert, Bathilda Bagshot, R.A.B., Gregorovitch, Viktor Krum, the Lovegoods, house elves, Wormtail just  to name a few. Watch out for cameos or references to inanimate and animate objects like, Harry's first snitch, his invisibility cloak (which plays a major role ), the Monster Book of Monsters, the Whomping Willow, the Marauder's Map, pensieves, Polyjuice Potion,  and even Sirius' flying motorcycle as referenced early in Sorcerers' Stone.<br/><br/>Book SIX focused on tracking down the Horcruxes or magical objects into which the Dark Lord Voldemort a.k.a Tom Riddle has divided his soul to be virtually immortal. Horcruxes we've seen the Diary, the Ring, the great snake Nagini and Voldemort himself. We get some insight into his history and plans, but by the end of Half-Blood Prince we have as more questions than answers.<br/><br/>Questions ultimately answered in Book Seven:<br/><br/>Is HARRY himself one of the remaining Horcruxes?<br/>How to destroy them? How did Dumbledore destroy the ring?<br/>Where is real locket Horcrux? Who is R.A.B.?<br/>What becomes of Hogwarts?<br/>Is Snape evil? Why did Dumbledore trust him?<br/>Did Dumbledore have a plan?<br/>What are the Deathly Hallows? What is Voldemort's ultimate goal?<br/>Must HARRY die to stop Voldemort?<br/>What did Dumbledore really see in the Mirror of Erised, back in Book 1?<br/><br/>BOOK 7... Careful some plot spoilers below.......<br/><br/>This one opens with scenes behind enemy lines, revealing Harry's 17th birthday and the end of his protection from the Dark Lord is fast approaching. The Death Eaters are ready for the Order's plan to move Harry to a safe house. Following a down-rite heart warming good-bye to the Dursleys, the action-packed escape ends with the loss of more than just Harry's broom, but two friends fall as his childhood innocence is symbolically stripped from him. Things slow-down just long enough for The Wedding, before the chill is off the drinks all hell breaks lose and Harry's quest begins again for the "you know whats" and this time Harry's archetype takes on literal interpretation as his searches for a sword, "the Sword of Gryffindor"  possibly the only way to finish his assignment for Dumbledore.<br/>The Sword is at Hogwarts and Hogwarts is again controlled by the Ministry, but a corrupt or controlled government which has placed Snape as Headmaster. He has the Sword in Dumbledore's office, or does he? This quest and the search for the Horcruxes lead Harry back to the ex-headquarters of the Order, Grimmauld Place where he makes things right with Kreacher, the house elf willed to Harry along with the family estate itself.<br/>Harry visits his own family's home which has become a memorial of sorts like GRACELAND. I think Hermione would disapprove of the graffiti there as well. Before this there is a daring visit to the "Muggle-Born Registration Commission. Forced further into hiding the trio learn more of Dumbledore's early history, the tale of the 3 Brothers and possible revelations about Harry's cloak.<br/><br/>The Sword is recovered by a Gryffindor other than Harry, but pulled from a lake like the Arthur archetype. Harry learns the hard way that there is power and fear in a name as the taboo on the Dark Lords name leads to the trio's capture and imprisonment at Malfoy Manor where Voldemort himself is a house-guest. Wormtail makes good on his debit to Harry. Ultimately they escape at the cost of a friend's LIFE along with fellow prisoners: Griphook the Goblin, Luna Lovegood and wandmaker Ollivander. They learn lots of wand lore that will be Harry's key weapon in his "final" battle with the Dark Lord, the "Elder Wand" will be the deciding force. Griphook will lead Harry and friends as they break into the best protected place in the wizarding world Gringotts Bank in order to claim a Horcrux. Are there really Dragons and traps protecting the place? Griphooks price for this good deed?<br/><br/>During return to HOGWARTS, new secret entrance to the school is revealed, along with a character previously only referenced Aberforth Dumbledore, who reveals his late brother's motivating guilt. Also the D.A. are summoned, among others to help Harry in his final quest. Harry up to this point has walked a fine line, between falling into the traps that both Tom Riddle and Dumbledore fell. The desire for the "Greater Good" costing a lot of lives. For all of his trust in people Dumbledore's greatest weakness was his secretiveness, and it cost both him and Harry plenty. Meanwhile, Harry risks his life turning away from killing whenever possible, Lupin even calls him on this early in this story. Harry here makes a choice to include the D.A., his friends &amp; students from Hogwarts in his last mission for Dumbledore.  This final battle at the school sees the return of many magical forces from the Forest and more. What begins as a play for time becomes the end of the war. The cast of characters and tied up plot lines is enormous here, Ron proves his worth and cleverness in "now or never" moments while Neville Longbottom proves himself a true Gryffindor as well.<br/><br/>Fear not there is an epilogue that is a satisfying bookend for the series as is the entire novel, "An exceptionally satisfying bookend to an exceptional series" that will live on long past the final Hollywood interpretations, as surely as THE CHUDLEY CANNONS will rank bottom of this years LEAGUE!!"<br/><br/>Thanks J.K.<br/><br/>Long live Gryffindor, where dwell the Brave at Heart!
 It was great to finally read this book
 It's hard to say for sure, but this may have been my favorite of the Harry Potter series.  I actually shed tears at one point.  I'm just a bit sad that there will be no more books in the series.<br/><br/>As usual Mr. Dale's narration was wonderful.
 Love a good story
 Simple to order and delivered rapidly.  Easy, satisfied experience
 What else?
 The cost from Amazon saved me almost 50% from a large chain book store.  The set came quickly, wrapped in cellophane and in mint condition.  I read every night with my 8 year old son, and he quickly became hooked on this series.  He received the set for his birthday in September, and now, 3 months later, we are half way through the fourth book.  People either love the series or hate it, but if you are a fan like we are, this is a quality boxed set.  As you can see, each book when standing next to each other creates a picture of Hogwarts.  On the back of each book there is the back view of Harry and a quote from the text of the book.
 Excellent book
 Perfectos!
 Well, you knew it had to end, some day. But now I want to know what happens after the 19 years. Surely  life isn't all peaches and cream. Someone from the DEs must want to rise to the challenge. What fun will it be to have the powers they have worked so hard to hone all that time just to pull lollipops out of the air...? Alas, we'll never know. The CD version is excellent!!!
 I liked everything I chose except the cane attachment. I didn't like that at all!!
 It’s Harry Potter nothing else to say
 The reviews are right, bring out those tissues ladies and gentlemen because the final installment of Harry Potter is so inadequate it will certainly bring you to tears.<br/><br/>Let me admit that Rowling did an incredible job throughout the Harry Potter epic up until this book, which in my opinion IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.  I loved her books, which is why I am heart wrenched and disappointed.  She had complete freedom to do anything she wanted, instead she preferred to make various spelling errors, lack of character development, or better yet negative character shifts (especially in Hermione, Ron, Ron's mother, Dumbeldore, and Voldemort), plot holes and MAJOR contradictions.  Majority of the book I believe fell in the former category, but she did produce some marvelous chapters and moments in the book, but not enough.  Nevertheless, it left me wondering if JK Rowling and her Hogwarts Express ran out of steam.<br/><br/>The unnecessary deaths of main characters throughout Book 7 have left me greatly confused.  The deaths in Book 7 did nothing for the plot, and did nothing to help aggrandize Harry into a better hero.  Instead, Rowling was hacking a way at people, I believe to lighten her burden of wrapping up the story.<br/><br/>There were too many cheesy parallels inside the book:<br/>(...)<br/><br/>Outside the book:<br/>(...)<br/>*Do red and green streaks of light fly around only when you perform curses?  I had forgotten that I was reading Harry Potter and not Star Wars.<br/><br/>One of Rowling's gifts is that she can take people's imagination and question reality... "what if...could this be true...,"but instead this book lacked any of that, and left readers doubtful, and stuttering in their hands..."hmm, yea right."<br/><br/>I am not really sure as to what happened in this book because her other books were so amazing.  I won't get started on the Epilogue.  What I do know is that there is a tremendous lack of original ideas, and the incorporation of too many other people's work in this book without proper transcendence into the Harry Potter Wizarding World.<br/><br/>I can only conclude that Rowling was pressed for time and squeezed this out as best she could.  Ugh, how sad to end a wonderful journey like this.  The creation of the Deathly Hallows to sidetrack readers from the Horcuxes and potential "serious" answers to longstanding Harry Potter questions is iniquitous.  But what is more disappointing to me than that is the next time I pick up one of her books I'll be most dubious of it.
 Look, I give the Harry Potter series a 5 out of 5 - but I am sort of disappointed with this. I bought this paperback box set because my HP series is old, unmatched and worn out. Sadly, these are the small paperback copies. My originals were the big paperbacks (and hardbacks) and had these same covers, but sadly, the paperbacks themselves are just a smidge bigger than mass market paperbacks. The later books are SO THICK THEY ARE BRICKS and the font is tiny. There will be no way to read them without breaking the crap out of the spine. I just don't think these are worth $50.
 Love them
 I love reading the book
 Of course I'm dissapointed that the series has ended but the conclusion in the seventh book was satisfactory. Harry lives and we are allowed a peak into his future and see that he is happy ever after--we hope. Rowlings may change her mind and write anotehr book about Harry. Imagine his children in danger and him coming to the rescue with his buddies.
 Perfect.
 cool
 I was lead on a rollercoaster ride that ran out of steam. JKR did a good job of wrapping up story lines, answering the biggest cliff hanger since "Who shot JR?", and humanizing characters with faults and fears like everyone has. However, what she also did was use ALOT of excess verbiage that was absolutely not needed and tended to drag, over simplify situations that really needed more depth, and worse of all, bowed to the money with a "Hollywood" ending. It was anticlimactic at the best, it left me feeling....nothing, one death was a little touching but even it happened fast with no lead in so you really didn't care, and the others were just...humph...whatever. You spend the majority of your time with Harry and his usual angst and ignorance till things are handed to him, and Voldamort, who really had no use but to laugh manically and be stupid. The best part of the book was brining out an unexpected hero in the end who you have always secretly rooted for and finally got his happy ending. It simply pales in comparison to the build, character development, and overall care to story she took in the rest of her books. I was really disappointed. :{
 A fan of Peter Needham's brilliant translations of Harry Potter, I've posted a lengthy review of this latest installment, a review unfortunately too long to appear here, on my own web site: edwinfirmage.com/Supporting_Documents/Creative_&amp;_Scholarly_Works_files/Review%20of%20Harry%20Potter.pdf. The review includes numerous examples of Needham's deftness in turning idiomatic English into equally idiomatic Latin. Suffice it to say, this new translation is as good as the first. I can't imagine a better way to introduce kids to the fun of Harry Potter and Latin. And for anyone interested in learning conversational Latin (no, that's not a contradiction in terms), this book is a superb teacher.
 I was one of the many who could not wait to get my hands on the latest Harry Potter book. I have been a definite fan since the very first chapter of the very first book, but it was with a great deal of disappointment that I finished the series.<br/><br/>Rowling doesn't even appear to be trying anymore. The storyline wanders all over the place, there are great tracts of inactivity with too much over-dramatization of teen angst, the so-called 'drama' amounts to nothing more intricate than a mass kill-fest wherein she slashes down characters in a freshman-creative-writing-class manner with very little attention paid to the aftermath of such deaths. The ending is sloppy and deeply unsatisfying, the 'explanations' for many of the interesting mysteries set up in the previous books are pathetic and poorly thought out, and the final chapter was so bad as to make me actually cringe. The Epilogue, as it is laughingly called, is little more than a badly written list of the children that Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and other obvious pairs have. I have read better endings than this tripe in fanfiction works by fifteen year olds.<br/><br/>Among the questions that the patient reader never has answered are these: Does Harry ever become an Auror? What jobs do Hermione and Ron have? How does George deal with the death of his twin? Does Harry ever see the Dursleys again? How does Hogwarts fare after that massive battle at the end of the book? ... The list is literally miles long.<br/><br/>Rowling dropped the crystal ball so hard that it shattered, sucking away a great deal of the joy that I found in the series as a whole. It is with a heavy heart that I am forced, by a sense of literary taste, to call Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows one of the most disappointing and enraging pieces of trash to ever sail out of an overpaid author's hands. Rowling has clearly lost all respect for her readers, and this book shows it.
 Exactly as advertised
 I loved this book!  I think it was well worth the wait.  I'm so glad to have all the questions finally answered and be able to understand the motives of Dumbledore and Snape.  We were even able to finally understand Petunia!  I'm really going to miss this series.  I think it will be a very long time before we run upon something that even slightly compares.
 Excellent! Very enjoyable to listen to.
 After reading the first book I fell in love with the story, its action and mixed fantasy, this one is just another piece of art, one that you can sit and enjoy and understand a little bit more of the world this boy lives in and the things that happen around him, the fantastic and clever ways they have to find out all they want, the way they solve the mysteries...
 Amazing! I love the style of these books and it arrived on time and in good condition
 beautiful books!
 I appreciated J.K. Rowling's decision to fill in the blanks left from the previous six books.  Although there is much darkness in book seven, J.K. Rowling never lost sight of her primary audience - children.
 Just what my daughter wanted!
 I want to say thanks to JKR - this series has really altered what we read, what we perceive a book should be, and will do so for a looooonnngg time.<br/>The last installment blows you away - everything about it was wondrous - yes, there are many deaths, but there are many triumphs that have those deaths not be in vain.<br/>This book explains the actions of Snape, one of my favorites in the series, and all loose ends tie together in amazing ways -<br/>To me, then ending is perfect - others have found it too story book.
 Well, I guess there's no description needed about the book content, everyone know about them.. Speaking specifically about the box set I think it's a great deal.. I got these because they were the best deal when buying the whole set of books (which is what I was looking for) but I was a little skeptical because I don't like buying paprback books, I like to go for the hardcover but since all the hardcovers were so expensive i figured I'd give it a try. So far they remain the same way, no pages missing, lovely presentation with the illustrations on the box and full illustrations on the books at the beginning of every chapter and they're well adhered, no pages have come off or anything and they don;t seem like they will either. Thequality of the pages is not the best if you look at them xlosely but they're not cheap paper that rips either. it looks good. The only thing was that one one of the books (I believe chamber of secrets) apparently one of the pages had not been printed completely (the page had been like cut in half) and they pasted the remaining piece, (I just noticed b/c the page felt thicker than the rest but you can't really see it) that happened in 1 page, the rest of the books are fine. So I would encourage other people to buy it as well, it's a great deal to get all books at once, plues the box looks pretty
 (...)<br/>This was a great ending to a great series, in the finest tradition of the hero's journey. It's true that everything was more or less predicted in discussions online and off amongst avid readers, but that's hardly a criticism of the book. When millions of people are trying to guess what one writer will do, the odds of them guessing correctly are pretty darn good.<br/><br/>The epilogue, I felt, was a mistake, though possibly an intentional one. It reveals only one thing we couldn't have guessed-- (...) and that's hardly worth squelching the glory of the real ending. The effect is to break the spell that Harry Potter has held me in for the last eight years, since I first met him in the Anchorage Airport bookshop, and maybe that's what the author was trying to do-- remind us we live in a Muggle world after all.<br/><br/>(...)
 JK Rowling has done it again!  There are some things in the book that caused us Potter fans to yell out "That's just Wrong!" but the incidents fit in well.  Just upsets us when bad things happen to great characters!<br/>Not sure about the ending...maybe wishing there was a bit more insight there into adult Harry.  Good way to finish the series.  What's next, JK?
 Books are great just wished they were hardback.
 Super cute! Love it
 Came quickly and safely with no rips or tears
 This review is spoiler free!<br/><br/>I have just raced through Harry Potter 7 in a span of 18 hours. In a way, I'm kicking myself. I should have dragged it out, enjoyed the journey more. Let the last story roll over me during the week.<br/><br/>But the book was impossible to put down. After a slow start of picking up the pieces, it reaches an unbearable intensity level that rips through to the last page.  Unrelenting is the word I would use. There may be some who dislike this book as it does not take its time to enjoy the scenery. It rushes. But then, you won't want it to slow down.<br/><br/>Again, staying away from spoilers, I can tell you that this book differs from the others. Almost the entire book is focused, laser-like, on Ron, Hermione and Harry as the they to unravel the mysteries of the last six books. But no one is forgotten. All the past characters get their moments to shine. And if any of them fall, they fall with wand in hand. You will not feel cheated.<br/><br/>The final confrontation - that's not a spoiler, you knew there'd be one -- is handled with Rowling's usual skill and grace. It does not disappoint. After seven books and some, what? 3000 pages? You will close the book knowing it ended the way it should. And that the journey was worth it.<br/><br/>The best thing is that Rowling answers all the questions, touches on all the details, never seems to forget a single thread. The backstory is explained, unravelling mysteries that have been around since Book One.<br/><br/>As the title of my review says, when you finish this book, there will be only one question remaining...<br/><br/>Now what?
 This book set is amazing! I already owned the 7th book, so I did not want to purchase the entire series. I found this book set for a great price and it is perfect for those of us who already have the last book!
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Hard-Cover-Boxed-Set-Books-1-7/dp/0545044251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Hard Cover Boxed Set: Books #1-7</a> It's exactly what I wanted! The Mary GrandPré illustrations on the front and back, comes in a cardboard box made to look like a trunk, and all hardcovered! Can't ask for more! It was packed nicely and arrived in pristine condition. Definitely one I'll collect for years to come :)
 Same books as the $40 set but they come in a CHEAP carboard trunk. The handles are thin rope, not sturdy as the ad claims. The privacy lock is cheap plastic. They make the box look like it is a quality velvet lined wood trunk (and for an extra $80 you would think thats what your getting)and I fell for it, please don't make the same mistake.
 While I would have preferred to be able to purchase this as a digital download (a format the other books in the series are available in), this CD set meets the need.  Fantastically narrated, this is a great way for couples/families to read a book together.  And, of course, anyone looking at the last book in this series already knows this is an excellent series and story.
 Bought as gift. Very satisfied.
 Was delivered quickly and was very much enjoyed
 I can't find anything to complain about. I received this order right on time, no difficulties, no hassle. It was placed in well protected box, well taken care of, to make sure the items were in prime condition, which they were. Overall, I am most pleased with the seller and the merchandise. Thanks a bunch!
 Came faster than expected and was everything i expected
 Noice
 I greatly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This book wasn't incredible, but no one should have ever expected it to be. The story of Harry Potter builds as he grows more mature, therefore allowing greater depth in late books. The character development is what is exciting about the Harry Potter series, each character grows and changes from book to book. If you are not anti-mainstream and have not yet read a Harry Potter book, I strongly suggest you try reading the first two.
 I am a 22 year-old Graduate student and I LOVE Harry Potter books! I am completely addicted to them. I have read 2 in the last 48 hours. I would recommend them to anyone at any age. This boxed set is a great deal and would be something any muggle or wizard would enjoy.
 Wonderful!
 Ah I got this right after it came out (yet now I review it!)<br/>This is no doubt a great series with great characters. I definitely enjoyed it. I stayed up till 7 am reading the last parts of it (notice I say last parts, I'm a slow reader). I read all the previous ones at libraries but decided to buy the other 6 since I've been into them since grade school. I'll probably want to read'm again.
 In the sequel to Sorceror's Stone, Harry Potter finds himself as the suspected Heir of Slytherin, who is accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling continues the story of Harry in this wonderful sequel.  Harry and his friends are a year older and a little wiser.  Ginny Weasley, the younger sister of Ron, joins them at Hogwarts, completely infatuated with Harry.  The story is unique and fresh.  It captivates young readers as well as adults, such as myself.  I highly recommend this book.
 Beautiful! My 4 year old has been enjoying these so much.
 My son loved it!
 GOOD
 I bought this set as a gift for a 12 year old. He absolutely loved it. I think he will cherish it for a long time and will hopefully pass it onto his children. It's a quality collection
 Beautiful Book.
 Ok so I have not finished yet, but I think this is going to be my rate.<br/>  WHY 4 STARS AND NOT 5?!<br/>Well...it's kinda weird and wild!<br/>It's everywhere!<br/>  DO YOU THINK OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT?!<br/>  WHY?<br/>Well, if you like fantasy then you would like this.<br/>  ANYTHING ELSE?<br/>Nope.<br/>  HOPE YOU LIKED MY REVIEW!<br/>  : )<br/>Bye!<br/>and keep loving your kindle!<br/><br/>NOW IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMTHING ABOUT MY REVIEW, THEN GET THE BOOK CALLED,<br/>BIG NATE AND FRIENDS AND NAME THE REVIEW ''SAY HI'' AND POST IT AND I WILL LOOK AT<br/>IT.<br/><br/>  THANK YOU!
 I have bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. We were both very disappointed. This is not present - worthy. The  "collectible trunk-like box with sturdy handles" is a cheap cardboard box with rope handles. The "privacy lock" is a 2 piece plastic clip. No "Bonus decorative stickers" included.
 My son LOVES it
 AS the others, I waited with great anticipation for this book, and was not at all disappointed.  I am eager for my friends to finish, as I want to discuss some of the nuances that I still do not totally understand, but the depth of this book, the references to Hitler-esque situations, are so relevent today. Rowling says so much more in this book than ever before, about humanity, and there is much to be learned amidst her story of magic and wizards.<br/>To be honest, I do not understand how most children would understand this book at all, I would think at least 13 or 14 to grasp all that is going on, certaibnly not for 8 or 9 year olds.<br/>And also, one really does have to have read the prior books, at least 5 + 6 to read this one... this cannot be the first Potter book one reads.
 These books will be your absolute life. I suggest watching the first 3 movies then reading the complete series. It gives you a real feel for the characters which you absolutely fall in love with. These books will consume your time. You'll want to do nothing but read and read and read and eat and read and read, my life in a nutshell for the 5 weeks I was reading these books. They're just so appealing, and of course sad in the sense that this story, along with the characters, aren't real. They're all great books and you're going to be really sad when its over.
 I must admit that I am a late bloomer when it came to reading Harry Potter.  I was not an enthusiast in the beginning.  It wasn't untill I got my 40" Hd TV and watched the series on HBO.  I slowly got hooked on the charachters and plots and found myself being drawn into the Harry Potter circle.  I truly love to read but I was not doing much casual reading mostly I read manuals of some sort or another.  I found the Harry Potter book set advertised on my FB page (I follow three or four Harry Potter pages as well as Amazon) and since I have seen all the movies except the last I was interested in how the movies differed from the books.  I purchased the books at a good price, recieved the shipment in good time and was off to enjoying one of my favorite relaxing past times. Although I do not know how relaxing it was reading book seven.  "The Deathly Hallows" was filled with adventure and danger keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.  I have dealt with Amazon numerous times and so far never hit a glitch in their billing or customer service.  The books are great but since multi-millions of copies have been sold world wide I don't think it will be news to anyone that reads this review.  The seven books in their own display case is a wonderful addition to anyone's bookcase.  I purchased the paperback version and I am thinking of also buying the hard cover books because although paperbacks are less expensive they get disfigured easily.  As far as the quality of the written word I read the seventh book in just four days.  I could not put it down for long, I just had to get to the end to see if Harry, Hermoine &amp; Ron's army of friends was victorious over the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters.  Happy Reading to all.
 Bought book set for my God kids. Loved it.
 Perfect condition, and all books in order!
 It was in perfect condition.
 a little old but not damaged
 Best illustrations !!!!!
 I was terrified of opening book 7 and reading it. I had avoided spoilers and reviews like crazy but had feared the worst for Harry. I won't say how it ended, I won't spoil it for those readers who haven't finished it but lets just say true fans will agree that its the perfect ending. Yes its tragic, yes its realistic, no its not too far fetched (within the series constraints)...JK did it again, its the perfect ending. But does anyone else who's finished the book feel a little lost now? For years we've all been reading, theorizing, reading again and now...well its truly over. I feel somewhat lost...like a piece of my childhood is finally over with (and I haven't been a child for years now). Goodbye Harry, you were and will always be a wonderful and treasured piece of all of our lives.
 To be honest I was not sure what to expect when I read The Deathly Hallows...  It is really dificult to wrap up such a brilliant, long-running series as Harry Potter properly.  It turns out my fears were unfounded, as the book is not only brilliant, but highly satisfying.  I think most fans of the series will be quite happy with the book from cover to cover.  Kudos to J.K. Rowling for producing such a imaginative fantasy world and allowing millions of people, young and old (like me) to enjoy.  Highly recommended to all Potter fans.
 My son is enjoying the series
 I bought this product thinking I will not be able to read the books since I though that having seeing all the movies will take away my interest in reading the books. I was completely wrong. I have the background of the movies of course, however I am clearer on what is happening and understand the story a lot better. Furthermore, I can make sense of the movies as well (since they get confusing at times). I love the books, the movies change the story and characters and cut valuable information from the original story. The books have allowed me to fully appreciate Harry Potter's life and what happens within J.K. Rowling's world of wizardry. The only downfall is that instead of portraying the story in my mind I use the movies as my visual aid. I have not been able to let the books down ever since I purchased them. I love the story so much. Besides, the characters seem so much more real within the books, they seem to portray their feelings a lot better rather than the movies, E.G I cried when Cedric Diggory died in the book and not when he dies in the movies (I think this also plays part in the fact that i get to know Cedric a lot more in the books rather than in the movies). I also think that if I would have bought the books separately I would have spent more money.
 I thought this book was great from the start, catching your attention right away, a great continuation of the sixth book, "The Half Blood Prince"I thought it was the best book with the great ending. The deaths of some characters were perfect to leave you sad but motivated to read how the villians loose in end. To find out who was the Half Blood Prince and to see Harry finally live a life in peace with his friends. I can't wait to see how the movie will come out.
 As soon as I saw the cheap cardboard box that these wonderful books had been packaged in, I knew to check Amazon to see if others were as disappointed as I am.  I love the Harry Potter books.  I already have all seven books in hardback and bought this set because of the supposed "collector's" box that could be a wonderful way to store the books.  I wasn't expecting wood for the price I bought it for, but the trunk could have made of another material that would be more sturdy and stand up to some amount of time, wear, and tear.  Now I have two sets of hardbound books, and can't decide whether to just throw the trunk away, the reason I made this purchase, or just be bummed every time I see it sitting there.  The company that made this "collector's" set should be ashamed of themselves for putting such wonderful books in such a crappy box.
 I don't know what else can be said about Harry Potter. It was a fantastic read and I'm very happy with how the series ended. I'm amazed by J.K. Rowling and her ability to tie everything from all seven books together in some form or another to create such a wonderful series. I cannot wait to read these books with my children and pass the series on!
 If you haven't read the first six Harry Potter books, you might find this seventh one a little hard to follow initially.  Eventually, the meaning of strange words becomes clear in context.  This book would have benefited from a preface, or at least a glossary to benefit new readers and refresh the memory of old fans.  But it is nonetheless facinating, exciting, and totally lovable.
 The box is nice and pretty and the books come in perfect order
 This review is about the physical properties of the book only. If you're looking to complete your set that contain book jackets, like I was, then this isn't it. It's a shiny cover.
 I wanted something to keep my kids busy on the long ride to my sister's house.  I got the first Harry Potter and was hooked and had to buy all seven.  We have listened to them once through and are starting over again.  Anytime we get in the car I hear "Harry Potter mom" and I don't have to listen to them fight.  It is so much better then letting them watch movies on trips, they have to use their imaginations and I finally got my oldest son to admit the books are so much better than the movies.  Even though the movies were great.  My kids were 7 and 9 to start and this kept them busy for a six hour trip; five minutes trips to the grocery store; ride home from the babysitters; etc.  Not to mention my dad who never even wants to watch the movies because it is kids stuff is so totally hooked.  I will be giving my extra book one and two to my nieces for Christmas.
 Finally! I got my Harry Potter paperback box set. ^_^ I was waiting eagerly for this!<br/>Okay, first of all I think I must say what's most important. It's that; it is really good to buy this book set from Amazon.com as they sell it for a satisfying price and also they are reliable. The real price of the set is 86.23 USD but they still sell it for 50.85 USD here, which is really cheap. With shipping charges and all, I had to pay 68.83 USD but still it didn't reach the real price of the set. So I highly recommend you to buy this Harry Potter Paperback Box Set from Amazon.com because their price is satisfying and also reliable. I have seen this same Paperback Box Set in some other online shopping sites as well and what's so frustrating is the price. I think buying from here would be the best. :)<br/>Okay, So, about the box set, it is all new and was well packed. I love the stunning covers of book 5 and 6. They're all blue and green and look so beautiful. ^_^ There are no tears, folds or damages in any of the books. Only in the final one, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there was a little damage in a corner, which is not so much obvious; I think it was something with handling. The covers of Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire are not so much dazzling as in the pictures, but still look good. The thing is it's like the cover has faded color. But it doesn't look old or anything, just not dazzling. (No Bright print I mean)<br/>The only big disappointment is that I expected the pages to be in good condition. I mean I expected that they would be printed in high quality papers. But they aren't. Wish they were high quality white papers. These papers are easily crumpled and not white; kinda like ash color. :( and what I love is the high quality paper print. :(<br/>I can't wait till reading the books, I expect to start reading 'em right away.<br/>So, Good Luck with Buying! :)
 JK Rowling creates an antagonist who appears to have been influenced by a certain 19th century philosopher. Perhaps he read them during Muggle Studies while a student at Hogwarts. You can catch certain pithy statements scattered throughout the seven books from Quirrell's recitation of what Voldemort taught him in Sorcerer's Stone to the Voldemort's own declamations during the climactic duel:<br/>"DUMBLEDORE IS DEAD!"<br/> Dumbledore was] "too weak to dare."<br/><br/>In contrast, Rowling's protagonist and his mentor believe the most powerful thing on earth is love--self-sacrificing love. This theme starts with Lily Potter, continues through the actions of many characters, extends through Dumbledore's death and culminates in Harry's willingness to sacrifice himself.<br/><br/>All over the world, Rowling offers her readers a choice between Power and Love, Horcruxes or Hallows. Yes, Rowling debunks racial prejudice and other hatreds, but she is really interested in contrasting self-seeking power and self-sacrificing love.<br/><br/>This philosophical duel gets explained in a chapter entitled, "King's Cross." Of all the places Rowling could have chosen to set her denouement, it just happens to be at a railway station with an evocative name.<br/><br/>"Of course it's happening inside your head, but why should that not be real?"
 I mean, it’s Harry Potter
 Beautiful!
 Even though some plot details leaked beforehand (and some erroneously), there is no question that once readers pick up this book, we enter Rowling's world and forget about the spoilers. As one who had only read two of the previous six, I still had no problem following the intricate plot details. Yes, there is death and violence involving several characters--but that is also true in Shakespeare and Greek tragedy, which we certainly teach in our schools. During this time of war and uncertainty, whether on foreign soil or in our streets and schools, it is not inappropriate to address the issues of death and loss with people of any age. The important messages involve sacrifice, loyalty, honesty, forgiveness and redemption--and what themes could be more positive? On an entertainment level, the climactic battle at Hogwarts is epic (the future film will have a lot to live up to!) and I don't agree with those who are unhappy with the epilogue, feeling that it is "tacked on". The final sentence of the last chapter and the final sentence of the epilogue are just perfect
 Perfect!!!!
 The way my package came wrapped in a large box, with 2 folded cardboard supports, I would have expected a special, quality trunk (even if made of cardboard).  The online picture is deceiving, the trunk really looked colorful and attractive; but I am sad to say, it is neither attractive or colorful.  The publisher should have just mailed the books directly in the "trunk" (which is nothing more than a glorified cardboard shipping box) and saved the planet from more overpackaging!!!!!  The books, of course, are fabulous!  I also hope the publisher will send out a replacement trunk worthy of such an important set of books.
 Wonderful books for kids and adults !!
 I read a chunk of reviews and I'd have to agree that if you care about the box, keep looking. I, however, was looking to get the full set of books at a reasonable price. I'll keep the books in the box since it's easier, but I don't really care about the appearance of the box. I care about having the collection of books. The box isn't fancy, but it's fairly sturdy and will do fine to hold the books. I'm glad I was able to get a full set of books at a decent price.
 Came with a box for them
 For my grandson birthday
 I liked it
 I've read all the Harry Potter books numerous times, but never bought them because I was holding out for a set like this one . . . or rather, what this one was advertised to be! I wasn't expecting something massive and heavy-duty, but I was expecting real wood and maybe a little bit of fabric on the inside. The box is just cardboard and while it looks okay now, I can only imagine what it's going to look like in a couple of months after I open and close it to take a book out or put a book back in!<br/><br/>The books, naturally, are fantastic both physically and literarily, but the box definitely brings down the rating. I'm disappointed about the box because if I had known it was going to be cardboard, I would have held out for a leather bound set, but, knowing me, I'll probably just keep this set and "beef up" the box! After all, my mom taught me plenty of "arts and crafts!"
 I purchased each of the Harry Potter books separately when they were released.  I have purchased these as a keepsake for my daughter as a collectible item.  An attractive box encases this great series of books.  Anxiously awaiting books 5,6 and 7.
 While I was very excited to get the whole set of books in hardback, my expectation was that the case would be sturdy enough to actually store and keep the books in.  Boy, what a disappointment!!  After receiving the books, I went back and looked at the picture of the product.  In the picture, you cannot even tell it is cardboard.  You sure can tell on mine!  Obviously folded pieced of cardboard that DO NOT look like the picture.  Since the birth of my daughter last year, I have ordered A LOT of items from Amazon, mostly for her.  And have only once before been disappointed.  But that purchase was $30 - and they refunded it.  This is quite another matter when I have paid over $100 for an item that was not portrayed accurately either by picture or written description.  This has taught me that reading the reviews is VERY important on EVERY item you buy.  Shame on you Amazon!
 The set contains all 7 of the books in hardcover editions. The books are set in a cardboard case with an addition cardboard insert that holds around 10 stickers of the various places and houses in the books to stick on the box or elsewhere. The set is wrapped in plastic wrap and placed within the cardboard chest, which looks nice but is of rather cheap quality; the lining in the lid pops out when opened, the hinge rips apart very easily, and the "lock" is a simple plastic latch. However, at $117 online, it's a very good price, and if you refrained from buying the books until they were all released, as I did, it's even better than buying all the books seperately, which would go to $120-140 total. So if you haven't yet bought any of the books, or you have more than half that need to be replaced, this is a great buy. But if you already have most or all of the books, or are thinking of getting this for the box, then you should just look for what you need elsewhere. And I'll say again: the box is not worth it.
 In anticipation of the book I reread the first six books - as did a lot of people, I imagine - and it was really great to see the development of the characters, leading up to this finale.  The book did ramble around a bit - there were parts where I was just SLIGHTLY bored - but it was worth getting through that to get to the ending, and have the mysteries answered.  Played around with my emotions, and left me feeling full and satisfied (but emotionally drained after 22 hours of reading).  Will be read many many times!
 Great condition and amazing books! 😍
 nice
 The price and a fun read.
 GREAT!
 My son loves his new set of books!! They came in great condition!!
 Beautiful books with a great price.
 This is a magnificent volume! This is my third time reading Chamber of Secrets but I can't resist with all the beautiful illustrations and neither will you. This is a large heavy book so younger readers might be more comfortable at a table with a sturdy book holder. It appears to be well binded and a good solid book but if picked up or carried by a cover it could tear the binding. Avid Harry fan or first timer will be delighted to have this. I also placed a clear plastic library type dust jacket cover on it to ensure the life of the great cover illustration as the book without a dust jacket is a plain red cloth. Can't wait for the rest of the stories to be released like this.
 I am rereading them. So enjoyable
 I was so excited to get the book, and yet fearful that every character I loved was at risk with the rumors circulating.  I feel that Rowling did an excellent job in wrapping up the series in a sensitive, yet suspenseful way that stayed true to her themes.  Yes, there are always losses in the battle between good and evil, but good should and does prevail.
 What an enjoyable ending to 4000 pages of fun with Harry, Hermione and Ron.  While the story lagged a bit in the middle, the ending more than made up for any lull.  I would have loved to see a more detailed epilogue, but any ending is better than nothing!  Thank you Ms. Rowling for 8 years of magic!
 There was no doubt in my mind that this book would be amazing from beginning to end. Needless to say I was not wrong in the least. I love how the book came shipped in a muggles do not open before package and was full of great surprises. As most Harry Potter fans I could not keep my nose out of this delightful book. Who wants to leave the house? J. K. Rowling is an amazing author who dreamed something up and turned it into something that many will remember for years.<br/><br/>I guarantee you will love this book almost as much as you love your 2007 Ferrari :)
 Okay did  not write  a review  so skip this now cause I don't want to do a review so there
 I know the title is a little controversial.  Yet, I noticed on Amazon that the other sets without the trunk ranged from $90 (used) to $400.  I just received this trunk today and really like it.  Yes, it is cardboard but I love the luggage look and the inclusion of the stickers.<br/><br/>Let me preface my review with my acceptance of the trunk may come from my excitement from starting to read the books.  I can hear the gasps!!! I know, I know.  I have watched every single movie within the first week in theater including movie 6 but have not read the books.<br/><br/>For the purchaser, just know the package may not be great but what's in it is!!!  I am thinking of just going to an art store and creating a trunk to place my books (putting artistic skills to work).  Then it will really be a collector's item.  I hope you enjoyed the review.
 Takes quite a while to receive as this item is shipped from the UK, but our eleven year old grand daughter is already an avid reader and Harry Potter fan.  Packaged well for shipping and books are of high quality.  A wonderful purchase, so we are quite pleased.  I would highly recommend this vendor, we dealt with them on the shipping time and they were extremely helpful.
 It would of been so easy for J.K. Rowlings to tie this series end up into a pretty little package. But, she didn't.  She took the hard way, never fearing killing off important side characters to make this book above and beyond the others.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was my first experience with SCI/FI fantasy and with a marketed childerens series.  I was hooked from the first.  What has always intreged me was that she never shied away from making the transition into a more teen/adult novel.  She has let Harry grow up with the kids who started the series at the same age as he.<br/>I have read many series type novels and most authors let a stinker or two into the mix.  J.k. Rowling has led her readers from point A to point B with extreme talent.  Not a stinker in the bunch.<br/>There is so much in this book that satisfys the reader.  All questions and half assumtions are answered with total respect for the reader. I will be sorry to see Harry go but I will let him go knowing full well were he has gone and some of what his future holds.
 They were exactly what we expected.
 Just what I expected.
 Condition came in as promised, good purchase.
 I ADORE this series, so many of the issues throughout the book can be compared to issues we face on a daily basis (both on a personal and international level).  The way Rowling has approached her writing is amazing and the development of her characters is something that makes you relate, adore, pity, and hate them.  Highly recommend to any and all ages, it's a fantastic read that I re-read over and over again.
 I am a PANK - professional aunt no kids. I devoured the Harry Potter series and could not wait until my nephew, an avid reader, was old enough to get him the entire set. He and I both were reading the Percy Jackson series and based on our conversations, I knew he was ready. He is thoroughly enjoying them, and it is a story he will enjoy reading again for years to come. Purchasing the set is worth the expense when you know it will stand the test of time and his younger brother by 4 years will be able to enjoy as well (thankfully already likes to read too).
 This set was nicer than I expected. The books are of great quality and came in great condition.
 I have just finished reading the 7th book and I think is the one I liked best. I don't give it 5 stars because I was kind of lost most of the book. I didn't know how it was to end at all and that is a good thing, but for some time i thought the story was wandering through the pages, telling and describing things that were no necessary. I think the book it's alittle oversized because of that. But it's a great book that you can't stop reading till it's done. A really good ending.
 Simply beautiful.
 Good
 I loved it, exactly what I wanted!
 Loved it very much. The books are good quality and I loved the stickers and the “box” that came with it!
 If your ordering this in hopes of having a good case to hold all your books, look some place else. I was disappointed with the quality of the chest. I was afraid when picking it up by the string handles that it might rip right through the cardboard.<br/><br/>However, if your buying this for the books only it's a great deal. I'm very happy with the books and the price that I paid for all hardcover. I've been searching for awhile now checking bookstores and whatnot for the hardcover versions and found it hard to find anyone carrying them any longer. Seems everyone went to the paperback set once it came out. So overall I'm happy with my purchase.
 I was very sad to hear that this was going to be the last book in the series.  Like so many others, I have gotten caught up in the world of Harry Potter and his friends.  However, I was very pleased to get my copy yesterday.  It's a daunting book - must weigh a good three pounds!  However, it caught my interest from the first page.<br/><br/>The story takes up, as with her other books, a couple months after the last one.  Lord Valdemor and the Death-Eaters are gaining more power and have infiltrated the Ministry of Magic.  The enchantment on the house at Privet Drive is going to disappear the day Harry turns 17 and the Order of the Pheonix is about to move him.  This starts the point at which Harry is on the run.<br/><br/>In additional, before he died, Dumbledore gave Harry a task to complete with Ron &amp; Hermone, but no one else is to know about it.  The nust complete it or Lord Vademore will win.  As the book progresses, the situation worsens.  Lord Vademore appears to be winning.  He's got the Ministry and Hogwarts under his control. The war has started and the Order of the Pheonix appears to be losing.<br/><br/>The story flows very well and most of the previous characters get at least a cameo appearance.  At the end of the book, all the different plots from the different books are tied together.  There are no loose ends.<br/><br/>This is a great story and I think in general the Harry Potter books have been very good for children.  Any book that can capture a child's imagination enough to keep the reading is wonderful.  However, this is more violent than the previous tales (it's about a war after all) and parts of it may be distressing for the younger children.  I recommend this book and the series in general to any adult and older children.
 My review is based on reading volumes 1, 2 and half of three (all in two and a half weeks). I have trouble putting J.K. Rowling's excellent work down. She tells a story wonderfully and paints amazing word pictures. I plan to finish the series as quickly as time allows. And, by then, I'll be wishing she had written an eighth book.
 Very fast shiping and good quality
 Page turner!
 Really happy w/ this box set. A little cumbersome getting the books out if they are all stuffed inside already, but worth the price. My point of purchase came from deciding between digital or this. &amp; it's nostalgic to tote around a physical novel, like when I was a kid.<br/><br/>Inexpensive compared to buying them separate, &amp; you know the condition is great when new. Perfect for yourself or as a gift to a reader being introduced to HP for the first time.
 I found this book to be the best Harry Potter book yet.  However, go through and read the others first so that you have a strong basis of the story lines in the previous books.  The book wraps up the Harry Potter story nicely and you won't be disappointed.  I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 13 because of the violence that occurs.
 Great
 I was so excited to receive this boxed set. My son is at an age where we can start to enjoy these together. I intentionally purchased the new set to have the box included. Many of the cheaper versions did not include the box. Everything looked great until I noticed one of the handles was broken. Obviously the books are quite heavy, but it seems the yarn handle wasn't fastened in. The end of the handle just fell right out the side. :(<br/><br/>The box is cardboard, and it is clearly not made for carrying around. We wanted it for display purposes. Now its sad the box is damaged.<br/><br/>I suppose I could exchange, but my son was so excited about reading these books. It would be a shame to have to box them up while he is in the middle of reading them.
 I bought the regular hardcover version of Deathly Hallows on the night when it first came out in July 2007. The book itself is possibly the most entertaining piece of literature you could ever encounter and is a stisfying ending to a remarkable series. I just purchased the deluxe edition a couple of weeks ago though. I was stunned to see Amazon selling it for under 9 dollars so I had to take the rare opportunity to get it at that price. Now I see Amazon has increased the price by over 30 dollars. With that in mind I wouldn't buy this book if you already have the standard edition of Deathly Hallows. Aside from the beautiful cover there is very little difference between the two. There is also a color illustration of Lucius Malfoy's peacock on high quality paper but other than that the only differences are the slipcase and full page illustrations of the chapter pictures. To me this doesn't justify the huge price difference between the two editions, but if you are a big fan and you simply want it for your collection I would reccomend trying to get it for a lower price. I think Amazon periodically brings the price way down.
 Okay, I have seen the first few movies, but hadn't read the books.  So, I ordered the package of the first 6 books in paperback that Amazon was offering and thought it was a good time to pre-order Book 7.  All of the items were coming supersaver shipping.  Well, the package of the first 6 books is on backorder and is not scheduled to arrive until late August!  You can imagine my surprise when I went out to the mailbox on Saturday (July 21) and there was Book 7.  What to do?!?!  I'm sorry, I probaby should have hidden it away for that time in the distant future when I would finish the first 6 books. But, I figured, what's the harm in reading a few pages....and once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down!  It was like I was under a spell or something....  Okay, so I didn't have all the context the first 6 books would provide, but I did have some gist from the movies.  Besides, a really good book will stand on it's own.  This one pretty much does.....though there are a few things that left me feeling disappointed.  The way the last Horcruxe was destroyed.  Of course, I had no idea about any magical powers for the sorting hat, but if Harry had pulled it out once, then why wouldn't he remeber that he could get it out again???  All that time looking for the sword and all he needed to do was sneak back in Hogwarts and get the sorting hat?  I think it's messy.  Also, letting a minor character (in this book) do the deed....another quibble.....Harry was a little too nice.  Didn't want to hurt anyone or anything.....just protected himself or stun people that were trying to kill him and his friends. Harry Potter as Ghandi or a wizard version of a savior.  He got very angry at times....but where did his creed of non-violence come from?  Maybe the other books explain, but it didn't make sense on it's own.<br/><br/>I would have preferred an ending where Harry used the sword to kill the snake......letting others do the dirty work left me feeling unsatisfied.  He saw what the snake did to Snape. He knew it had to die.  It was a wimp-out on the part of Rowling.  It's like she couldn't let go of her baby.....didn't want him to really grow up.  Didn't want him to be a "man".  It's great if you can trick evil into destroying itself, but when push comes to shove, sometimes you have to do the deed.<br/><br/>And the drama at the end made no real sense....after failing to kill Harry when he was just standing there in the forest, resigned to his fate, how could Valdemort think he could stand against Harry when Harry was up and challenging him, wand at the ready?  Why would he believe that something that had not worked before would work now?  That is the definition of insanity, but Voldemort wasn't shown to be that insane thoughout the book.  My ending would have had Harry save Neville, grab the sorting hat, get the sword, kill the snake as it attacked while Voldemort was stunned to see Harry still alive, and then an enraged Voldemort could be expected to attack Harry despite the fact that he couldn't kill him.  Or maybe, Voldemort would kill himself. Rowling, however, wanted to give Voldemort one last chance for what.....redemption???  The problem with that is simply this.......why?  Why would Harry do that?  Voldemort showed no remorse throughout the book....if he had, Harry would have known.  Why give him one last chance?  It makes no sense.
 The final book in the Harry Potter series yet the most important of all.  This book brings closure to fans' questions:<br/><br/>What happens to Harry relationship with Ron, Hermoine, and Ginny?<br/>Who dies?<br/>Does Percy Weasley make peace with his entire family?<br/>Did Harry defeat Voldemort once and for all?<br/><br/>For every hard core Harry Potter fan, this book is a must-have in their collection.
 Nice condition and priceless addition to any children's library.
 Teast nice
 The magic of this series has surely lessened--not because it became darker, but because it became darker in a mechanical and predictable way. No surprises, no real twists, and worst, no real character development.  I'm sure many readers never want the book to end, but sheer overblown heft (especially while Harry, Ron and Hermione are wandering aimlessly over much of Britain) stalls the story without real reason.  Ms. Rowling promised death, and death comes to many, but not convincingly.  (To me, only the death of one very small but valiant creature seemed to carry emotional impact.)  The epilogue is trite, though perhaps it offers the hope of further stories, if Ms. Rowling should ever be so inclined.<br/><br/>I still feel affection and admiration for the series as a whole. Even where Ms. Rowling might have been judged derivative, her refashioning of old ideas with her own brightly original ones in the earlier novels is a kind of genius.  To have invented such a complete world and to have shared it so generously is no small achievement, but I wish the last of these wonderful books had been more satisfying, and more worthy of its predecessors.
 I started reading the first book, that I borrow from a cousin, as a way of improve my english, the problem was that I couldn't get enough of this characters, the author make an excellent work describing and explaining a new world to the readers.This box set it's the best way to own the series, you have the first 6 books in one place so that way you don't have every book in a different part of your house.
 Great collection!
 While it was sad to reach the end of this multi-year saga, J.K. Rowling did not disappoint. While the movies were entertaining, I will always cherish the books!
 With all the speculation as to whether or not Harry would be killed, it was relieving to find that good won over evil.  For all of the people who denounce the Harry Potter books because of the aspect of witchcraft, they only need to read almost every fairy tale to find witches.  The lessons taught regarding friendship could not be better.
 The recipient loved it!!! Great book!!!
 Quick shipping and nicely bundled.
 My daughter loves her book set!
 This book was an enjoyable experience to read. I was rather impressed at how well written the details were given of characters and places as well as the tie in of events that occurred not only in this book though in the previous books leading to this one. I am not a big reader and have not read the other books and may just go back and do so. With this book I had known everything that was going to happen in the book before it was released, due to online leaks. However I knew it would not keep me from enjoying the book, which I enjoyed far greater because even though I knew what would happen, how it happened was truly the adventure and surprising it was. Very well done.
 Gorgeous!!!!
 I was late to get on to the Harry Potter bandwagon, but all the hype around the seventh book's and fifth movie's releases got to me.  I figured I had nothing to lose by ordering all six books for this extremely low price.  I was anything but disappointed:  I couldn't put the books down and had read them all in just over two weeks.  And for the price, you just can't beat it.
 Ready to read!
 These books are obviously great, but the reader for this audio book is AMAZING. He does all of the voices of the characters and is enthralling. I like that all of the CDs are in individual folders, it makes it easier to locate and change the discs!
 Great stuff. I love how easy and enjoyable of a read Harry Potter is. I can easily recommend this series to any reader of all ages.
 Jim Dale is a Rock Star! It's absolutely incredible how he can switch so quickly to do a unique voice with emotion for every single character. Even if you've read the book, this audiobook is a value-added experience. I've done both and noticed that the book has grammatical problems and inconsistencies. Those minor issues go unnoticed in the audiobook since the narrator plows right on through with seat-gripping drama instead of letting your brain get all hung up on the sentence structure by re-reading passages.
 Great!!
 It was exactly like I thought it would be! Would recommend!
 I'm not much of a fan of fantasy as such. However these are so well written and so well received by kids that I think anyone who likes science fiction should read them. I still think Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is still far better for young readers, but these are very good and deserve to be as popular as they are.
 Bought these as a Christmas present for my husband. He loved them
 Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury<br/>I was all set to read this book for a review in time for the Aug-Sept VGP. I especially ordered it to be delivered right to our house on the day it was released. And it came right on time. The trouble was that we had two ten-year-old boys visiting us for four days. I read them the first two chapters,  and I was looking forward to reading the rest of the book. Here's the glitch though. One of the kids, the one who had already read the first six Potter books snagged my copy and wouldn't give it back! He read 200 pages that day and I realized I wasn't going to get to read it unless we bought him his own copy. So we did and he'd nearly reached the end of the 759 page book 2 1/2 days later when he left for home. I finished my copy the next day. In a nut shell, it was a great read.
 My daughter loves them
 Was let down
 Alright, if it were because of J. K. Rowling's epic tale I would have given it 5 stars. I give it 3 because the books aren't quite as nice as I expected. Yes, I knew they would be a bit worn off and some dust jackets were missing. I didn't know they would be stained inside though. The Chamber of Secrets' pages are nearly falling apart and there's a whole rainbow of crayolas on the edges of the pages. The book in the best state was The Philosopher's Stone. That one is pretty much like new, I was actually surprised. The Goblet of Fire seems to be rather fine too, but the dust jacket is so damaged I decided to remove it altogether. Pages in The Deathly Hallows are wrinkled, which actually bothered me. The rest seem fine. Not excellent, just fine. At least all of them are perfectly readable and they don't seem to be missing any pages (only the first 3 were read at the time of writing this review).
 If you read the other six books, you will read this one.  The author ties all of it together with a good ending (only one major fatal casualty).  Without spoiling the ending, let me say she keeps true to the original story without selling out.  (I know, that told you nothing, but then you need to read the book to find out what happened; or you can wait and see the two movies--but it is better to read the book first, then see the movies).
 The trunk that the books come in is just cardboard with print or stickers over it. It looks decent, not as good up close. The trunk isn't very sturdy. I actually had to return the first one I bought and have another one sent because the trunk arrived severely damaged.<br/><br/>It's fine. It's a decent display case for the books that I gave as a gift. After receiving it I would say it's definitely not worth the money, but it looks decent and the recipient of the gift enjoyed it, but they asked for this kind of thing in general.
 Truly magical and came 3 weeks earlier! Was so happy to get it. And Dobby is adorable :)
 The seller was amazing! Books in great quality.
 Gorgeous book! Love the illustrations!
 This review is applicable to the entire 7 book series.  The entire series was a really great read and I was through the entire series in about 3 weeks (which may not be fast for some, but it is for me).  I found myself staying up late into the night to read.<br/><br/>These books are as good for adults as they are for the young teenage audience they are marketed to.  I am a 27 year old Doctor.  Definitely should be a must read if you like anything in the fantasy genre.
 The final chapter of Harry Potter met all my expectations. I sat down the day I got the hardcover and read it over the weekend. We then purchased the Audio version. Jim Dale does an excellent presentation and is enjoyable listening. I am sad that this is the last of Harry Potter and anticipate new ventures coming from Ms Rowland. I highly recommend the audio version as well as the hardcover edition. As adults we have enjoyed the amazing imagination of Ms Rowland and compare her storytelling abilities to JR Tolkien. I do not believe the Harry Potter books are suitable for young children however, and recommend that they are far more appropriate for 13 year olds and above. The tend to be dark and far too intense and violent for the very young.
 Bought this as a gift.  Great condition
 came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read
 I was never interested in the Harry Potter books.  I retired from the teaching profession two and a half years ago and was glad I did not have to be in a classroom when this craze hit.<br/>Well, times have changed!!  I saw the movie on Thanksgiving Eve and ordered the books the next day.  I have read year two (2 days!) and am now in the middle of year three.  I also signed up for year five as soon as it is available.  Boy am I hooked!!!  They are fabulous!!<br/>P.S. I am a senior citizen.
 As soon as I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  The action was gripping, the characters were charming, and I was anxious to see how it all ended.  When I got there, I wasn't disappointed!!  I think the way Rowling chose to end her monumental series was just right.  If you're a Harry Potter fan, you HAVE to read this book. No ifs ands or buts...
 I was disappointed that this cool-looking trunk is actually cardboard with a flimsy plastic latch. For over one hundred dollars, you'd expect at least balsa wood or some other cheap wood, but not cardboard! I threw my "trunk" away. The books inside are the exact hardbacks you find on the shelves, but buying them this way saves you a lot of money!
 Beautiful selection of Harry Potter books if that is what you like.  I think I read these wrong - one after the other.  I should have let them simmer a little between readings.  I kept getting about 2/3rds the way through the books, then I would just get so annoyed at how whinny the little Potter boy was!  Always complaining about everything!  But, I do recommend slogging your way through these because the last one absolutely makes the entire series.  I can't wait until my daughter is old enough so that I can read these to her.
 One of book has a misprinted
 Ok. I read this book in one sitting. I have read all of the Harry Potter books first to myself and then to my 2 kids. I was supposed to not read this by myself, I was supposed to wait and read it to my kids little by little at bedtime, but I couldn't help myself. I had to read it, and actually, I read it twice to myself, and we are now 3/4 of the way through my reading it aloud to my kids.<br/><br/>If you have not read any of the Harry Potter books, you should first go back and get book 1 and read all of the books in the series before you read this one, and you should buy every single book in the series because you will want to go back and read them again.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling is an amazing storyteller and she ended the series in an excellent way. I will not give it away, so you will have to read it.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed. Go out and buy it now.
 Love the price
 The deal I got on these books was amazing and I am so excited to finally have all the books of the series! Thank you
 Book 2 is really a replay of book 1 and works to reinforce the basic structure of the series.  The plot, including the finale, is actually better designed than in book 1, but there isn't as much emotion behind it.  The fact that Harry is a wizard isn't new anymore.  We spend the book getting used to life inside Hogwarts alongside Harry.  It is a fun journey, but not quite as exciting as the initial discovery.
 Jim Dale is a wonderful performer for the HP series. I have all of the audio books. Or rather, I had them all before I loaned them out and never got them back-- that's how good these are. He has voices for each character and he clearly puts thought behind his work. When someone is supposed to be eating/yawning while talking he mimics it. This is well worth buying and listening to. McGonagall alone is worth the price. (Get the early books and listen to her scolding "Jordon") You really picture what is going on.
 gift for son
 I love it! It’s super nice!
 Very happy with my purchase
 Wonderful artwork to go along with a classic story.
 As expected, this Harry Potter was the best yet.  It is sad to think the series is over, but this book ties up all the loose ends and makes you happy that you were part of such a wonderful saga.  JK Rowling hits a home run with this final chapter. I only hope that she can find a new character to entice us with in the coming years.
 Nicely well packaged...
 These illustrations are beyond amazing. Love it.
 These stories are for every lover of books and those who don't love to read also. I was able to get my son interested in reading with this series.  J.K rowling has done something great for humanity by creating such entertaing stories for the masses.
 Gilderoy Lockheart is the character you love to hate! He is so full of himself, that I'm surprised he can even get out of bed.<br/>He spends every waking moment telling everyone how good he is.<br/>Of course, Harry, Ron and Hermione have to bail him out in the end, but hey, no one's perfect!
 I enjoy each and every one of the Harry Potter books buy JK Rowling.  I find her to be a very gifted writer.  I wish that the movies were on the same story lines.  So many things are deleted, so reading the books first and then seeing the movies help to pull the plots together.  She explains things in her books that are not mentioned in the films.  I recommend the book to anyone 12 and older.  Some of the things in these books along with some of the words can be a little difficult for younger children. Events and characters can be a tad scary.
 J.K. Rowling did it again!  This has to be my favorite book in the series.  I think she wrapped up her story lines well and there was a great amount of excitement and suspense.  I was very upset to have to put the book down for anything.  I feel that the drama and the scale of the different battles in the book lived up to my hopes for a grand finale. The characters seem to be friends that I will be sad not to read more about!  It doesn't seem possible for the movie to even come close to living up to the book!
 The book was great, but in comparison to Book 4 (the best one in the series, I think), it is very sloppy. There were very few links to the previous books and the ending was wrapped up too quickly. However, it certainly satisfies the cravings I've had for knowing how it all ends. It's an amazing book, but if you compare it to Rowling's potential, it seems weak.
 From the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was hooked on the series. J.K. Rowling might not be the best at technical writing ability (she tends to use the same descriptions too much, like "bellows"), but she is one of the best storytellers ever. Stong characters that you care about, vivid scenes, enchanting creatures, life lessons, and great action are all part of her books. And Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows does not disappoint. The book is immediately dark, and be prepared for a death in the first chapter. That is not the only death in the first 100 pages. But the darkness is not stifling: the scene where Harry leaves Privet Drive for the last time is fun, escapist fantasy. Fred and George's sense of humor still is there. A major argument between Hermione and Ron also made me smile. The book is a little slow when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are camping throughout the country looking for the Horcruxes, but Rowling makes it clear through numerous close calls with Death Eaters that something could be right around the corner. The book ties up the loose ends nicely, and the back story of Dumbledore was unexpected. Don't worry - he is still a good guy. But he has flaws like good people in real life do. Like in Book 1, love is a major part of the book - you will see it even with some bad characters at the end. The trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) survive with the help of that love/chivalry theme, but be prepared to pay for that happening with multiple well-known Order Members (a female member who dies is one of my favorite characters - was quite sad,) and a member of the Weasley family dying. I never thought the death of the tragic figure Snape would be so heartbreaking. The final battle between Harry and Voldemort is short, and you can kind of see Voldemort's manner of death coming - the short duel between Harry and Voldemort makes sense, though. Also, the massive battle of Hogwarts makes up for the quick battle between Harry and Voldemort. The battle of Hogwarts has it all - giants, huge spiders, house elves, and centaurs included! Even Luna, my favorite character, is there helping Harry and company. I'm glad Rowling didn't relegate her to the sidelines. In fact, most all the well-known characters, including teachers, participate in the Hogwarts battle. The epilogue was too short IMO. The author should not have to give details later about the professions of Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron. But I liked one thing: the circle continues with the children of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione going to Hogwarts. And based on the series, it's neat to think of the adventures the children might have.
 If you don't know about this by now. Buy the books and read them. The Harry Potter series is a great series to get young children into reading.
 What an adventure! The Harry Potter series exceeded all of my expectations! I can’t wait to watch the last two movies!
 Received in great condition and was delivered on time. No damage. My son was so excited!
 Great deal!
 As usual Jim Dale takes you away with his masterful reading of this final Harry Potter book. The story as you likely know is superb but what you are purchasing is a winning performance by the narrator. You cant get a better solo reading of this story.  The packaging is clever with interesting illustrations. If you have already read the book this CD set will increase your enjoyment of the story.  If this is your first time with the Deathly Hallows you are in for a thrill.  Highly recommended.
 The product came in the condition advertised.
 JK Rowling became very wealthy very quickly and you can tell that she didn't think this book through. It's a little interesting but not as exciting as her other books. She attempted to be clever having the main characters not attend Hogwarts but at the end it's very obvious this story line was not planned well and she must've needed to prematurely cut story lines short in order to meet Scholastic's deadlines. There is no solid explanation of why Harry survives. Generally, she's good at making solid explanations. She's still rich though so she might write something good again eventually.
 I bought these books for my son as a reward for good grades on his report card.  He was delighted to receive them, and now everyone in the family but my youngest (who should be starting to be interested in this type of book soon) has read them.  My oldest reads them over and over in no particular order, just because she likes them so much, and my son picks them up and reads snatches from this book or that one often.
 It’s Harry Potter...what more do I say?
 I loved the whole series.
 My grand daughter love it
 I am a TOTAL Harry Potter fan, and have already read all of the books awhile ago. When I saw the final movie I was super bummed to think that the saga was finally over... so I wanted to be able to read the book again but thought it would be cool do the book on CD. I have been listening for awhile now and absolutely love these CD's!!! I listen to them all the time, on my i-pod, on my lap top and in my car!!! I love being able to hear the book being read by Jim Dale too, he does the best impressions and hearing the parts read aloud and in there own voices makes this such an awesome interactive experience!!! I cannot get enough! I will for sure be getting the whole lot of CD's to re-read all the books from beginning to end to re-live the whole Harry Potter world all over again.(by the way, these are totally better than reading the books on your own!!!) It is such a blast, cannot say enough good things about them! JIM DALE ROCKS!
 It's Harry Potter's final year.  The story needs no review so I am just commenting on the physical book.  The book arrived brand new and still shrink wrapped, which is an excellent feeling opening a brand new book.  I baby my books and their bindings.  Wife on the other hand likes to use the floor as a book mark.<br/><br/>Book arrived in no time and was in excellent shape.  Great story too, can't wait for the 2nd part of the movie.
 Very cheap paper. I was disapointed to open the books
 I didn't pick up on the Harry Potter book series until ' Order of the Pheonix ' but I was completely hooked after I finished it. Year 5 and 6 are by far my most favorite 2 from the series. JK writes with so much detail and seems to keep past story lines in order so not to askew the current plot in any way. Starting at year 4 and continuing through to 6 are probably the most exciting 3 of the series. The final arrival of the Dark Lord has happened and it is inevitable that Harry and Tom Riddle are getting closer and closer to their final showdown. Book 7 can't come fast enough.<br/><br/>I wanted to get the entire set in hard back and Amazon had the best price out of the major book stores. They showed up in a timely manor and were in great condition.
 A fitting end to an amazing series. Bravo to Rowling for her creativity. We were captivated by the action, the underlying romances, the inevitable death of Voldemort or Harry---. My only criticism is I wish she would have explored Snape's leadership of Hogwarts a bit more. I would have liked to see the actions tie in with the end discovery of Snapes true character. Other than that, truly brilliant. She deserves every penny she's made on this book. Made a lot of Muggles happy.
 Awesome ending to a wonderful series of books. While I have enjoyed seeing this series unfold I actually got into this backwards, movies as each became available for purchase, then reading the books following book 6's release. Like many others, I too will go through withdrawals when the final movie is available. The ride has been fun.
 I know that many people say that they will not let their kids read the Harry Potter books because of the evil witchcraft associated with it. My daughter loves this series and has made her love reading even more. The stories are full of action and friendship. I have told the other parents at our church that as long as your child understands that it is make believe they should be able to enjoy this imaginary story with no fear of compromising their souls, which many have gone as far as saying that exact thing.
 Amazing!!!
 I read some negative reviews on here, mainly about the cardboard chest which the books come in. However this was the best packaging for the books I had seen, and as a lover of packaging, I have to get the nicest ones. The chest is quite sturdy, and with all the books inside, it's quite heavy. However I love the chest, made of cardboard or not, it holds everything in and was made quite well, since cardboard packaging can be a bit of a headache.<br/><br/>It may have been nice to include a gold looking clasp, but the black one is fine, and does the job.<br/><br/>The covers of the books are all amazing, perfectly illustrated. Accompanied by embossed and foil stamped titles. They are the most beautiful covers I've seen of all the editions published. I'm glad I waited to buy them all in one lot, so that all the packaging could be the same.<br/><br/>I won't comment on the stories, because if you're looking to purchase I would assume you've already read them.
 Yes, it's the same harry potter books as before, but my old hardcovers were so worn (read them a million times each!) that they were falling apart and chunks of pages were just stuck into the book! I knew it was time to order a new set, but didn't want to spend a fortune. I waited a bit and was worth it. The new covers are VERY, VERY pretty, and the spines make up the Hogwarts castle, which is great for displaying on a bookshelf. The price, since it has dropped from $100 to about $60, is a lot more reasonable, too.<br/><br/>Overall I would say the beautiful new covers are worth the $60 on their own, but some may disagree.<br/><br/>Yes, the box IS just cardboard, but you'll likely be displaying these books spine-out anyway, so the box really doesn't matter much.
 Like usual.
 The books are amazing.  J.K. Rowling managed to create a magical world that is both appealing to children and adults.  The books follow the heroic life of young Harry Potter from age 11.  As Harry gets older, the books mature with him.  While the first book is very colorful and innocent, books five and six are much darker and emotional, of which love becomes a major theme in the series.<br/><br/>While this set is very tempting to buy, it would be much better to wait until the seventh and last book to come out to buy the seven-book set, which would probably be released in one to two years.  The price is eye-boggling, but some things you can't miss out.  The Harry Potter series is one of them.
 I bought this collection when it was on sale and it was well worth the price. The Kindle version makes it easy to select chapters or books, and if you forget who a character is, you can tap on their name and see a short character summary appear. I was initially worried that it might be a pain to navigate through this collection, but I've been pleased by how uncomplicated my Kindle makes it to find exactly the spot I need.
 I'm not going to sit here and review all of these wonderful books; if you are looking into purchasing this set, you most likely already love Harry Potter. And rightly so, it's one of the best fantasy series out there.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the original paperback covers, but I LOVE this new look. To me it really shows the adventure and friendship that was such a big part of the entire series. My favorite aspect is the picture of Hogsmeade that is formed when all 7 books are place together.<br/><br/>Great stuff, and totally worth purchasing!
 An excellent book. .
 My son loved this book!
 Libros de buena calidad
 LOVE this illustrated edition!
 Awesome Illustrations!
 Delivered on the release date, as promised.  No lines, no fuss, at-my-door service!  The book itself was excellent...fitting ties into previous years, and a suitable ending.
 Although I was saddened to get this book as it was the last in the series, once again JK Rowling pulled me into Harry's magical world and I was devastated to leave it. I actually read the book in one day. I had not planned to do that but I could not put it down. Kids and adults alike will love this last adventure for Harry, Ron and Hermione!
 Great book!! Can't beat Harry Potter!
 Jim Dale who has been narrating the Harry Potter series continues to do a superb job.  He really makes the characters come alive.  His voices are distinct but not distracting.
 My sister fell in love with the design and box. Perfect present for HP fans!
 This was the best of in the series, although I am torn to try and choose my favorite.  Thanks to J.K. Rowling for the literary adventure that I will be sure to pass on to my own kids someday.
 My child loves the stories very much. Reading in Kindle is much convenient.
 When I started reading this series it was just to find out what all the hype was about.  One chapter into it and I was hooked.  This is the best series I have read.  I was more excited for the new releases than my nieces and nephews.<br/>This one was the best as it pulled together all of the books.  The ending is fabulous.  I laughed, I cried, I read fast during some scenes and slow for others.  I am a commuter in NY with an hour train ride - Thank goodness for that as I was able to read.  So many people were reading it - men, women, boys and girls, didn't matter the age as this appeals to all ages.<br/>Bravo, JK Rowling - you did a wonderful job and gave everyone a story to share with generations to come.
 Amazing!
 I love all things Harry Potter and I need them all in my life. For the second book I was worried about how big these were going to get if they continue the entire series but I love them to much not to have them. The pictures are wonderfully done, very imaginative to the story line. I love being able to read it and visualize it and not just in the movie form. If you have a Harry Potter fanatic in your life and they don't already own this, it is a wonderful idea to get it for them, especially right here at Christmas. I love growing my collection of books with ones I know I can pass down one day to my nieces or nephews, or even if I ever have kids one day.
 Having read Deathly Hollows first, and then gone back to read the first 6, I'm in somewhat unique position to judge this series based on every book standing on its own merits, without previous books detracting or benefiting from each other. This is especially true for the last book; while some complain regarding the passing being either too slow or too fast, reading every book as a self-contained book, it is of much better quality than most fantasy books out there. It's clear that Rowlings improved with the writing of each book and while only time will tell how this series ranks among other fantasy series, it's steadily becoming thought of as a classic.
 Love it
 Great read. Not my favorite of the series though. Looking forward to the next book.  Great characters. Tons of fun
 I read a review of the 5th Harry Potter series on audiobook, written by Stephen King. I trust him, bought it and was blown away. I already read the series. But Jim Dale's performance fleshed out the characters, deepened the experience so profoundly, I bought all the other audiobooks of the series. I've listened to them a number of times! J.K. Rowling was inspired, obviously, but taking it to an audio version with such clarity and the highest of standards, made me an even bigger fan of her work. And Jim Dale deserves mention. His hundreds of different characters are brilliant, entertaining, and are what made listening over and over anything but boring! Great for children, adults and the whole family!
 It was with both longing and dismay that I opened up the final book of this magical series.  But now that I've finished it, I don't think Rowling could have done it any better.  I won't post any spoilers (even though I'm sure others have done so) but I will say that I'm so glad the truth behind Severus Snape was finally revealed, and in such a beautiful, heart-wrenching way.  I'm so sorry to see the magic ending, but I'm glad I was along for the ride every step of the way.
 Spiders
 People laugh when I say Harry Potter is the best series I have ever read.  I am an avid book nut, but I swear that it is true.  I understand it seems strange for a grown woman to love a children's series, but I do.  I couldnt wait to finish this series to find out how it ended, but sobbed when it was over because I knew I would never have that experience again. I have turned many people into Potter fans, and not one has regretted my efforts. Read it, read it read it. Young or old, this is a truly touching, deep story.
 It will be for others to dissect this one, to offer their opinions on what Rowling should or should not have done in terms of plot.  I would suggest--gently, as Dumbledore would have done, I think--that we are somewhat arrogant if we presume to tell her how the characters of her own creation should or should not behave.  Throughout the series, Rowling has proven to be consistent--true to the personalities of her characters, never resorting to trite manipulation, always offering her readers a valid rationale for why characters did what they did.  I spent the weekend reading this last book in the series.  My children--who now have their own children--called to ask:  "Well...?"  "Read it," I told them, "You will not be disappointed."
 Incredible. Love the illustrations and quality.
 I was a skeptic at thinking these books could be any good. Then I saw the movie and thought that they couldn't be that bad. But reading the first book.. I became addicted. Since then I have read all 4 books and have read them over at least half a dozen times.<br/>These Books are not to be underestimated.. They are VERY addictive and VERY good.
 These books as well as The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings have spoiled me now and forever. I have yet to find anything to compare and meet my high expectations. All these books are worth reading. Even if you have seen the movies, there are things in the books that they didn't use in the movie. There is something for everyone here. There are just so many characters to relate to, so much amusement and humor, ingenious wonder and imagination. It is quite an experience to read these books. If you haven't, do yourself the favor. Even the longest and most drawn out book(Order of the Phoenix Book 5) is more interesting than other popular fantasy books on the shelf. Just read it! :)
 This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Having followed the series from the beginning, I had high hopes, as well as reservations, about where it would go.  The middle sagged slightly, but when relating to the issues the characters are facing it was understandable.  The end wrapped up nicely, making it easier to say goodbye to our beloved Harry.
 This audiobook, like all in the set, is read beautifully by Jim Dale and is an exceptionally good car book as it can be listened to more than once without losing the excitement of the story. Great value f.or money, Jim Dale does a superb job
 These book are beautiful!  I got them for my husband for Christmas and we have been reading them together.  They are sturdy, well-made hardcovers with good quality jackets.  Of course, as everyone who has read these books knows, J.K.R. is a fabulous story teller with a friendly, clever voice and a perceptive understanding of human character.  Her characters are vivid, her stories are riveting, and her story telling techniques are quite witty and humorous.  I would highly recommend these books to anyone who enjoys books about mysteries, adventure, legends, and mythological creatures.  Harry Potter is "bloody brilliant!"
 When I first started reading Deathly Hallows I did not like how it was going but by the end of the journey; I realized what I had just read was the best book of the entire series which is hard for me to admit.  This book is a must read it will have you second guessing until the very end and wanting more.  All I can say to sum it up is you will not believe how it ends and it will leave you feeling like you should have seen it coming.  I plan to re read it again this time listening to the audiobook version so I can experience it on an even deeper level.  Must read for any true Harry Potter fan.
 I was anxious to get this before anyone spoiled the ending.  I was not disappointed in Rowling's latest and last book of the series.  I think it was her best yet.  It answered many lingering questions and kept me up late until I finished it!
 I've been a fan ever since I was 16 years old and all I can say about the books, is that they are really amazing...and even though the movies are over...I know HP will live in my heart forever!!
 A must read for fans of Harry Potter - duh.  Mostly fast paced...  end of chapter cliffhangers and a well resolved ending.  Harry has to confront fate and make difficult choices - definitely a winner.
 I don't want to put any spoilers into this review. I will simply say that I read this book in 2 days when it first arrived, I couldn't put it down. I work full time and also go to grad school, so I don't have a lot of free time, but this book was so good that I found the time to read it over and over. The only suggestions I can share are to be ready for non-stop action from the get-go, that is what makes this book so much harder to put down than most HP books (not an easy task to begin with). The epilogue may frustrate you, so you have been warned if you choose to read it. Other than that, this book is amazing and full of emotion. A fitting end to an amazing series.
 JKR did a magnificent job of writing a satisfying ending to a wonderful series.  The book has great pacing, continued to show the development of the characters and does a nice job of tying up all the plot elements.  As another  reviewer pointed out, the nice thing is nothing is forced--the finale comes together naturally.<br/><br/>Yes, it is dark and we lose some favorite characters, but nothing is gratuitous and the losses provide the perfect backdrop for some of the deeper themes of the story.
 it was a ok buy, they were slightly more used then i was used to. but they where low cost, so i really like that.
 Love this set - came looking great!
 Amazing finish
 I love JK Rowling, and I love Harry Potter.  But this book was a heartbreaking mess.  The 'Hallows' and the Peverells? Unnecessary distractions.  The 'put-outer' returning Ron to the campsite?  Nonsense.  The Weasleys living free?  Unbelievable.  So much was wrong with the book, it ruined all that was right.  At the end, I was dissatisfied with the epilogue.  We've been suffering for years with these characters, now we're cheated out of the happily ever after that we've earned.<br/>I've heard JKR may put together an encyclopedia containing an in-depth epilogue, I really hope she does.  Something sweet to take this bitter taste from my mouth.<br/><br/>I guess we all had our theories as to what would happen in Book 7, and we do get very attached to the characters, and make the stories 'our own'. That said, I knew anything could happen, and I really enjoyed the book until after the wedding. (The high point of excitement was Kingsley's patronus!! Loved that.)<br/><br/>After that it just got SOOOO dark. I understand JKR was telling a war story, and good people die sometimes fighting for a worthy cause. Point well taken. I got the point with the Potter's deaths. I got the point with the Longbottoms. With Cedric. With Sirius. Dumbledore. Moody. Hedwig. Dobby. Ted Tonks. JKR went on to kill Snape, Colin &amp; Dennis Creevey, Lupin, Tonks, and Fred before she got it all out of her system. That's in addition to Bones, Vance, Abbot, Scrimgeor, etc. Enough's enough! I wanted to send Deathly Hallows back to the kitchen, like a soup with too much salt.<br/><br/>The 'Hallows' just felt contrived...a way to get JKR out of several corners she'd written herself into. The Horcruxes (a wickedly cool concept) were set up over five books!!! The Peverell story came out of thin air. I kept thinking "Funny that Dumbledore didn't mention any of this." The second half of the book felt like JKR improvising, and wondering what the heck she was gonna do next. Rather like Harry in the woods!!!<br/><br/>As to feeling cheated....yeah, I did. You, me and everybody else have been following Harry down toilets, through fire, Inferi, Dementors, and death for ten years. Dang it, we deserved an invite to Harry &amp; Ginny's and Hermione &amp; Ron's weddings! I wanted to see George okay without his twin. I wanted the foursome, with Neville and Luna, kicking back and clinking butterbeers together.<br/><br/>So yeah, I really do hope JKR can give us a warm and fuzzy look at the Potters soon.
 I read this book aloud with my husband and we were riveted to the end.  We could hardly put it down.  There were several nights that we stayed up all night reading it.  It is that good.  I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't read it, but there is a whole chapter devoted to whether Snape is a bad guy or a good guy, you get to see Bill and Fleur's wedding, you find out who R.A.B. is and just about every question from the series is wrapped up.  A wonderful end to a wonderful series and we will all miss waiting for new books to come out.  If you haven't bought yourself a copy yet, what are you waiting for?  Don't you want to find out if Harry lives or not and whether or not he manages to defeat Voldemort?  Go ahead and buy your copy today.  It's great!
 This was a nice final book.  I read the seven books in about 2 - 3 weeks.  I was surprised to find them so engaging -- and that they became more so as the books continued on.
 Beautiful! such a great price!

All 7 books in perfect hardback condition, in a lovely commemorative trunk! It is made of a thick cardboard, so be aware of that but the books are perfection! It also comes with a set of stickers for you to place all over your trunk! So cute. I am happy
 Wonderful!
 We love the books and the covers are terrific
 If you're like me and didn't appreciate until recently how well written and adult themed the Harry Potter books are, this set is an economical way to get your own copy of the entire series (so you don't have to borrow from the kids).  The books are printed on high quality paper stock with good bindings, and original dust jackets and illustrations. They will lie on my shelf next to my leather bound "Lord of the Rings" set.  This set is also a great gift for a child who was too young to appreciate the series when it originally came out, particularly if you want to send the lesson on how much richer the reading experience is compared to the movie.<br/><br/>However, if you are looking for collector's value, don't waste your money.  The "box" is cheezy cardboard, and while the books are marked "first edition" the lowest number on the publisher's page is 07, so they don't have value as first printing first editions.<br/><br/>I thought it was good value for 7 original quality hardbacks.  Keep the books for your library and give the chest to the kids.
 I loved it.
 This book exceeded my expectations!  It was very enjoyable to get all of the answers along with Harry and to finish out this long story with such a bang.  This whole series is morally and grammatically superior to most of the other literature that is published in the US for young readers. Kudos to J.K. Rowling... The end was worth the wait.
 I'd read all of the books many times, and decided I want to keep my hard cover copies put away, so I bought them for my Kindle app to be able to read them... but I do have to say that I love books so much that reading books on the Kindle app just isn't as satisfying especially when the books are favorites, like the Harry Potter series.
 I think that this last book of the Harry Potter series is by far the best of all the books. This will make a great movie, she is so creative, and wraps up the questions left in the other books really well. It's a fun and exciting adventure she puts Harry and his friends through!! I highly recommend the book to anyone who is a Harry Potter or fantasy fan!! Read it you'll love it!!
 The second installment of the Harry Potter series is well worth your time. PLEASE read the first book first, so that the story will make much more sense (and come on Harry Potter is such a defining series of the past 15 years), however JK did a great job of making this book have all necessary information if you decide to skip it.  I say, NO VIOLENCE, because I do not think it is anything graphic, and I have had no problem reading it as a child or an adult, but do know that Harry must fight against He-who-must-not-be-named, throughout the series. Contains themes great for children or adults-friendship, being yourself, good vs. evil, etc. Wonderful Story line, and really sets up for the "darker" events of the end of the series. I love this series!
 Love Harry Potter
 Just as described
 Came as expected and earlier than planned
 Came as described
 The last book of a great series, amazing read, very interesting.  Arrived with perfect timing, no complaints whatsoever.  Read it twice, only book I ever did that for.
 Super.
 Overall I am pleased with this purchase, I have been wanting to order the entire Harry Potter series for awhile now and am glad I found this affordable box set on amazon. The only complaint I have is that in book 5 there was a page that looked like it had something go wrong when printing/putting the book together because there was a big rip/hole in the paper and about a sentence of text was missing. I am just guessing that it has something to do with the quality of the printing process though, and not a shipping/handling accident. I definitely recommend this box set to anyone looking for the Harry Potter series in the paperback version.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a delightful, terrifying, funny, painful, sad and gripping read.  I have long been a fan of the Potter series and have awaited this volume with a battling mixture of excitement and sadness.  This book is every bit as good as each of the previous volumes.  It is possibly the best in the series.  In spite of all the speculation and prediction among fans, the ending is full of surprises. J. K. Rowling has outdone herself in this book.  I higly recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans, but readers should not approach this book if they have not read all six of the other Harry Potter books.  Excellent!
 I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and have been ever since I started reading the books back around 2000. I owned the original hardcovers, but after many uses by myself and other family members, they started to fall apart. I loved the artwork on this set and liked the idea of a paperback copy, so I was very excited to get it. Unfortunately, the set I received was handled so poorly during shipping and was generally so very low-quality that I had to return it. The flaws: The binding wasn't very good and seemed to crack when I opened the books, the pages on one of the books was yellower than all the rest as if it was printed on different paper, the ink was smeared on several pages, the book corners/binding/box had torn during shipping, and there was a residue from the inside of the box that stubbornly clung to the edge of the pages on every book no matter what I did to try to scrape it off. I ended up ordering a Bloomsbury set after this one and was completely amazed at how much higher-quality it was. I'm disappointed that this set was made so cheaply.
 amazing
 Never bothered reading it like all those nerds in middle school when it first came out. Was too busy being a man!<br/><br/>Jokes aside, I really didn't read it back in the day and felt like I really, really missed out on something awesome. Almost through the first book now, and it's good even now that I'm much older. Besides, it's important to read before going to bed. Helps calm your mind and keep your brain from turning to mush. Also, much better than the movies... and the movies are really good!
 Great book lots of fun
 Have read all the books and liked them so much I wanted my own set.
 Love Potter!!!!!!!
 The order was filled and delivered promptly. This will be the second time reading through the series. It is easy to read and develops an amazing amount facts about all the characters that grows from book to book.  The story takes suprising turns and characters have a depth of personality that grow with every chapter.  Ms Rowling has an unique talent for wrapping the similarities we all share in a blanket of magic and mystery.  While I look forward to the last book in the series with anticipation to see how things will wrap up I'll feel a sadness, like the day after Christmas, when the magic has passed.  However I can always read it again!!!<br/><br/>"K"
 What can I say about all the Harry Potter books?  Wonderful!  Started out thinking the Potter fad was nonsense and now am one of the biggest fans despite being a senior citizen.  Loved the book but was sad that Jo didn't define the paths the main characters chose for their adult lives.  A bit sparse on some of the details but still wonderful.
 I was so sad when this was over. I read it as slowly as I could and it still ended. I was so despondent that I didn't read for weeks. I'm slowly recovering with the help of Dick Francis.<br/>By the way, great story line and beautifully crafted storytelling. I could see it all in my mind as it unfolded.
 On Saturday morning at 9:32 am I arose out of bed, walked down the hallway, and opened my front door.  The postman was there with my copy of Deathly Hallows.  This was an unexceptional event except for one small detail:  he had not rung the buzzer yet, and I usually sleep late on Saturdays.  On Sunday afternoon at 4:07 pm I finished reading all but the epilogue.  Tears were streaming down my face as I tried not to make any noise so that anyone would hear me.  However, these were tears of joy mingled with sorrow:  a eucatastrophe.  This is the hallmark of some of the best written works:  that joy and sorrow have become so closely joined together that they cannot be separated.  They have become one.  I'm still astonished today as I write this brief tribute.  Her completed work is a gift at any price.  I can only say "Thank you, J.K. Rowling."
 The seventh book is a well written ending to the life and times of Harry Potter.  Although sad the story is over, RK wrapped up the saga neatly.
 Great purchase

Happy reading.<br/><br/>While I got into this book series a bit late in the game (I wasn't even aware of its existence until after the release of the fourth book...shame on me) I quickly caught up and I've been hooked ever since.  I don't think any book series has been this solid from beginning to end.<br/>  J. K. Rowling spent an extraordinary amount of time even just developing the setting and plot and it shows.  The world us Muggles aren't aware of isn't just squeezed into this little space where there happens to be room for it.  No, its woven right into our own world so seamlessly that we'd never notice where one world ends and the other begins...it all works flawlessly.<br/>  The characters are all great except one (check out my above-mentioned reviews to see who.)  They are funny, brave, smart, wonderfully annoying, perfectly psychopathic, and so much more.  Everyone has their own specific favorites and that's just fine...there are so many to choose from.  My favorite throughout this series is absolutely Hermione Granger.  She is smart but doesn't always have all the answers.  She's resourceful but doesn't always have exactly what is needed.  She's friendly but has her limits.  She's tough but can get scared.  In my opinion, she is the most flushed-out and most interesting character in these books.<br/>  I have a whole pool of characters who make second place on the list after Hermione, including Sirius Black, Albus Dumbledore, Mad-Eye Moody, Remus Lupin, Ron Weasley and pretty much his entire family, and more.  Lord Voldemort also makes this list as he is one of the creepiest, evil, and finest villains in literary fiction that I've seen far and wide.<br/>  Harry Potter does make that list, but it's a close call.  He's interesting because of his background and the role he plays, but as for personality and similar qualities, he's pretty bland.  I wasn't always wondering how'd he get out of some mess he was in...I was wondering what twists and turns would come next in the story.  I didn't want Harry to die, but there were characters who I'd have probably fought for more vigorously.  Ultimately, he was a decent protagonist throughout these seven books, but I feel he could have been more.<br/>  In the United States, these audio books are read by Jim Dale, who does an amazing job.  While some of the many different voices he does do indicate that he's behind all of them, so many more don't.  Like J. K. Rowling, Jim Dale is able to take us into this world and make us truly believe.  Things come alive and magic is real when Mr. Dale begins narrating.  A job well done!<br/>  I will depart from my normal methodology for reviews on Amazon and comment on the price for the whole series of audio books.  It's high, no doubt about that.  But, when you break it down, it comes out to about $40, which is the average price for the individual audio books on Amazon.  The question remaining is simply whether to buy this set all at once or buy the individual books over time?  Either way, it's worth it.<br/>  J. K. Rowling gave us an amazing series of books.  Jim Dale brought that series to life on these audio books.  Pick them up and follow Harry across this seven-year saga.  While my opinion about the epilogue from Deathly Hallows remains as I've described in my review for that book, I will definitely listen to these great books over and over again.  These are so much more than just kids' books.  Enjoy.<br/><br/>P.S.:  So, which Hogwarts House would you be sorted into?<br/><br/>My Order of Preference:<br/><br/>1.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br/>2.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<br/>3.  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince<br/>4.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<br/>5.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br/>6.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br/>7.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br/><br/>Please keep your hate mail to a minimum.  Thanks.
 I didn't see any product description to indicate size, so I assumed they were the same size as the normal hardbacks.  They are a good bit smaller at just over 8 inches tall.  Though for some, this will make it easier to hold and not as heavy.  They are packed into the box very tightly, making it difficult to pull a book out without either potentially ripping the dust jacket or turning over the entire box.  The box is a thick cardboard, nice but probably not sturdy enough to endure regular use or movement, very good for sitting on a shelf.  Dust jackets have really nice gold embossed lettering and cool graphics.
 Very nice illustrations
 Genial 100% fiable
 Books brand new, cool boxing and stickers
 Harry Potter is instantly a classic. A must read for muggles and wizards alike.
 Naturally, like many other avid Harry Potter readers, I was very excited for this book. When I got my copy, I did not hestitate to begin reading what would become the end of Harry Potter's story as we know it.<br/><br/>This book kept my attention quite well with great imagery and sad, heartful moments all around. The death's experienced in this final tale will have you crying right along with the rest in the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>The ending was excellent, a book I will return to read over and over again, minus the epilogue, which seemed as if it were a fanfiction and not something from the clever mind of J.K. Rowling herself. I just feel as if it were rushed and not really thought through. Something more for a way younger crowd, than for all readers.
 Wasnt damaged
 Without giving to much away, this book was not at all what I expected. I loved it!! Although it didn't end as I thought.. the ending was a perfect way to end the series. The book takes you through the lives of many of the characters that Rowling has been writing about all along and it all ties together. I Highly recommend the whole Harry Potter series to anyone. I'm going to miss the Harry Potter stories, and I am really sad it all had to come to an end.
 The narrator brings the characters to life better than the movies!
 loved it
 We have been Potter fans since it was first delivered to the USA before all the hype. I am amazed at all that has happened to the series. Kudos to JK Rowling for getting kids (and adults) excited about reading again! Although I thought the ending as predictable, it also brought some closure to a great series.
 new is better~~ he said.
 I love this book nobody  can make a better book than this . I gave a 5 star because it had so many twists
 Well, seven books, a fantastic series. My entire family, wife and kids, all read this last book. Everyone is sad to see it end. If you have yet to read the HP books, you will always be glad you did. While Deathly Hallows is far from the best book of the series, it does bring it to a good close. Well done!
 Lived up to the hype - couldn't put it down. An amazing end that leaves the reader slightly out of breath, but completely satisfied. Glad to hear that she'll be publishing the back stories in an "encyclopedia" format, as some of the characters were left a little more open ended than others.<br/>Agreed with the reviews about some of the action/fight scene writing - confusing at times. Also, some of the magic logic used to justify the actions towards the end were oddly communicated. Overall, though - I couldn't imagine being more impressed.
 I didn't expect to not like the later books, but I don't. I had already read the first two books when I bought this set, and loved them. The third one I thought was too long, and a little boring at points, but I liked the end. And I just haven't been able to get even half way through the fourth book, it seems like a bizarre little soap opera filled with long (LOOOONG) conversations, details about trivialities like camping trips and especially way too much detail about quidtich (sp?), the weird (and dull) sport Harry is obsessed with, which has always been the weakest part of the books IMHO (I usually skim these parts). I hate sports.<br/><br/>I really don't know if I will ever finish the series. The first two books were so tight, short, exciting and funny. I'm so let down.
 After reading several reviews I wasn't sure about the Harry Potter Trunk.  I think sometimes people tend to be over critical and for me this was one of those times.  I couldn't be happier with the books, stickers included and the trunk!!  It looks neat in my library up on the shelf along with the Harry Potter collection I have just started.  I have to agree with a couple reviewers who wrote that the movie series didn't cause them much excitement but after reading the books they were hooked.  That same thing happened to me and now I am an avid fan and enjoying every minute of searching for little and big treasures.  Even though I am retired I feel like a little kid going into the library taking one of the Harry Potter Pop Ups and just looking for something new.  It's the only cat free room in my house!!  Believe me you won't be disappointed....
 As a fantasy fiction author, I enjoyed all of J.K. Rowling's works, although I felt the earlier books were more sharply edited and had a greater dramatic tension. The creative ending of the series is the strength of this book, where she does not tightly wrap up all the loose ends, and it is not a happily-ever-after in that everybody walks away with a smile. Instead, the story captures the rough-edged reality of life, where even when things get resolved in the hero's favor, that triumph may be edged with sadness and loss. - Author Claudia Newcorn
 I never liked audiobooks,  but the guy that read this book its amazing.  I owned the whole series in Audiobook and I'm always listening to one or another.  Buy it!
 This is a great buy for those who couldn't wait to buy book 7 with the complete set like me.  Book 6 is  the only  first print for those interested in collecting.
 After buying and reading the books as they first came out, time took its toll and the pages turned yellow. Had the chance to get this box set and trust me when I say, it is simply beautiful and refreshing. Box is nice enough to keep in the shelf the books themselves are magical. Harry Potter will live long in the minds of those of us who read the series and to have this set is perfect. Fast shipping and great customer service. If you have the money, and love the series, GET IT. You won't regret it.
 I bought this for my son and he loves it
 This has become my favorite book in the series.  I definitely enjoyed reading it from cover to cover and I'm looking forward to read it again.  I think to keep so many people interested for a series of 7 books is nothing short of miraculous. I'm a little bit saddened that there will be no more Harry Potter books to look forward to, but all good things must come to an end.
 J.K. Rowling gave us a great last book. I didn't think she would be able to sum everything up in a way that would please the audience. She proved me wrong. I won't go into any specifics of the book. I will say if you are not a Harry Potter fan I suggest you become one. This is one of those legendary tales people will be talking about for years to come and you will want to have been on the journey.
 Always love the Harry Potter series.  My gift is the beginning of my young friend's experience at HEARING it read by the amazing Mr. Dale.  In my view, the books came to life in a much different way from reading it myself.  A wonderful experience, that I'm glad to share.  I believe that the item was received on time for her to open it during the holiday break.  thanks<br/>s
 A fitting ending to the seven Harry Potter books. As a 46 year old reader I can honestly say I laughed, I cried &amp; I god scared at some points.<br/><br/>This book will be a touchstone for several generations.
 It was an amazing book.  I read it in less then 3 days and loved every bit of it.  It was here the day it came out at 1:00 pm thank you so very much for all the enjoyment
 Love the illustrations!
 I love the Harry Potter series and this book exceeded my expectations.  It was so fun to read and once I hit about half way through, I couldn't put it down.
 Everything was as described.
 Decent just a rip I'm the cover
 If you've ever read any of the Harry Potter series, you HAVE to read the last book. In my opinion, it's the best book of the whole series. This book wraps up all the open-ended questions that you may of had while reading the other books of the series. Many parts of the book were just so touching. Especially toward the end...but no spoilers!
 I won't repeat what other have said already, I only wish to add my 2 cents worth and agree that this book is BY FAR the very best- if all the other books were of this standard the series would have soared even higher.  Once you start THIS one you won't want to put it down till the last page.<br/>Enjoy!
 Excellent books
 my opinion is along the lines of the others, harry potter is an intricate story filled with love friendship honor betrayal the fight againt evil the choice we all have to make between what is right and what is easy and a wonderul world of magic muggles Hogwarts and wizards and witches jsut learned what it is to be so, i read the other books multiple times trying to figure out the mystery and had almost everything figured out before the epilogue was published this last week, even so JK managed to lead me down a path to a conclusion more than even i thought it would be and to be honest i was astounded at myself for not thinking the most obvious point of it all. in this series i laughed i bawled my eyes out i cheered and i booed, and most of all i loved all these wonderful characters, JK tied up all her plot points and hints, what a masterful story this woman had in her head!!!<br/>my only disapointed point what how much information of her wonderful characters especially the weasleys with all they risked over the years for Harry and what was right.. were barely touched on when it was all done. THOSE plot points that werent tied up bothered me the most. and like all the other potter fans i am more than disheartened today that its all over.cept the movies.  i highly recommed this series to anybody not just children, but if your children do read it read it WITH them you can get jsut as much out of it as they,  please be aware that the older harry gets the scarier and more REAL the reality that is around harry gets. but its still worth every second. DUMBLEDORES ARMY!<br/>ENJOY!
 Short of coming in a leather-covered trunk with brass corners, this is the most well put together presentation for a boxed set (of books) that I've ever seen or owned. Anyone who needs to own the hardcover set of the Harry Potter series would do well to purchase this presentation of the collection.<br/><br/>Pro: The packaging really helps protect the books to ensure that there is no damage to them in travel.<br/>Pro: The rope handles on the trunk are anchored well enough to feel comfortable using them to lift the package.<br/>Con: The included decals look cheesy until you put them onto the outside of the case and realize that they fit the "style" of the outside of the trunk.<br/>Con: The latch for the trunk is a bizarre plastic piece that is stable now but I expect will have problems in decades to come.<br/><br/>One final note: seven hardcover books of reasonable length, even without the cardboard trunk, are heavy -- I highly recommend using Amazon's free shipping method -- you don't want to pay for these things to ship by weight!
 Right, so let's just get down to the main ideas:<br/><br/>In a nutshell:<br/>- Wonderful books and narration.<br/>- Not real fast shipping, but it did arrive a day earlier than I expected.<br/>- Lousy but passable packaging, as long as handled nicely by the delivery guys.<br/>- Odd "assortment" feel to product packaging design, not for people who want a nice-looking set on their shelf.<br/>- TERRIBLE compatibility with computers, music programs, and portable mp3 players. Best for car rides and CD players/stereos.<br/><br/>*** Why is it terrible in the compatibility department?<br/><br/>I have been in misery trying to organize Harry Potter 4 audio book tracks on my computer. I spent HOURS sorting, renaming, and editing properties, only to find that with 2 steps forward, I took one step back when some files decided to randomly revert back to their original properties or replace one another. This process repeated for several days and with every disc of the audio book.<br/><br/>After finally getting all the tracks in the album and playlist in the right order and with the right name, I put in disc 1 of Harry Potter 5 for ripping. Every music player program I have played the files correctly, but shows the CD as being the movie soundtrack to Harry Potter 5 by Nicolas Hooper, and even includes the CD cover art for the movie soundtrack!! Mixed up tracks and duplicate names were far more understandable than this mess. I doubt Brilanti Books is to blame, but I thought people should know what kind of can they're opening when they buy the HP audio books from these guys.
 I didn't buy this book for myself, I bought it for my Grandson.  Since I read the book a couple of years ago, my recollection isn't good enough to write a review.  I purchased the book for my Grandson to complete his set, and because he just loved the previous books, as did I.<br/><br/>I would like to add that the book, though used, arrived in like new condition and in a timely manner.  I was very pleased with my purchase.
 Jim Dale is amazing.  He brings Harry to life in a way that is magic.  He doesn't leave out a word of the original<br/>story which is great.
 Best books that I've read.
 I am quite pleased with this product.  The quality of the sound and the packaging was wonderful.  With this audio it has thrown me into the world of Harry Potter.  It is as if I am there experiencing this every moment.  I intend on purchasing each one of these so that I can escape the muggle world and leave my cares behind if only for a few moments
 I'm late in reading these books, but I was determined to finish them all.  Not sure why, now.  The last book was in hardback and it was so heavy I had to cut it in half.  This was not my favorite book.  Actually, I liked the earlier books better when they were young kids playing Quidditch and exploring Hogwarts and fighting a few bad characters. I liked the chess game.  But as the series went on, it became more and more treacherous and bloody. It seemed incredible that all these wizards and witches, with all their magic couldn't get rid of one bloody monster.  I didn't expect that much mayhem.  I should have given this book a 2 instead of a 3. I was kind.<br/><br/>I assumed the books were for kids. They're not. I wouldn't give these books to any kid under 13.  I lost track of the many, many names, which often changed it was hard to keep track of who was who. If that wasn't bad enough, the names were so queer, I couldn't remember them all.  Then there were a gzillion different wizards and witches, etc., who also kept changing. Sometimes they were good, and sometimes they were bad.  Never knew who was good or who was bad. Never figured out what horcruxes actually were. What were their purpose, anyway?  Off and on they seemed very important.  I must have skimmed through that part, or maybe it was in another book.  Anyway, the whole book was a conglomeration of spells, familiars, horrors, demons, attacks and worst of all, confusion. The best part was Hogwarts itself, which until the end, isn't even in this book.<br/><br/>The story, imo, got lost within the plethora of names and events. Harry, Hermione and Ron could perform most any magic ever thought up in a story.  Aside from them, most of the characters were a variety of very weird and terrifying monsters disguised as wizards, or death-eaters or vice versa, horrible prisons, terrible deaths and murders all up against Harry, his two young friends and their every changing wands.  Not for young kids<br/><br/>Please, don't compare it to Lord of the Rings.  Harry Potter is not great literature.
 Awesome, a great end to a fabulous series of fantasy and imagination. Suitable for all ages. Can't wait comes next for Rowling.
 One of my brothers has one of the books on tape so I knew pretty much what I was buying. I much prefered having this product in CD format. It's great entertainment. Many, many hours of listening pleasure. I've listened to 5 out of the 7 so far and have found no flaws or defects whatsoever. I'm very happy with this purchase. And buying them altogether was a significant cost savings over buying them seperate. I searched for quite some time to find the cheapest prices on this material. Discount stores, tag sales, flea markets, etc... nothing was better than this pricing.
 It's an amazing book with a great conclusion that still left my family wanting more, more, more.  What were the characters careers now? Who is headmaster at Hogwarts?  What happened to some of our favorite Hogwarts teachers?  What happened to the Dursleys?<br/><br/>We loved the book so much and were amazed at Rowlings ability to pull everything together in such a flawless manner;it makes us want to go back and read the first 6 for things we missed the first time that were referred to in this book.<br/><br/>Thank you J.K. for giving us the magic of Harry Potter.  You have given my family a piece of literature to enjoy together again and again.
 I did not read the Harry Potter books as they came out, and watched the movies before I read the movies; however I feel that the essence of the books is not lost despite my reading them after I watched the movies. The product itself is pretty amazing. The paperback books are pretty good quality and the box set they came in, is sturdy enough to hold these. Mind you that you are getting what you paid for i.e. the box cover set is hard cardboard, and the paperbacks are good if you take care of them, and put them back in the box set after you finish reading them, otherwise the chances of wear and tear are high on this product. But this product does deliver the most bang for your buck.
 This was a good series from the beginning to end. I think J. K. Rowling did an excellent job. I really don't know what author that could ever imagine or produce a story like this kind of story ever again. It will forever be a favorite of mine. God Bless you J. K. Rowling your stories of Harry Potter had many lessons of learining from right to wrong, from meaning of purpose, and above all true friendship :)
 I originally read the first Harry Potter book when my kids were young. I thought it was yet another cookie-cutter fantasy rip-off. But it has become hard to find good fantasy these days, so I thought I'd give the series another try (now that all the books are available!)<br/><br/>Well of course it cast its spell on me and I am hooked! I am starting book 6 now. Why am I reviewing this book? Because I have been reading other people's reviews of it, and the reviews are about as entertaining as the book itself! It is hilarious to read that people don't like Harry Potter because "it doesn't teach any Moral Values". I imagine that these people don't like to eat a muffin in the morning or watch a ball game because these things don't have a moral value, they are just "enjoyable".<br/><br/>I did have mixed feelings about this book. Like the first book, parts of it are kind of silly...like the flying car and the "whomping willow", not to mention "haunted plumbing" (well, when we live in old houses, maybe that's not so unbelievable). I could really do with fewer descriptions of spells involving exotic animal parts (the animal rights people would have an issue about this).  Ridiculous goings-on, an outrageous castle where poltergeists float around and staircases appear and disappear (I wonder if the author was visualizing the movie when she wrote). This book kind of reminded me of Nancy Drew detective stories. There is a contrived mystery with set-up clues which the genius sidekick (Hermione) just happens to find in an old book. Oh, did I mention one-dimensional characters? Malfoy is "bad", his sidekicks are "thuggish", and the Weasleys are extremely annoying. Any scene involving the Weasley family can be skimmed over because it will be pages and pages of exploding firecrackers, magical household disasters and other pointless foolery. I'm sure they will be even worse in the movies.<br/><br/>So basically, I enjoyed this book, but it was light bedtime reading. I think that if Rowling had stopped after this one, it would have gone down to oblivion. I believe the chief value of the first few Potter books is that they are a set-up to the later books. It is not till about book 4 (Goblet of Fire) that I began to see what was behind the silliness... the tragic backstory of Harry's parents, an epic struggle, and a fascinating alternate world of wizards that exists right next to our own.<br/><br/>Now that I am starting Book 6, I actually went back and skimmed over the first few books again to pick up some of the details. It is kind of like the first part of Lord of the Rings: Tolkien started off with cutesie-pie Hobbits and their fairy-story world, and you get the feeling the author was writing for children. But somewhere in the middle the author and the readers grew up. The cutesie pie became grim, and you couldn't read the books at night anymore.
 JKR's best work yet!  I have loved the Magical Ride!  However, i would love to find out what happened to some of the other main characters. So many questions unanswered!  I sincerely hope JKR decides to enlighten us with another HP Book including the fate of all the main characters, and some pre HP history of The Three brothers, and other things.  Thanks for the long wonderful ride JKR!!
 The only problem that I see after finishing this book, is the possibility that Harry Potter will no longer exist in print. As anxious as I was to finish the book, I'm saddened to realize that this might be an end to the fabulous run J. K. Rowling has had with this series. It was phenomenal, even for this 55-year-old! Bravo and best wishes. Read, read, read and please give us more!
 I was so excited when I got this book...but so nervous I was almost afraid to open it! What was going to happen? I had speculated for so long, I was almost afraid to find out. The story delivered! There were nailbiting moments as Harry and company invaded the ministry of magic, and the sadness of Hogwarts without Dumbledore. The final confrontation was spine tingling and frightening, but the triumph over Voldemort is worth every moment. JK Rowling ROCKS as a story teller and I can't wait to see what she conjurs up next!
 Okay.  I was probably expecting too much.  After all, we are talking about a set that includes 7 hardcover books for a little over $100.  However, the pictures on the web site made the "trunk" look way more substantial than it really is.  This case is not worth more than a couple of bucks.  So, if you can get the books individually for less, I would.
 Amazing!  My son and I loved it and can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
 I'm not the first one to point out the flimsy packaging, but mine just arrived and I'm so disappointed I have to add my two cents' worth.  It was damaged in shipping due to insufficient packaging, also, so I'll be returning it in hopes of getting one that is at least an intact birthday gift for my Potter-obsessed niece.  The cardboard box is so flimsy it won't last being opened a dozen times.  The "hinged" lid is just folded cardboard, already ripping; the colorful lid liner is a loose piece of cardboard that falls out; the handles are knotted cord, already pulled out at one spot; the flimsy plastic lock had already pulled out of its hole.  Harry deserves better than this!  The set is still a bit cheaper than buying all the individual books, but don't expect the box to last beyond Christmas morning.
 was a gift but now I can't see why anyone would buy 1-5. Without 6 &amp; 7 what's the point?
 This was a far more mature book than the previous books in the series--sometimes shockingly so--but it was, at its heart, still the same story. The way that it brought all of the different elements of the previous books together was amazing.
 Good value for money
 it was a birthday gift for my niece she loved it thank you
 The Harry Potter Books were a hallmark of my childhood. I grew up with them, and it changed the way I approached story writing. Coming into them as a child, without the understanding of all the symbolism behind things, the story was solid. It was scary when it needed to be scary, and funny when it needed to be funny. As an adult, looking back and reading over them again, I find the story still holds up. The symbolism speaks volumes and the flow of the story keeps me on the edge of my seat. This is a book series that I could not put down when I initially read them, and still find myself staying up late because I don't want to put it down.<br/><br/>Is it a structurally perfect story? No.<br/><br/>Is it the greatest story ever written? Probably not.<br/><br/>But for me, it takes me to a place where magic is real. Where friendships grow and change, evolve and scale with age and experience. It was the first big story I read with as much content as it contains. It was the first and only book series I have read where I audibly gasped at certain plot points, laughed out loud at others, and needed to set the book aside and take a break at certain revelations. This book shaped me as a person, and gave me a set of characters I could relate to and grow with. This stands as my favorite book series. I know it might not be for everyone, but it was perfect for me.
 I was never a fan of the original cover art for the Harry Potter books, so when I found out about this box set, I had to have it -- nevermind that I already had 6 of the 7 books. It was worth every cent. The cover art is SO much better, both in quality and in actually showing standout scenes from the series. The fact that all the spines form a grand picture of Hogwarts is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>There is one downside though. The box is a bit too small. Once I got a book out (a challenge in itself), I can no longer get all 7 back in. The fit is just too tight. I have resigned to just putting book 1 on top of it -- as is, the other 6 still fill the box up. I don't know how they got all 7 in there the first time.
 After all the scare talk about this final volume, it was wonderful to read a fully satisfying wrapup of a wonderful series.  I'm ready for whatever Rowling decides to do next.
 I was the best aunt in the world when I presented my niece with these.  She's quite the reader and loved them.
 this review isn't really about the books story, but<br/>about Amazon's delivery of the book, on the<br/>day of release. Which the US Postal Service made<br/>sure of.I preordered my books, and I was promised<br/>day of release delivery and I had my books, from<br/>the US Postal Service by 9AM on release day..<br/>Just want to say good job to Amazon, and to the US Postal<br/>Service. Didn't have to go wait in line, or travel anywhere<br/>to get my books.
 Nice boxed set of all the Harry Potter books.  My daughter has already worked her way through two of the books and is on her third.  I recommend this purchase if you are not lending your books out to all of your friends.  I have already purchased each of the Harry Potter books separately in hard cover, but they were so well read that they are either missing or have broken bindings.  This is our second set and I am keeping it close to home.
 Good read!
 They came right on time and were exactly what I expected!
 Harry Potter is my life time best series. I really love the series, enjoy each and every book in the series. So I decided to have them in their original language and I bought this box set. The box set came in perfectly good condition (better than the pics), books are complete and in order. I'm not expecting any bonus came with this box set, so I'm truly satisfied with what came to my hand.
 Just finished the first book.  I was a fan of the film series and thought I'd try out the source material.  This is great reading, even for adults.  Literary fiction usually is my first choice, but I'm glad I tried the first novel.  I would recommend this to parents who want to expose their children to well written stories which examine themes such as friendship, compassion, decency, justice, humility and sharing.
 If you want to save your hardbacks of Harry Potter by not rereading them I suggest that you buy the box set that are paperbacks. They are an excellent way to preserve your hardbacks and you can reread them as many times as you want.I am rereading them now.They fit nicely in their box and can be stored anywhere.I recommend them to anyone who is a Harry Potter fan or any one who loves to read and keep their books.
 Like Oliver, I still wanted more after reading the last of the seven-book Harry Potter series. This book has considerably more reflection than the other previous books, just to wrap up various character motivations. It also carried its own adventurous plot besides winding up the over-all one. I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. JK Rowling gave a fine epilogue for the main children characters, but I would have loved to know more about some of the characters I have become attached to over the course of reading the series.
 After reading book 6 and being disappointed I had hoped book 7 would be more cohesive and illuminating. While some questions were answered many were not. I think 759 pages of rhetoric should have been sufficient to leave no doubts or questions about HP, his cohorts and the wizarding community most of those issues were not addressed. Futher more the HP series is simply an adaptation and rendition of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Horcruxes and hallows extracted directly from Tolkien. The Kings Cross chapter was especially cryptic and not later clarified and there will be no book 8 to clear up all the remaining questions.
 Great
 This set of books is an amazing deal.  The books are not of "low quality" as someone else has said.  They are all strong, durable paperbacks that you would buy at a bookstore.  I myself am just rereading all the books (I read to 4 when I was younger) and am currently in Book 2.  I must say, these books are just as, or even more, stunning now as they were when I was ten years old.  A great buy for great books.
 Wonderful!! Makes this such a fun read aloud.
 Was delivered quick and undamaged. I was very scared go see the box before I received it because of the reviews.  Honestly, I bought this set as a gift for my girlfriend and didn't want to be embarrassed by some crappy box, lol. I was very pleased when I finally got to see it for myself. I dont know what some of those reviews were talking about. It is cardboard but it is sturdy and looks cool . I would not hesitate to buy this product again or to recommend to a friend. My girlfriend absolutely loves it! Very happy with my product and purchase.
 The final book brings to a fitting close this beloved series that has captivated young and old.  Now I'm waiting for the series to be printed in collectors-quality covers that I can buy for my grandchildren.
 Love it!!
 The last of the seven books. I'm three time older then who these books were written for, but I couldn't stop reading them! I think I read this book in three days or something!
 What a way to wrap up a fabulous series of books.  The kids all grew up and had their own kids and sent them off the Hogwarts also. It is a real hit and must read.
 Thanks so much to Ms. Rowling for bringing us this series. Her remarkable talent for invention, humor, pacing, dialogue, character, language, imagery - everything - is showcased best of all of in this last installment. I love these books, own each one, and plan to read them all again and again. I look forward to reading them to my children some day. (Though this last one will have to wait until they're older.)
 Good
 This boxed set was purchased as a Christmas gift for a Second Grade Student (and his family).  He was delighted as were his parents.  I am a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother and own and have read every book in the series, seen and own all the movies to date and am now collecting the audio books.  To say that I am a fan of Harry Potter is an understatement.
 MISLEAD BY REVIEWS. We were so looking forward to the set of books arriving in its trunk-like case for our 9 year old who loves to read. The box is cute but the books, for some reason, I expected to be illustrated. This is not the case. These books are the original version/ edition (No glossy pages. Just hardbound books) THAT DESERVES 3 STARS still. I thought I carefully selected my books which I usually base on reviews from other Amazonians! The reviews for this particular set were all from people who bought the illustrated version which is a much larger, glossy paged book leading me to believe THE SET OF 7 was illustrated. Had I done a more thorough research prior to my purchase, I would not have ordered the set. I now know that there are only 3 illustrated books available plus the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Costco sells them. Fortunately, Amazon Customer Service is excellent and my refund is pending.
 Love love love anything Harry Potter. Absolutely my favorite.
 The final book in this series really fills in a lot of the unkowns throughout the different books.  It has all of the action, mystery, social issues, and the eternal fight between good and evil that the other books have had, but it wraps it up in a fabulous book with a great ending.  I will miss Harry and his pals.  I hope J.K. Rowling comes up with another story line as great as the Harry Potter series has been.
 Wow, wow, wow.  I devoured this book.  You have to read the Half Blood Prince or you'll miss a lot.  A must read for even the casual Harry Potter fan
 Some people may ask "Why do you read Harry Potter" or may say "It's a child book" and my answer it's a clear "you're wrong".<br/><br/>J.K Rowling teaches you through Harry, Ron and Hermione that friendship is one of the very important things in life, that we can be heroes one day if our choices are the right ones. It doesn't matter how hard you try, you have to try harder to get things.<br/><br/>It teaches you to not discriminate, you know Hermione Granger can be a bit bossy, geek or nerd and she was bullied by her mates but she proved that she can be brave and she got her friends by that.<br/><br/>Ronald Weasley is from a pure-blood family and nor Harry or Hermione are pureblood and that didn't matter for him, he doesn't discriminate his friends.<br/><br/>Harry Potter teaches you that not matter how hard life can be, you gotta be strong and you'll do it completely perfect.
 I've been waiting a long time for this story to end. And it finally has.<br/><br/>The story was fairly good till the end when it seemed like it was more like something you might see in a movie than imagine through a book, but I found it interesting.<br/><br/>I recommend it for anyone who has read the other 6 Harry Potter books. (obviously)
 I purchased this book to complete my Harry Potter series. I found a used copy of this book for 0.01 + $3.99 shipping. Although I was originally hesitant about the quality of this book for such a cheap price, I found that I neeedn't have worried. The book shipped to my house on time, and when I opened it up and inspected it, I was VERY impressed with the quality. The book looks almost brand new! This is an excellent addition to my Harry Potter series. I am so glad I bought it here! Great product, great seller, fast shipping. :)
 Just like our original set!
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  When our son was much younger we would go to our nearest book store to get the latest book.  I started reading these to Jake and as he got older he plowed through them and then he would pass the book on to me.  Somewhere in our home are the original books the he and then his younger sister read.<br/>I decided to get a whole new set to keep for myself in my library.  I am definitely going to reread the series.<br/>The books arrived in perfect condition with their covers intact in the pretty handsome box it comes in.  For the price it is well worth the money..
 Note - no spoilers here. I sped through this in two days because I was afraid someone would tell me key plot points and how it ends. It's very good. Many of the reviews talk about unevenness - I see their point, but I really really enjoyed the book from start to finish. ... and it made me want to rush right out and reread all of the books again.  Thoroughly enjoyable. If you haven't picked up this series before, DO! You won't be dissapointed.
 I liked when Harry went down to the chamber of secrets to save Ginny
 Glad to see that the main characters(for the most part) survived.  It was a fast paced book with action the entire way through.  Enjoyed the book, sorry to see it be the end.  Liked the twisting plot, and how she explained all the twists in the book.  Glad she cleared up the mysteries.
 I loved this series, and although I was worried that after how great it was the end might fizzle, J.K. Rowling somehow managed to end this series in a way that was incredibly satisfying. I loved each and every chapter, although I have a definate favorite that my husband and I both laughed and cried then entire time. I won't tell which, but if you've read it you know what I am talking about!!! Loved it, loved it, loved it. Amazing. J.K. Rowling most definately no longer dances in anyone elses footsteps...
 Arrived on time. Amazing.
 perfect
 I don't know why everyone is making a big fuss over the cardboard trunk.  I personally think the cardboard one is beautiful and very durable.  I think that the cardboard was a better choice because instead of paying $100 for the set you probably would have had to pay more than double that if it was wooden.  All in all it was a great gift and comes highly recommended!
 This is a wonderful addition to any HP lover's collection!  While one of the best in the series, this Deluxe Edition is a beautiful copy of JKR's magnum opus.  I've personally left mine in the packaging.  I am going to continue to watch for sales and hopefully get copies of all 7 books in their Deluxe Editions....and no longer worry about the possibility of ruining my copies when I read them!
 After years of waiting for the final showdown, this is the best Rowling could give us? We were thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>She had greatness in her grasp and had mapped it out perfectly. Snape was going to go down. That was a given. Anyone could have guessed that, for Lily's sake, he would die defending Harry. However, instead of the blaze of honorable, brave glory that he deserved after years as Harry's protector, Rowling has him walk right into his death, and poof, he's gone. Didn't even get to draw his wand or even knick old Voldemort!  Not fair! Shame on her!<br/><br/>And... it was a bloodbath! She killed off so many beloved characters! No one was safe by the end! The worst were Hedgewig, Colin, and a Weasley!! We half expected Hagrid to get it in the end. It was horrible and senseless! She even kills off Tonks and Remus leaving Teddy an orphan!  Just nasty! And yet the Malfoys emerge without casualties!  What was she thinking?<br/><br/>And then, the worst was that we get to see them all years later! Hermione Granger, the brightest witch of her age is now doing what? She seems to be a housewife!?!?! Only Neville appears to be doing something with his life.  The rest are all just playing house out in suburbia?!?!?!  What kind of ending is that?  Harry Potter, dad, husband, lawnmower?!?!? Please!  What kind of ending is that?<br/><br/>And the middle is just plain boring.  Pages and pages of hiding in the woods....Talk about anti climactic!<br/>Honestly, Harry's had the Invisibility Cloak since year 1 but, Ron and Hermione never told him that there was this story about the Deathly Hallows? What the heck was she thinking!<br/>She wrote like she was tired and just wanted to wrap it up already.<br/><br/>I loved the time we had between books 6 &amp; 7 when we all tried to guess how it would go down!  That was fun! We had so much better ideas than Rowling! Shame.<br/>All it was, in the end, was an ending.<br/> Oh, well.
 Perhaps a second, more careful reading will change my opinion, but this is a hard book to review.  As a standalone book by itself, it seems to be a bit lacking in some structural tenets at times, including muddied rising action, climaxes, and falling action.  As the culmination of a seven-book series, though, it comes very close to being everything it should be, delivering the final climax of a story that spans seven books, the resolution of all unanswered questions, and the final denoument.<br/><br/>That said, it's unlikely that readers will be disappointed by the book.  You're more likely to get swept up in the action and stop paying attention to the structure of the story.  Rowling wraps things up neatly and satisfyingly, even if sometimes disappointingly.
 JK Rowling has done it again with the final chapter of her 7-part Harry Potter series. Death Hallows is a very fulfilling and poignant finale to the series that we've all grown to love. I recommend this book, and the entire series, in fact, to anyone who loves a fantastic story!
 I really loved my new books¡ thanks a lot¡¡ very good seller.
 I got this for my Lady Boss for Christmas. We love reading his books. My Sister-In-Law &amp; Neices got me started on them. I am not sorry that I have. I even have all of the movies so far. It has been a real joy to read these books &amp; watch the movies. I hope there are more to come. I am looking forward to that.
 Reading
 4 of disks did not work at all
 Before you read, I do have some SPOILERS in here. Don't say I didn't warn you. Let me just say I liked the final Harry Potter book, but I was disappointed. After endearing these characters to us over the last ten years, she leaves us with very little closure with some of the characters we have grown to love. What about the Weasleys who have a child to bury? Who became Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts? What happened in the aftermath of the battle? What jobs did Harry, Ron, and Hermione have when they were older. We know very little about their lives. I wanted a little more information about the characters I've become so fond of. It was a bit of a disappointing ending to such an enchanting story.
 AWESOME!!!<br/><br/>As far as final books go, Rowling has outdone herself. Mind you I would have liked more after story of the gang, but, isn't that what Fan Fic is for? Now the fanfic writers can take off from where J.K. left off. Just a sheer delight to read, I could not put it down till I was done. A must read for any Potter fan!
 Harry Potter 7 is a fabulous read. It is gripping and engaging. A whole lot better than the movie, as it usually is with movies remakes in general. JK Rowling does an amazing job of bringing together all the looseends and from the previous books which makes for a coherent reading.<br/><br/>For an avid Harry Potter fan this is amust read and it is like the icing on cake. The climax is on the lines you expected but there definite twists and turns in the plot. If towards the middle the book get a little too detailed my earnest suggestion there is to continue reading.
 There aint nothing like Harry Potter. Read the first book and you'll understand why Jo Rowling is the world's best selling author.<br/><br/>If you're like most people and you claim not to like sci-fi - do yourself a favor and give HP a chance. It aint sci fi as you know it, it's a different world you'll want to live in.<br/><br/>Family appropriate, appreciated by kids and adults. So complex and light hearted. Entertaining, amusing, thought provoking, inspiring.
 Like the other 6 I loved this book, it does a pretty fantastic job rapping up the series in a satisfying way.  Having said that, what I really loved about the other books, especially 1-4, was that the kids were investigating mysteries and taking classes and competing in quidditch matches - and fighting Voldemort of course.  This book lacks those types of charming moments, but is fantastic in other ways.
 worth your time and money
 The reason I love Harry Potter isn't so much that Rowling is such a great writer, but more in the fact that she has a great way of telling a story, and creating a new world, much the same way Tolkien did.  Each chapter you have more curiosity as to what happens next and how it will all be wrapped up. I have loved reading them myself and out loud to my kids!  My 6 year old daughter even begs me to read the next chapter, they get wrapped up in it as much as I do!
 Was quick service.  Good book.
 good
 I will try not to give any spoilers...I read my copy in less than 24 hours mainly because I was paranoid I would go to check my email and see an internet review titled "Harry Lives!" or "Harry Dies!"  Don't let the lack of stars fool you this was a very good book.  Most of the 1 stars are from people mad at Amazon for not getting them their book on time...That's right, they haven't even read the book!  A lot of the other reviews are disgusted with the "sex and language".  Sex!  Come on! You must have read a different book than I.  The main characters are now 17 they are no longer 11.  They are also fighting for their lives and should be forgiven a few "bloody"s  and "effing"s!  I am hoping J.K Rowling will get bored in early retirement and in a few years we will get Hogwarts Generation 2!
 I had just finished reading it and it set up some very good story-lines such as the relationships between Harry and his friends as well as the origins of Voldemort. But what got me the most is the end of the story where Harry and Hermione become apart of the Weasley family in the end. The story was sad, but it brought together Harry and his friends together forever. I'm going to miss any follow up stories, but this one ended the series with a bang. Trust me , check this one out, you won't be disappointed.
 Can't miss with Harry Potter
 Received on Sat as promised, finished it on Sunday and have begun reading it again. I was a bit worried about the frequent use of "God" in the beginning, but by the end no mention... thank goodness! Got a bit too religious for me early on. However, I was very happy with the use of characters. My one regret is that it didn't have an extra hundred pages or so to follow up on all of them 19-years on... still, a great read and a very fitting last book of a series.
 I was really looking forward to this box set as it looks great visually, which is still the case...however, it is a look and don't touch product.  I, and probably a lot of other people, would have paid more money to buy something that was better quality.  High quality is what you expect from Harry Potter and the people behind this travisty of a cardboard container, have certainly spoilt that aspect of it, as well as missing out on something that could have been better for everybody.  The books as you expect are great, but most collectors already have them - people bought this box set for the container and it wasn't worth it, which is a shame, as it was such a good idea that was spoilt to save money or effort.
 I enjoyed the last book of JK Rowling's Potter Series.  I'm sorry to see it come to an end, but the book closed nicely.  Jim Dale is magnificent! He is incredible in creating such distinctive voices for each character and giving them the emotions portrayed strongly in the books.  Really a treat, this book!
 Not sure why but parts at the top and bottom are cut off and I can't read it at times or it will even start a sentence go to next page and no end to sentence just start on next line . This makes reading very difficult .<br/><br/>Notice in photo bottom left can't read it
 LOVE IT!
 Well Im 68 years old and have enjoyed all seven Potter books.<br/><br/>I hate to see the series end but all good things will end in time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed #7 and it's surprise ending.<br/><br/>This one is the most violent of the series so I would suggest parent review before letting the younger ones read it.
 Beautiful! Love this edition.
 I've always wanted the HP hardcover trunk set and it's three times the amount of money I bought it for if I were to buy it in my home country.<br/><br/>I do wish that paperbacks were available or different hardcover designs were created, but I guess not many fans are willing to re-purchase their entire collection all over again. I've never bought any of the books before, having borrowed them from my friends or from the library in the past. It feels good knowing that I have my own HP set though. Definitely worth my money.
 The book perfectly ends a great series.  The movie was more concerned with special effects than plot.  On IMDB, I gave the movie only one star.
 Perfect condition set of books!
 I am seventy-two years old and I have read this book twice and seen the movie at least three times. That should tell you that I love it. Sure, it's fantasy...so what? I am a lover of science, mathematics and logical thinking. But, the imagination needs food and we can fill that need from many different sources. This book is so very well written, so engaging, so engrossing that it can appeal to all ages. As I get older, I am finding comfort in such charming books as this one. There are also invaluable life lessons to be learned and reminded of no matter what your age.
 I don't have to wait for any book to come back to the library! I can visit Hogswart whenever I want!
 The promotional picture of this set is completely misleading.  The books come in a cheap cardboard box that doesn't look at all like the one pictured except in the most distant sense.  It's promoted as "collectible trunk-like box with sturdy handles and privacy lock"... in reality, it's a flimsy cardboard box with a couple of shoe strings for handles.  This is a total rip off, and the company should be ashamed of lying so blatantly in their promotion.
 This is such a sad excuse for a collector's chest.  In fact a cardboard box with visibly ugly edges.  When I first read the description it was written as a wooden box which is why I ordered it and figured I was getting a great deal for pre-ordering.  Not the case.  I would have been more than happy to pay more for a nicely done box even if it were just a sturdier cardboard made well that looked better.  The box looks great if you neglect the corners all together and don't plan on using the handles at all.  It should have been covered with some sort of edging and made a bit better.  I was pretty sad to get such a disappointing product.  I am still excited however to read the books.
 Pre ordered and had it the morning after it came out! Great book. I thought the epiloque was a bit over the top, but the books were intended to be kids books.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows lived up to all my expectations and went beyond.  Rowling is truly a master in capturing one's imagination.  I was completely enthralled in the story from the first page to the last...I must admit that reading it with a British accent in my head makes the story even more enchanting!  I love the little life lessons Rowling weaves into this series and brings them all together in the final chapters.  A must read for kids of all ages!  My only disappointment was the use of two rather strong swear words in the book.  As a classroom teacher, that would most likely eliminate the possibility of reading this aloud to my students.
 Better than the film.
 I LOVE THIS SERIES. LIFE,DEATH,LOVE,FRIENDSHIP. IT MAY BE FICTION BUT IT APPLIES TO ALL OF US HERE AND NOW. GOOD VS. EVIL, RIGHT VS. WRONG, UP VS. DOWN, POSITIVE VS. NEGATIVE.  THE GOOD GUYS DONT ALWAYS WIN BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING TRYING.
 Having heard of the Harry Potter phenomenon and having seen the movies, i was interested in reading the books and seeing where Harry's adventures took him.  Because i hate having to wait for the next installment, i bought this set of 6 books and read them one by one over the course of 10 days.  The books are spellbinding (no pun intended) and kept me hooked from start to finish.  As expected i wanted to read the seventh book that has not come out yet and have already preordered my copy.  These are great books for old and young alike.  I had wanted to read them to my 2 year old, but she is not ready for these books yet...maybe when she is around 6-7 we can read them together.
 I am a very big Jim Dale fan, from Pete's Dragon to Barnum and everything in between, but his reading of these books is tired and gimmicky. He may have won a world record for number of voices but his narration is stale, flat and has no connection to the dialogue. It's as if he recorded the voices and then just read the dialogue in between with no contextual connection.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry's readings are exciting, eloquent and dynamic. His voices are equally as entertaining as Dale's with the added bonus of a narration that keeps you engaged throughout. There's no comparison. Buy the Fry reading if you can get it.
 Loved it--- great second book...onto the third.. I love harry potter.. it is never ending. And just feels like the best series
 If you read this book you have to be a Harry Potter Fan. It is a good ending to one of the best series i have ever read. Its Bittersweet in a way.
 I have loved the Harry Potter Series.  I wish it would continue on maybe on to a 2nd and 3rd generation.  I would love to see Harry Potter as a senior citizen and how he deals with his kids and/or grandkids sneaking around for adventure as he and his friends did.  ;o)
 I never understood what all the fuss and fervor about HP were about in high school.  Now I do.  Of course, I not gonna buy wizard robes any time soon, but after having to read "Sorcerer's Stone" in college, I chose to read the rest.  So to all those who I poked fun at, please accept this as my apology.  This really is a perfectly crafted story from beginning to end.  And although it began as a children's series, it is much more than that.
 I bought this set as a college graduation present for my daughter.  It was a very good deal on the books themselves: I had bought my set one at a time for about $30 each, so this was less than half that price.  She was a little disoppointed that the chest was so flimsy, but mostly that several of the dustcovers were wrinkled and torn.  We are bibliophiles in my family, and we treat books with careful respect, and we have books that are decades old that are in better shape than these came new.  I offered to trade dustcovers with her, as mine are in much better shape even after being read many times by many people, but she didn't want to do that.
 My son loves Harry Potter books he just started reading it September 20, 2017. He just finished the first book. He loves this book because it has information that is not in the movie.
 Harry Potter totally rocks.  If you are a fan, this is a great collector's chest of all 7 books, of course, if you don't mind hardcovers.  I couldn't be happier w/this delivery, everything was new, almost didn't want to open it.  This is what started my collection of boxsets.  Also, I recommend this to ALL AGES, not just children.
 great books for great price!!
 I could not have imagined this book being made a movie that was PG. With so many characters being bumped off in such a grusome way. JK Rowlings did an excellent job of tying up loose ends but still left room for a sequel down the road to extend on may different paths. I recommend this book to the 13 and over crowd.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a> My daughters book was stolen while on vacation.  I was not eager to spend full price on another hardback book so I decided to try the used route.  I was so pleased when I received it.  The quality was great for used!! It arrived in exactly the condition it was described.  Not to mention the price was very reasonable.
 What an experience!  The pacing, the richness of the characters, the beautiful story.  So moving, gripping, and hard to put down.  Wow...
 I am reading all of the Harry Potter books from start to finish and have enjoyed them so far. Despite having seen all except the last movie (I am planning on reading the last book then seeing it) the reading the books offers a fun and diverse experience. You can pick up on imagery and details that are left out in the movies. I wish I had read these without seeing the movies first but either way you cannot go wrong with Harry Potter. Some of the most charming, heart-warming, and magical tales written in the last century.
 My nephewloved it.
 A very good book.  J.K.Rowling has managed to write an entertaining book again. Some of the concepts in the book may be a little difficult for younger readers to grasp though and would recommend an adult reading it with them to explain certain aspects.
 The handle was broke and box was bent up
 If you have not read this book yet this is the review for you.  I will spoil nothing.  Let me just tell you a little of what to expect.<br/>1) Expect more danger and emotion than the other books in the series.<br/>2) Expect answers to your big questions, but some things left unsaid.<br/>3) Expect a thoroughly satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>Advice:<br/>1) Put aside preconcieved notions of what you think should happen and enjoy the ride.  I dragged in one or two expectations regarding plot and wish I had not.<br/>2) Take the day off when you recieve the book in the mail b/c once you start it is really hard to put down.<br/><br/>To say more would spoil your fun.  Enjoy!
 Of course, I love the Harry Potter books and they get five stars.  But I am rating the set of books for My Kindle.  As soon as I bought it I realized that it was one long book--over 15,000 pages.  This means that if I wanted to free up space on my device, I would have to delete ALL SEVEN books, instead of being able to delete just one and keep the other six. Also, it would have been easier to open an individual book if I had purchased each book separately:  in this 7-book edition, you must open the main screen, then navigate to the table of contents. It might have cost me a few extra dollars to buy each  book separately, but might have been worth it.
 The set look very good delivery to my home.its great:)
 This book was OK, but not as good as the first.<br/>I was very disapointed because I was afraid the first one would be the only really great book of the series... but fear not because the 3rd and 4th books are really great!<br/>It seems that the author was in a rush to get the 2nd book out. It's ok, but could have been better.
 This is an excellent book.  What made it even better is Jim Dale's fantastic narration.  As with the other books, the characters come alive and take on distinct personalities due to Mr. Dale's rendering of their unique voices.  It's a shame that this is the end of the 7 book series. I highly recommend listening to this and the other HP audio books!
 This is a great deal.  All six books in paperback format at a very resonable price.  My family love that Harry Potter movies so we decided to read the books.  There is so much more info in the books than the movies.  Highly recommend this set to anybody looking to buy the Harry Potte series.
 Love the Special Edition Harry Potter Paperback Box Set. It made a great Hanukkah gift for all the fans in my family who have read and reread their original Harry Potter box sets until the books fell apart.
 I loved this book.  It was so interesting and you never quite know what will happen next.  You can speculate but she really makes you think!  I did not like the ending only because I know there will not be anymore Harry Potter books!  Read this before you see the movie, when it come out.
 Absolutely love Stephen Fry and his narratation. It really brought the story to life.
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling is one of my favorite books. In Harry’s second year he encounters a wall that reads “THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED, ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.” This makes Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione very curious.<br/>  In this second book in the series, Harry and his friends try to figure out how to stop the bad things that could happen as a result from the chamber being open. The writing on the wall made them want to know more about the chamber. They believe that the heir of Slytherin could be their arch enemy, Draco Malfoy. They brew up a polyjuice potion which makes them able to appear as someone else temporarily. They use this to sneak into the Slytherin common room and get some information from Malfoy. Later, Harry goes to the dueling club and gets paired up with Malfoy, and he sends out a snake at Harry. The snake looked like he was going to attack the other people, so Harry talks to the snake and tells him to stop, except what he said sounded like a foreign language. Harry was speaking parseltongue. Harry and his friend’s base of work is the girls bathroom, because nobody goes in there. They find a book in the bathroom with blank pages, and later Harry found out something magical about the book, but I’m not going to tell you, because you should read it yourself. Finally, they find the chamber and what is inside of it.<br/>  I would give this book a 10/10. It was a great book because it gave me an image in my head and I could visualize what was happening. J.K. Rowling does a great job of putting the right amount of words in this book; not too less, that you don’t get what’s happening, and not too much, where it gets boring. My favorite part is where they make the polyjuice potion and go in the Slytherin common room. You should read the book rather than watching the movie because there is a LOT more details in the book, which gives it more feeling.<br/>  You will be amazed and surprised and wondering yourself who the heir of Slytherin is. This was an excellent book and I would read it again.
 This Box set was by far the best value if you're looking to buy all the books.  They don't mention, but the package comes with some stickers so you kid can personalize the trunk.
 Bought it for my wife and son and they both enjoyed it. They are both big Harry Potter fans and read and watch all the books and movies.
 If you don't have any of the books and want the hardcover set this is the way to purchase it. The only thing I didn't care for was the chest was cardboard. For the price it would have been nice if it was tin or some type of tin lightweight metal. It does come with all seven book and you also get a couple of cool inserts along with some stickers to help personalize your chest.
 I was a little concerned about the Harry Potter series coming to an end...wondering, is the last book going to leave me wanting more, or worse, will it sully the entire series for me? I was very pleasantly surprised that this book was my favorite of all.  I reread book 6 and then started right in on book 7, finishing both in less than three days. It's addictive, and I just couldn't put it down.  Thank you Ms Rowling for giving us the story of Harry Potter!
 The exploits of Harry Potter is now over and I will admit that I'm going to miss him and his friends. For Harry fan's this is a must read. If you're not a fan yet, try the first of the seven books and then come back for more. Although the finale looks like a lot of reading I found it amazingly easy to get into the story and very hard to put it down. Get started now.
 I notice alot of people are complaining about the box that the books are in because it's cardboard. Some people can just never be satisfied. So if you're picky and never satisfied than heed those reviews. I'm pleased with the box set. It has the hardcover books which fit snuggly inside and as some people said there are stickers in there too, which I've not used yet because I do not want to waste them.
 Great
 The only thing that kept this product from being five-star quality was because some of the pages in at least on of the books were printed out in a weird way. Either the top line or the bottom line of the text was half cut-off and made reading it a little more difficult. These pages were also a slightly different size than the rest. I found it a little peculiar in a brand new book set. But other than that, they were in good shape.
 I bought this set for my 28 year old daughter.  She had previously borrowed all the books from the library.  She was thrilled to get this set so she could re-read the books anytime she wanted to.  It is a very nice addition to her Harry Potter collection.
 My 9 year old is going through her Harry Potter phase. Normally, my kids have just checked out the books through the school library, but when my daughter finished the 2nd book, she couldn't get the 3rd... I found this set at a great price and bought it for her as a reward for reading!!
 My son gave me the money to buy this 1-6 set. He always got into mine and finally he had me order him his own set. He is now lacking the 7th (last book) and it has to be paperback to go w/ the rest of his collection. But anyways, I highly recommend this and all Harry Potter Books and Movies. You will get lost in the book and feel like your actually playing the parts of the character's.
 Six books of Harry Potter.  My six year old daughter and I are reading our way through them at bedtime.  If you're a collector this isn't the edition for you ... we dog-ear the pages, bend the binding, use them as coasters ... but most of all, the fantasy of Harry Potter unscrolls in our imaginations.
 Love it... Illustrations are just great...
 I wish I had read more reviews about this product before purchase.  I was surprised the so-called trunk was just cardboard.  Mine arrived in very poor shape.  One corner is totally ripped apart, the cheap plastic lock is broken, and one of the handles is only half attached.  If I had seen this in a store, I wouldn't have given it a second look.  I bought it as a gift and I don't have time to return it, but I will certainly be taking a closer look at reviews in the future.
 This book thrills from beginning to end....and is perhaps the best in the Harry Potter series.  Without spoiling the book, it manages to take the secrets from all the previous novels and tie everything together in a nice, neat package.  Don't wait for the movie to come out on this one!
 I personally adore this set. I just received it today and it is stunning. I know there are many reviews where people are upset because they thought the trunk would be made of real wood. Although that would have been awesome, I read the reviews before purchasing this product so I knew it was cardboard. The set is perfect for me because I did not already have the books. For those of you who want to purchase this solely for the trunk DON'T do it. It is made of cardboard although it feels like fairly sturdy cardboard. It arrived in perfect condition and was packaged very well in a nice thick box. There was no damage and every book looks flawless. For someone who is looking for a good series to read I would say this is a must have. If you do not have the books already you should buy this set. If you already have them do not purchase this set for the cardboard trunk. I would have been very upset if I was expecting a wood trunk and got a cardboard one. These books are basically for people who do not already have the books. I am very pleased with this purchase and it was well worth the money. The hardcover copies will last for years!
 Harry Potter is the most entertaining literary series of our time. But I haven't touched Harry Potter in around eight years; having felt that I had outgrown the series, I lost interest and sold my books not long after finishing Book 7, The Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>I saw this on Amazon's home page for $15 (WOW) and immediately purchased it. Getting a digital copy at that price is enough to dispel any misgivings about Harry Potter being dorky or for children. It's an amazing price for some incredible entertainment and childhood nostalgia. I'm glad I made the purchase: Harry Potter is even better than the childhood-me remembered.<br/><br/>Harry Potter: The Complete Collection includes the seven Harry Potter books in one well-formatted file. I am quite disappointed to see that the $15 price tag was only temporary. There's absolutely no way I would have purchased this eBook at the current price.
 This book was not only gripping but it was a fitting conclusion to a series I have read with much enjoyment.  Not only does J.K. Rowling invent wonderful characters and stories, but she writes extremely well.  I am satisied with the end--although I wish I could read more!
 second time I've purchased this product.  First one was lent out and never returned and I like it so much I wanted to buy another so that I will always have it on hand.  I would warn buyers however, if you are buying this book for someone 13yrs or younger you may want to make sure to talk to them about it.  It is alot more dark and complex than the books early in the series.
 Fans have to read it whether they think it will be good or not...you know, the addiction thing. But it's worth it. Wish it wasn't over...
 ITEM ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.
 Wow! I loved listening to the very last Harry Potter book on CD! Jim Dale, the narrator is an actor and a wonderful voice artist as well. So enjoyable was this, that I plan to eventually acquire all of the Harry Potter books on CD. Amazon, as usual, seems to have the best price around.
 I can't say enough on how awesome this book series is. My 10yr old son read the first one and just loved it. So I got him this second book and he is just so into reading it. A beautiful combination of exhilarating pictures and an exciting story line as we already know have made reading so interesting for my son. He takes it to school to read on his own and it's so popular amongst his classmates they actually look over his shoulder and read along quietly. Both of his teaches RAVE about this book and it's all I can do as well. The only bad thing about these books is the third book in the series doesn't come out for another year. People, these two books are worth every penny and will last for every one of your kids. 6 out of 5 stars for me. Simply amazing. Oh and a little about me...I am just another Amazon user. I do not review often. This is an honest and pure review. I can't wait for him to get the third next October.
 Great product
 It's the best price for the 7 books (Hard cover). Books are really good and stylish. The box, however, it's made with cheap material. It looks very nice though.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you are purchasing this set just for the books, it is your best bet. If you are purchasing this for the case, you will be a little dissapointed, not for the looks but for the material.
 My Granddaughter found the set really great.
 What can you say?  HP
 Even better the second time! My 7 year old son and I read it side-by-side.  So fun to share the magic of Harry Potter with him!
 The Harry Potter Series were all great, this the final one was<br/>good, not the ending I expected. I feel it could have been better.<br/>I would recomend this book to every one who liked magical stories.<br/>The Auther is great and I hope She will continue writing books.
 Though the price is nice, the packaging is not.  Very flimsy and low quality.  Plastic latch will break easily if not careful.  The books themselves are wrapped, but the box will deteriorate after time if it is not treated well.  Would have been five stars if not for the packaging.
 I own all the paper versions of Harry Potter and read them all.  Recently, bought all the Kindle versions and re-reading them again.  Up to the 3rd book. The Kindle versions are fantastic.  So nice to have all seven books in a small device.  Plus I have to add, I love the movies, but I think the book versions are far better.  Lots of "happenings" not included in the movies and the movies changed events to suit time and flow.  Kindle versions, very much worth the money.
 I bought this book to add to my collection of the Harry Potter series.  I haven't read it yet but I intend to soon.  But I wanted to have it so that my Grandchildren could read all of them.  I think that she has done a marvelous job of interesting children and adults to "enjoy" reading!
 I'm 79 and I LOVED this book. My only regret is that there are no more. So sad!I read all of her series and am amazed that she kept the interest going in all seven books.My guess is those who don't like the books, haven't read them! Good did triumph over evil, and life goes on.
 I got this set of Harry Potter books over the European ones, as it is simply the best one - printing quality and design wise. I always prefer hardcover versions and this edition is the one fitting the best the universe created by J.K. Rowling. I did not really need the box it came in though, however, it was cheaper than buying each book separately and it is an added protection for the books if you don't transfer them in your shelves, as well as a nice collection item for fans and children.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this hardcover edition - I think the quality of the printing, the fact it is hardcover, the choice of paper and some other elements add to the pleasure of reading and you will like discovering or rediscovering the Harry Potter edition through this set of books.
 These books are just wonderful.  I have read all of them, the story line, everything about them is wonderful.  Great read.
 Still a little upset she killed Hedrig the owl so early but applaud the way she tied every character into a nice neat ending. Bravo.MRS
 Harry Potter isn't for everyone. Harry Potter isn't the best book series ever written. But it is a good read, and that's all anyone can really ask for. This final volume has some very exciting and interesting parts, but loses points for dragging in several chapters, even though that dragging is understandable and kind of necessary to the plot. Fans will love or hate how the series ends, depending upon their personal preferences. I thought everything was wrapped up well enough.
 A very exciting end to a superb series.<br/>It was like desert to an excellent meal.<br/>Hope J. R. Rowlings will write more in the future.
 After resisting reading the books for years, i finally gave in. i was immediately hooked. the voice characterizations are wonderful and familiar across the entire series. this final audio production did the story justice. it is a wonderful and redemptive story, and it was a joy to walk with Harry from the beginning through to the very last word.
 This was a fantastic ending to an amazing story. Yet, Jim Dale still manages to elevate this story with uncanny knack for voices and incredible skill at telling a story. I have listened to other Audiobooks and there is no comparison to Jim Dale. Over the course of the 7 books, his voices for the kids in the books have aged along with the kids. Cannot praise his work enough.
 My daughter loved this item, it will give her monthes of reading pleasure. She was so surprised!  The only drawback was that it was delivered in a box that said Harry Potter Books on the outside!  Luckily I was the one home when the delivery was made.  I can tell you that I was upstet about that!
 The "Luggage" box is nothin like what it seems.  It's very cheap cardboard and was already split down both of the front corners of the lid when we unwrapped it.  There is no checker-pattern on the inside of the lid...it's not colored at all.  The biggest appeal of buying a "Boxed Set" was to have the box, and it didn't last through manufacturing/shipping.  If you are considering as a gift, I'd keep looking.
 Daughter loves the collection
 Enjoyed the CD very much even though I had read the book.  Heard things I missed in the reading.  Miss listening to it now.
 As reviews for all box sets (regardless of publishers) are lumped together, I thought to give feedback on the Scholastic Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7) which I just received today. A review on the story content has received enough coverage so I will only focus on the quality of the box and book quality. The box overall is sturdy enough and acceptable (even though there was a little dent at one corner but that's a delivery issue). However, I am disappointed by the quality of the paper and the small font size, which is surprising for a set targeted at children.<br/><br/>I compared the quality of this set to that of a borrowed book that was published by Bloomsbury and the latter was much better on both paper quality and font size so I would recommend that set instead, which I think has a similar cost in Amazon UK. I lived outside US so I am not going to bother returning this set but if I would have if I reside there.
 Arrived today.<br/><br/>First of all I will say I have seen the films, but only decided to read the books this year. After being given a paperback I read it and loved it, and decided I would read them all.<br/><br/>So the hardbacks cost 50$ AUD each in Australia (thats 45$ usd at current exchange rate). The math is simple enough $50 x 7 = 350$. Thankfully this box set retails for 275$ in Australian book stores. This makes it value purchase if your wanting all 7 books (all with matching covers no less). Now this is where it gets good , amazon sold this for $116.99 usd + 11.98 postage to Australia which is about what 3 of hardbacks cost here. 7 books! for the price of 3 and they even came in a box to store them in.<br/><br/>I can't wait to read them. The books themselves seem very high quality compared to other hardbacks I own. I do feel bad for the people that bought this for the wrong reasons. All i know is got the complete set of books for well under half the price of buying them in Australia seperately (The paperbacks would have costed me the same price here as this set). I highly recommend this to anyone who wants the set in hardbacks it's a bargain.<br/><br/>If you allready own all 7 hardbacks then I would not recommend buying this just for the box.<br/><br/>Buy it for the books.
 Great book 2! Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok. Great second book
 Very pleased
 JK Rowling does it again.  An enlightening story of a young man's struggle with his higher calling and his perception of his reality.
 It's my fault for not reading the description more carefully -- I was so excited to give this to my daughter for Christmas that I overlooked the fact that the box was cardboard and not wood.  It's an incredibly cheap cardboard box, at that.  It was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>This would have been so much better if it was made out of wood, and could be a true heirloom.<br/><br/>We already had at least two copies of each book, but I bought this with the idea that it would be something my daughter could keep forever and pass along to her kids.  Not so.  The cardboard will start to tear and separate just as a result of removing the books from time to time.
 The book is amazing. Don't hesitate. You'll love it!
 I am a Harry Potter fan, so this to me is a wonderful book.  Now I am not just saying that because I am a fan, it is very well written, just as the others are.  I will not go into the story, I don't think that is fair but the storyline and characters in this book are great, a very good all round read.
 If your looking to read Harry Potter or re read the series this is a good way to pick up all the books in the series at once. The price point is really affordable. Reading these on hard cover makes it really enjoyable. I highly recommend this set for yourself or as a gift. Recently got a pass to Universal Studios Hollywood and I am stoked on the who world of HP.
 Originally read as e-books, but wanted physical books to display with my Funko Pops, nice looking box set, and decide to read again.
 Loved this book
 This book is the best of the series. I picked up the book and could not put it down till I was finished. There were so many exciting moments in the book that even out the slower parts. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a fun, adventurous and amusing tales.
 problems with shipping; not actually a set.
 About what I expected.  The reader is very talented although I could have enjoyed it as much if he didn't try to do voices for each character.  Having seen the movies I already have an idea what each of the major characters sounds like.  A straight reading would have been preferable.
 Over the course of the last four months I have been reading the entire Harry Potter collection. I can say with absolute certainty that this series of books are going to go down in history as one of the greatest literary works of all time!<br/><br/>Every character was brought to life vividly by Ms. Rowling, baring none. The descriptions of the people and places, as the story of Harry’s adventure continued, were carefully thought out and precisely written and I found that I could identify with many of the inhabitants of the wizarding world.<br/>Much the same as Harry made observations while under his invisibility cloak, I felt many times that I was right there with Harry as his journey progressed. A sensation that is very uncommon in books I have read in the past.<br/><br/>I was there when Harry was lonely in his room under the stairs.<br/><br/>I was angry when the Dursley’s were cruel and unkind to Harry.<br/><br/>I was excited when Harry made the Quidditch team in his first year.<br/><br/>I believe everyone knows what it’s like to be bullied. Harry suffers greatly at the hands of Professor Snape, the Malfoy family, The Ministry of Magic, the Death Eaters, the Dementors, hosts of other villains too numerous to mention, and ultimately Lord Voldemort.<br/>Through it all Harry retains a nobility that inspires others to endure adversity and come out the other end a better and stronger person.<br/><br/>I felt grief as Harry lost loved ones to Voldemort’s progression to power.<br/><br/>I felt joy when Harry had brief instances when he got to be a normal teenager doing normal teenage things.<br/><br/>I was right there beside him as he walked into the dark forest with his parents, Professor Lupin, Tonks and Remus, and his god father Serious Black to lay down his life in the hopes of destroying Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>At the story’s end I found myself suffering a sense of loss as all the characters I have come to know over the past four months moved on to meet their destinies. It was like saying good bye to an old and dear friend that you’ll never get to see again. I believe that is the quintessential mark of a good book.<br/><br/>I have only one regret about reading the Harry Potter series. That it is very likely that Ms. Rowling, myself and the circles of our lives will never cross and I will be unable to say what a joy it has been to read her work personally.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>R.W. Belew Sr.<br/>Author
 A super conclusion to the Harry Potter series.  If you've read the first 6 you don't need me to tell you to read this one.  If you haven't read the first six, get cracking!!!
 WE liked the extra book
 JK Rowling didn't disappoint, I hope she writes more fun books for us to read.  I loved the controversy as well, makes people think and question their own thinking, made my beliefs stronger.
 Thanks, good item. Exactly what you would expect.
 What a great way to end one of this generations greatest series.  J.K. brings all of the threads together and finishes the Harry Potter saga with a flourish that will appease all fans.  Thank You for 10 great years of reading and many future rereading to come.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows more than lives up to expectations as the final denoument of the Harry Potter epic. Complex and skilfully written, J.K.Rowling delves into the (now beloved) characters as we have not seen before, revealing depth, inner angst, confusion and courage as Harry and his friends are thrown into the storm-of-the-century of good versus evil. Casting themselves adrift from the safety and comfort of Hogwarts and their teachers and mentors, Harry, Hermione and Ron must struggle with their own demons as they search for the seven Horcruxes. This turns out to be like looking for a black cat on a dark night, as even Harry has little idea of where to go or what to look for. Compounding their dilemma is the idea of the three Deathly Hallows--should Harry be looking for Hallows or the Horcruxes? Which will ultimately lead to the defeat of the Dark Lord?<br/>J.K.Rowling's masterful use of this complex journey in the unfolding of the Harry Potter climax is riveting. The care and sensitivity she uses in creating the inner journeys of the Harry, Ron and Hermione allows us to feel the uncertainty, the pain, fear and self-doubt they experience as they are tested again and again as the Dark Lord's circle of power tightens around them. This is a book worth re-reading several times, to truly mine the depths begun and nurtured throughout the entire series.<br/><br/>Meredith Kennedy, Author of 'The Red Jacket.'
 also this box set does not come with a House Elf....
 I love the Harry Potter Series. JK Rowling created a world for me to escape to, and I'm thankful for that. Harry Potter is good for the soul. I recomend that you buy this product, however the box is only made of cardboard. So if you already have all 7 books in hardback, you don't really need this. The case will still be fun to display, especially if you have other Harry Potter merchandise. It even comes with stickers!
 A wonderful story. Sit back and enjoy.
 With all the hype and hysteria surrounding this book, I really expected it to be a disappointment.  It wasn't.  I'm a fan of the books and movies (although I'm not a freaky, dress up in character, kind of fan), and I've enjoyed most of them.  The darker the story got, however, the less I enjoyed it.  I expected this one to be pretty dark, and it was in spots, but it certainly redeemed itself.  I enjoyed it tremendously.
 I will never read this series too many times, I never get tired of it.<br/>To quote the book: "after all this time?"<br/>"Always."
 Ah, closure.  This was a good book and J.K.R. finished it well.  The story slowed a bit towards the middle of the book and too many one-off characters were popping up everywhere but once the three amigos set off the action picks up steam.  I would have no issues recommending this book to the reader.  It is quite worth the price.<br/><br/>And as for the Epilogue, I am of the opinion that it was JUST PERFECT.  It aptly closes the series and gives us just a quick glimpse of what the world will be like and how the actions of those who did what they did leave an impact on us all.
 I ordered this book set for my kids to read to get AR points in school and didnt wanna spend a bunch of money buying them new. I ordered them and they were used and the looked like new! The only thing was there was a small personal dedication in the first book, but really, who cares. We're gonna read the books, not try to figure out who owened them. I was SHOCKED at what great condition they were in. Thanks!
 I love these books. I can read them over and over again. I never get tired of them. Good read.
 Excellent story! I couldn't put it down! The book arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.
 nice for h.p. fans to have all the books collected in a nice box (not made in wood, mind you). the box is well done and creates quite an atmosphere of magic. the printings of the books are very nice to read. the books themselves are simply fantastic (as anyone who's been reading h.p. books knows).<br/>only one thing: in the box there should be also "quidditch through the ages" and "fantastic beasts and where to find them". just to complete!
 I have read the AMAZING Harry Potter books before, but I wanted my own copies, so I got this set. I decided to use the 4th book for a project for school, and got mostly done, all the way to page 466, and then it skips 59 pages! It goes straight to 515! I decided to just keep reading, and then, when I got to page 562, it goes back to 515!!!! Also, I read in many reviews that it came with a top, lock, bookends AND handles. I did not get any of those.<br/>I am very disappointed and wish that I could read some of my favorite books
 A wonderful gift for persons of any age - Harry Potter opens up a new world of imagination similar to Narnia in the depth of the characters and world itself.
 All of the Harry Potter are great but this brought everything together. Great end to an awesome series. Great job J.R. Rowling for entertaining us all if these years
 I was pleased with my purchase of the set; I have started the first in the series and look forward to pleasurable reading in the future with the rest of the set!
 I won't comment on the plot of the story, everybody knows that this book have become favourite for all kids and not only around the world (including me). So that leaves me with the item as an item<br/><br/>I live in Greece, but because I was impatient, I couldn't wait six months to be translated to Greece, so I bought it from here, when the book arrived, I never expected such book, it was hardcover and had this nice cover art-like of Harry Potter, I seriously loved the whole book exterior.<br/><br/>As about the plot, what can someone say for Harry Potter? (Absolutely fascinating plot)
 Great book.
 This much awaited Harry Potter book was delivered on the releasing day itself, inspite of the fact that I had asked for regular shipping. Another wonder from JKR, the book's a must have and a must read. It has reinforced my faith in JKR and my love for the wizarding world! I am sure all HP fans will agree wholeheartedly.
 I briefly scanned over the bad reviews, and I do not understand what these people were expecting? It is a fictional story! This book was just as good as all the others in the series. I loved the "epilogue". It was heart warming to, finally, see Harry find happiness.<br/><br/>To address the reviewer who says Rowling is not much of an author, well her books have sold millions and all have been made into major Hollywood films. Not many authors can make claim to that.<br/><br/>I will buy anything Rowling produces in the future. I hope she will continue to write. Someone with her passion cannot stop now. That would be cheating her fans.<br/><br/>I look forward to some day reading the Harry Potter books to my grandchildren.<br/><br/>If you do not yet own all the Harry Potter books, I strongly advise you get the whole series. You will truly enjoy it.
 So much has been written about Harry that I'm not even going to try. This set, however, is another matter. It's great to have the first five books all in one box, lined up on the shelf, all one size, and in complementary colors. THey're bound well, and the illustrations are terrific.
 It was worth the wait.  Despite misgivings because of the ending of book six, I dove into book seven with ravenous hunger.  To my delight, Ms. Rowling told an exceptional story.  Loose ends were neatly tied off and the pages seemed to turn themselves as if I were in the library at Hogwarts.  A must must read, even if you reviled the name of J.K. Rowling after book sis.  She's acquited herself very nicely indeed.
 I purchased this multi-volume set for two foreign siblings who are learning English.  I was able to give them several of the Harry Potter books at a relatively low cost.  As the books are classics, it is probably better to own them in hardback, but this set can bring the joy of reading to these kids without breaking the bank.
 This set was so cool! Opening it up and see the books was magical with how cool the case is. My wife opened this on Christmas and was so excited to see how cool the it all looked right down to the cool latch on the front. If you are not piecing together a set and want a great set to display on your bookshelf this is the way to go. Tilted it up on the top row with it held open displaying the books looks awesome.<br/>I must recommend the bookmarks that are diecast metal crest for each house plus the school’s crest. They are a perfect pairing for any Harry Potter enthusiast.
 The Treasure chest is not a durable product. It's made of cardboard and can break easily. The books on the other hand are perfect. This item was a gift to a teen and he loved it. More thought should have gone in to the durability of the treasure chest as it is supposed to be a collector series. It's a shame they didn't do a more sturdy item for the die hard fans. They knew it would be bought regardless and took advantage of the fans. Too bad for the fans but they are making a fortune on these.
 JK Rolling has a gift. That's the best collection I've ever read. I've read all the books before purchasing this collection. But I've decided that I should have them all. The box is extremely beautiful and every book seems to be made with special care for the readers. It's worth every cent.
 Great illustration
 My daughter was thrilled with it
 This, the second book in the Harry Potter series, is better than the first, but not as good as the others. But that is just my opinion. In this book, Harry is beginning to wonder if he belongs at Hogwarts after a series of unfortunate events. I won't say anything else, exept that the series is a must read.
 This was a wonderful conclusion to harry Potters adventure in Hogwarts. Everything was tied in nicely and it was a happy ending. I will miss this series greatly and I hope Ms. Rowling finds it in her heart to write more Hogwarts adventures even though Harry has grown up.
 I did not read this but bought it as a gift.  I am sure it is a good read since all of her books are enjoyed by millions.
 The Deathly Hallows was everything I anticipated and more.  The story picks up after the dramatic climax of "The Half-Blood Prince" and hits the ground running.  Will Harry or Voldemort survive?  Did Dumbledore misplace his trust in Snape?  Who else will die?  All these questions and more are answered in this amazing conclusion to the Harry Potter series.  Ms. Rowling has saved her best for last and her personal evolution in her craft has never been more apparent.  This book is a necessity for anyone with the slightest interest in Harry Potter.
 Re-read and re-listened.  Have now shared the series with nieces and nephews.
 As expected
 Hello,<br/><br/>I brought this Harry Potter book collection for my son who had read his older books to peices and he was so thrilled with the way the collection is presented.<br/><br/>To buy these books individually would of been time consuming to search for decent price....the price with postage was excellent and postage to Australia fast.<br/><br/>This is the perfect collection for the Harry Potter fan my son says bring on book 7,lol
 The Harry Potter series - got to do it no matter how long it takes - start now and stay with it.
 One of my favorite Hary Potter books, number 7, has a darker feel throughout the book as the conflict between Voltemort and Harry climaxes for the final book in the series. It is the longest book, but it is filled with wonderful imagery and character development by J.K. Rowling- a must read!
 After reading the other 6, this one fell a little flat. Gone was the humor that ran through the others. Missing was the epic battle at the end (I really felt the end battle was lame and a let down). And the epilogue at the end? Didn't really tie things up for me or leave me feeling satisfied. After so many years following these characters and growing to love them, this was just a let down. Still good-but had I started with this one I wouldn't have been impressed with the storyline or the writing.
 Nothing new to say about the quality of the books or its edition, which have quite good appearance, with beautiful covers and "illustrations".<br/><br/>About this box, the "bad" thing is that is made of folded cardboard which means that it has some bad edges an can even be unfolded. It also seems risky to lift it by the handles, because it is a lot of weight for that not-so-thick cardboard. The locker is both quite a good idea, but slightly hard to close when the box is full.<br/><br/>EXTRAS. If you already have the books, DON'T buy this, because it has no extras, except for a few stickers for the box, nothing interesting.<br/><br/>My piece of advise: Don't buy this for the box but for the books
 I enjoyed this final installment except I felt it lacked genuine emotion amongst the characters.  J.K. didn't spend much time allowing them (and the reader)  to "feel" after important and extremely emotional events occurred.  I felt she rushed through those particular happenings and concentrated more on the battles.  I didn't have any time to mourn or celebrate, which would have made the book so much more satisfying!!<br/><br/>At times I got confused because so many names were being thrown around from the last book.  Reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is highly recommended  right before reading this final book so you're able to keep track of some of the newer characters.  If you haven't read any of the past books, you will be totally lost,  although I think most readers understand that.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I wished the final chapter had been more current and I felt like I'd missed so much of  what I'd been hoping to experience between the characters.
 This was a perfect final chapter for this series.  Rowlings wrapped up all the loose ends, answered open questions and tied the plot up tidily.  After finishing the book, I felt closure for all.  Very enjoyable.  But don't read it if you haven't read the other six!
 The books and box are as expected.  It was cheaper to buy the whole set than individual books and it is nice to have the cardboard box to store them in.<br/><br/>The edges of the book binding did get rubbed and loose some color from being carried around so I protect the books a little more now.  But they are paper backs so I didn't expect them to handle much abuse.<br/><br/>In general it is a good purchase for anyone wanting to read the whole Harry Potter collection.
 I bought this for a friend, but I read some of the series as well. I really enjoyed the depth created in this world of Potter. I'm sure a lot of fans of this mega series would agree that it was a fun ride.
 Loved it all! It’s all in great condition!!
 Of course it was a great book, I read it with my kids and enjoyed it a lot. Wonderful series for youth for 5th grade and up.
 what's to say..harry is a fantastic read..all of his have never disappointed.  We share our books with others and everyone loved this one.  I hate to see an end but I guess it's time.  Bye Harry..you'll be missed :)
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a><br/><br/>Very Good Book! I loved it!! Recommended!
 Such an enjoyable read. A great story well written. I could read it again one hundred times. Can't wait to read the next.
 For those with a busy life and or much time traveling. We have book parties with the grandchildren. More than one has picked up a book after listening,
 JK Rowling managed to end the series in a way that tied up all loose endings.  It's amazing when you look back on the entire series how tightly everything fit together.  The middle of the book was a bit slow but the action-packed beginning and ending more than made up for it.  It's sad to say goodbye to Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Ginny, Hogwarts etc...
 I love harry potter it is my 3 rd time reading the series i also watched all the movies i love them
 The 7th and final installment of the Harry Potter series lives up to what I've come to expect from Rowling.  It is exciting, touching, and filled with suspense until the very end.  As with most Potter fans, I am sad at the close of this phenomenal series, but I have not been disappointed.  I look forward with anticipation to Rowling's next literary venture.
 A great value!!  We saw the exact same set at Target and was much more.  I have just finished the first book...I could not put it down.  As an adult reading the books I can see how children and adults are hooked on them.
 I purchased this book, Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, for my grandson's birthday. He was so happy he kept it in his arms while opening his other presents and he was 17 on his birthday!! He simply could not believe he got the book. Thanks Amazon for your help. Elsie
 This selection was just about perfect from timeliness of service to packaging to being as represented. I had read the book but the Jim Dale recording added life and interest to the story and the characters. The vendor shipped promptly and the title was indeed like new. I enjoyed the title and the service and will certainly buy from this vendor again when a title I want is offered.
 I will always buy any book he wants as reading is so fundamental.  He loves the Harry Potter series and Amazon is the only place I buy.
 Probably my 10 th time reading it since my first time 13years ago and I still love it just as much
 A great ending to the series. The middle of the book repeats the same story line several times over, but the ending is great.
 I just wanted to say that it was excellent that the book was delivered on the day of release!  what a great thing.  I didn't have ot spend the money and taxes to get the book a minute after midnight.<br/>great value
 Kids love it
 good book
 Great book! Very well written, great end to the series, leaves the reader satisfied. I got into this series through the movies - constantly had friends telling me to read the books and I'm glad I did! If you like the movies the books give you further dimensions into the world, much more immersive and gives you deeper looks into the worlds of house elves, the other members of the Order of the Phoenix as well as classmates like Neville, Luna, and many others. Also, if you enjoy this series, I also highly recommend the audiobook versions read completely unabridged by Jim Dale. He has a distinct and consistent voice for every character and it is amazing to listen to. I have heard good reviews for the Stephen Fry readings but have yet to listen to them. Seems to be that Brits tend to prefer Stephen Fry while the American audience leans toward Jim Dale. Ironically both readers are British; go figure, haha.
 In this installation Ron Weasley finds the source of the ticking... *spoiler alert* it is, in fact, a pipe bomb.
 Awesome.  What will I find to read now?  J.K. Rowling writes yet another great tale and manages to collect all the danglers by the last page.
 Jim Dale is a master.  The different voices he uses are amazing.  It's like listening to a full stage production of the book.
 I'm absolutelly delighted of the seven and final book. It gives all the answers of the previous books, has very good action, has some loses and overall is a worthy final of the previous six books. I hope Rowling will return in some years with another fascinating story. Very good indeed!
 Anything Harry Potter is wonderful.
 Beautiful illustrations.
 Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed.  Also, I preorder this book from Amazon, and received it the same day it went on sale!
 While the books themselves are amazing, I was not totally happy with this set. I love the new cover art and box art, which is the main reason I bought it. I didn't have a complete matching set of books for the Harry Potter series, and I really wanted one cohesive set.<br/><br/>The downside to this set is that the books were packed in so tight to the collectors box that they were very hard to get out and now that I have taken them out I cannot get them all back in! I can't manage to squeeze a 7th book in there. If only the box was just a tiny bit wider, it would not be such a tight fit. So now I have book 1 sitting on top of the box with #2-7 in there.
 I am heartbroken that the series is over. The Harry Potter Series was my childhood. This book, along with the rest of the series, is a MUST READ! I read this series over and over and it never gets old. No other book could ever live up to this series in my opinion.
 The books are wonderful. Since I only own book one in paperback and book four in hardcover this was a relatively inexpensive way to get all of the books, and in hardcovers no less!<br/><br/>I'd have to say that the big problem everyone has with the box isn't that it's a rip off so much as... it wasn't what they were expecting. When you see something nice in your minds eye.. and it doesn't turn out that way, it leads to a great deal of disappointment, even if getting the books is wonderful. I know I was disappointed. I really was expecting more.<br/><br/>But, I got my books and for that I'm satisfied.
 so many pages we've traveled this journey.  what this few more.<br/>It's quite alot.  It's a powerful journey.<br/>I won't lie to you, there are a few pacing issues.  There are a few times where it speeds up only to suddenly stop.  But you do have this feeling like there there is a constant threat available, something missing from book six.<br/>I really don't need to be reviewing this,  if you've read book six you know you want to read this one.  ya'll are probaly reading this expecting to hear if it's any good, if your a fan yes.  nif your not, why are you reading this review?
 Love all the harry potter books
 I bought what I thought was the picture shown of the boxed set. What I got were the books and a cardboard case. No trunk with the HP emblem. When I tried to connect directly with the seller, he said I would have to pay the shipping cost (20.00), possible extra fees, and if the seller thought the books came back in any kind of different condition, he would decide how much money will be deducted from the return. Basically, it was a no win and lesson learned experience. That's when I took the case to Amazon. They basically made him do the return to make me feel like a satisfied customer. Amazon returned all my bonus points and the seller gave in. I ended up buying the set from Scholastic for 80.00. Still got stuck with the shipping cost but Amazon was wonderful and the books I purchased from scholastic were top notch!
 Amazing!
 JK Rowling delivered more than what was expected. The book was a fitting finale to this well-loved and popular series. The only thing that is disappointing is that this is the last book of the series, no more looking forward for the next book (that was half of the fun, the anticipation!). I hope she'll be back soon with new books, she really is a great author.
 I enjoyed the book very much, and think she has ended at the right time,not drawing the story out so that your not wanting more . So many Authers keep writing until they leave you with an Oh no not another one! feeling , this leaves you with , I wish it had gone on just a little longer !.  One of the best !!!.
 I love Harry Potter. If you are not a regular reader reform your ways with the Harry Potter series. This one is a really great book within the series.
 "All the past Harry Potter books in the paper back spine, which are much easier to handle while reading, for an extremely affordable price, have to give respect for that."  Says the man with an average to below average paycheck. A+ Transaction.
 Loved the whole series wished it went on longer.  Happy that this series got more people reading.  Highly recommend yo everyone
 I only spent $30.00 plus S&amp;S but I have already read them all now once and am working on a second time. I currently have 2 books rented out to friends. I have orded the set with them in hard cover and a nice box but I wanted a set that I could through into a suitcase and take with me when I travel or to lend to friends without being to scared of what kind of condition they would return home in. This was a fantastic purchase for me
 Once again J.K. Rowling wove her spell and produced the final chapter in Harry's life.  Harry learns valuable lessons of friendship and trusting in yourself and your destiny to over come the biggest obsticle we all face, death.  The book held my interest throughout and was hard to put down (even though my son was anxiously waiting for me to finish reading it so that he could read it also).  This book is a definite "must read" for all readers.
 Great collection at a reasonable price
 Excellent shape CDs and greatest price!
 ****SPOILERS****<br/>This is an interesting book but its ok.<br/>Bad and sad points:<br/>1.There were some interesting things in here.Ginny being possessed?<br/>2.GINNY LIKING HARRY?I really dont like Ginny.No offense Bonnie Wright.In my loving opinion Hermione should have had a brother or sister so either Ron or Ginny could like one.<br/>3.Why do Ron and Hermione always fight?<br/>Good points:<br/>1.Hagrid is very funny.<br/>2.Hermione and Ron stick with Harry until the END.<br/>3.I like Moaning Myrtle.She is funny.<br/><br/>  I think 4 stars are good****
 while I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones it was still a great read. It was a more adult book than the earlier ones with more violence. The author rounded up the futures of the principles in the book to give the readers a glimpse of where they went but it was very brief. I haven't looked forward to a book so much in 30 years and I don't think you will be disappointed. I highly recommend
 What else can one say that has not already been said. Good price from Amazon. Book neatly ties up all loose ends !  Very hard to put down once you start !
 Of course, everyone who loves this series probably already owns all of the books and even in hardback form. So, how about for a few dollars more, offering the trunk in a classier material than cardboard!? Even a plastic would have been nicer or how about a thin veneer? I am disappointed and wish I had waited to order this set before I read the reviews. We already have the whole set and now we have 2 sets and a cardboard box. Boo
 I couldn't wait to get through the pages of this, the final book.  Wonderfully written, humorous and dreadfully sad in the same wonderful package.  A true classic and a series everyone should read.
 so far so good
 This book was said to be with some wear and tear, and maybe the box that holds them did have a little wear but the books looked like they had never been out of the box let alone read :) LOVE IT!
 Once again,very entertaining..this last book to the sequel is just as good as the previous six! I finished book 6 w/ so many questions and this book answered them all and then some. Wonderful and sad all at the same time. Hate to see J.K. Rowling wrapping up the story,but very pleased w/ this book! Happy Reading....hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!
 It was an absoloutly wonderful buy. I sat and read the first 6 books within 4 days. I couldnt put them down, the writing is bewtiching and you fill so close to the characters so that when things effect the characters you feel as if its happing to you. I havent read books so good in a long time. This is absoultly worth buying. In fact i plan on rereading the books again. I was absoultly thrilled with the set.
 Loved it.
 I enjoyed this book and do not want to give the impression that I did not - but this series has slowly switched genres.<br/><br/>The writing in each sequel is deeper, perhaps even better - that should be good.<br/><br/>But I miss the lightheartedness of the beginning of the series.
 but i was so happy that i did buy it and read it in order. It was so so good..i love Harry Potter I now get the hype.
 Great book, Amazon was great, book arrived as promised and for a lot less than the local retailers.  Great job Amazon.
 Appsolutely enjoyed the books and the narration by Jim Dale is great.  If you enjoyed reading the books, the audio version is just as enjoyable; especially on a long road trip.
 Again, J.K. Rowling has led me into the wondrous world of wizardry in a thouroughly wonderful way. I felt weightlessly transported right into the magical milieu of Harry, Hermione, Ron and all the other colorful characters and personalities of Hogwarts as if I were right amongst them sharing all of their awesome adventures.<br/>This generation of readers is fortunate to have Ms. Rowling to lead them into the realm of reading in such a compelling manner.
 This book was to be released on a Sat. however eveyone said, oh you will not get it until Monday because it just came out. I got my book on the Sat. that it was released, I was so surprised and grateful, I told my grandson it would not be there until monday and when I told him he came to my house on Sat. he got his dad to bring him to getit on that Sat.what good work and thanks a million
 This will forever be a classic!
 My set came nicely packed in a durable matching display box, which I particularly liked. I had read the books at my library, but I wanted them for my personal library of favorite books which I re-read often. I am very glad to have found this set and I am looking forward to the last book when it comes in. I am happy to be able to have this order reserved for me, as I am about 75 miles from a book store.<br/><br/>Bessie Shryer
 I wanted the entire Harry Potter boxed set, and I'm pretty happy with this.  The only negative is that I was hoping the box would be a bit more sturdy and "nice looking".  It is just a cheap cardboard box with graphics/illustrations.  But, atleast it has all the hard-cover Harry Potter books which is nice.  I would recommend this, but dont think you're getting a "fancy" box/chest.
 not my favorite hp book simply because I like the plot line of OotP better.  Amazing though. I am a huge JKR and HP fan.<br/>Lots of love to the series.<br/>Always.
 This was an exciting ending to a great series of books. The adventure that Harry Potter and his friends undertake is so different from the regular course of the books. I really enjoyed reading the book and am sad that the series is over. I was very satisfied with the way that J.K Rowling finished her series.
 I had already read the book twice when my tape came.  I was delighted that I caught on to so many details that I had missed when reading.<br/><br/>I can't really say anything different than anyone else.  It is a terrific book and I loved the audio version.
 She has done it again!  I couldn't imagine there being a better book than HBP, but JKR has done it again!!!  DH is an AMAZING book!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat almost the whole way through.  There is laughter, tears (lots), suspense, the list goes on.  I am so sad to know that the HP ride is actually over.  This movie is going to be killer!  Until then, all we can do is go back to the beginning . . .and start the adventures all over again.  Thanks JKR!
 This is really excellent reading, very entertaining.  I recommend this book to people from middle school to adults.  Read it in two weeks.
 Jim Dale is incredible for the entire series, but he does his best work yet for the climax of the 7 audiobooks. I actually get more out of the audiobook than I do out of reading the book, because I tend to read to fast and end up skimming important details. With the audiobook, I'm listening at a nice even pace, and get everything.<br/><br/>The combination of J.K. Rowling's descriptive writing, and Jim Dales performance can't be beat! :)
 Less than 24 hours after getting it, I'm finished.  I did NOT want to stop reading. I will NOT give away what happens to Harry.  I will not tell what the death count will be. I will say that this book was a phenomenal read. It was a rocking, no holds barred race of amazing adventures.  I laughed and cried my way through this book to an end that was fantastically satisfying.  Rowling outdid herself.  There is no way anyone could be disappointed in this book.
 I got this at a great price. Book is beautiful. I just wish it had a dust jacket, too. That was my only complaint.
 This set is a fun way to get to know/read all of the Harry Potter books. All of the books are hardcover so they are keepsakes that will last many years. The heavy cardboard "trunk" they come in helps keep them organized and is meant to remind you of Harry's trunk that he takes with him each year he attends, "The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry". Various stickers having to do with Harry and "Hogwarts" come with the set, allowing you to decorate the "trunk", which I found to be lots of fun. The books when you read them speak for themselves, of course. This book set is perfect for Harry Potter memorabilia collectors.
 This was definitely the most emotional Harry Potter of them all!  I was reading it from the moment I woke up until the moment my eyes closed every night.  It took me only 3 days to finish because I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next!  It's a real nail-biter!  J.K. Rowling REALLY knows how to write!
 Best series ever
 Definitely one of the best books ever!  It will keep you reading for hours.  I thought this was one of the best books of the series b/c JK keeps you in the dark but slowly reveals more and more clues until the end.  Get it and read it, you won't be disappointed.
 This book was AWESOME!!! Everything I expected and much more! Before reading it I was NOT looking forward to the end of this series, but J.K. Rowling is just incredible.  While this book is darker than the others, and yes, there is some real sadness, there is also complete "closure". Beautifully done. Well worth the wait!
 Love the books, and Jim Dale has read for them all.  The stories come alive, he's an outstanding voice actor.
 High praise from all reviewers including myself so I just wanted to mention if you or anyone else noticed any other "Easter Eggs" in the illustrations besides the obvious differences in the Hogwarts Greenhouses on the end sheets.<br/>Look closely at the bird nest at the top of the chimney on the right side of the greenhouse and you will find other differences in the greenhouse pictures as well, but I won't spoil the thrill of the hunt for you. All of the illustrations are worth a closer look.<br/>I will be ordering more for gifts to my family right now!
 What can I say... J.K. has put her heart and soul into keeping the Harry Potter stories intriguing, thrilling, and personal, and has outdone herself in this anxiously-awaited final segment of this unparalleled series.  I loved it, was more than moved throughout the story of the Deathly Hallows, and feel fully satiated and complete.  Thank you, J.K.... you are truly a master for all ages.
 I loved the movies and the books.
 This was the best book JK has written. As she promised all questions were answered. Although you may not like how many lives are lost in the book, but when there is a war that is what happens. Congratulation JK excellent book.  Enjoy book all you readers.
 It was fun to hear from my hairdresser and her daughter their reaction to my gift of the Harry Potter set for Christmas.  Eyes sparkling hearing that every night since has read several pages and to see her imagination beginning to unfold, her intelligence responding to the wonderful writing and to hear her say how she is imagining what she is reading, she has not seen to movies yet.  I am so glad I thought of it as it gives me pleasure to see little minds unfolding.
 My daughter is 10 and she reads a lot. So she expressed interest in Harry Potter series and this set is the best value for money if you think about North American complete series hardcover editions sold by Amazon (.com and .ca).<br/>Yes, chest is cardboard, but it is as good as cardboard chest can be, and children can care less whether it is "wooden", "genuine" or whatever. They would value the "chest from Hogwarts" part.
 This book is mind-blowingly amazing. Definitely one of the best books i've ever read. It was a fantastic conclusion to the series!
 I would give this book 5 stars because of all the mystery about the attacks that were happening by Ginny.  I have read the first book and the second book, and I loved both of them.  I didn't know I would like the books so much and I think that J.K. Rowling is a great author of the Harry potter series.
 Hubby is a truck driver and has now listened to all 7 of the books on CD. He was very pleased and said that they got him through many miles of highway.
 What an amazing rollercoaster ride.  I read it in two nights, and would have done so in one had my body been willing.  Book 7 is definitely the climax of the series, with the action starting right from the start and never ending.  So many pieces fall together in this book, but it's all done so suspensefully that you don't feel like you are just listening to lots of talk.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Rowling, I'm going to miss this series.  I hope you reconsider and write more about these characters (prior or future generations, for example) down the road.
 These books are a good read for any age.  Each book has a story that reinforces the value of friendship, honor, and love.  Wonderful books.  I wish J.K. Rowling would continue with this series.  The cardboard chest is sturdy and is excellent for storing the series of books.
 After reading many negative reviews about the quality of the "box" that these books come in, I decided to buy this anyway.  Buying each of the books individually comes out to a couple of extra dollars, so this was the most cost effective way to purchase all 7 hardcovers (as of December 2009).  You're essentially getting the box free along with the books, and it makes for a nice present.  Is the box of superior quality?  No.  Was I expecting a handcrafted wooden box to be included free of cost with the books?  No.  People have unrealistic expectations, and I would definitely recommend this as a nice gift as long as you realize that the cardboard box should be recycled at some point while keeping the books.  We just gave this as a present to a 14 year old, and found that the packaging added a nice little boost to the overall "wow factor" when opening the present.  Think of it as extra wrapping paper that makes for a nice presentation.  And remember, it doesn't cost you anything.  Once practicality kicks in, and it's time for the books to live on a shelf, it's easy to break it down and throw it in the recycle bin.  If you want a nice wooden box for the books, then be prepared to pay a premium.  It's nice for "free".
 Beautifully illustrated, perfect for any HP fans.
 Many things were answered in the final book. This is truly a fitting ending for a great story. J.K. Rowling has a true gift that she has shared with the world.<br/><br/>After much speculation, the world finally knows the 'truth'. After going back and rereading the first few books, it becomes apparent that parts of the story were beginning to take shape even from the start. Most people have a difficult time writing even one book, but to write seven and not stray off topic, is absolutely amazing.
 This is the last of a great series of audio books on CD, and the narration by Jim Dale continues to make the characters come alive.  What a great way to enjoy the last of the Harry Potter books.  Make's my daily drive time commute fun and interesting.  If you have listened to the other (6) Harry Potter audio books on CD, this last one in the series is a must.  One of the best of the series, Jim Dale's best effort with dozens of voices.
 Great book :)
 My 23-yo daughter wanted a complete set of HP hardback books for her Birthday.  When I saw this set, I thought she would really like it.  When she saw it she was very excited.  Apparently, she'd seen this boxed set before in a book store, but it was too expensive at the time.  She's now reading through the series again and I have no idea how many times that will make...<br/><br/>Note:  The trunk is not wooden, but cardboard.  I didn't think it would be, but I've seen that complaint in other posts.  The price is still great for the full set of books with a nice Hogwarts themed trunk.
 I actually read the Harry Potter Series to see what they left out of the movies. If you have seen the movies but haven't read the books, I highly recommend reading them. Geared toward a young audience the books can get a bit tedious, but the overall story is well thought out and the main characters are very multi-dimensional.<br/>This particular book was purchased on Amazon and arrived on time and in great condition. I would buy from this retailer again.
 If you are buying this to collect, to store unopened because you think the case will make it valuable someday, or because you already own all the books and just need this because it is so cool, or to ah... maybe collect.... then you will be dissapointed - the case is only cardboard.  Personally, I do not understand all of the negative reviews.  Of course it is cardboard.  Does anybody really need to "Collect" these books?  They are just books.  Books are for reading.<br/><br/>Not owning any of the books, and having waited until this set came out for the express purpose of having all of the books in one set, I have no complaints.  The cardboard box is quite sturdy and does the job.  The books are good quality, of course.  The cardboard exterior box will not detract from the reading experience.  Finally, the price is good.  As for the cardboard case, who cares!<br/><br/>If you are buying this set simply for collecting purposes of any kind, and already own most or all of the books, I would kindly suggest you take some time to re-think what you could do with $120 hard earned dollars.
 I'm quite bummed about the box like most others seem to be.  I honestly was buying it to have a collector's type of item, which only the box could have succeeded in creating.  The books are fine, but the box is cardboard and in my case; very dented cardboard.
 incredible version of a great book!
 I have to admit I was disappointed in the last book of this generally outstanding series. The action was disjointed, Harry's feelings, motives, and actions often failed to ring true (or were inadequately developed), and the last chapter weakened the ending. Sorry to disagree with the majority on this, but I think that when the excitement fades, people will find this last book the least interesting to reread.
 It's that time again! He's back and so is trouble.  Someone has opened up the chamber of secrets and something is turning Mudbloods (people with one unmagical parent and one magical parent) to stone! Great story and  unpredictable ending . Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of  the best books I've ever read!
 These Harry Potter books are great reading for all ages! My granddaughter, daughter, son and myself have read them all!
 I am a Very late comer to Harry Potter!<br/>When everyone in the country was reading the series &amp; becoming totally mesmerized, I felt like it was something I'd never sink my teeth into, or even understand it!<br/>WoW, was I ever wrong LOL. I TOTALLY have fallen in love w/the whole series, the characters and all their adventures and dangers!<br/>It is an excellent read, I see many more years of enjoyment, as I now own the entire series in hard cover and kindle edition.......<br/>Happy Reading!!!!
 I run my own movie theatre and my roommate convinced me that I needed to read the Harry Potter books before the film opens next month.  From the moment I picked it up I was immediately addicted!  The author has a wonderful way of capturing Harry in akward and humorous predicaments (I couldn't help but laugh out loud at some of them!), and her writing style appeals to more than just children (I'm in my mid-twenties).<br/>Now I can't wait for the next book, and I'm even more excited for the movie!!
 Amazing artwork to add to an amazing story.
 As usual, the reader does a magnificant job of being all the characters in this great book.  He brings the story to life.  He made long hours on the road fly by.
 I Congratulate J.K. Rowlings. She did an excellent job in how to end the story. There's a more grown up character and theme: I think that the books grew according to the age of Harry Potter and the prospective reader. And te ending is a very clever and interesting one.
 My husband and I buy the audio version of the Potter series to listen to on our frequent long drives visiting relatives. We love them because a) the stories are so rich you really can listen to them over and over b) Jim Dale delivers a spot on performance that captures the characters and mood every time.  Even if you've read the printed version (I read it cover-to-cover the first weekend) you'll love the audio book.
 I love it so much!! i am so happy
 Love this book. It was a great finish to the series. Turns out the Malfoy's weren't as evil as we thought. ;-)
 It felt a bit rushed, but still held my attention and had a great climax and resolution to the series.
 What an awesome closing to the series!  I didn't want to finish the book because I didn't want the story of Harry to be over, but it is so fantastically written that I couldn't put it down!
 My daughter was very pleased that this set came with all 6 of the books. We thought we would have to buy #6 seperate. A great investment for kids who love HArry Potter. It is encouraging to see them read and not just watch the movies.
 As sad as it is that this is the end of the Harry Potter saga, this was an excellent read. As a matter of fact, I read it so fast the first time that I had to read it again so I could absorb and enjoy it more.<br/><br/>If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll love this book. It has all the laughter, anger, surprise, disappointment and yes, will bring tears to  your eyes. Enjoy!!!
 Surprise, surprise! IT was amazing!!
 a keeper for sure - destined to become a timeless classic - nobody reads Potter like Jim Dale - fantastic
 Simply amazing. Dream came true
 Wow!!!  I originally bought the first book for my dyslexic neice. I fell for this series too.  This ending is powerful.  It is the classic coming of age.  The quintensial good vs. evil.  It marveously paced.  The book pulls together so many questions and ends perfectly.  I started reading and couldn't stop until I read the lst sentence.  If you love this magical world, you won't be disapointed.<br/><br/>Lisa
 My kids loved this!
 Recommend this to everyone!!! Simply magical as the first! Definitely hooked me and I can't wait to read the next.one!
 From my experience, the bulk of people disappointed with Rowling's final book are the hardcore fanshippers.  Some people will be disappointed if they've held on tightly to their dearly loved and yearned for (though perhaps a bit impractical) romantic pairings.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, felt Rowling offered plenty of closure to the series in the way she's always viewed it.  The final book explains all of the reader's unanswered questions, so fear not!<br/><br/>I loved this book.  It is not my favorite of the series, but I am very happy with the outcome.  Such a pity that it's all over now...
 I absolutely love this book!<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling never fails to impress her readers. I have read all the Harry Potter books, and while each of them are thoroughly enjoyable, I must admit that Deathly Hallows is my favorite!<br/><br/>This book is very well written. It is supposed to be Harry's last and final year at Hogwarts, and all the questions that anxious Harry Potter fans have been waiting to know the answer to will be revealed!<br/><br/>* Who is the mysterious R.A.B.?<br/>* Severus Snape- friend or foe?<br/>* Who will live? Who will die?<br/>* And will Voldemort prevail?
 Not much else I can say.  Great end to a great series.  I've loved Harry Potter since the first book came out.
 Any book with the two names of Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling on the front means business. if you are a Harry Potter fan this is just a piece of the great epic of Harry Potter. Join Harry in his second year at Hogwarts. im not gonna reveal anything about the book so that you will go out and read it. if you dont want to buy it go to your local library and borrow it. its just the same. im all about this great story of a simple boy.
 I am so sad the series is over. I just finished Book seven and am still a little depressed that the Harry Potter series is over. I too started reading them to my children and we all have been avid fans ever since. I had to let my two boys read this one first, so I was last in our family to read it. It is a great book. It was exciting, emotional, a little teary and just plain wonderful. What will we read now that "Harry" is over???
 My daughter needed the book to add to her collection of Harry Potter books. She has enjoyed them all including this one.
 This will make a surprise Christmas gift.
 I'm really disappointed with this purchase. It comes in a cardboard box. The part with Harry Potter written on it is cardboard. I spent the extra money to get a keep sake. Cardboard is not a keep sake. It's cheap looking in real life. I'm very sorry I purchased this.
 I started reading Harry Potter books because my daughter wanted to read them. After seeing the movies, I wondered if these books were too scary or too adult for my 8 year old. I was also out of a fresh supply of books to read, but I was not exactly thrilled to be reading Harry Potter. Boy, was I wrong! I read all 7 books as fast as work and family would possibly allow. I bought Deathly Hallows online because my local book store did not have it, and I needed it NOW. While this last book is not my favorite in the magnificent series of stories, I had to know what happened to the characters. Predictable, but a page-turner. If there is another mom out there who has yet to read what your kids are reading: you are missing out!<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Paperback-Box-Set-Books-1-7/dp/0545162076/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)</a>
 I was very excited and pleased to be able to purchase this set, as I am a new Harry Potter fan.  The "suitcase" the books came in was not up to the quality I expected. The books, however, being the most important , will last a lifetime and I will be able to pass them on to my grandchildren.
 We are Harry Potter fans adding Deathly Hollows to our collection of all the books, audio tapes and DVDs of the series!
 Indifferent.  That's how I feel about the ending of the Harry Potter saga. There was no satisfactory ending in my opinion. Yes, there is an ending and it resolves many of the issues at hand AND Rowling does kill off two characters and many more minor characters meet their demise, but the ending had no emotional resonance for Harry (or me). The final battle with Voldemort was anti-climactic. It was just, "We're here...exposition, philosophise, monologue, meaning of death...fire...someone's dead". The whole battle, outside of the talking, took like two paragraphs. How lame is that? And the other deaths don't motivate Harry to go on to this final battle so much as clarify one's allegiances and the other motivates someone else to battle. It would have been more satisfying to me if someone closer to Harry (like Sirius or Dumbledore in previous books) had met their end and we could have been on that emotional journey with him. If someone like Prof. McGonagal, Hagrid, Neville, Ginny, Hermione or Ron had died protecting Harry from Voldemort a sense of honor or redoubling of his efforts to avenge them would have happened and given me a more satisfying ending. I was much more touched by the death of two other characters close to Harry. The first was killed in the escape from Privet Drive when a curse hit this character by mistake. The sudden and senseless death put a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. The second was killed by Beatrix Lestrange while helping Harry escape from the dungeon of the Malfoy Mansion. Both of these characters sacrificed themselves for the greater good of Harry's mission. Their deaths meant Harry could go on. This is what I was looking for in the resolution to this story. Alas, I didn't write the damn thing. The book, on whole, was great except for the last half of the final chapter and I kind of thought the epilogue was a cheat (although I thought the "King's Cross" chapter was unnecessary). I don't know if J.K. Rowling will ever visit this world again. The story of Harry and Voldemort is done. There is no going back. But the wizarding world is still there. Hogwarts still exists as do it's professors and students. Should she decide to return to this world again at some future date, I will be along wand and broomstick in hand.
 Awesome book!
 The price was better than what I could find locally.  It arrived quickly and I was very pleased with it.  I've always been pleased with the service from Amazon.
 Wonderful gift for my grandson!!
 Aswm
 J.K. Rowling has done it.  She successfully completed the series in an exciting and thought provoking way.  There are many profound truths to be explored in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
 I pre-ordered this book and received it immediately upon it's release then proceeded to read it in about 17 consecutive hours.<br/><br/>I have no words to describe this book...at least not anything different than what others have said and are saying.  DON'T read this book until you've read the other six. IF you haven't read these books and have only watched the movies then I suggest you get to reading them because they are SOOOO much better than the movies!!!!<br/><br/>As for those of you who are plot spoiling, shame on you for being so selfish as to ruin Rowling's hard work by rushing to be the first to pass on the gossip.
 I've read many reviews about this book it was great although I wish we would have been given more info about certain things the ending could have been a little more the Lord voldemort dying and that's it all in all a good book I'm sad to see the series come to an end
 well i bought this boxset a few months ago , and i love it. i know that most people complain about the fact that the trunk is not made of wood but of carton, which is true as u can see in the pictures. i guess i didnt get dissapointed because i already knew what i was going to get before i bought it. u have to see it this way: it is a little cheaper than buying each book separately ,so u save some money and plus u get this trunk(made of carton but still ,pretty nice)and some stickers(this is the only thing that dissapointed me,i expected cooler stickers, not these that seem to have been drawn by a kid haha).<br/>but in general overview , if you do not have any of the hp books , this is your best choice.
 I enjoyed this book very much, I knew there would be an ending and I wouldn't have to wait two or three years to find out the rest of the story.  The characters are believable and the story moves in an orderly fashion if you believe in a wizarding world.  A really good, enjoyable book always leaves you wondering what else happened to the characters.  This was a very, very enjoyable book.
 It was a good end to a good story where good triumphs over evil yet again. Thank you Ms Rowling for a good time!  The only thing missing was an accounting of what happened to everyone else in the end... Where is Hagrid, Luna, George, and the others now?
 I ordered these because I've been wanting a full Harry Potter set forever!  I have refused to buy the Scholastic editions, preferring the unaltered first book, so Amazon was my best option (as usual).  The cover and box artwork is just stunning.  The colors are all very vibrant.  These editions are very unique from any other set I have ever seen.  I wish these came in hardback.
 The books themselves are awesome. The box, however, ripped apart at the bottom. It is not strong enough to hold the weight of the books and they were so tightly squeezed in that I had to flip the box over so they could slide out. I see customer photos for different sets of these books, but I got the paperbacks with the Kazu Kibuishi illustrations.  Another customer posted a picture of the torn box and that is exactly what mine looks like. I was quite disappointed that the quality is so poor.
 I have loved the series, however, I found this last book to be my least favorite of the group.  It is still good, just not up to the Harry Potter series standards.  I did however like the extras that the Deluxe Version included.  It was worth the extra money.
 If you haven't heard a Jim Dale Harry Potter book, you are missing out. He has a totally different voice for every character and it is a blast
 Great book for all ages!  After reading the entire series, this book wraps it all up beautifully!  I'm reading the entire series now with my son and he is loving reading again.  That is what is so great about the Harry Potter series of books, it makes kids want to read again!
 If you like the Harry Potter series, then you will certainly want to finish it by reading this book. The story is fun as we have come to expect, but at points it is tedious in the extreme and moves very slowly. The second half of the book is much better than the first in that the plot actually moves somewhere. My main problem is that the book simply ended. The final chapter concludes with a three-page epilogue following it, which does not exactly leave much room for telling the tale after the battle. After 7 books, I would have hoped that she would have put more time into the ending, but it seems she didn't. At least at the end of this saga, there are no Ewoks jumping about.
 I cried for many reasons reading this book.  The most of which was it was the end.  It was everything I hoped it would be and more.  All questions were answered, all characters got the glory, or punishment they deserved, and Harry Potter was the boy who lived, yet again. I loved this book.
 Love the series and the maturing plotline. Darker than the earlier ones, keep that in mind for younger readers.
 The box is a bit flimsy, but its a good deal overall for reading purposes. However, collectors should probably go with the pricier hardback edition.
 This product was received in excellent condition very quickly ... helped me keep within budget!<br/><br/>THANK YOU!
 I chose this rating for the simple reason the service was fast and the book was in excellent condition. I was able to enjoy reading the story within days after deciding to buy it, I believe it was even sent the day I ordered it. It is almost like getting a book brand new, but with tremendous savings.
 I've never really had a proper HP set despite being a huge potterhead. The last set I had was when there was only four books which unfortunately I never got to bring with me when I migrated… I like art and bright colours, so when I saw this set few yrs ago I already set my mind into getting it but it took so long due to other college finances… but I finally got it and I'm so happy with it~💖 It's so beautiful (‾᷄ ᵕ ‾᷅人)💕
 The book was delivered in a timely manner and both me &amp; my daughter read it at break-neck speeds.  It was well written and the ending was not what I expected.  It was a terrific book in the series.
 This book is one of the greatest book I have ever read. It is known for the children mostly but even grown ups love this book. As I am now 25 I am still in love with this book. Yes, the competitors like twilight are excellent books to but Harry Potter is still number one series for children, young adults, and most grown ups. I would recommend this book to anyone who is into love, fantasy, action, and mystery. The whole series just flows with excitement and its one book that is hard to it down. I catch my self reading at night before bed and end up reading way to long because u get so involved its hard to tell how long you have read. My children will be asked to read this book when there old enough I'm sure  they will love it just as much as I have.
 Answers many questions and fills the voids for those of the secret knowledge seekers
 This one seems to drag a bit, but it is a good conclusion to the story. Jim Dale does a great job as always!
 Extremely happy with the purchase.  I bought it for my newphew who loves to read.  Seeing his face when he opened these books for Christmas was worth every penny I paid.<br/><br/>I had purchased the same set of books just a week before in a store and returned them after being able to make this purchase for the same set of books at almost 1/2 the price.
 When I heard rumors of illustrated Harry Potter books, I was extremely doubtful.  I was worried that there was no way to do JK Rowling's work any justice in 2-D.  I was terribly wrong.  Jim Kay's illustrations are beautiful.  He captures the whimsical and wild world of Hogwarts and it's many characters.  He honors the words of JK Rowling without taking away from them.  This truly is a beautiful book.  I am reading through the series with my children, and it is so much fun to read along with these illustrations.
 Be sure to brush up on the last two Harry Potter books or you'll be guessing about what's going on with some of the story line.  Over all it was worth waiting for; thanks to Amazon I didn't stand in a long line or pay $35+; a friend of mine did!.  Pre-orders are great, just picked the book up at the Post Office on the day it was released.
 Have used Amazon.com in the past with great satisfaction. This experience was highly disappointing. When initially ordering the 6 book boxed set of Harry Potter books, I ATTEMPTED ordering with a NO CHARGE for shipping. I understood delivery would be slightly longer and did not object. The problem started when I tried to check out. Amazon.com had my credit card info from prior purchases yet when attempting to complete my checkout, I was not able to pull up my account info. Since the info did not appear, I assumed the order was not completed. I then tried a second time to order and this time somehow was successful? in placing and completing the order. This is where my frustration and disappointment begins. I was being charged over $11.00 for a RUSH delivery which was not necessary. Next I receive 2 confirmations for my single order. I attempted obviously unsuccessfully to cancel the RUSH delivery, but somehow was still not able to. I now have 2 sets of the same books and have now incurred more than double the cost of 1 set. I also read that cancellation cannot occur once delivery has been sent. I have no idea where my 3 emails went pleading my dilemma and requesting cancellation and a credit for the RUSH delivery set nor do I understand why my previous transactions were flawless and this one HORRIFIC. As delighted as I've been with reading the books, I still have an UNOPENED set that I've been charged for and do not feel confident any longer that I can rely on or trust Amazon.com for any future ordering. Ideal customer service would accept my returning the unopened set of books and crediting me this expense. If this should occur, then I could continue doing business with Amazon.com.<br/><br/>Fran Larson
 Amazon has the cheapest prices I've found for the unabridged audiobook CDs narrated by Jim Dale.  That being said, they are still rather expensive.  Buy with caution because this is a well-written series, narrated by a more-than-able voice artist, and it will almost certainly lead to an addiction.  Affording one of these audiobooks isn't too much of a financial stretch, but starting a collection, however, can leave you searching for loose change.  Overall, I would recommend this product to any fan of the HP series.  They are great for long trips and for people who lack the time to sit down and read the books.  5-star product / 3 star-price.
 This fast paced volume keeps the reader guessing what will happen next. The book was a good adventure, escaping from the traditional story demonstrating the survival of our favorite characters outside of the traditional setting. This was a great way to end the tail of Harry and company.
 It was worth the frustration of the many obstacles of things I didn't like happening.
 I loved all of the books
 All of the books arrived in fairly ok shape. They were a bit late, but that wasn't the seller's fault and they did give me a partial refund. It may have been ny fault, but I was under the impression that only #7 seven didn't have a book cover, so I was slightly surprised when three of them were missing a cover. After flipping through them, I discovered that there was a tiny hard spot that seemed, disturbingly, quite a bit like dried blood, a puzzle piece wedged in one book, a pencil mark, which I fixed(just felt it ought to be noted), some ink stains, something I recognized from when I shared books with my brother as booger stains, one of the pages was dog eared, which is less of an actual problem, but more of a pet peeve, most of the book's paper edges have dirt streaks or more colorful streaks on them, and one book seems as though it's been opened too far at one point. You can see the part that holds the pages together. While the readability is at no point diminished, I profess myself... disappointed, as a devoted potterhead. I am overall happy to be able to read the books, but I wish they'd been in better condition. So, conclusion: Customer service. Great. Condition: Poor. Advertisement accuracy: In between.
 I love the Harry Potter series.  I have 2 sets, one for myself and one for my granddaughter.  I will be looking forward to more of J K Rowling's books in the future.
 I, have always wantedto ead the Hsrry Potter books and now have! Sfter watching the movies, it id no durprise that books such as these ae as anaxing as ttgey sre. I spologise forvthe nsny typos because I am writing this ftom my Kinfle :/
 First of all, the Harry Potter books is the best book series ever so if you're looking for some books to read at a reasonable price then this is the series to buy. If you're looking for a collectors box don't buy this because it just holds all the books in a cardboard box (at least the box has designs on it) but does come in shrink wrap so you can preserve it if you want to have a good collection untouched I guess. Anyway, if you just want the books to read them like I did get this package it will suffice for what you need at a decent price. Harry Potter fan forever . . . and ever.<br/><br/>I will be sitting in my rocker at the age of 80 reading Harry Potter books and my family will ask, "Still after all this time?" and I will say "Always."<br/><br/>Harry Potter rules.
 I will leave it to others to go into details.  I found this to be a very satisfactory conclusion to this delightful series.
 It was long-awaited and  anticipated by millions of people around the globe, and it was amazing. I sobbed throughout the chapter 32, and I'm not ashamed because the book was exquisite. J.K.R. rounded down everything she previously mentioned in the other books, and Harry himself is somewhat different, he striked me as someone who suddenly grew up in a very positive kind of way. To all those who haven't yet read this final piece of the most magical book ever, I envy you.
 well I just simply love this book....I had to quit reading though, because it gave to many details that I would of needed to know from harry potter 6 in the first few chapters.....but this book is a must read if you like fantasy....rowlings definitly brings this fantasy book to real life.
 The Harry Potter series is, simply put, amazing.  Having all seven books is almost a necessity as they books are fun and easy to read and I am able to fly through them.  They are hard to put down and you can go right into the next book after finishing the one before.  J. K. Rowling writes simply, but not boring, and even though Harry Potter is found in the children's section of most libraries and bookstores, Rowling has the ability to write in such a way that Harry breaks the mold of traditional "children's" books, appealing to people of many different generations.  I am 23, and love these books.  My uncle is over 60 yrs old and he bought his box set from Amazon as well.<br/>  Amazon is THE place to buy books (as well as numerous other products) online.  I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7), as you will be, too.
 I needed this book and I was happy to find it online. It came on time too.This book is a Good Read!
 I could read this over and over again. I only wish that the movies replicated to the books better. Oh well
 enjoy all the books.
 I have been listening to the Harry Potter series for the last three books, when my lifestyle changed and I no longer could find the time to sit down to actually read the books.  Since the only time I have is during commuting, audio book is the only way I could fit in such a luxury.  I don't think I could even go back to the reading them myself, even if I could find the time.
 All good things come to an end.  J.K. Rowling tied up most of the loose threads of Harry's story, and other characters, in the final book of the series.  The book moved well and maintained plot tension and some character ambiguity up to the end.
 The seven Harry Potter books are truly works of literature that will stand the test of time. I believe that, someday, my grandchildren will enjoy just as fully reading these books to their children as I have enjoyed reading them with my family.
 This is a great value. You get all seven hardcover jacketed books for $122.00 that's only $17.50 each. The box is a nice touch and the stickers let you customized. My only complaint is the box isn't well made. However, it looks good and as long as it's only used for display, it should last. If you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a must have.
 HP 7 is excellent.  It lived up to every bit of hype laid out before it, and then some.  It is darker than any of the other books.  From the very first chapter to the last, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster.  But by the end there is resolution to the story and as a reader, you are quite satisfied.  (Well, complete satisfaction would be never having to put the books down, but we all know we get greedy and finish them as quickly as we get them!)<br/><br/>Enjoy the Deathly Hollows!  I certainly did!
 I loved all the Harry Potter books.  Lots of action; delightful magical animals and situations.  J.K. Rowling has a terrific imagination.  Liked the way the series ended!
 Harry Potter learns that there is a chamber of secrets deep beneath the Hogwarts School of Wizardry. As is par for the course, he must deal with impossibly mean relatives, and an obnoxious Draco Malfoy and an annoying Dobby.<br/><br/>But his amazing friends Ron and Hermione are devoted and loyal. The book is every bit as exciting as volume one.
 Exactly as described. My little one is enjoying the books!
 My grandson was very pleased with this, especially since you had it on my doorstep the day it came out!
 The last book was well worth the wait.  It was impossible to put down!  Every time I thought I had it figured out, another shock changed my train of thought.  Well written, stimulating and riviting.  I am thrilled with the ending, and happy that the series ended in such a wonderful manner.<br/>The series may be at an end, but Harry will live on, in all of our hearts.
 Excellent book, i recive it on time and good prize
 These are wonderful books.  I already have all of these books and ordered this Boxed Set for my grandson who has finally reached the age to read the books and he loves to read.  He has already book 6 and he loved it.  He could actually imagine what she was writing.  Great writing by the author.
 this book is amazing i loved it from the very begining to the very end this book has everything i wanted in a book and more this book is awesome if you enjoyed this book heres some other books you might enjoy as well<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/By-J-R-R-Tolkien-The-Lord-of-the-Rings-50th-Anniversary-Edition-Fiftieth-50th-Edition/dp/B0062CU3ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">By J.R.R.

 I am almost 50 years old and I can not get enough of Harry Potter, it is the most exciting reading and listening I have every done. I own the cd collection so I can listen to it while I work.  I find I am on pins and needles waiting for the next book.  I will collect everything they have dealing with Harry Potter and I am not a collector of anything. I must admit I have become and Harry Potter junkie :O).
 Goodbye... Dear, Harry. I, and everyone else will miss you terribly.<br/>As if you were really real, too. That's saying a lot since, it is hard to think of you as fictional. It is also hard to think that this is the end...who or what will replace such fine writing as this? My readers heart is surely broken and no magic can fix it. What a thrill ride it has been for all ages and not just children. Cheers to you, Harry.
 Fun volume. Great artwork.
 JK Rowling has outdone herself with this book! I have read all the HP books and seen all the movies and they just get better and better. Great book for kids, teens, adults - anyone who can read! It is long, but well worth the time it takes to read it!!!!!!!
 I got a nice deal for this pretty book. Its quiet nice. The content is the thing I dont need to describe...
 Amazing
 Can't say anything about Harry Potter that hasn't already been said. Good series even for adults.
 Winding up the series, JK Rowling has tied together all the threads of her previous books. On the run, Harry, Ron and Hermione strive to find the secret of Harry's past, how the prophecy would be fulfilled, and the final battle. The final battle being fought, Harry discovers the full extent of the bond between him and Voldemort. With the deaths of many characters we've grown to know and love, the big surprise comes that Harry does not destroy Voldemort. That is not a spoiler, but rather a teaser. I'll say no more on that if you have not read the book.<br/><br/>I only wish there were more authors like Rowling that don't dumb down their books.
 This is the 5th time I have read the Harry Potter series and I'm always in love with them!  Excellent book for any age or gender... I always hate the ending because i feel as if there should be more! Hope there will be more to come on this wonderful, complicated, and well though out tale!
 I have not yet read any of the HP books but I am a big HP movie fan and finally decided to get the books. I know the movies are never as good as the books so I was really excited when I saw this set for such a small price. I just got my set today and was not disappointed. I read all the reviews when the set was released and was worried that the box would be wrapping paper, it's not. I wouldn't trust my toddler with this but if stored well it makes a great storage box and it's nice to look at. If you purchase this, expect the box to be a bonus not the feature item. If you don't already own the set, I recommend you buy this. I'm very pleased with this product.
 Fast paced, keeps you interested. Good book for relaxing with. I did feel the author skipped over time frames rather poorly, and seemed to be in a hurry in the last few chapters to end the story. Not as good as the first 2 volumes but fun reading, anyway.
 I could not put this novel down.  I am sad that the series is over but I enjoyed the ride while it lasted.
 Never read the book saw the movie first but it was just as great as the movie I loved it.
 This is an appropriate ending to a great series of books. I re-read all of them on a regular basis.
 I was dreading whether HP and the Deathly Hallows would have a tragic ending or a "Sopranos" ending...neither happened. The ending was quite satisfying. It really helps to have read the previous 6 volumes of HP as Rowling ties up many loose ends. Yes, volume 7 is THAT good. I didn't think anything would be better than volume 4 (HP and the Goblet of Fire) but volume 7 is at least as good. I feel terrible separation anxiety that it is now all over. At least we have the movie versions of volumes 6 and 7 to see but alas they will not be as good as the books. I'm ready to read it all again and again!
 Perfect. Half the price of local store
 I remember standing in line at our local Barnes &amp; Noble with my daughter, Lauren on July 21st, 2007 waiting for midnight to arrive so we could buy Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows! We were so excited to find out how our favorite story was going to end. Needless to say we were not disappointed. I'm now reading these books to my granddaughter, Rachel and we are having so much fun. I recently order the entire boxed set for her so she could have her own copies. These books have now touched 3 generations of our family. Thank you JK Rowling for bringing us hours of delightful reading and a way for us to spend precious time together and start family traditions of reading together.
 I am one of the newest Harry Potter fans. Yes, I know I am a little late to the party. I had never seen any of the movies or read any of the books when they came out. I finally saw the movies this year and instantly fell in love. I bought this book set as a Christmas present to myself and I haven't been able to put it down. The books are so descriptive and captivating! I would recommend these books to absolutely anyone. I was the biggest doubter of the Harry Potter fad and now that I gave it a chance I am hooked!
 The Harry Potter books grabbed you from book one and always left you wanting the next one now so that you could keep reading to see what was going to happen next.  This one was off and running from page one and kept on going full speed ahead.  She had a lot to cover and put all together and she did a fabulous job.  It is sad that we have come to the end of these books.  Now I will have to find something else to keep my children reading.
 Perhaps one of the best classics our generation will ever witness, Happy Potter is one of those book series that just has everything.  A great hero, great characters, great villains, awesome adventures and wonder, and a great experience for all readers to enjoy.  Trust me when I say it, this is a series that will never die.
 I felt she struggled wit this book. If we all remember she struggled with the end. She wanted to kill Harry but the fans roard disapproval and she capitulated.<br/>The beginning draged a bit but as Harry came closer to his destiny the book began to get exciting. What botherd me about the the book was the ending dealing with years later. Could of been better.<br/>As a whole the book was excellent. Can'twait for the second part of the movie.<br/>Ray a young 61
 love it
 Only bad thing I can say about purchasing this box set is that I wish I would have had the patience to have waited for the entire set to come out.  I was so pysched to see all 6 at such an awesome price, I became "Impulse Shopper".  Still, these 6 books kept me and my husband highly entertained for a good couple of weeks.  Now, we'll just have to make sure to reread all 6 before Book 7 comes out next year.
 I have wondered what series even compares with Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Only the James Bond franchise for both books and movies.  However, the epic ending for Harry Potter, the best book yet.  The audio book makes the book......... EVEN BETTER.
 Like everyone here, I believed the books are great. But I felt dupped by the fact that this set came in a cheap cardboard box. The shipping box it came in, which even identified the contents with a prominent Harry Potter Logo as the full boxed set, was far sturdier than the actual box the books came in! When I reserved this set, I too thought the box pictured would be a hard, sturdy wooden box with felt interior. Boy, was I wrong! You need to handle it gently otherwise you might tear the box or yank out the weak rope attached to it's side. I am still going to enjoy the books though. I'm just going to store them on my bookshelf or find a real steamer trunk to put them in, instead of that flimsy box!
 The actual book itself had some pages cut oddly so they were sticking out on some places but the story itself was wonderful!
 Love it
 I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series, so it would be difficult to not give 5 stars to the complete series.  The product arrived from Amazon in a timely manner and will be given to my nephew for Christmas.  I am sure that he will receive many years of enjoyment from this classic set of books.
 I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed listening to the last book in the Harry Potter series on CD.  My fiance and I listened to the sixth book during our Thanksgiving travels, which were considerable, and started to listen to the seventh book this Christmas.  We are only up to half of the story and are so bummed that our travels are over b/c we want to finish the book!
 Amazing illustration. I loved it!
 OK, I admit it. I love the Harry Potter series. Probably even more than my kids. This is a great conclusion to the series. Great examination of relationships between maturing kids in difficult circumstances. Rowling finishes both the 'coming-of-age' story and the good vs. evil saga that have carried the series forward. Masterful writing.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the movie!
 good series
 I bought this set of books for my daughter and grandson in Miami and they arrived in a timely manner in great shape.
 I have all the other books in this majestic series in paperback &amp; I thought I would complete my collection with the final installment in paperback
 I loved this book!  It definitely lived up to my expectations of the Harry Potter series.  I was sucked in from the very beginning of the book, and enjoyed every minute of it.  This was a wonderful book from a wonderful series, and I am very sorry to see it end.
 I can say nothing bad about Harry Potter.  You can't go wrong buying any of the books in the series.
 I have read all the Harry Potter books and wanted to read them again.  I had borrowed the books from my children and grandchildren so needed to get my own set. Listening to Jim Dale and his marvelous reading of the books was fantastic.  After finishing the Deathly Hollows, I wanted to start all over again immediately.  I will listen to Harry often and for the rest of my life.
 I waited 10 years for this and I was not disappointed. Rowling kept her promise, and gave Potter fans the best of herself. Book 6 made me a bit apprehensive about the ending as well as the quality of the read, but my fears were allayed from the first chapter. The writing was the best since Book 4; the comedy and the darkness were offered up in satisfying amounts. I would not, could not ask for more.
 While watching the movies last month, I thought it's been a while I should re-read the books.  So glad I did...wow.  I absolutely know why these books are so popular!  Ms Rowling has so much imagination....the plot is wellltbought out and the characters are so lovingly memorable...If you have not already taken the time to read them you need to.
 Beautiful book, my daughter in law loves it!!
 I thought it was by far the best of all seven books, I even bought the audio cassettes and listened to it that way also. Again it was fantastic.
 Got the cd's of the book to listen in the car while on vacation.  The family loved the narrator and it was a great way to "read" Harry Potter when we couldn't actually read it.
 I am sorry that the Harry Potter series is ending.  This book is another engaging read.  Rowling does a good job of reminding us who characters are and how they fit together -- for those of us who read the previous book some time ago (or have poor memories).  Rowling's writing still creates the clearest pictures in the mind.  It's a great escape for this hip grandma.
 this book is the best book ever i very strongly advise you to read this, from the age of 1-100 you will find this book to be funny, emotonal, and inspiring
 Harry Potter's amazing journey comes to an end in this book, and JKR has done the series justice in a splendid conclusion.  Good does triumph over evil, though not without cost, and Harry triumphs over his doubts and fears. (No spoilers here!  Read the book.)  The plot takes some unexpected twists and turns, though I was sorry not to see more of certain much-loved characters who do not appear until the last chapters.  The core coming-of-age story of a hero who is willing to die to protect his friends is brilliantly told and extremely satisfying.<br/><br/>Bravo!
 I bought this box set for my daughter's 7th birthday. She is an avid reader and we read together at bedtime every night. Out of all the gifts she received this year, this was her favorite. It is wonderful to have such a great book series together so once we eagerly finish one, we can move right on to the next. The artwork on the books is just beautiful and when they're all together, the picture of Hogwart's is incredible. There is no doubt this box set it worth the price!
 Credit to Rowling:  she clearly DID have the whole story in mind the whole way through.  Not perfectly realised, perhaps, but an honest and satisfying conclusion to a great story &amp; characters.  She played fair with them, and with the reader.
 J K Rowling really pulled it off.  The entire book &amp; was entertaining and I felt that it answered all my questions.  I was very satisfied after reading it (which took my wife and I two days).  What a great ending to a great series.<br/>Nate
 I had read all the Harry Potter books before buying this set. I loved them so much I wanted to have a permanent set of the entire collection for my library. This was a great value (not too expensive!) for all the books. They are paperback, but durable and a great quality. I would recommend this to anyone who has wanted the collection but hated to spend the money on hardback copies.
 After reading the books a few times, I enjoy listening to them being read to me.  And Jim Dale is truely outstanding!!!  I can't believe all the voices he does, I recomend this whole heartedly!!
 I have avoided purchasing the full HP series because of the cost.  My daughter just began getting into the books and this is really the way to go.  She is awarded a new book once she completes a book.  And I throw out the teaser that the movie can never cover everything that is in the book which motivates her to read even more.  Chamber arrived in excellent condition and was a great value.  Will definitely get her Azkaban when she completes this one.
 I couldn't have been more pleased with the final book of the Harry Potter series.  Rowling has kept up her amazing storytelling talent right to the very end.
 I'm not going to write a long and drawn out point by point review of this book.  All I will say is that if you are HP fan, you will enjoy this final installment of the life of the boy wizard. You can't please everyone, so some people were disappointed in this book, my personal opinion is, it was worth being a fan all of these years and waiting for the seventh one. Enjoy!!
 How can anyone not love the Harry Potter series? The development of characters and the increasing maturity of topic is amazing.
 I ordered this book by mistake, thinking it was the hardcopy.  I love J.K. Rowling's works, but the idea of reading this book through squinted eyes  was too daunting, and I quickly went back on-line to Amazon to get the hardback version of Book 7 in this enthralling series.

I thoroughly enjoyed the books and movies, but the audio collection is for me the most enjoyable way to enjoy the series.
 Great boxed collection!
 was pleased with overall condition of the book. was not pleased with the name wrote on the side of the book
 The book came very promptly and in perfect condition.  I would definitely order from (and already have!) Amazon again.
 The book realy starts off slow but the back story of the older characters really pulls all the books together, It would be wise to browse through books (3-6) prior to reading this book. The ending does provide fair closure to the series.
 Bought long long ago. Loved it. Have read it many times. Harry Potter is always a very very enjoyable read.
 Great reading and great story.  I wasn't sure I would like these books, but the content was great and I couldn't read fast enough to see what happened next.
 But it was really good. My husband, a close friend and I have spent the last three years pondering and questioning the end. We probably each wrote an entire thesis comparing themes, character development and all that boring stuff I never contemplated until this series. I was terrified that Rowling would cave and give us easy answers in a hurried ending. JKR - thank you. I can't wait to share these books with my son. I honestly believe that this series has made me a better reader - and when I found a reference to a bezoar in a 16th-century history I was reading (for fun!) I couldn't stop laughing.
 I am reading these books for the 3rd time! I am probably way too old to love these books but they are by far, the best books I've ever read - ever! Kudos to J.K.Rowling! She managed to capture every possible age group with this creation. I even purchased 2 copies of Tales of Beedle the Bard for myself and my best friend. Truly am a fan.
 This book was purchased for my nephew.  He read it in two days, and then he reread it.  I have only watched the movies; however, he says the book is much better, because the are no details left out.  If you are a HARRY POTTER FAN, YOU HAVE FOUND A GREAT BOOK TO READ.  YOUNGER AND OLDER FOLKS WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.
 title pretty much says it all<br/>if your not a HP Fan today is as good as any to start!
 The book is less intriguing than the others but is still amazing. I don't know my advice but I think it is yes, buy it.
 I am 61 years old and have loved the series of Harry Potter books. I have gotten seversl of my grandchildren interested and they borrow my books all the time. Christina asked for a complete set for Christmas.  The set I bought was only the first six books. The set is wonderful. She couldn't be happier. This set was a real bargin.  I plan to buy her the last book for her birthday (March 1).

 love
 Just got this book.  Illustrations are great
 Like all of Potter, not Shakespeare ... but it doesn't have to be to be fun.
 It's strange to see the amount of complaints given the price tag. It's terrible that folks don't associate $53 to a fairly cheaper set compared to the more pricier sets out there into the hundred$ of dollar$. The set is very nice. They are paperbacks, so if you're ok with that - this is a great purchase. The case that holds all the books is made of some hard cardboard, not cheap at all. My Daughter loves them!
 Audio books are my preferred way of enjoying a book. It's all in the "Theater of the mind". I can picture what's happening the way I want it to look, not some film maker.<br/>  I can work around the place while listening to a book series that changed the world.<br/>AND the audio books are read by Jim Dale, an award winning man who also does all the voices, after much study. He's the best there is.
 The imagination of J.K. Rowling is magical. If you have the first 6 books of Harry Potter this one completes the set. From the very first one "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"  clear through to this last one. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows" J.K. Rowling has created a magic world of make believe and excitement  for children and adults alike. I would reccomend these books for all who loves fantasy!
 All here and perfect.
 Beautiful set.Will become a family heirloom.
 This book was awesome. It was a fireworks ending for the potter story. This was the best book in the series. I would recommend it to all. It was the icing on the cake.
 There are no words to describe how this is the best book in the series (what does "best" really mean?) All I can say is that Rowling took things to a whole new level, surprising, delightful and heartbreaking all in one. Never have I felt the characters like this or been more on the edge of my seat!
 My grandson now has the series - he loves these books.
 Great Set
 I did not read this but my 16 and 14 year olds devoured it and loved this book.  They couldn't put it down.  We gave it to our 17 year old nephew and he too finished it in record time.  Our 20 year old college student also throughly enjoyed this book.  They did not want to finish it because it was the last one.
 I was itching to get this after I finished book 6 and I wasn't disappointed.  Since reading the book and watching the movies, the books are so much better. The first part of the movie for this book was pretty good, am hoping they don't mess up the 2nd part.<br/><br/>The book wrapped up very nicely to end the series, I was happy with it.
 I was absolutely amazed by this book!  From cover to cover it was absolutely perfect!<br/><br/>On a second note, I did not recieve the book (despite my pre-order) from Amazon until almost 1 week after I could have bought it for the same price at my local B&amp;K.  Shame on you Amazon!  Shame!
 My granddaughter loaned me her paperback set of books to start, but I changed to Kindle editions almost immediately so I could continue reading on a lengthy trip. They are so well written! I found so many instances where I could compare the adventures to current day situations of good and evil, freedom vs repression. I eagerly look forward to reading more of Rowling's wonderful books.
 I've never given a review to anything off of amazon before, even though I'm a frequent shopper and adore their speedy ordering, products, and quick delivery.  But for Harry Potter, I had to leave a comment.  I think I'm one of the last people on the planet to read the series and now am full-on obsessed.  I finished book 7 last Monday.  I'm convincing others in my life to start reading it.  I never really gave the series much thought, never heard much about it, but I guess I assumed I wouldn't like it/it wasn't for me.  I was quite wrong, I think everyone would enjoy the journey.  Drop your judgments of this series and pick it up!<br/><br/>Regarding this particular set of books.  It is an incredible price for 7 books.  It is not getting 5 stars because there are a few minor complaints.  One - I can't get all 7 books back in the box after I've read them all now, since they expand with reading.  Book 1 sat on top of the box it came in for a week, but now I'm starting to read the series again, so not that big of a deal.  And two - the 7th book wasn't glued together properly, the first 20 pages fell right out.  Slightly annoying, but barely inhibitied my brisk pace of continuing the story.  And lastly, there are several pages throughout most of the books with random dots of extra ink or markings, but that did not interfer with the writing whatsoever.  Overall, it's a spectacular read, but low quality books.  I'm going to look for a hardback set to collect.
 This book set is wonderful. You get the whole series besides the newest book for a great price. If you've never read Harry Potter before you're missing out. It is a wonderful story full of humor, danger, love, and adventure. If you've only read one of the books you should definitely get the full set and read the whole series it is definitely worth it.
 The greatest end to the greatest story ever told.
 wife loved it but the box it comes in isn't real wood. it's cardboard.
 Wonderfully whimsical, with a big twist at the end.
 Very intense right from the beginning. Had to stop reading at the end of each chapter just to process all that had happened before going on. Ms. Rowling did a fantastic job, and the ending just wrapped everthing up wonderfully.
 good
 I couldn't stop reading once I started.  I have read them more than once.  These books have great details, without boring you, making you feel like you are right there.  I read them before all of the movies had came out.  So, it was even more interesting.  They did stick pretty close to the books as far as the movies go.  It's so much fun when you have read then watched the movie.  These are all great reads.
 Here it is; the final installment of Harry Potter, after years of nerd worship and Chirstian-hating, JK first series come to a close. What can I say about it without spoiling the end the end to anyone who has yet ot finish it? It ends the way we always knew it would, but J.K. expertly and loyaly adds what were always never see coming, just because thats how it always been. Simply put - loved it, and so will you.
 Best book ever
 My favorite book of my favorite series. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny ... I miss you guys!!!
 This is the best and most exciting book of the Harry Potter series. Perhaps it is the fact the fact that he has grown up somewhat or the revelation that Dumbledore was no saint, this installment is not a disappointing end to a popular tale.
 This Deluxe Edition looks like a box set, it's great if you are a collector.<br/>However, if you are just into reading the book, I will recommend you to buy the regular version instead.
 I hesitated before writing this review because I wasn't certain who I wanted to write it for: The Harry Potter faithful?  Literary snobs who want to bash all things Potter? The uninitiated? (Are there any left?)  I've decided to address the things I wanted to - without detracting from the future experience of those who haven't yet read the book.<br/><br/>For starters I want to say I shall put no spoilers here.  I warily shielded myself from `net, news and people who might be discussing major plot points before I had a chance to read the Deathly Hallows and make up my own mind, and I think every reader should have the same chance.<br/><br/>All that being said: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a magnificently glorious ending to the tales of the wizard with the lightning scar.  I was moved, I was thrilled.  I am happy.<br/><br/>Joann Rowling doesn't waste her time with exposition and filling you in on past installments: if you haven't read the first six books get thee immediately to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone.  For those who are already "up to speed", this makes for a thrill-ride of the highest order.  Past encounters with the pensieve and patronuses and mandrakes and Hogwart's house-ghosts become enriched and enlightened.  Looking now from the end of the whole series gives me a real sense of awe at the depth and complexity of the mythical world of wizards, witches and muggles.  I read criticism of Rowling's creations and I can't think of anything other than some pitiful, unhappy bit of envy prompting the critics to pronounce "well, it's just not very GOOD".  Harold Bloom has written that in years to come Rowling and Stephen King will be completely forgotten.  I don't pretend to know the future, but my prediction is that centuries after Harold Bloom has been utterly forgotten, people will be reading and loving works by both Rowling and King.<br/><br/>Aside from criticism that "it's just not well written", the next line of criticism seems to be along the lines of "it's just pop culture - our children aren't being prompted to read OTHER things while they're wasting their time on Harry Potter".  I see the completely opposite truth first-hand.  My daughter, who was in the third grade when Harry's adventures began, just graduated from high school having read, for example, all of Shakespeare - with the ability to quote lengthy passages from Hamlet, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Much Ado about Nothing.  Prior to Harry Potter, reading was a chore for her.<br/><br/>Back to the Deathly Hallows: I couldn't help but imagine the yet-to-be-made film version of this story.  Harry and his friends encounter thrills and battles and demons that would be as appropriate as a wizard Indiana Jones or James Bond.  The book opens with a bang and takes scarcely a breath.  There are about three chapters of slower pace as Harry, Ron and Hermione search their souls and make their plans.  The rest of the book is one hair-raising white-knuckle scrape after another. The "big questions" that have been pondered since "The Half-Blood Prince" are all answered.  Who dies? Is Dumbledore really dead?  Is Snape working for good or the Dark Lord? Things and characters mentioned previously are seen again and carry new weight because of the groundwork that has been laid in previous volumes.  In "Goblet of Fire" Rowling introduces us to the "unforgiveable" curses.  When the torturing "cruciatus" curse is applied in a class demonstration to a spider, Rowling's prose is so descriptive that we feel pity for the spider.  Now, when the curse is placed on major characters, we can almost feel their suffering.<br/><br/>Ms. Rowling need never write - or do any other sort of work - again.  But I bet she does.  I hope she does.  Selfishly, I hope that a writer so clever, inventive, and just plain (or, not so plain) entertaining will write again.  If she never publishes another word, we'll always have these books, and "Harry Potter" will be pulled from cherished library shelves in centuries to come as certainly as "The Three Musketeers" or "Tom Sawyer" is today.
 A book that kept up late every night reading. The right balance humor, mystery, and magic, I could not put it down!
 A steal at this price! I have been dying to read the series. I am currently on the Fourth book and I cannot tear myself away from them! I was always a huge fan of the movies but these books are a hundred times better! I catch myself laughing out loud at the smart remarks from the Weasley boys all the time. The characters are beautifully written. I love how there could be so many things going on but not be too confusing! I recommend this series to anyone who loves a good read and isn't afraid to full immerse themselves into a story! Buying them in a box set was the best decision because once I finish one book, I am able to pick up the next one right away.
 With much anticipation of the last book, I had owned all previous books, but in paperback. Falling in love with the concept, as I am an avid collector of books &amp; novels of non-fiction and fiction, I felt the need to purchase all hardback versions so in the future, as I have my own children, the books will be safe in the hard shells and complete. The packaging to secure the items was by far the best, and I think that was do to the caring nature of the person who so loves books and would not like to see them damaged. This may be a pre-teen novel series, but all ages have enjoyed these readings, especially me.
 This book is thrilling!  There are a few surprises which I won't reveal because they will spoil it for you.  It is definitely a page turner and I was sad when I had finished reading it because it is the last in the series.
 The Harry Potter books have been my favorite books for a as long as I can remember. I will always cherish them and pass them down to my children. This series has meant so much to me and I'm extremely grateful for having the opportunity to read them. Thanks J.K. Rowling!
 Excellent.
 I am fan of Harry Potter and reading this book was fantastic. The story is fast and fluid. I enjoy every page of the Deathly Hallows!!
 Too much action scenes and not enough character interaction as is in the other books.  The only interaction was Ron complaining, Hermoine bossing and/or crying and Harry musing or being inraged. Also, too cut and dry with all loose ends neatly tied up.
 Wonderfuls series of books and not just for children.  Great fantasy and adventures.  Love this series of books.  Sorry this was the last book that the author will be writing in this series. I'm thoroughly addicted to reading these books.  I will reread the series now that I have them all in the order that they were released and refresh my memories of times past spent enjoying perusing them.
 My daughter is a Harry Potter zealot. She REALLY liked getting a book that has JKRowling's signature on the case. This is one of her prized possessions related to Harry Potter. The story itself is also riveting, but its hard to imagine the series has reached its end.
 This is a great gift for Harry Fans. It comes in a nice sturdy case that is great to set out or add to your library. The paperback series is not expensive, and is very nice. I received it within a couple of days and was very pleased with my purchase. This is something that I have added to my library for my grandchildren to enjoy someday.
 Came as promised
 Though it's a boxed set that doesn't include the last book, it's such a great value to get all of the paperbacks together to read and loan to friends to prepare for the book 7 release.  Much easier than toting around those hardbacks.
 Although I had hoped Ms. Rowling would get over herself and allow her books to be available on the Kindle, I got tired of waiting and order this paperback set so my kiddos could re-read them this summer.  We already owned the last book so this set fit our needs nicely.  It's a good price and the books are of good quality.
 I'm nine years old and I love these book I read all of them in a few months I miss reading Harry potter
 I just couldn't believe that Hermione was working for Voldemort the entire time! How depressing :P.
 I grew up with Harry Potter and I really want any children I might have to one day grow up with Harry too.  That's why I made the investment to purchase this book set.  Having not only a copy of every book in hardcover but a box that serves as a display, a carrying case and a means in which to protect the books also is a great way to ensure that one day my future generations can fall in love with Harry just like I did.
 I was very pleased with this product. The packageing was done well and it came without damage. That is always a plus. I do wish the discription would of been a bit more detailed in telling me the case for the books was cardboard, but it was made well. My daughter was extremely pleased with this gift. It brought tears to her eyes. I will most definitely shop amazon again. Thank you.
 This is a nice display item with a very realistic looking box from 5 feet away. The truth is, the box, although thick and sturdy looking, is not sturdy enough for the weight of the books. The side 'handles' can NOT be used to pick up the box when the books are in it. I knew this when I purchased the set from the earlier reviews and all in all am happy with the set and its "display" value.<br/>A good wooden box would add cost to the item, but would be well worth it and I would have paid the price if it were available.
 Normally, even with a book I like, I do a little mental rewriting. In this case,  didn't feel the need to rewrite anything.<br/><br/>There is a lot of death in this book, and I thought it would be a good idea to have a 'children's version' with lighter content... but after thinking it over...<br/><br/>The story had a war in it. There's a war going on right now. Plenty of kids have parents in the war or know someone who has parents and loved ones fighting, losing limbs, or dying. This is just a book and it might make them sad but it might help them deal with real sadness.<br/><br/>Life is full of good and bad... and for both, children need guidance. Letting them run mad with the good while hiding the bad leaves them poorly prepared to deal with whatever life deals them in the future.<br/><br/>ACK, how did I get on this soapbox! *leaps off* Ahem... yes... I liked the book... and it did make me cry but in the end, I was pleased.
 Great book
 Great
 It goes without saying, a great read.
 My set is complete now. Yipee!
 I bought this for the kids and we read each book before watching the film adaptation of each one, which was a real incentive to read! It was extremely fun for them and rewarding. Finally, we got to book 7, and half way through we watched film 7, then finished the book and watching film 8. They loved it! The kids haven't read the books again since then but it is still a beloved set on our book shelf.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)<br/><br/>  This was full of surprises and nice that it included an overview of Harry's life as an adult. Highly reccommend!
 This book was a fun read filled with excitement. Rowling reveals the explanations to many mysteries from other books here. It all makes sense in the end. I loved this book. I definitely had to read the ending of Harry Potter, I mean C'mon!
 It was a great final book in the series. It answered all the questions one may have had about the storyline. I appreciated the epilogue and finding out how the characters got on with their lives. All in all a good finish!
 I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and even read ".... the Deathly Hallows" twice.  That did not diminish at all the wonder of listening to the audio version.  Jim Dale is absolutely marvelous and now, I want all of the audio versions.
 This last book of Harry Potter is just as good as the first one.I have enjoyed reading all of J.K. Rowlings books.
 Great deal!!!
 I thought all four books were exciting.I DO NOT think they were simplistic,and even if they were lets not forget it's for the 9-12 year old reader.Rock on Rowling I can't wait for year 5!
 This is a great box set for the books, however now that book 7 is out in hard back, the paperback version probally will be out before the end of the year (2007) so I would wait until the box set with book 7 comes out.
 A Truly great way to end the series 5 stars. Read all the books so sad that it's over.<br/><br/>A truly great way to end the series
 Don't get me wrong, but the book, although brilliant, leaves me yearning for a bit more....and sad at the loss of some of my favorite characters including Mr. Snape. Then again, I am a bit sad that its come to the end.<br/><br/>The epilogue did not complete my need to know the end. What of McGonagell, Hagrid, The Weasleys, and the Longbottoms. Who took over Hogwarts? What became of the house elves and others that joined the fight.<br/><br/>I almost believe one could write and eight book to complete the lives of those we have come to know as old friends, heros and villians.<br/><br/>I must admit, I am thankful for how it ended, that the true heros were those we least suspected or dared to believe were true. That Severas was proven a hero and so many others found strength and unexpected courage proved that it was not Harry alone that could win the battle, but a community of people who as friends and believers worked together to conquer evil...maybe we should take a look at this and think about how in our own lives we can take a stand to make the world a better place.
 This item is AWESOME!!!  I purchased the seventh year book in stores before i bought this and spent $34 for a hardback.  I never thought I would be able to get all 6 hardbacks for this cheap!  All in great condition and, as most of you know, Harry Potter is a FANTASTIC READ!!
 This review is solely on the binding, boxing, paper quality, and such.  I don't think anyone needs to hear more fanyboy gushing about the Potter saga.<br/><br/>This boxed set is beautiful.  Solid but not bulky.  The box and spine art is wonderful, and the new cover art is sublime.  Paper quality is very good, as is the typeface.  Scholastic did very good work on this box set, and if you haven't read this series (or read it to your little muggles) this is a fine entry into the Wizarding World.
 Whew what a ride!  This final book in the series keeps you on the edge of your seat from cover to cover.  J.K. Rowling has done herself proud with an exciting and strong finale.  I am really going to miss Harry and the gang.
 First of all, I would like to thank everybody who wrote such horrible reviews about the box.  You lowered my expectations to the point where, when my set finally arrived, I was thrilled.  I was expecting total garbage from what I've read here, and was really starting to regret my pre-order.... but my set arrived today and it's really not that bad at all.  Yes, I admit, I was hoping for something better...I always knew it was going to be cardboard of some kind but I was hoping for some nice textured cardboard, something like the Lord of the Rings DVD's came in.  It is just regular corrugated cardboard (decently sturdy so far) printed to resemble a trunk.  Pretty creative in my opinion.  The books, of course, are fantastic.  This set is well worth the money for the books alone, and the "trunk" (box) is neat, if not high quality.  If you do not have the books in hardcover yet, buy this set.  If you are thinking of purchasing this "collection" for the box, just wait until they sell a seperate wooden box at a ridiculous price... we all know it's going to happen.
 I really enjoyed this book. It was full of supsense and definitely had a surprise ending.
 Love all the harry potter books.
 My least favorite of the seven but still great. Good for adults and kids. Can't wait to read the next one.
 It had obviously been owned before but every single thing was in perfect condition. Couldn't have asked for better!
 The item was exactly as it was described online.  Arrived promptly and well packaged.  Good seller.
 mint conditon
 Book arrived in excelent condition. Super fast shipping and great price. I am very pleased with this purchase!
 Awesome book - I'll pass this one on to my kids...when I have them!  I fell in love with the Harry Potter series very late after they were released, but once I started, I couldn't stop!  Book #7 only took me 3 days to read.
 These books are the best things I have ever read.They have adventure,humor,excitement,mystery,and the occasional drama.The only thing bad about these books is that they have to end.But they are sooo good that I just reread them until the next book anyway(lol).I highly,highly recommednd them to the avid reader.And dont 4get book 5 which is FINALLY out!!!Yay!!!
 I bought this leather bound collector's edition of Chamber of Secrets for my brother. It came in pristine condition even though it is used. He loved it! I also bought the Sorcerer's Stone, which also came in perfect condition. They are well worth the money. I'd like to find the other 5 books eventually, but I could only find books 1 &amp; 2.
 What can I say?  These books are a treasure to be read and re-read and I am so glad to have them on Kindle.  Now I can easily look up all those British terms.  I am 65 and I love these books and enjoyed the excitement of the past years waiting for the next book to come out and sharing theories with other Potter fans about what might happen.
 Item received promptly (especially for overseas / UK shipment), in perfect condition.  Exactly as advertised!  VERY happy, and I'm sure the giftee will be too.  Would definitely purchase from again. Cheers!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Boxed-Set-X7-Adult-Paperbck-Harry-Potter/dp/0747595844/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Boxed Set X7 Adult Paperbck (Harry Potter)</a>
 My children and I read them together.  This series is one of the few that have captivated my children's interest in reading.  I certainly hope Ms. Rowling continues to write other books now that the Harry Potter series is finished.
 Reading it to my GF for her birthday.
 I had avoided Harry Potter for many years because of my belief that it was overrated, childish garbage. I could not have been more wrong. Rowling has written a wonderful series not only for children, but equally good for adults. These books have excellent prose, wit, character development, and plot. (Coming from one whose favorite authors are Shakespeare, Dickens, and Hugo, this means a lot.)<br/><br/>To the Christian parent: do not let the word "witchcraft" scare you away from reading, or allowing your child to read Harry Potter. The magic in these books is as innocent as the magic in any other children's fantasy novel. The line between good and evil is clearly defined, and there are constructive, Biblically acceptable messages. There are no wiji boards or voodoo dolls, and fortune-telling is shown to be a sham. As long as your child understands the truth of witchcraft (which takes a five-minute talk), Harry Potter is a safe, enjoyable series for all ages.
 The case is very sturdy and heavy. It looks beautiful and definitely can be used as a display piece. Perfect for any Harry Potter fan. The books are finely bound and the paper is very thick. Looks like a book you would find in an old library. I think it would be a great gift for a teen since younger kids will probably destroy it.
 I purchased this item for my daughter's 24th birthday, altho we share it I must admit.  We both love to listen to books on our Ipods and every night she listens to one of the books to relax, let down after work, and falls asleep as  Jim Dale brings the characters to life.  Hoorah for JK Rowling- not only for children but for imaginative people of all ages who would love to have schooled at HogWarts.
 What's not to love? Characters, dialog, setting, action, substance and entertainment add up to create a piece of great literature.
 I purchased this book recently and i couldn't stop reading until i finally finished it. i think the book is the best possible wrap up to the whole Harry Potter series. Although i admit some of the things that happened threw me off a little, but overall i thoroughly enjoyed the book.
 Considering all of the hype associated with this book, I was a little apprehensive when first reading it. I'm pleased to say that this book was nothing short of a masterpiece. I read the whole thing in one sitting! I couldn't put it down.<br/><br/> I applaud Ms. Rowling for her magnificent writing in tying up all the loose ends of the Harry Potter story and coming up with a beautiful ending.
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a Magical, charming, entertaining and wonderful book!<br/>The lessons in this book are constant. The connection to God is evident,the battle between Good and Evil are ever present.<br/>The writing is rich and colorful, you can actually see the way the castle looks and feels, the creatures are described so vividly you can imagine them perfectly, you can even smell the smells and actually feel propelled into Hogwarts Castle. The magic in the story is like the icing on the cake!<br/>I am a HUGE fan of these books,and I recommend them highly to people of all ages.
 Nearly everything I wanted wrapped up in the final book was. I just wish the series didn't have to end. I would have like to see what was next in everyone's life - not after the children start going to Hogwarts.
 If you enjoy the book, listening to Jim Dale is like being at the movies... this book comes alive.
 If you've been a fan of the HP audio books - this one won't let you down. Jim Dale does an excellent job in the final installment. I wish he were the new Dumbledore in the movies.  The book exceeded my expectations - I was on the edge of my car seat :)  In case you haven't read it yet you know who dies don't you....
 great ending to the series.  follows the travails of Harry and the gang as they search for the horcruxes.<br/>Many beloved characters are impacted in the final struggle with "you know who"<br/>recommended for mature teens and up.
 Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:<br/>Ahh, all good things must come to an end. I am a Harry Potter nut. Why the three stars then? Well, I don't know to be honest with you. I "liked it", but I just don't know if I can go further than that. Maybe 3.5 stars? What really ruined the book for me was the epilogue. Had Ms. Rowling not included the epilogue, I think I could have gone with 4 stars. It just felt so cheesy after all the darkness that we've experienced throughout the development of the story.<br/><br/>Eh, well, I think that's all I really need to say. I highly doubt someone is scouring reviews of Harry Potter to decide if they're going to read it or not. ;) So I'll keep in short &amp; sweet, per usual!
 Ok, so I'm a Harry Potter nut and have collected all seven books in hardcopy. Paperbacks are fine but you almost break the binding trying to read the books. The second book, Chamber of Secrets, continues to send you, your children and grandchildren on a wonderful journey.  I shopped Amazon used books and found books in wonderful condition and inexpensively too.
 I bought these story books for my niece on her Birth Day, she really like these books.<br/>good stuff in this price.<br/>Paper Quality: paper quality is not good, however its hard to read these kind of book again and again, so i would say in this case for 1 or 2 times read quality doesn't matter.
 Love the book. It is great to have it on CD, so that I can load it on my IPod.
 The Packaging is good. The disc could have been in a non-abrasive plastic sleeves. I particularly enjoy hearing Jim Dale read this delightful series
 WOW-- I can't believe it -- it's as good as the 1st!  -Maybe even better; i'm so relieved.  Rowling's back w/her endearing humour/original fun :)<br/><br/>Prisoner of Azkaban should be here in a coupla weeks;  I ordered movies#1-6 (seen #1) &amp; that'll be here soon, so i can watch Chamber of Secrets movie Yaaaaay!!  :):)<br/><br/>{chk out my Kool photos!}
 Everybody loves the second book in series. New characters, new plots. Rowling does just that. Plus even if the character is minor she still lets us understand the characters feelings. She also makes it another learning/mystery book.<br/><br/>This is Harry's second year at Hogwars and meets new friends and old enemies. And there are strange occurrences even if it is Rowling's magical world. Harry is warned not to go to Hogwarts but chooses not to listen to the creature's advice. He also gains more trust and confidence throughout the book.<br/><br/>Rowling is able to succeed again and probably does it again in her next book, by creating new characters and creatures, and a variety of plots and twists. Good book.
 I loved the book and have read it twice already. It think it will stand the test of time. I've enjoyed all the books.
 Great all around deal.
 I must confess that as an adult I too have become addicted to the series. As a Christian, I was somewhat concerned about the magical elements at first. However, after reading the series, I find the "magical" episodes so silly that I consider it no more harmful to the children in my life than a fantasy cartoon. A fun book to read to your children!
 Obviously, the book is great. I bought this to replace the seventh book of the series. Somehow along the way, I lost my copy of Deathly Hallows. I specifically chose this book from this buyer because the cover matched all of the other books I have at home. However, when the book arrived, it came without a cover! Which defeated my purpose of buying this particular book from this buyer, instead of just buying any copy of the book. Very disappointing.
 I just have to say that its an EXCELLENTE book, i wouldnt go as far as saying its the best, i have to reread it, but is intense, amazing, fun, and a great conclusion to a great series, im sorry for al the characters that have to die  but glad for the ones who survived. Most of the plot points were solved, and let me say this is going to make one hell of a movie.....
 I love how this series is combined &amp; packaged in the case. Professor McGonagall on one end &amp; Dumbledore with Hagrid on the other. I lost my other books (not a set like this) when they were not returned to me. This is well worth the price I paid to replace all of them &amp; in such a great setting. Now, if I could only get each book out without having to tip the case over to loosen the other books. (I don't want to damage my new treasure!)
 Nobody wants to see this wonderful world come to an end, at least our view of it. After getting to know these characters over the other 6 books, I became attached to them and invested in their lives, success and failure. As difficult such a task as concluding this great story, Ms. Rowling was able to still make me want it never to end. It was painful but triumphant. I still want to read all 7 books again...
 Books were good condition, but came in a cardboard box and not the wooden one as advertised.  VERY VERY VERY disappointing.  I suggest buying the books elsewhere and either forget the nice collectible wood box or build one... ridiculous and a sham.
 Great books
 Love this
 Great
 Grand son is wanting so bad.
 As expected, the same high level of quality writing and storytelling -- I intend to read them all again in sequence, non-stop this next time.  Thanks, Ms. Rowling, for all of this.
 This is the book to tie up the loose ends. The movie was fairly true to the book but true fans of course want to read and reread before seeing the movie.
 All these books are great.
 This box set is beautiful! Some reviews state that the box itself is poor quality so I wonder if the reviews are combined for this box set and another because this box set is 10 times sturdier than any other box set I have ever purchased. Thicker material; I don't worry about ripping the box when I grab/put back the books whereas with other sets, the box falls apart when you try to return the books to their spot.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall this is an amazing box set and I definitely recommend for any Harry Potter fans!
 It was a great read! Going through these for the first time like this is great. Can't wish to finish the series.
 This book really wraps up the whole series.  Although, sometimes it tends to detail too much in the feelings of the characters, it really transports you to the dwells and fights.<br/><br/>One can read this book over and over again and would not get bored with it.
 Excellent!
 Very well written. Great story. A bit too dark for me.
 I am so happy I pre-ordered this! The owl post delivered it promptly, and what a lovely surprise months later after pre-ordering!  The binding and cover are high quality! Its perfect size to place on my lap while I real and flip through the beautiful artwork throughout the book! This is a MUST have treasure for any true potter fan! I am giddy with excitement!
 The book was pretty good, only thing is that I do beleive she killed off way to many characters. It was like WWIII in wizard land with a bit of psycho.
 It was for my daughter who is a big Harry Potter fan
 I'm very happy with this box set, I've read through all the books from the set twice already, which is why I ordered paperback. I wasn't looking to buy a collectors thing, I wanted to read them, so this is perfect for that. I ordered the 7th paperback separately to lower the cost and still get all the books.
 Excellent transaction. Excellent condition. Perfect all around. A great item at a fantastic price.  Words cannot describe my experience on Amazon as of late. The item bought was in excellent condition and served its purpose well.  Nothing can compare and have nothing ill to say of it, nor do I have anything else to mention that needs concern. Highly recommend for anyone who shops on the internet!  Amazon is always the best!
 I've just gotten into the Harry Potter series, and I absolutely love it!  Great books!
 Good deal for the price--and I loved that the page numbers in the paperback edition correspond to the hardcover edition. This makes for easy reference when discussing the finer points of the series with others.
 Yes, this is a great book. But you probably already knew that. Rowling does a masterful job of showing how Potter has grown into a man in this book. Can't praise it enough, it lives up to all the hype and then some.
 This book was right there with the others in the series. Great read for all ages.
 Up until Book 7, I borrowed the Harry Potter's from a friend or the library.  After Book 7, I decided to actually buy the set for myself, but I did not want duplicates.  Since this set offered the first six only, it was the best deal for me.  I am very happy with them, although the box was not as exciting as I had hoped.  But I'm not in it for the box, right?
 This is a fabulous find and totally worth the money. I have 5 children who have really enjoyed this series. I have them all in hardback but refused to let them "borrow" or read from them as I wanted to preserve the beauty of these books. So I bought a set of paperbacks, problem solved! The are durable and still very aesthetic.
 Well, for a series I didn't even want to read, I am now a total convert.  JK has managed to weave a story thick with love, friendship, choices between right and wrong into one of the best series of all time.  This book caps Harry's story and it doesn't fall short.  As a matter of fact, JK has outdone herself with this one.  This was an excellent end to her tale.  I don't know how she'll ever top it.
 I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this book.  I thought it  was a great end to a great series.  JK Rowling has a way of making you so involved in her characters that you really care about them.  Yes it is sad that some beloved characters have to perish but there is a war going on after all!  I think she does a fabulous job of telling her story!  Well done!
 Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!! This is just what I needed!
 I read it in a few days and loved it!  I was sad to see the series end.
 This book is very interesting and has lots of twists and turns making me want to read more. I can't wait to read the next book!
 Best book yet!
 What a great way to practice Latin!  I am a Harry Potter fan, and being able to read it in Latin was a treat.  I often struggle to find ways to practice Latin, and reading Harry Potter was infinitely more enjoyable to be than trying to work through Cicero or De Bello Gallico...  I highly recommend it to anyone trying to learn or wanting to practice Latin.
 Harry Potter Part II: The Good and the Not So Good<br/><br/> A good way to evaluate Harry Potter is to compare it to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Taking into account the facts that Tolkien’s masterpiece is the standard for fantasy literature and that Rowling is writing a slightly different genre and for a different audience, Harry Potter holds up fairly well.  Nevertheless, Rowling falls short at a crucial point.  That shortcoming, however, is one that much Christian thinking about God and evil shares.  We desperately need to hear Tolkien in order to avoid the errors of moralism and a simplistic faith that cannot withstand the tidal waves of disappointment in the face of the hiddenness of God.<br/> The similarities between Tolkien’s and Rowling’s works are obvious.  They are both fantasy literature, have a deep concern with the dangers of power, and share a typically British appreciation for normal life.<br/> The differences are just as important.  Harry Potter is also a coming of age story and shows a marked preoccupation with death.  The Lord of the Rings is an epic tale and so more in tune with the tragic dimension of life.<br/> As a coming of age story, Harry Potter is necessarily geared to a younger audience than Tolkien, and, at least in the earlier volumes, is at the level of intelligent older children.  As Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow up, the story becomes more appropriate for adolescents and young adults.  I think this is why Rowling has so much more humor than does Tolkien.  Her marvelous gift for invention is used to entertain children and teens.  Howlers, disgusting jelly bean flavors, and quidditch are great fun.  She also includes a wonderful collection of queer beasts and odd ball characters.<br/> Tolkien is the better stylist.  As an epic author his prose has a gravitas that is lacking in Rowling, and his landscape descriptions carry the reader into a world of sweeping grandeur.  At times Rowling’s writing contains some painful lapses.<br/> Rowling does avoid the trap of simplistic characterization, a failing of many children’s and cosmic conflict stories.  Her characters are not mere cartoon figures of pure good and evil.  There is internal conflict and failure by the good.  Hermione can be a prig.  In addition to Ron’s adolescent addiction to snogging (which is Rowling’s fault not his), he is subject to juvenile jealousy, and Harry can feel real hatred.  Harry also has to come to grips with the fact that his father had mistreated Snape, and, as a young wizard, even Dumbledore had lusted for power.<br/> Also, some of the bad characters are not purely evil.  The Malfoy family is a case in point.  Lucius Malfoy, a nasty bigoted man, in the end is a weak person.  His wife Narcissa is too, but at the same time she is strongly devoted to her son Draco, a devotion that leads her to lie to Voldemort and save Harry Potter.  Draco, the bad boy bully in all the earlier stories, still has enough decency not to want to kill Dumbledore and in the end, if not reconciled to Harry, at least has become a husband and a father who is no longer actively hostile to Potter.<br/> Both Rowling and Tolkien finish their tales in the typically British fashion in which the great cosmic battle for evil results in the reestablishment of normal life.  In Tolkien the Shire is restored, and Sam becomes happily married.  In Harry Potter the main characters are married and send their children to Hogwarts.<br/> Yet this return to the normal points to the most serious shortcoming of Harry Potter. Rowling’s portrayal of evil lacks the depth of Tolkien’s.  Harry’s loss of his parents and friends poignantly portrays the human desire to escape the tragic consequences of death.  Voldemort’s quest for immortality shows how that desire can be perverted to very evil ends.  In the end, however, Harry can go on to live a normal life, having matured from his combat with evil but not being permanently marred by it.  He can live a normal life even though he has a scar.<br/> The effect of evil upon Frodo is lasting, symbolized by his loss of a finger and the injury received on Weathertop that never completely heals.  Frodo does not just have battle wounds.  He is a wounded person.  He cannot return to a normal life in the Shire and is granted passage to Valinor where he will find peace.<br/> As I watched Harry snap the Elder Wand and cast it into an abyss in the movie version of The Deathly Hallows (in the book he returns it to Dumbledore’s grave) so that it could never be used for evil purposes again, I couldn’t help but think of the contrast with Frodo and the ring of power.  Harry, the true hero, resists the temptation to abuse power.  In The Lord of the Rings Frodo fails.  He cannot resist the temptation to keep the ring and use its power for himself.  The ring is only destroyed because Gollum wants it for himself, takes it from Frodo, and then falls into the fires of Mount Doom.<br/> In Tolkien evil is not defeated by the heroic efforts of an individual.  Evil defeats itself in what he calls a “eucatastrophe” (See his “On Fairy-Stories” in Essays Presented to Charles Williams edited by C. S. Lewis.).  Tolkien’s eucatastrophe is undoubtedly derived from the biblical notion of evil defeating itself, especially in the cross of Christ where the forces of evil do their worst and unwittingly trigger the means of saving the world.<br/> The theme of evil defeating itself is present in Harry Potter.  The killing curse that Voldemort uses upon Harry is his own undoing, but in the final analysis it is Harry’s heroic action that saves the day.<br/> We Christians often present the Bible as a collection of tales about heroes from whom we can learn moral lessons and ways to live victoriously.  We look for evident victories.  Sadly our quest for evident victories means that we will seek power to win them.  In so doing we walk by sight and thus succumb to power’s hidden capacity for evil.<br/> We forget that God has chosen to reveal the biblical characters as sinners and frequently as failures.  The hero of the biblical narrative is God, and his ways are not only higher than ours they are often hidden from us.  In the darkest hour, at the moment of testing, the Christian will often fail. Yet even then the unseen hand of God’s providence is working to overcome evil.  Indeed, the very victories of evil, such as the cross, are the moments of its greatest downfalls.  By trusting in the hidden God, we learn to walk by faith and not by sight and overcome the temptations of power.  As the Lord told Paul, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).
 I forced myself to only read one chapter a day, and it still came to a swift end, well written and thoroughly enjoyed!
 As promised. Thank you.
 Our family wore out the first CD's as they were released over the years and chose to purchase a fresh set of the entire series. Papa has only listened to the disks, multiple times, Mama and teenage daughter have likewise, and read, as we own all the hardcopy books (and movies) too.  The reader, Mr. Jim Dale, is fantastic with his voices/characters and this is a must listen for anyone who loves great storytelling.  The shipment arrived with one box slightly bent due to packing movement, no worries, highly recommended for everyone.
 I read the book in two days and thought it was tremendous.  She sure has a way with writing that gets the dust off of your imagination.  Action packed and well worth the time spent to read it!!!  I love Harry Potter!!!
 Sssooo good!
 I've seen all versions of HP book covers that every editorial across the world had.<br/>But this one's are cooler since they look more like the movies, so it is a very nice plus.<br/>The inside of the book, every page is exactly the same as the old Schoolastic editions, so they are quite good as well.<br/>I totally recomend this to anyone who's not read any HP books before and even those who had, this is a very nice addition to anyones HP collection.
 A highly entertaining and fast moving finish to the highly successful series. A must if you have read the other books.
 order received.
 Was surprised at the many differences between the British and American versions.  These are the adult, cloth books, and were in alost perfect condition when they arrived.  I was a little disappointed with the flimsy box they sit in though, I expected something a little sturdier.  Still giving them 5 stars because I am an avid Harry Potter fan and these books are amazing, I got them to read so not to worried about the case.  And the price was EXCELLENT
 Great book. Left me wanting more.
 I love it because there was so much information that was left out of the movie and the book made it come all together.
 Ordered for my daughter - reading it every night since received.  Received promptly.  She couldn't wait to continue the saga!
 These are very entertaining books:  both kids and adults would like them.  Of course, it would be nice if book 7 was included in the series, but I don't think it is in paperback yet.  My only complaint was that the set took quite some time to arrive.
 This muggle loved it.  Discussions with my granddaughters about this book were wonderful.  Anything to bring the generations together.
 If you like action, romance, comedy, and good writing, look no further because this is the series that captivated millions of children, young adults, and adults across the world. This wizarding world simply enchants you into a trance that keeps you turning pages. When you're away from this book you get withdrawals and the only potion that can remedy your need is more Harry Potter. Enter into the world and become a student at hogwarts, and you'll never be the same again.
 It didn't  tell me it had no cover on it.
 Good
   I highly recommend reading Harry Potter: The Deathly Hollows by J.K Rowling out of 5 stars because the book is influential.<br/>For example, after all these when Harry's parents and others died, he kept moving on with his life, but still remembering his<br/>loved ones inside his heart. This is very sympathetic since Harry has lost many of family and friends.Also in the book he was<br/> willing to die just for all of his friends could still live.This is very courageous that he would die just for his comrades instead of<br/> still living and try to find another way to defeat the enemy. In the book, wizards can do extraordinary things with their wands <br/>and power like teleporting into anywhere, spells, and be physically able to fly on special creatures and broomsticks. This is very cool and wanting to do it since we cannot. In conclusion I have told you what you want to hear, bu the book will tell you more if you just open the book and discover the adventurous journeys in it and you will enjoy it.
 I actually already had all the hardcovers before I ordered this set. However, the ex that gave them to me thought it'd be nice to write inside the cover. PSH! Had to replace them all with this cute set. It's not the sturdiest box they could've made and it's not real easy taking them out of the box. A previous reviewer mentioned putting the included stickers on the corners to conceal any eye sores, but I'm content with the way it came. I kept the box it was shipped in too, only because it too has the HP logo on it. Couldn't bring myself to throw that baby away :) Amazon.com has the best prices and I'm satisfied with the purchase. Hurry up and order your own! Enjoy!
 The final book flows nicely and keeps you involved in the developements. I marvel at JK Rowlings mind and conception of the whole Harry Potter series. This book does very well in bringing the problem of Lord Voldemort to a conclusion. To me a unique conclusion.  However, it does skip 19 years at the end. So maybe that will lead to another book and then again maybe not.
 Well, I wrote a review some years ago, when I first read this book. Same number of stars.<br/><br/>My opinion hasn't changed much, but I deleted my original review. Why? Y'all can't handle a dissenting viewpoint. The second someone pipes up with "I identified with Draco and wished Rowling had given him a halfway happy ending," you guys jump down their throat and downvote every defense they offer.<br/><br/>You don't want a discussion. You want an echo chamber.<br/><br/>I'm leaving that here. Peace and out.
 **** SPOILERS AHEAD . . . if you haven't read the book, please be warned! ****<br/><br/>JK Rowling's final installment in the Harry Potter franchise is a clunky, over-stuffed opus that's ultimately disappointing.  One gets the sense, in reading this novel for the second time, that Rowling found herself having great difficulty concluding her saga in one volume - after all, the previous six books have each focused on one school year in the lives of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they prepared themselves for the expected war between the forces of Good and Evil.  The war itself, as compressed into this one book, feels rushed, bloated, summarized at times, and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Basically, `Deathly Hallows' is a novel about choices - should Harry spend his time seeking Horcruxes (magical objects containing parts of Voldemort's evil soul) or Hallows (magical objects purported to give their possessor dominion over death)?  Dumbledore has instructed Harry to go after the Horcruxes, since finding and destroying all seven is the only way to finally destroy Voldemort.  But the lure of the Hallows is great, and Harry finds himself obsessed with finding the Elder Wand.  Searching for Horcruxes isn't particularly glamorous (and it keeps the trio out of the battle for most of the novel), but it does bring our heroes closer to their ultimate goal (destroying Voldemort).  Searching for Hallows would be more fun (and probably more exciting for readers of this story).  In the end, Harry must make the ultimate choice - self-sacrifice or self-preservation.  The search for the Horcruxes symbolizes that self-sacrifice (especially since one of the seven Horcruxes ends up being inside Harry), while the search for the Hallows symbolizes personal power and self-preservation.  The final show-down between Harry and Voldemort puts it all into perspective - Voldemort has put all his hopes into the Elder Wand, which he believes will protect him and give him dominion over death; Harry offers himself to death willingly.  Harry's willingness to sacrifice his own life for the greater good is what gives him the power to defeat Voldemort.<br/><br/>OK, that's what the novel is about.  Unfortunately, to get there Rowling has to throw in a ton of exposition as she explains what Hallows are, what Horcruxes really mean, and how wands really work.  Her characters jump from action scene to action scene, spending the time between explaining to each other (and the reader) what actually happened and why it's important.  It feels a bit like an action film that stops every 15 minutes so that the director can step forward and explain things to the audience.  In the end, we discover that the Hallows really aren't important to the story at all (other than as a symbol), and even the Horcruxes end up feeling anti-climactic once that ghostly Dumbledore starts in on that long and confusing explanation of how Harry himself is a Horcrux (OK, OK, it's all a bit ridiculous).  Add to all that the convoluted "rules" Rowling sets up in this book surrounding the use of wands (none of which were part of the previous 6 books) and you get a book jam-packed with "stuff" that gets in the way of the story.<br/><br/>And that's what's lacking here - the story.  Most of the actual war takes place elsewhere, as we readers are stuck with Harry, Ron, and Hermione (who are hiding out in the country-side, thinking about Horcruxes and Hallows).  We hear (in passing) that things are happening at Hogwarts and at the Ministry, but we see little of it until the novel's climax.  Major characters (Snape and Ginny, especially) have very little to do in this novel.  We never get the Snape-Harry scene I've looked forward to since the first book, nor do we get any resolution between Harry and Ginny.  The final show-down between Harry and Voldemort is disappointing - too much talk and too little real action.  In the end, Harry wins because of those wand "rules."  He doesn't beat Voldemort - Voldemort's mistake about the Elder Wand ends up undoing him (it really wouldn't have mattered at all what Harry did or didn't do).<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Rowling ends her novel two and a half pages after the Harry-Voldemort showdown.  After hundreds of pages about Horcruxes, Hallows, and wands, we get nothing about how these characters handle the aftermath of this epic war.  How does Harry deal with the deaths of his friends?  How do the Weasleys deal with Harry?  What happens to little Teddy . . . or Luna . . . or countless others mentioned only in passing?  What is it like for epic heroes to come home from the war and face life again?  What has been lost?  What has been gained?  This is the heart of this series of novels - the quest has always been to find a way to live in peace and love and harmony.  Rowling gives us none of that, however.<br/><br/>Except in that awful Epilogue.  She gives us seven pages on Platform 9 ¾ set 19 years after the battle at Hogwarts.  We see Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and even Draco and his wife . . . all with children of their own ready to begin their magical education at Hogwarts.  We learn that Teddy is fine (orphaned but resilient), Neville is a professor at Hogwarts, and Harry has given his oldest son Snape's name (well, as a middle name anyway - the boy is called Albus Severus).  We're supposed to be happy about all this suburban bliss, all these comfortably complacent families waiting together for the Hogwarts Express.  But what has changed in this world?  What was all that Good vs. Evil stuff all about?  Is the magical world still hidden and separate from the Muggle world?  Wasn't it part of the fight to bring those two worlds together once and for all?  Is Slytherin House still a bastion for bigots and racists?  Little Albus Severus worries that the Sorting Hat might put him in Slytherin - and Harry tries to tell him that one of his namesakes, Severus Snape, was a Slytherin and the bravest man he has ever known.  If that's true, then why, after 19 years, are children still labeling Slytherins as dark and evil?  If Voldemort is gone, if the war has been won, why aren't all of the Houses at Hogwarts united for the common good?  I guess we'll never know.<br/><br/>Overall, `Deathly Hallows' isn't a bad read.  All of us who love these characters will enjoy immersing ourselves in their world one last time.  It just isn't the book it could have been . . . or the book it should have been.  It's a disappointment, and since it's the last book we'll probably ever read about Harry's world, that's a shame.  So I give it 2 ½ stars - rounded up to 3 because it's Harry, after all.
 I live in england but i decided to purchase the american versions of the books as i love the design of the covers and the pictures that head each chapter.<br/>I also liked the design of the box, instead of the box that the english versions come in, which to be honest is quite bland.<br/>I really love this set of harry potter books, the detail of the trunk is great and the stickers that are included in the set to decorate the trunk are brilliant quality.<br/>This would be an amazing gift for any harry potter fan, i have many items in my collection, such as film prop replicas, cards etc. and i've got to say that this is the best item i have in my collection.<br/>I have two young children and it will be a great family heirloom to pass down through the generations, as i know they will love these books as much as i do and the magical atmosphere that they set when you are reading them is truly captivating.<br/>Overall, if you are deliberating on whether or not to buy this item, i think you definitely should because in my opinion it will be one of the best things you could ever buy and it is a great thing to own
 This is a must have for anyone who has followed this series.  And by the way for anyone who hasn't.  JKRowling is amazing.  Her books are so easy to read and draw you in to where you won't want to put them down.
 Deathly Hallows is the climax and closing to the 7 book Harry Potter series. It's urgent pacing will leave readers enthralled and utterly spent until the last chapter where readers may finally catch their breath.<br/><br/>I would also suggest HP enthusiasts acquiring the unabridged audio books reads by Jim Dale. He brings the characters to life and color to your imagination.
 Another fine reading by Jim Dale! I am never disappointed with his interpretation of the books.<br/>I would definitely recommend this to any HP fan.
 I love this book, but at the same time I hate it, because it's the end to one of the best series written in this generation. The Deathly Hallows has a wonderful story but it's not flawless.  Throughout the plot twists towards the end, it feels a bit rushed, and a bit confusing (over the ownership of the elder wand). Nevertheless it's still a great book to have, and I would suggest this book to anyone who is a fan of the genre (and maybe even if you're not).
 This story tape had my seven year old son in his room most of the day on a weekend day to hear all of the story, all 8 disks. That is no small feat and shows how both JK Rowling's captivating story and Jim Dale's reading of it are both spellbinding. Unequalled imagination. Get it for your kids. They will be thrilled and enjoy many quiet hours. You may sneak in to listen, too!
 As this is the last in the series, all I can do is wait for the movie.  The book was well thought out and told in an interesting way.  Any Harry Potter fan who hasn't already gotten the book, should definitely do so.
 this series is amazing and the Hogwarts spines make this the total package!!! Harry Potter is the best series I've ever read!! This makes the movies look like nothing!!
 The book is beautiful.
 The package of almost 8 kilograms contains the complete book set in the style box and also a set of Hogwart's stickers. Everything is of a great quality and it has surprised me to get the set of such a style and magic atmosphere! It is very easy to take out each book from the box, because there is enough space. But not too much for books to move unwillingly. Each book is bound in a cloth and over it, there is a splendid paper cover with a glossy, plastic title. The text inside is perfectly readable. I would like to recommend it to real fans as a brilliant peace of magic into your book-case.
 What's to say. If you like Harry potter than you will be pleased. IT'S A BOOK, as long as the print is legible and you like the story than what els matters.
 I ordered this package for my sister, for her birthday.  Only because I absolutely love the Harry Potter series!  People who just watch the movies are missing out on so much!  I loan out my Harry Potter books all the time, it's a great release and a fabulous story!!
 Like the others, I know for a fact that the pre release description was a WOODEN box.  As I bought the books as gift, the receipient will not share my disappointment and will love the books and probably throw the box away in the other Christmas wrapping trash.  This is the first time I recall a deceptive description from Amazon, and I am very disappointed by it.
 Love it!
 best book I ever read .so glad Iread it .it kept my attention for the whole book.at first it is alittle boring but then gets  really good .
 This is the greates book I have ever read, and I want more!!!<br/>J.K. Rowling rocks, please keep on writting!!!!!
 This was her best book yet!  I was really glad to see the story unfold - and with more detail and excitement than I anticipated too!  I'm sad to see the story end but she did a marvelous job at wrapping it up and having all of her books tie together in this final story.  I would definitely recommend this book and this series to anyone!
 She's done it again. This was one of the best books in the series. An excellent follow up and more child friendly than some (older child anyway). This book did an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends, giving answers to all the unanaswered questions, and having a generally satisfactory conclusion to a huge story. A must read for any fan and not a book to be feared as some of the hype might have led you to believe.
 Granddaughter  loved it.
 The best and darkest of the series.  The first 100 pages were kind of slow.
 When the final book in the series came out, I splurged and bought this set. They are so much easier to carry around than the giant hard-back editions. I was originally just going to replace book 1, since mine fell in the bathtub and swelled to about three times its normal size, but I'm glad I got the whole set because they look nice being all the same size on my bookshelf. (I mean, why not?)
 For all the issues I have with JK Rowling, Jim Kay brought the magic back and made the experience even better than it was on the first read. His illustrations and beautiful. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the choices in that they aren't as imaginative or out-of-the-box as they could be (i.e. all of the main characters are still very white, and all look a bit similar to the movie interpretations despite some slight changes). However, the illustrations are beautiful and magical and fantastic.
 The books arrived very quickly and at a reasonable price.<br/>There were a few pages that had ink smears making some of the text difficult to read but this was from the printer.
 I am not a Harry Potter fan, but most other people in my family are, and this book completed their collections. It made nice gifts for them. It arrived on the day of release, and was way cheaper than in the stores.
 This is a book, and series, you can read over and over again. This was a great ending to me series, with much more details than the movies provide. Very well written, makes you want to keep reading....very hard to put down! The book itself and the book art are good quality, very sturdy and will last for years to come. Don't hesitate to purchase this addition to your library.
 😭😭😭😭😭 those feels man, but good book. I need more Harry Potter, please, if only I could have just one more book.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an absolute must for anyone who's read the first 6 books in the series. The Deathly Hallows takes you through Harry's last adventure to destroy the evil Lord Voldemort. J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job in tying up the story to a very satisfying ending I think all will be pleased with.
 Three words: buy this book!! No further explanations are necessary really. The book explains in much detail the story line behind each relevant character. It shows you their flaws, their strengths and their ultimate downfalls. It also neatly wraps up the storylines of Harry, Ron and Hermoine. This book is a sweet and magical read. Will hold you from the first word to the last one.
 5 stars. Duh. It's Harry Potter.
 I have loved these books since I was a child. Harry Potter was what first got me into reading anything. I had bought all the books as they came to shelves. Unfortunatly i lost them all sometime after I moved from my parents house. So i decided to buy this box set. Let me start by saying that I was fully aware when I purchaced this from reading other reviews that they would be ariving in a cardboard box. Personaly, I am not impressed with the box but that is not why I bought this. I bought these books to read them. So if your looking for a collectors item, this isnt it. However, if you are looking for some wonderful books to read or have already read Harry Potter and want hardback copys, this set is worth it.
 Wow I am so happy I found this book. I have all the paperbacks but the illustrations in this book are mind-blowing! Amazon beats any in store price I've seen. I'm so excited to collect these. FYI one book is released every October. Sorcerer's Stone was released 2015, Chamber of Secrets 2016, so Deathly Hallows should come out October 2021.
 Highly enjoyed this final book to this series. While I disliked one statement by Dumbledore in the second to last book, this final book seemed to hit the mark.  I particularly enjoyed the family building uplifting message that love can see us through difficult times.  The example of Harry being the kind of man that was brave, clever and masculine enough to be a guide, protector and provider for those that depended upon him is a good role model for boys in a world that otherwise mocks men as stooges and incompetents.  Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing good role models for both sexes in these books.
 This book is awesome!
 Like wow it was totally cool. It was like I was really there. The books are awesome compared to the movies
 Certainly a dramatic conclusion to the HP books.  Very well written and with enough twists and turns to keep your attention.  One remarkable conclusion upon finishing it was how the symbolism of the Master Mason's Degree can be found within the pages.  Don't know if Rowling has become a member of one of the Masonic obediences that accept women, but she sure has concluded her HP series with a new version of the 3rd Degree of Masonry.  This is a book for all ages not just young people.
 Arrived sooner than expected. No issues
 It's Harry Potter! What else can I say? These are simply the twelve more words that are required I write.
 gorgeous, gorgeous illustrations.
 Took awhile for it to get to me even with 2 day shipping and some pages had little folds. Other than that all was well. Was a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it, so I can't be mad.
 I originally gave this 5 stars for the price, in spite of the cheap cardboard trunk, but due to the publisher's and Amazon's poor quality control, I must give this a lower rating. Book 4 has a section of duplicate pages where missing pages should be, and Book 7 has creased pages with blurred print. Amazon will not replace individual books within the set, so I must take all 18 lbs to UPS and make arrangements to be home for another UPS delivery.
 perosnally I disliked the last scene of this book. Rowling jumps ahead and shows us the future of the group as adults. It was stupid and it felt so rushed.<br/>Still, I loved the rest so much I couldn't penalize it a star. haha
 I was very happy with the shipment and product. It arrived in a timely fashion.
 Awesome
 Wife loved it!!!!
 Once you start you can't stop reading this amazing story. And it is so nice that we have faces from the movies to match with the names. Plus it is a very good deal for the price!
 The picture is misleading... It looks like a sturdy box with metal corners and such. All of it is a printed mess on laminated plastic-cardboard like material. Excellent books inside mind you - just crappy presentation and packaging. The imagery of the product are there to mislead you into thinking that a quality chest was created in order to store your books. Obviously the prototype was used and may have been made out of a decent material.<br/><br/>The actual shipment of the object wasn't given much thought. The corners were crushed rather nicely - further detracting from the display.
 This product was received in exceptional shape; all books were in great condition and no marks, blemishes, or nicks on any of them.  The turn around on shipping was faster than expected and I received my item in approximately one week instead of about 3.
 I set out to buy this for my cousin as a birthday gift, but I decided to keep it for myself and buy her something else HP related. Anyway, having already read all the books years ago, I just had to keep them for myself. A beautiful set of books for my shelf. If you are a HP fan, then this is a great set to add to your collection. Or, if you've never read the books and would like to start, this is the perfect set.
 Better than the first!<br/>Cant wait to read # 3... ready for more adventure an imagination with Harry and the gang.
 I have read all the HP books, but was borrowing them from my sister.  Once #6 came out, I knew I needed to read #5 to refresh my memory.  I came across the box set, and it is perfect to go back to for a refresher, but also excellent to add onto as more books come out.
 The illustrations are just fantastic!!
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son.  It is very heavy for him to carry however I think he feels that makes it more substantial! He loved the box it came in and has covered it with all the Hogwarts stickers which were included - even the Slytherin ones!  The book jackets are really cute and just perfect for little kids and I'm sure it is something my son will look after and cherish for many years.  It was admittedly a very expensive gift as I also had to pay courier fees from the U.S. to Australia to get here in time for Christmas but I think it is well worth the expense if it encourages children to read.  I think that if it had included H.P. bookmarks then that would have been just the ultimate.
 Great read!
 It's so beautiful my daughter and I love it.
 My daughter, age 9, is up to the 5th book in the Harry Potter series, and had been wanting the whole collection for some time.  She was elated on Christmas morning to see her very own Harry Potter trunk, with the whole set.  The books are hardback and lovely, and now my husband can get started on reading the series.  She also enjoyed the House crest stickers, which she put on various family members (she gave her baby sister Hufflepuff, for example) and her trunk.  Very cute collection.
 The book set is beautiful. However I was slightly stunned to find the container is simply a cardboard box! I thought it would be wood but I suppose that is an unrealistic expectation for the price. The price is a "deal" if for the books only, and the "chest" is a nice display even if it is cardboard! Overall, I'm wonderfully pleased.
 I loved this book but now I forgot about the rating of this book so I am now on the order of the Phoenix and I love the book from the first page to where I am now.<br/>Harry potter and the chamber of secrets.
 I got this for my daughter who loves Harry Potter.  The set is nice but the box that holds the books was damaged in shipping, which was a bit of a disappointment for me.  It is supposed to be a nice display case for the books but instead it's banged up.  My daughter isn't picky so she didn't complain but maybe the seller could do a better job packaging it for others in the future, especially at this price.
 LOVE IT, THIS BOOK HAD AN OUTSTANDING PLOT AND STORY. THE PLOT TWIST WAS AMAZING CAN'T WAIT READ THE NEXT ONE!!!!
 It was a very intriguing book. It had a lot of action. I would recommend this book to children ages10+. It wasn't to scary but still difficult to stop reading.
 Absolutely nice book and quality was pretty good
 It said the books were "Used" but they looked brand new, very pleased with my purchase
 The books had never been opened before they were sent to me, and they're awesome! Just as described!
 If you're a fan of J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series, there is no question that you were waiting and couldn't wait; and for me to rate it any less than 5 stars would make me a traitor.
 Fantastic ending to a great series of books. A must read by any Potter fan.
 Awesome.
 This set was purchased as a gift.  My family has already read the entire Harry Potter series, but my niece and nephews have not.  This was a Christmas gift for them.  The package arrived within 5 days, and the box was in excellent condition with the plastic wrapping completely intact.  This was a great value for gift giving, as buying each individual book would have been a good bit more expensive.  I know my niece and nephews will love reading the books as much as my family did.
 this was the best book ever I challenge anyone to a duel who does not agree with me it is great for anyone.
 I am a 31 year old who bought the books after having listened to them each at least six times.  Every time I hear the tales on tape I am transported to a whole different exciting fantasy land of magic and dragons.<br/>I can't wait for the next book!
 Though many many many people have been giving bad reviews of this item, I would like to give the opposite.<br/><br/>I live in Australia - and here we get the UK Versions of the books. I purchased this item because I wanted to see what the American version of the books were like. They are fantastic in comparison!! Let me tell you that - not only do you get extra illustrations for each chapter, but the book is bigger and thicker which makes them a lot more attractive.<br/><br/>Though a lot of people dislike the 'chest' - not many have mentioned that though it is cardboard, it is still sturdy. It is only going to fall apart if you jump up and down on it or spend the time to rip it apart.<br/><br/>With the UK edition Box Set (all 7 books) you only get a filmsy slip case, which is far more likely to be destroyed then the cardboard box that comes with the US editions.<br/><br/>Sure - a wooden box would have been preferred - but would you pay an added $50+ for it?
 She did it up big for the ending.  Plenty of spoilers to be had....
 The fact that the film adaptation is going to be split into two full-length feature films should tell you how much stuff is in this book, and how much the filmmakers wish to honor the amazing finale of J.K. Rowling's series. The book definitely deserves it, and you'll see why when you read it. Obviously make sure you have read all the other books in the series first, then embark on the journey for yourself.
 We're introducing Harry Potter to our 6 year old - and this is a good way to do it!  We listen to the audio books in the car, and then review/continue with the book itself.  Sometimes, we even give my 6 year old (who has just started reading...) the book to follow along with the audiobook.
 As described, fast shipping!
 She loved it!
 love it
 Audio book was great, Stephen Fry's vocal talents enhance the already gripping story line, making it difficult to switch off. It has been the cause of several late night when I found it really hard to turn off.
 Got the Boxed Set for my niece and nephew for Christmas, because they'd never read the books and I thought it would be a nice way to present them.  It really is a great boxed set, very heavy and substantial and I think worth the money.  The books are great, of course, but you can buy them in lots of ways. I thought this was a lot nicer than just buying a bunch of random books and wrapping them up.
 When receiving your cardboard trunk, remember that this item, like the books, can be brought the life with your imagination. Be happy if you can afford this and buy it up; I've never had such a nice feeling as knowing one day, I'll be able to hand these hardcovers to my children, so they can experience what I do repeatedly; the excellence of the magic word and world of HP.
 The quality of the books was a little disappointing. But as I'm in it for the reading, not the collecting, it wasn't too big of a deal to me. Some of the books looked a lil sloppy and after reading about people missing pages I'm going to check mine. Did they just take all the overstock from the past and shove it in a cardboard box tho?
 I was very pleased with the books. I knew the box was going to be cheap and it's just made out of cardboard and like others have in their reviews it has unfinished edges. But I really don't mind (it'll help protect the books better than if they were out in the open or on a bookshelf), I thought it was cute and it was on sale and I wanted my own set of Harry Potter books since we just have a family set and once I'm on my own I didn't want to have to fight over them. The stickers are nice, not sure what I'm going to do with them yet, I don't want to put them on the box. But overall the books were all in brand new condition and I'm looking forward to rereading the series again.
 It's breathe taking!  I think the box is fantastic.  Really yes it's cardboard but it's great.  I didn't know what I was expecting to get book wise because I live in Canada.  I've always wanted to have the American version as well as the Canadian also, and when I saw the complete books 1-7 I had to have it.  And wow the books are huge compared to the Canadian ones, just massive.  But they are gorgeous.<br/><br/>I think everyone should buy this boxset.  Even though it is CARDBOARD it's still a great way to store all seven books.  I wasn't disappointed at all.
 I got this as a Christmas present, and I LOVE it. I love that they are all the original versions of the book series (original cover art) and that they are all hardcover.<br/><br/>I love the "chest" it comes in. The chest is made of cardboard and comes with a latch made of plastic, which shoelace handles on each side. I'm contemplating getting an actual chest/trunk for this, but it wouldn't have the Harry Potter writing on it, so ehh.
 Book was in excellent condition.  It was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She was thrilled with the book!
 Our granddaughter requested this for Christmas, since it finishes the saga of Harry Potter.  Fast service and a superior product.
 I love the illustrations! I also like how none of the pages are completely plain, even if there is not one illustration on a page, the page itself is often embellished with various appropriate patterns and not always the same pattern either. You can stare are Kay's illustrations for a long time and if you look closely you might find a few easter eggs. The Diagon Alley pages are especially amusing as Kay has added many more shops than just the one that Rowling describes.
 Listened to it several times,  You can't go wrong with the Harry Potter books.  And this Audio version is great way to experience the book without the book.
 These books where a steal.  They are in great condition and my son is enjoying them.  Thanks amazon for a great book.
 No spoilers here! I feel that perhaps I must have read a different book that the rest of the rave reviews.  I liked the book.  I thought the conclusion was fantastic and that Rowling did a magnificent job pulling together the threads of the past plots, and winding them all together to create a cohesive ending.<br/><br/>But I also feel that the book was too long.  It seems that Rowling felt like she *had* to put the climax of the book at the end of the Hogwart's school year, and that the rest of the book was just waiting around to get there.  Too much time was spent wandering around and hiding, rather than taking action.  Voldy and his Death Eater's are reeking havoc about the land, and our three heroes are hiding at various locations.  I expected more of an longstanding battle to progress throughout the entire book.  The events that took place while the heroes were in hiding felt contrived.<br/><br/>Also the epilogue left a lot to be desired.  It was not well thought out, and left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Why do it at all if you aren't going to brief about the other characters and the state of the wizarding world post-climatic event?<br/><br/>Overall, the Deathly Hallows is a fitting conclusion to the Harry Potter series, though, but I do not feel it is a 5 star book or in anyway the best of the series.
 Purchased for a friend, he enjoyed.
 The content of the books is great. Obviously, it's Harry Potter. But the condition of the books were listed as "very good" and when they came, there were corners bent back of the covers and inside pages of the books. And even worse, I was disgusted to find chunks of pet hair stuck to the sides of the pages of the books. Clumps of it. Everywhere. So gross.
 This is a great deal if you feel like marathoning through the series or taking your time with it. Havimg them all on a Kindle is awesome, and as reluctant as I am to admit it; so much more convenient than a conventional book. I left my kindle at work one night while I was reading Order of the Phoenix so I lugged out my old hardcover from my library, and I totally forgot how huge and heavy the original books were! When the fifth book first came out, I used to carry that thing in my arms going back and forth to Boston, and riding on the T...didn't think nothing of it back then. Needless to say after trying to wrestle that mammoth of a book, I went straight back to work the next day, and promptly secured my Kindle in my bag where it stayed until I got home, and turned it on to keep reading where I left off! Never again! Ha ha! Get it, you won't regret it, and it definitely is an awesome value!
 Amazing!<br/>Very cool and really fun!<br/>Great book for parents or kids.<br/>Once you've read the book you should watch the movie.
 The second installment was pretty solid. I bought the book as a gift for my girlfriend who has never read the series before and after the first one she was excited to receive the second. The book's condition was as advertised and the delivery was within the stated time so I was very happy. I would buy from this seller again.
 Its sad to know this is the last book in the series. This series has done so much to get kids reading again and away from the TV, Game Boy, etc. etc. Always keep kids in books, your never sorry if you do.
 Wonderful ending to this story that took years to tell.<br/>Although the tale has been told, there is a glimmer of hope that<br/>may lead to an eventual continuance.<br/><br/>Thank you JK Rowling for keeping us entertained for may years.
 I am still listening to the CD's but it is by far the best Harry Potter yet.  Everything connects and people I spoke with say it continues to be good all the way through.  Listen to the first ones though to truly appreciate this one.
 Another phenomenal book by JK Rowling. It's so easy to utterly immerse yourself wholly into Harry Potter's world. It takes a truly amazing mind to write such a series. She is second only to Tolkien.
 This box set came and looked exactly how I imagined and wanted it to. Looks pristine and holds this wonderful story nicely.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is an epic story for all ages. If someone is hesitant on picking up a book and starting to read again (let's get real, most of us only read books when we have to and a lot of that was in school) this is definitely a good place to start and get motivated.
 These are the Harry Potter novels, 5 stars, modern classics, enough said.  Great for books for adults as well as children in case you aren't familiar with them and have been living under a rock.
 I gobbled this book up in a day, then reread it slowly and enjoyed it so much. I am sorry to see it end but could not have asked for anything more.<br/>I am sure I will read this series over and over again.
 Not my favorite book in the series, but you'll probably hear that about the first two books from a lot of people. By all means this is an important book in the series and I'd never suggest anyone skip this one over or read it half-heartedly, but thankfully this is the last book you'll read in the series before you realize that there is more darkness to the Harry Potter universe than anyone first noticed.
 awsome
 I doubt anyone would be disappointed with this conclusion to the Harry Potter series.  Lot of action and a great storyline.  Also for those serious Potter finatics the necessary closure is included in the Epilogue.
 always.
 One of the discs skipped a few times other than that all is good.
 This is a great collection to read no matter if it is your first time reading or your 100th. Great for all ages.
 I ordered this because Harry Potter is one of my favorite book series and I have read them repeatedly. I do not like to give my hard cover books a beating bc of their cost and value so I was very excited to finally be able to have book 7 in paperback for frequent re-reading. I recieved my order witin 3 days and the book came in perfect condition, as promised.
 I often reread the HP series and this is the book that always slows me down. I just hate the character of Lockhart and just glaze past the pages that he appears on. The rest of the book is solid and overall the story is enjoyable.
 Love these books!
 Is a gift and know it will be enjoyed.
 There's nothing like seeing a child's eyes light up when they open up their Christmas present to find this collection waiting for them inside. The complete JK Rowling collection delivers itself in a sturdy packaging and brings more to the storyline than the movies. A great gift for any teenage fan.
 J.K. Rowling is a superb story teller, I enjoyed each installment of Harry Potter and was glad with the story line's ending.
 You won't be disappointed by any of the Potter books. Just get all of them. It is hard to put down once you open the first page. I have a friend who asked me whether he still needs to read the books since he has seen the movies (5 movies so far), but the joy of Harry Potter lies not just in the motion pictures. You will experience much more inside the books: the language Joanna Rowling uses, richer characters and more twists, a world full of imagination. I felt strong resonance while I was reading Harry Potter; the enchanted world is really a reflection of our current society.
 I was not sure just what a 'Library Binding Edition' was all about.  It is an extra heavy (durable) binding - I guess to withstand heavy usage.  I very much like the weight of it.  The retailer sent it along quite promptly.  And in new condition as advertised.  The story, of course, speaks for itself.  I cannot say that I enjoyed the ending - but, the journey was entertaining!
 I read it for the first time when i was a little kid. I have read it a million times I'll read it's million more.
 Nice gift for that fan of Harry Potter.
 Do I really need to say more? It's the final Harry Potter book. A great end to a great series.
 The second book in a captivating 7-part series that has won me over. Vividly painted worlds blended together to form a wonderful book that is sure to get to the heart of (almost) every child and adult alike!
 If you liked Sorcerers Stone then you'll definitely like Chamber of Secrets. One of the great thing about this series I think is that each book gets better and better. Again GREAT series and I highly recommend it for anyone!
 Package arrived in great condition, and was just as advertised.  My girlfriend is a huge Harry Potter nerd and she absolutely loved this collection.  It came in a nice little box, and each book was wrapped carefully.  I appreciated the quality of this item for the price, as a local bookstore wanted double the price as what I paid here.  If you are a fan of the books or movies, this would be a great addition to your collection.  I definitely recommend.
 This set is the harry potter fan's dream!! It is beautiful to put on display and is so fun. It is in a trunk like the ones they would use to pack for school ;) and the books are beautiful and great quality. The trunk isn't the BEST quality but it is great. It is a thick cardboard material that is coated. The books can be hard to get out when they're all in there, but that comes with all box sets. I love this and don't regret buying it.
 I red just books 5, 6 and 7 and really loved them. The only thing is that the hardbook cover makes the book to heavy and your hand may hurt after hours of reading, If you haven't read it I would recommend to get the paper cover, if it available.
 This CD was just as mesmerizing as the book except I could do other things while I listened! I didn't want to put stop listening! Jim Dale is great with the voices for the characters. I could picture the frail Olivander talking about the Hallows and feel Harry's pain as he manually dug the grave by the sea.  This is the end of the Happy Potter series but you will definately want to start from the beginning of the series to know what other trials Harry faced and how he got to this point.
 I love love love these books!!!!
 I don't usually review but I wanted to comment on the quality of the box. Obviously it is not a metallic strong box, but I think it is greatly done for the price &amp; purpose. It is made of various layers of thick cardboard and is very sturdy. I disagree with the reviewers that say it is flimsy. It cannot be used as a suitcase but it is GREAT to keep things in (either the books or other things) and looks lovely on a bookcase.<br/><br/>The books are wonderful obviously and great editions.
 We had bought all the other books of this series in hard cover to collect and missed picking this book up, so I was really happy to find it.  It arrived when promised and met all expectations.
 I enjoyed this final episode in the lives of Harry, Ron and Hermione.  It was the best of the series. I thought the ending was as it should be. Could not put it down.  Look forward to other books by Rowling.
 this book has all of the elements a great sequel needs. it is funny and thriller. overall great read aloud for children.
 Awesome
 This was a great conclusion to a great series.In all 7,we see good struggling with evil.We see the good working together to overcome all the obstacles placed in their but they keep struggling. Good wins in the end but only have a united effort. This is a wonderful series and I hope all will read it thoughtfully. Especially,young people--and it wont hurt old people,like me, also.
 I bought this for my son who has all of them, of course. He is 13 now and loves them! I plan on reading them all, I just haven't started yet! But since my husband flipped to the end to see if he lives, do I really need to? haha.
 The perfect way to enjoy a long car ride.  I was nervous about purchasing a used copy but the seller was very accurate in that is was "like new" (at least with the first 10 cd's).  Much to my surprise, it came earlier than expected, making this an even better experience.  Now that we are home, we continue to listen to the beautiful story telling.  I'm a sucker for an accent and this delivers.  With all the media buzz around us, it is nice to take some time with the family and listen to a great story.
 So I've not actually read this yet, I wanted the last two books before I started reading the series (I already had the first five). I have finally started reading the series, I'm on "Year 3" and I'm loving them! I'm reading the book, then my daughter and I are watching that movie, then she reads that book while I start the next one. We are having a blast doing this!! The books just keep getting better and better!!! I highly recommend them.
 This is a really good book. I am ten years old and I also love this book. I am a big reader and this has been one of my favorite books to read.  It did not take me a long time to read.  So, in this book, to me, it gets sort of creepy. Harry is hearing voices in the walls. Also, make sure you read the book before you watch the movie. I think that this is a great summer read or a Christmas break read . This is a great book for all ages. My mom read it to me when I was six. Make sure you read the first book first or else you will not understand it.  AMAZING BOOK!!!!!
 My 5th grader is adicted to Potter everything. I (being rather frugal) wondered whether to get her just the set of books, or this one that includes the case. Definitely happy I got this one with the case. She was/is beyond thrilled with it. It comes with stickers to personalize the trunk. Nice and sturdy which promotes treating them as a keepsake (granted, a well-read keepsake). Best birthday present!
 I am a grown woman and finally got around to ordering the Harry Potter series to read.  I believe it does a lot to encourage kids to read.<br/>JK Rawling is one of the best writers I have ever read. It explains the Harry Potter craze.  I will be sorry to see the ending to this series.<br/>I hope her next series will be just as exciting.
 Fantastic Book!
 I had to replace half my original HP books due to flooding in a basement. I looked for the hardback ones of the ruined ones but the price I paid for the set was still cheaper. I do love having the "trunk" as well - I think it adds a little something to them.<br/><br/>It was definitely worth it. A warning though the "trunk" is cardboard/foamboard. I wasn't expecting it to be wood or anything so it didn't take any value away from the product but maybe it will give someone a heads up who wants it to be more sturdy.
 Sirius-ly stunning! This illustrated book is gorgeous.  As an adult who spent many childhood hours waiting to buy my copy at the bookstore, I just *had* to have a copy of the illustrated version.  It seems like every page has something - a picture, a texture, some little magical aspect to make these books come to life. I cannot wait to collect the rest of the book over the next few years and read them to my son. I treasure it already.
 Amazing as always.
 This was a gift for my son. It was recieved in about three days after its purchase. Was in excellent shape.Packaged as though recieved in a book store. We are all very happy with the total experience.
 I'm an avid reader and the Harry Potter set is one of those books that I can re-read over and over again.  So when we were going to go on a long road trip I thought it would be a great time to buy the audio collection. My fiance and I have listened to the whole set at least 5 times since I purchased this in July 2010 and we're starting our 6th time now.  It's a great set that's really well acted by the reader and you can just see the characters come alive.  I especially love that it's the same reader in all 7 audiobooks.
 I love them!  Son maravillosos!
 she’s gonna love it
 I read the book, I listened to the CD.  The story is very good, the performance on the CD is truly remarkable!  How does that man keep all those voices straight?  I recommend this CD to anyone who has the time to listen!
 These are great books one of my absolute favorite series! They are so captivating, these books are for any age! I would recommend reading the books before seeing the movies of course you get more out of it! J.K. Rowling is so clever the books is very original and well thought out. Over the series you really get to know the characters and she does a great job keeping you interested in the books!
 OMG!!! I love this book,  it's so amazing!  One of my favorite, I wish I could experience the first time reading it over and over again, I'm sure I'll be reading this book many more than once!
 Best book
 Wonddrful
 This last book in the series was a little lopsided. It dragged on a bit with the quest- too much fighting and death for our taste. The ending came abruptly, questions answered although it seemed in a rush. We didn't like it as much as the other books in the series.
 Great Book!! This is by far the best of the series. It is well written and sums up the series well. i hope Rowling keeps writing it would be ashame if she stops. I would put this book up there with some of the greats of fantasy like Stephen King's "the stand" and C.S. lewis's "Narania" (spelling) series.
 Finished the series! Awesome. Glad I was able to read the books on my kindle for free. Really helped me out
 Ah the bittersweet end to the Harry Potter series. It was a great book and intertwined the previous books and drew you into its arms and made you not want to put it down. I really enjoyed the whole series and this one was no exception.
 Great book
 JK nos sorprende una vez mas con sus libros, la presentación del mismo es impecable como siempre. Lo que he leído de la historia es atrapante, le recomiendo a todos los que no lo hayan leído que lo hagan, es excelente.
 I received this set very quickly and haven't been able to put them down since.  I'm currently reading book 5 and hope to have book 6 read before the movie's release this summer.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in this genre!
 Excellent!!!
 I love the Harry Potter series.  I have all of the hardback books in the series and bought this one to complete the paperback series for my kids to read.  This is a very good series and I recommend it highly.  It is good for young readers because it is very easy to get into.
 Received the Harry Potter multiple book set (in paperback) in time for Christmas gift-giving to young nephew who is just discovering Harry Potter novels.  He loved having all the books (except for the final one) in paperback form--his favorite type of book. I appreciated the ease of ordering, not having to wonder if they would arrive in time.  Thanks!
 Hubby is very happy to listen to the books on CD; being a truck driver it helps him pass the times as the miles melt away. He now gets to enjoy what the rest of us have read. He will be listening to books 4 and 5 on his next trip out.
 This was hands down the best book of the seven.  I have read all the books but this was so incredible.  I would read it again and again.  I can't wait till my kids are a little older and we can read it together.  There was so much packed in this book.  It will be a great movie.
 I'm totally pleased with this set of books. The print could be a tiny bit larger but otherwise it's an excellent value and everything else was perfect. The quality of the books is fine, as is the box.
 book
 Box came ripped with broken handle
 good, but not great if you're a collector. as a series, they are attractive, but the box they display in shows a little wear and isn't high quality. these are good condition, though, and still sit on the mantle with my favorites. the lettering on the spines and cover is gold or silver. these are also the best deal i found at $30.56.
 It took me two days to read this book, mostly because at some point I did have to cook, eat and sleep. I felt it was a nice wrap up to the whole Harry Potter saga and one day I will read the series again. I even liked the epilogue short as it was for what it was. I think Rowling did a great job.
 Great sequel to a great book. Read it - you'll enjoy it!<br/>Cheers!
 I am very satisfied with this seller. I bought the book for a great price and I received it in a relatively short period of time. The book itself was as described. I would recommend buying books here!
 After a ,long time in waiting it is finally here and without dissapointment. Harry and tha gang set out again to defeat evil at its own game. I couldn't put it down and the ending is what I expected.
 I Love HP and I've read all the books and they are all awesome. If you havn't...I suggest you pick up all 7 of the Harry Potter books. The Deathly Hallows is amazing. Harry finally fights Lord Voldermort but, he loses some of the people he loves. I was heart broken when ... died. Great book!
 Great reading
 Lovely book, can't wait to read the rest! Hermione is the best character, finally making smart girls the coolest girls.
 I had stopped being a Harry Potter fan after the fifth book.  I didn't really like how the story was going at the time.  However, I did want to know how the series ended, and so I watched the movie.  I liked the movie, and this caused me to want to read the book.<br/><br/>The movie was a little more appealing in that it made things have a nicer ending.  The book is a little bit more realistic.  For instance, the way Hedwig died.  In the movie, she dies defending Harry.  It is sad but sweet.  In the book, she was angry with Harry for keeping her locked in her cage.  She gets killed while riding with him when a killing spell hits her in her cage.  That is just sad.<br/><br/>The book can be a little tiresome to read because it also has more interpersonal fighting between our three heroes.  However, the book does give more information.  For instance, something the movie never quite explains--how did the Deatheaters find the trio so quickly after they disappeared from the wedding.  You also learn more about who R.A.B. was and his tragic end.  This is something that is not really explained in the movie.  You learn the identity, but you don't know the reason why he did what he did.<br/><br/>People who think Dumbledore was so great that he had chocolate coming out of his butt may get upset with this book, which reveals Dumbledore's imperfections and his mistakes.  To his credit, Dumbledore seemed to be someone who learned from his mistakes and tried to always do good.<br/><br/>One thing I did like about this book was that we did see more of the villains in it.  One thing that has consistently annoyed me with J.K. Rowling with this series is that her bad guys always felt like an afterthought.  I really liked the Malfoys, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Voldemort...and I was disappointed that more was not done with these characters.  However, at least we have more scenes with them in this book.<br/><br/>Of course, be prepared to be traumatized.  Like a Shakespearean play, a good many favorite characters get killed.
 It was a very nice set, came packaged nicely.  Not only is Rowling an incredible author, but I was able to enjoy the books before I expected to.  They arrived quickly.
 This was purchased for a gift and it much .
 JK does not disappoint in this final book. Darker than the rest but shows how much Harry and his friends have grown. It made me want to read the whole series again. (Which I did:-) I was thrilled with the way she strung together all the bits and peices that were mentioned here and there in the previous book. She did a good job of balancing everything out to make a grand finale.
 The box set came to me quick and in mint condition!  I really couldn't have asked for a better transaction!  The books arrived well within the given arrival dates, and were obviously brand-new, or atleast unopened!  I am very happy with this dealer and would not hesitate to purchase for them again in the future.
 What else is there to say?  If you haven't heard of Harry Potter, something's wrong w/you.  Books are awesome, delivered quickly.  Description of the item were to the T.  Couldn't have gotten them any better than it arrived!
 A Great wrap up to a great series....I am now going through Harry Potter withdrawl!!
 The end to the greatest story ever told.
 Excellent shape enjoyed it.
 I got this novel for my girlfriend, and she absolutely LOVED it. She has not stopped talking about it since she started reading it. I would highly recommend this book for any Harry Potter fan. Thanks Amazon for the superior price/service!
 I think this is a proper finale for the series, everything comes into place. Very nice travel throught all the scenarios of the rest of the book, very nice ending chapters and epilogue
 I LOVE HARRY POTTER!  So, this is the last book of harry potter :(((. It's sad that it's the last book but, this book was great! It tells you everything you need to know. It answers soo many questions. If you love harry potter you need to get this book. I got the hard cover because I don't like the paper back books I don't like the lines it makes on the spine. I bought the book online on pottermore last year for my birthday and I just finished reading the whole book today it took me a year but I finished it again, last time I read it, it was back in 2009 so of course I didn't really remember much until I started to read the book again. I bought the hard cover book for my birthday this year which was this month and thought it was a nice birthday present since I love Harry potter. I still have to buy again the 2,3, and 6th boo. And of course read it again. So like I said if you've read the other sixth books you have to read the last book. Like everyone says " the books are always better then the movies" and it is soo true. Happy reading!
 Before ordering this box set, I hadn't read any of the Harry Potter books.  I did some research on the price of the box set of these books, and a brand new set at bookstores would have cost almost twice as much.  On Amazon, I was able to get the box set for around $45, and they even threw in free shipping. I ordered the books on a Monday night and was told they probably wouldn't arrive for about a week and a half to two weeks.  Well I was pleasantly surprised when I checked the mail on Thursday of the same week that I had ordered the books, and they had arrived!  The books were in perfect condition, with the set still being factory sealed.  I have ordered items, mostly books, from Amazon before and have always been pleased.  This order, what with the free standard shipping, fast arrival, and perfect condition of the books, has far surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>Now onto the actual books themselves.  I admit I was somewhat skeptical when my friends recommended this series to me. I thought I couldn't possibly be interested in reading books for 9-12 year olds, being that I am over twice as old as the recommended reading age.  Now obviously the books are a quick read for adults, but it is also one of the most well written and interesting series I've ever read.  I finished the first two books in two days.  Whenever I was not reading, I wanted to be because I was so curious about what was going to happen next.  Rowling does an excellent job of making sure the plots and their turnouts are not predictable, so it's a fun read up to the very last page.
 So great!
 The perfect ending to a page-turning series! Couldn't put it down!
 The seller described the condition of the used books in great detail, which I appreciated. The books did not have to be in mint condition for me. I just wanted them readable and not falling apart and at a reasonable price. I was a little worried about buying used books I could not see and inspect first but these arrived at my home in a timely manner and exactly as described.
 Attractive packaging, sturdy boxed set of quality-bound paperbacks. An excellent buy for a collector or for someone who wishes to keep the books for a second or third read. Makes an excellent gift for a Harry Potter beginner as well.
 This was not the chest/case we saw in the initial promotion for the collection. We were very disappointed when it arrived. I was expecting a faux leather or faux wood, but cardboard and plastic? It doesn't even look good from across the room, let alone the 5 feet away that some suggest.
 Thank you J.K. Rowling, it was a good book and a good ending.<br/><br/>My only wish is for another book, how about writing about Harry's parents?  I would buy and read a prequel, just an idea.
 I ordered this book as a gift so I did not read it myself but I was told it was wonderful (as to be expected from Harry Potter).  The book was delivered just as promised promptly on the release date in excellent condition.  It also came in a wonderful shipping box with creative Harry Potter sayings.  I pre-ordered it so it was the BEST deal with super saver shipping and a $5 off coupon.  I was very happy to have purchased it through Amazon.
 Excellent!  Boxed set keeps paperback books neat and orderly for these well read books.  The works themselves are of course new classics to be treasured for years to come. The author is well-deserving of the success she is experiencing for bringing people back to the world of reading.
 As always, the audio version of the Harry Potter series is excellent!  I thoroughly enjoyed this long-awaited conclusion to the series!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a>
 Bought the set as a birthday gift for my 50+ year old mother. She is thrilled with them. I got them on sale for $50 so that was a great bonus. The books are individually wrapped and the container they come in is pretty sturdy, but it's not really anything special as the description leads you on to believe.
 I never read Harry Potter as a kid. I never was a reader then. But since Highschool I began to love books. I'm almost 25 and I had an all mighty NEED to read them after so long. This set is satisfying to me because it's the same covers that I've seen as a kid and they're neatly in their box that comes with stickers. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend anyone who hasn't read Harry Potter to do so NOW. No matter what age. :)
 Great book
 What do you say when have watched Harry grow up...J.K.Rowling has given<br/>me a brother,son,friend.etc.
 Good looking book.  Can't wait to share it with my kids.
 It was brilant! Did herself proud. A very super story teller that shows shes still got what it takes. From page one, I was hooked. So what else is new? I was sorry that so many characters died, but in the end...good will always defeat evil and love conquers all. Harry Potter will live forever! To JK, well done you!
 I loved the book, but very sad to see the end of a great series!!! Was very glad Rowling ended the book the way she did!
 Harry Potter is one of the best books ever.  I have read 10 books this summer and the first two Harry Potter books were amazing.  The Chamber of Secrets completely shocked me at the end and made me hungry for more.  Its cute story of magic and mystery is easy to read yet very fufilling.  I recommend this book to 7 year olds to 100 year olds.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Paperback-Box-Set-Books-1-7/dp/0545162076/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)</a> i bought this set about a month and a half ago and i loved it i have read it 6 times already since i bought it. granted i have read them before but now i can read them anytime i want because i own them lol.  i feel J.K. Rowling is one of the best authors out i feel she compares with Stephen King and Stephine Meyer and James Patterson some of my all time favorite writers i am hoping now that she finished the harry potter series that maybe she will go on to write other things of that sort but if she does i will defiantly go out and by it.
 I got this set for my Grandson, who is 7 and an avid reader. It was delivered today and I got the best phone call from a very happy young man. I love that Amazon makes this kind of thing not only possible, but easy!<br/>His Mom was also pleased with the quality of the books and that they came in a nice presentation box.
 This book is the best ever of all the seven, and leaves the reader wondering what happened over the nineteen year gap?  Leaving the reader wanting more adventures, says everything about this book.
 I love the price and having all the books in one convenient place. The stickers are pretty cool to ahve on there as well. Great collection piece that my children should enjoy, too.<br/><br/>My only complaint is against the trunk. It feels like it may fall apart with only slight abuse which children tend to dish out quite frequently. It is cardboard and paper...of course, that is not the most important part to me so it's no big deal.
 I love the words and the description, and I also love how J.K. Rowling did nineteen years in the future.
 Great pictures
 Great package and very affordable.  Easy to take along to long waits in the Doctor's office or lunches alone.<br/><br/>Hey!  It's "'erry pot-er", as Hagrid would say.  How can it be bad?!
 I'd recommend the book, on the whole, but it was a disappointing (and perhaps prematurely published) capstone to the series . . . too many "deus ex machina" loose ends, too many "functional" (but unsatisfying) plot contrivances. Were I J.K.'s editor, I'd have excised the last chapter (fast-forward to the future) altogether, preferring to leave the story open-ended rather than to guillotine it that way.
 Harry Potter fans in my secondary English classes enjoyed predicting Book 7's revelations--as did I!  Suffice it to say that none of us got all of them exactly right, but we did learn how to defend good literary structure on the way to our conclusions.<br/><br/>Nice finish, Ms. Rowling!
 OK, I have to say that when I was placing my order, several comment pictures caught my eye. This  was described as a beautifully illustrated set. I thought it would be nice for my little one. I could read to her and show her some of those pages. But NO, not at all. This is pure text, like PhD textbooks.  The comment section is indeed, very misleading and set my expectation very high.
 I love these books
 Given as a gift
 YES!'
 These books are good, clean fun. They don't talk down to children and that's why I would highly recommend them to youngsters. Anyone who tells you there is Satanism within these pages are either stuffy old people or just idiots.
 I am a nerd and I love this series.  Books DVDs and audiobooks.  Most people need just 1 format.<br/>I actually prefer the audio books because 1. they take up less space, 2. i can "read" with my eyes closed (laying by the pool or on the beach for ex.) or doing some dreary task.  However I just like looking at the books on the shelf.  Maybe I will feel like turning actual pages.
 Ms. Rowling does not disappoint and brings all the dangling ends from the previous books to a conclusion.  A book that leaves me wanting to know about the characters' future and how they got to the "epilogue".
 If you saw the movies and wondered about the books, have read the books but never owned them or just looking for new copies to replace the worn out copies you've read over and over then this is the set for you. The artwork on the box is as good as the covers and the books fit neatly and easily into it. You  can keep it for the collectors value or as a display piece and the books you will love to read again and again. It's a can't miss series from a truly unique visionary (J.K. Rowling) that will dazzle and amaze. Highly recommended for any one who can read regardless of age!
 It is fun to be able to listen to the complete book whenever I want too. Since I have low vision the audio book makes reading much easier.
 My grandaughter loved it!
 Guys, relax. Yeah, the box is made of cardboard, but you're not paying any extra for it. In fact, you're paying $20 less for the set than if you were to buy each book individually, in which case you wouldn't have gotten the box or stickers anyway.<br/><br/>I can sort of understand the frustration for those who bought this set as a collector's item, but your arguments would have made more sense if you had to pay extra for the box. For the rest of us who bought it for the sake of getting all 7 books at once, this set was a smart purchase.
 I was anxiously awaiting for the set to be released in paperback so I could own the whole series without spending the $$ on the hardcover set.<br/><br/>The books are great as they ever were. My only issue was once you read a book, the physical copy expands. After reading all 7 it was difficult to fit them back in the box it came in without doing damage to them. That is the only reason I cannot give this product five stars.
 I love Harry Potter! It is the best series in the entire world! I would give it  a million stars if I could!!!
 Best written book in decades! As a teacher I highly recommend this novel for upper elementary school students through adults. You can't read it enough!
 this seller was absolutely wonderful.<br/>Not only did they provide a good and correct description of the condition of the book they sent it right away and i got it in a short matter of time.<br/>They made sure i was satisfied which made the experience a good one.<br/>They emailed me right away when they got my order and let me know when they would send it.<br/>Then they had accidently forgotten to add the recipt in the package with the book and sent me a handwritten personal letter along with the recipt.<br/>i was blown away with their professional respect for their buyer<br/>:)<br/>5 stars - 2 thumbs up
 I ordered the hardback set from Amazon (as the seller) and it is brand new and in mint condition. The books are beautiful. I love this series and I think this is a great price for the whole set, and the box is handy for storing the books safely away. The box is cardboard, so if you are buying this with the box being important to you, think twice. On the other hand, if you understand that it is just a cardboard box it isn't bad.
 The Harry Potter books are great, but I have to say that the Audio books are better! Jim Dale has an an amazing talent, and holds the Guinness World Record for the largest number of different voices created by one person(from this audio book set). Male, female, goblin voices etc. Absolutely incredible! You can tell what character is speaking, even before it is stated. I have never heard anything like it.<br/><br/> There is one caveat. Each Book is 17-20 CD's, so it takes a while to load on to your computer. Otherwise an awesome purchase!
 The pictures are absolutely beautiful!
 The boxed set is a nice collectors edition.  You could buy the books individually, but the box is nice and you get<br/>the stickers, so I would recommend this.  No need to tell you how great the books are.  I have read them all numerous times.
 This is my third time through this book and it was just as exciting as the first time I read it.
 After debating back and forth about buying this, I ordered it because the price dropped from one day to the next, (prices fluctuate). I was weary because of some of the reviews, but to my surprise the books were hardcover, the box was cute. Everything looked as pictured. I haven't even opened the plastic covering, so the books could be blank for all I know, but hopefully the quality was maintained throughout.
 i've read the book, but i find that long car rides are best with audio books, so i bought this.  it's great!
 Santa got this for my wife, she's a big Potter fan!
 This was an excellent final book to the series.<br/>Some of it went a little slow, but when it was over, we wanted more.<br/>I think Jim Dale really makes these audio books stand out.
 I finished this book in just a few days after receiving it.  I am already ready to read it again.  It is very well written and a great end to a very enjoyable series.
 Absolutely love it!
 Obviously you should not read this book unless you have read all the others. You also probably did not get to this book unless you enjoyed the others!<br/><br/>That being said, this book is a great ending to the series, and I would highly recommend this series to people of all ages.
 Good book, great price.  Didn't need a fancy cover for a good read.  So I got a great deal plus s&amp;h.  I decided to see what all the hype was about over the HP books.  Well, they are very well written.  It is hard to stop reading once begun.
 If you are a Harry Potter fan you don't need my review; if you haven't read them ...START, and go through the series ending with the Deathly Hallows.  All your questions will be answered, all your doubts resolved, all your fears allayed.  The only question you will be left with is: Why end the series here?  I want MORE!!!
 I was very pleased with this boxed set featuring all seven Harry Potter books. I had the urge to start reading the HP books for myself and see what the hype was all about. Well, I'm currently about a quarter way through Goblet of Fire (Part 4) and I'm loving it! Harry Potter is awesome! I'm so happy I ordered this boxed set because now I'm a new HP fan and enjoying every bit of it.
 Excellent book, presentation, time for delivery, I loved it! And for some reason, I rather have the box at home that simply download from the internet...
 This complete set is beautiful. I love the jacket covers but the hardbacks themselves are stunning. Perfect for any Harry Potter fan.
 I gave this to my niece for Xmas.  She loved, loved, loved it!<br/>Yes, as the other reviews note the box is cardboard-like and could have been more robust. But she's reading the books, not playing with the box.... She also loved the stickers that accompany the box to make the travel trunk look like more authentic.
 Awesome book
 I ordered two of these boxed sets - one so that I could re-read the books and one to give to my niece for her 11th Birthday.  The boxed sets came promptly and were in great condition.  There's not much that I can say about the Harry Potter series that hasn't already been said.  Such a wonderful and exciting journey.  J.K. Rowling has inspired me to try my own hand at writing - which is a gift that is beyond thrilling.
 I've read this a million times, and will read it again and again. Most certainly a wise purchase. Or kindle unlimited.
 Purchasing these illustrated versions for my little grandson as they become available, and I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the incredible illustrations. This is a collectors' version and something to read with younger children who will then transition to the longer books. The books are printed on high quality paper, beautifully bound and quite heavy. Beautiful to give as a gift, as well! I highly recommend this
 Absolutely loved reading this book with my son. Great follow up to the first and just as exciting. Highly recommended!
 Chances are, you've probably seen a hardback book before. That's what these books are like: paper with words (great words at that) bound in some harder, thicker paper. Ok, the books are good...duh.<br/><br/>What were the creators thinking when they made this box? I could have assembled this thing in 30 minutes with some paint and 3 UPS boxes. The other review talked about a cheap, junky, plastic "latch", if you can call it that, and they were right. It's cheap, junky, and plastic which will break and make you feel angry for spending money on it. Don't be deceived by the photograph, my books don't even fit snugly in the box because it is bending under the weight of the books. Also, don't hold it by the handles because it might tear though the cardboard. I am very sad. I actually was so sad that I had to go out and spend $80 to make my very own velvet lined box with metal hinges and a metal latch with corner guards. Now, MY box rocks. This one stinks. It's in my garage if anyone wants it. I'll sell it for really, really, really cheap.<br/><br/>The books are good and it's cheaper than buying them separately. That's the only redeeming quality.
 I've read all the books, and enjoyed the first four a great deal. However the last three have left me feeling flat. So many questions are left unanswered, the plot plods along, and none of the characters seems to undergo any real development.<br/><br/>It ends the series reasonably well, but there are no real fireworks in my opinion. It was a solidly okay book, but no more than that.
 I read the other Potter books in the series the normal way, but buying this CD set, I've become spoiled. Mr.Dale is a talented storyteller, you won't be disappointed with this lovely set.
 Came as seen in the image! I was able to relive my childhood all over again. Rereading the series gave me inspiration and melancholy. It was great to have everything in mint condition, it made the experience all the more satisfying as it's been a while for me to have a book between my fingers, to actually tangibly turn a page, as well as just having the time to leisurely read. I recommend this as a gift for those youngsters who have not lived in the era of HP, it'd be a shame not to share the magic that we have lived having these books in the prime of our own time.
 This bookset was a great value.  I couldn't find these books individually or as a set anywhere for a better price.
 I loved the movies so I really wanted to read the books. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on them in case I couldn't "get into them". I love the books even more than the movies now! This is a great value and it was packaged very well. It was pouring rain when they dropped the box outside my house and I was so mad because I thought it had ruined my books. But they were packaged to be protected from the weather :)
 The book came in perfect condition.  It arrived quickly and I couldn't be more pleased.
 I ordered the audiobook of the 7th Harry Potter book and was excited when I received it three or four days after I'd ordered it - I was shocked at how quick the turnaround time was, very pleased.<br/>However, the CD's didn't work right with my computer. The whole point of getting them was so that I could put them on my computer, and then from there on my iPod or whatever, so that was upsetting.<br/>I emailed AZ Fulfillment with my issue and they expressed their condolences and gave me step by step instructions to return it &amp; receive a full refund.<br/>Although the product didn't work out for me, the service from AZ Fulfillment makes me much more inclined to return in the future.<br/>Thank you.
 I bought these books because I have all the films in DVD and Blue Ray and some in BR3D, but have only read the paperback versions. I wanted something for my little girl to have for her own (Kindle be damned, not knocking Kindle, it's just that physical books have substance and an innate beauty that software just doesn't have).<br/>Upon opening the box, I was immediately disappointed. There was no boxed set! Just the box they arrived packed in!<br/>The photograph on Amazon shows seven books, all of them an identical height, meaning that they are all the same, ie matching. Unfortunately the very first book, Sorcerer's Stone is NOT the same height or quality as the other six books!<br/>The book in question is 8.5 inches tall, while the other six are 9.25 inches tall. This difference in height would have been obvious in the photograph, had the photo been of the books I bought. I was led to believe I was buying a "Boxed Set", the only box was the one these mismatched books arrived in.<br/>I paid $60.00 for 6 matching books and one cheaply made mismatched Book Club looking book. I feel badly because other folks paid $47.00 for First editions and matching books.<br/>In fairness, I must say that the other six books are First Editions and for the most part are indeed in good shape, and more or less what I expected. Shipping was $3.99 and cost Eros $10.00 to ship.<br/>I'm an honest guy, so, I spoke my mind. I will not return this set, I had already purchased The Sorcerer's Stone from another source (ABE'S Books)it is brand new, never been sold or read. It now occupies position one of seven on our bookshelf. READ BOOKS TOO!
 I was very pleased with how J.K. Rowling ended this series. I am an adult reader of the Harry Potter books and feel that she tied up all the loose ends nicely and left just a little tease of possible future stories coming beyond the Hogwarts years. Sigh....one can only hope.
 Only nitch is that these are paper back. The box these are in is beautiful, the side of the books have artwork and the new covers are AMAZING. The art work is gorgeous. Chances are, if you are buying these you've read the books already anyways and are buying as a collectible, and these definitely are something worth picking up and putting on the shelf for others to drool over.
 The series is a great series of books, there's nothing to deny to this fact.  The fact it has lived on so long, created such a following, sold so many books... heck they're even basing part of a theme park to the world of Potter.  So in no ways is my review based against the series itself.<br/><br/>This "Collector" set gives you all 7 books in hardback print.  GREAT!  But what would be a great set without a special container or other keepsake.  With the Lord of the Rings set, you received 2 very nice bookends that complemented the series.  One can assume with the Wheel of Time series end close at hand (unfortunately) that there will be a collector's set released then for those that enjoyed the series.  Many book and DVD series at least give their loyal fans that buy into the collector's sets something of great satisfaction.<br/><br/>Yet this cardboard box gives little to be satisfied about.  I purchased this set under the guise that I would be receiving something that I could cherish and enjoy, while I passed on my reading set of these books to my twin boys.  Yet now all I have are 2 sets of hardback books, some sticks, and a cardboard box.<br/><br/>It leads to question... is this the publishing label of the Harry Potter franchise that made this call?  We see this come out and now there's a "Limited Edition" of the DVD's coming out in December that comes with "Special Trunk Packaging", bookmarks, and collectible cards.  Who's to say those will be of any quality or if they will be on level with this... box.<br/><br/>Perhaps I may buy the "Collector's Edition" of the movies when all 7 are released.  Doubtful after this... as I will probably just round out the rest of my collection with the remaining DVD's that have not been released.<br/><br/>Disappointing does not describe what has been sold to me.  This is no "Collector's" edition, merely all 7 books in hardback with a cardboard box.
 I expected a lot more scuffs or markings than were in the book. It looked like a nearly new book--much better condition than they advertised. :-)
 How can an author write a great series and save the best for last?  Only JKR can answer that.  I was stunned that this final book was so excellently written and tied everything up.
 Stephen Fry is reading the "original" English version (before it was translated to US English) and his voiceings are wonderful. I have both the US and UK versions and really do prefer the UK version.
 Beautiful book. Wife loved it
 Perfect addition to my collection. I've read and watched the stories a hundred times over so i am definitely a HUGE fan. I purchased this on a Thursday night, it arrived on Friday early afternoon. Right in time for SVComic con on Saturday and i was able to get Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) to sign it!! Much thinner than the other books not really what i expected but then again i'm used to the paperbacks. Excellent Read!!
 This book series is great for anyone who wants to escape from the realities of real life. Eventhough it was intended for young readers. Mature readers will find the stories are fluid and and easy to dive into.
 I loved this book.  She answered so many questions.  Once you start reading it is hard to put down, it just never stops.  I wish this was not the end of Harry, but she did an excellent job ending it, and did right by Harry and her faithful readers.  I give it 10 thumbs up, 10 Stars, and 100% LOVED IT!!!!
 Don't start with this book if you haven't read any of the series. Start at book 1 and work through them in order. They are better than the movies...more details.
 My daughter went absolutely crazy for this british version of Harry Potter. Its a beautiful set (even though it arrived damaged/bent)&gt; she loves reading both american and british versions! wonderful set and much nicer covers!!!
 I liked the book overall. However, I still think that Harry and Hermione should have gotten together.
 The book pack I purchased (twice) for gifts was beautifully presented and of course the books are fantastic. J K Rowlings is now a household name and hr books are world famous. This collection is a must for people who love reading but also for those who love to have a beautiful treasure to keep for generations to come.
 I read the whole series to my sons.  We would anxiously wait for each new book to come out.  I enjoyed the stories as much as my boys did.
 Death, deception, Hermione's magic bag? What's not to love?
 The books are a "bucket list" 8th grade graduation present for a special student who I've worked with for three years who now wants to read.<br/>I priced shopped around and couldn't beat this price.
 Of course the Harry Potter books speak for themselves, but this collection is well bound and packaged for generations to come.  Athough it doesn't contain all of the books of course ... Maybe they will sell us a larger box with the new editions.  Recommended for all ages as a great hand me down.
 These set of books were a great purchase. The stories are filled with humour, suspense and lots of action. The characters develop nicely in this series.<br/><br/>I could not put it down. Even my twelve year old son read through them once and is going on a second round of reading! The price is fine for a set of seven, paperback books.
 I purchased this set of books for my son and he has read every one and will read them many times as they are available when ever he wants to read them again.  No more going to the library to get which ever one is there at that time and having to get them back for another person to check out.<br/>This is a great set for his personal collection.
 I received the book via "owl" on the day it came out and took me 2 weeks to read it (adults don't have as much time as children) and didn't want to put it down. I loved it. Great ending to a great series.
 I love the Harry Potter Series and have for a long time. So naturally I wanted to get a set for myself. I decided on the Limited Edition set with the red box and golden dragon drawn on it.<br/><br/>I was really drawn in by the art style of each book and the box. They all arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition besides the inside of the box being a little banged up. The isn't noticeable on the outside so it doesn't ruin the box art. I got my set shipped from Powell's Book Store. I can't wait to dive back into these books the moment I get back home.
 What can I say that hasn't already been said about Harry Potter. Fantastic narrative, characters that have heart and you can connect with. While the package isn't made from the best materials, it still looks nice and has an inner box that you can remove for storing openly on a shelf. I would suggest buying this if you do not already own the Harry Potter set breaks out to about $17 per book, which is a great deal.
 Fabulous Book, and great company. The book arrived quickly and was exactly as described. It was in great condition, and for a great price. I took it from the package, checked it out, then wrapped it. It made a wonderful present, and was exactly what i was looking for.
 We were search for the Harry Potter Chest book set, and amazon lead us to this seller.  It took over three weeks and an email to the seller to receive the product.  It was not what we where expecting.  We got the Harry Potter book set NOT the Chest set.  When we contacted the seller we where notified that at the very bottom of their description it stated that this was not the chest set.  Even though that is what we were searching on amazon for.  They said it was amazons fault, and amazon said that is the category the seller posted under.  When amazon sent us a notice to review this seller it still comes under the chest set.  Who is in the right and who is in the wrong we don't know, just make sure you carefully read this sellers full description prior to purchasing.  You may not get what you are expecting!
 I enjoyed all the Harry Potter books.  This finished my collection.  The story behind it is great and I loved the ending.
 As soon as my 12-year old unwrapped this present, she began screaming with delight, and I have to say:  it lives up to her enthusiasm.  Amazingly detailed artwork really enhances the story. We are looking forward to the future illustrated volumes by Jim Kay. Highly recommend for fans of the Harry Potter books, or as a way to introduce new generations to this fantastic series.
 first off, I'm a grown 23 year old lady but that didn't stop me from falling hopelessly and utterly in love with the harry potter books! I have seen the movies and the books are a million times better that the movies!!! RON and HERMIONE should have had more love scenes in my opinion being my favorite couple and all but the fact that there were so few and far between made it so much more amazing and precious! I hope j.k. Rowling would change her mind and write a book about their life together but that's just me!
 Amazing. Sad to come to an end.
 Absolutely gorgeous, just like the first book!
 Very good
 Lovely package. Thank you!
 She ran out of material on this one. She is another author who has success with something, then thinks everything she does must be good. Get it to finish the story, but don't start there.
 Reading the series for the second time. So much more detail than the movies!!!
 When I received the books, I was a bit worried only due to the fact the box they were shipped in was falling apart.  But that didn't affect the books any at all.  They were all in good shape and I was very happy with the way they were intact.  I had bought them for a birthday gift and also as a replacement to the person's books that had gotten water damaged, and these were beyond his expectations.  Thank you again for selling them to me.
 I bought this for my fiancee, she is a huge harry potter fan. The box is not that great, it's carton, but it looks good, she loved the stickers it comes with. The books are all hardcover. I wish the lock were made of metal, it's plastic, I guess the designers opted for the easy to open design, but again, this was not for me, it's the perfect gift for a harry potter fan.
 I just wanted to say that I hope this review convinces the store to ship heavy hard cover books in a box. The corners on mine were damaged. I planned on keeping this book as a collectible, but its not. Its also not worth the hassle to send it back and get another one over mashed corners. The book came in just an envelope, and its a big book, the last Harry Potter book in fact. The size and weight of the book tore through the envelope. The corners of the envelope were actually missing. They could have at least TAPED the corners...
 Harry Potter and friends are all grown up and leaving Hogwarts.  I will really miss them and their adventures.  Please don't abandon Harry Ms. Rowland, write about his family or heirs.  I so enjoyed this series even though I am a grandmother and great grandmother.  Rowland's writing spans generations.
 Beautiful artwork as expected. I can't wait for the rest of the collection. I will say that Amazon.com so far has the best pricing on this book but BEWARE the packaging. My copy came with the "Harry Potter" foil lettering scratched and in one spot scratched off completely. Some might not care but when the hardcover is just plain the dust jacket becomes just as important as protecting the inside pages.
 This product was exactly as the description had said. It is a good quality product, and the only thing that was off, which I thought was rather humorous, was that someone had the books in the wrong order. Other than someone not being able to count, it was a very good purchase. =]
 Book #54 Read in 2016<br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling<br/><br/>I am re-reading the series before the new one comes out at the end of July.  These are my favorite books.  In this one, book #2, there is a monster attacking Muggles at Hogwart's.  Harry, Ron and Hermoine are trying to figure out what the monster is and how to stop it.  I enjoy these characters and Rowling's writing.
 If you haven't read these books already, you are far behind on the times. This is a great book series that I strongly suggest to people of just about any book reading age. Of course you have to read the books BEFORE watching the movies in order to fully appreciate them. Great buy, no need for hardback these books are wonderful!
 I am so happy for this book! Excellent condition, excellent packaging and great delivery! If you're wary of the used condition, don't be, you can hardly even tell and it still has the lovely book smell.
 We really enjoyed the audio book. Jim Dale is brilliant at voicing the story. The price is the best I've seen on it too.
 Book was for my granddaughter and she was well pleased.
 The Chamber of Secrets was good, but not nearly as good as the Sorcerer's Stone.  In this sense, I was disappointed.  Maybe the bar was set too high with the first book?  It felt like almost the exact same format as the Sorcerer's Stone, only different red herrings.  Reading the book began to remind me of watching a bootlegged rerun.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but towards the second half, I just couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to end.  I am sure the 3rd book will be better. We haven't given up on Harry Potter, but may take a short break.
 I bought this mainly because I wanted to keep the set and I had all different sizes and shapes of books in this set as I bought them as they became available.  If you want to preserve this set and have it in mint condition, buying this boxed set is an excellent way in which to do this.  Of course, the story was interesting and captivating or I would not have re bought the books.
 What is there to say - if you are considering buying Book 7 then you must have read the others.  This book ties EVERYTHING together in such a tidy way there couldn't have been a better conclusion.  JK Rowling's best book in my opinion and the epilogue at the end of the book is wonderful and I am very glad she included it.
 If you're in the market for the Potter Books, you definitely want to get either this 6-book set or the 7-book set that's available.  It's a great value and works-out to about $17 per book shipped (for the 6-book set).  I saw the same set at Barnes &amp; Noble for $170 so this is a steal.<br/><br/>The box that it comes in isn't anything special, and you can throw it out if you'd like, but it does do a nice job of keeping the books protected if you don't feel like putting them on your shelf.
 Well, this is Harry Potter, so you can't go wrong. I'm originally a french speaker, and I wanted to discover these in th3e original language, so I bought them here.<br/><br/>This set is very good in that it offers the 7 books of the best sries ever in a good format, for a very cheap price. The cover art for the first few bucks is really kid-like, but hey, the first few ones ARE kid books, after all.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of the french version, and the english version is just as good.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Harry Potter.
 The Harry Potter series are a great read for any age.  Simple enough language for a child to understand and complex enough story and length to satisfy an adult.
 This was a gift for my 12-yr-old, who is greedily reading her way through The Sorcerer's Stone. We are big fans of the movies. She wanted to also read the book series for the full stories. She so far is quite impressed and anxious to read them all. The books are also attractive, colorful and can be stored in a very nice, sturdy case that they arrived in. All-in-all a delightful purchase. No complaints here!
 JK ties up many loose ends while taking you on a wonderful and exhilarating ride.  I've truly come to love Harry, Ron and Hermione.  And now my adolescent daughters will too.
 The book is still fresh, innovative and entertaining!  Jim Dale's voice  brings the characters to life.  I listen to the discs in my car and my long drive to work becomes something to look forward to.
 This collection is a great value.  I'm re-reading the series before Book 7 comes out, and I like soft-back books to read in bed.  So this collection is perfect for me.  They are the full-size, soft-back books with all the original artwork, etc.  I am very pleased with the product.
 First time I read this book, I read it in two days...quite a amazing thing since I am a 'slow' reader and always have been.  This amazing book series has helped more kids get interested in reading and using their imaginations - these characters are so well written - it's as if they are alive and you care what happens to them...even after the final battle.
 I love this set box! It has the perfect size and the letters are also of optimum size for a comfortable reading. I think it could be a great gift, altough I bought it for myself.<br/>The books are not to large, so that a kid can carry them, and not to small so that the letters are imposible to read and the lines in paragraphs are to close to each other.<br/>I also love the colors of the box and of the books.<br/>If you want to know something specific about this article just ask.<br/>(sorry about my english)
 We just got this for our 8 year old daughter's "something to read" for Christmas.  We already got her the previous fully illustrated Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for last birthday.  We haven't looked inside this new book, it was wrapped up in Christmas wrapping straight away.  The previous book was a joy.  She's read that one over and over, studying the beautiful illustrations.  I also liked the large size of these books.  It commands a presence on her bookshelf.  I'm sure she'll pore over this one over Christmas break with as much interest as the previous book.
 Great book
 I'm certain that everything that could possibly be said about the Harry Potter series has been said time and time again. Just beware that if you start reading these books you will get addicted to it. If you don't like waiting to find out the end of a book, wait until the seventh book comes out. Otherwise, go ahead and buy this collection. Especially at this excellent price that Amazon offers.
 Very perfect and great service.  Totally perfect transaction &amp;<br/>was happy to see my son loves the book set.<br/>It came in a cardboard set and totally worth the $
 I hated to say goodbye to Harry in this last book of the series, but the story does not disappoint (though I do wish a couple of the characters that were lost had survived) and the ending is satisfying.  If you are a follower of Harry Potter you need to add this book to your collection.
 Absolutely amazing! Harry Potter is my all time favorite book series!
 This box set is so beautiful, I almost feel bad reading the books.  You really feel like a wizard with your own trunk.  Just open this box and you really feel like you're going to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry!!! YAY!!
 Entertaining from the first page to the last.
 Package arrived as promised. Quality is the usual amazing audio from Jim Dale. Tapes make it easy to find one's place when listening is interrupted. Also, I can keep a cd in the cd drive.
 I decided to treat myself for my birthday and actually get what I want for a change. I love this box set!! I never had the chance to read books 1 thru 4 and now I can journey thru the beginning to the end at my leisure. It arrived on time and in great condition. I received the day after my birthday and haven't stop reading since. I'm already up to book 6 and only got the box set 3 weeks ago. I highly recommend the paperback set oppose to the hardcover because its easier to carry around and doesn't feel like a brick in your bag!
 Each book tells a complete story with beginning a middle and ending. The characters are described and brought to life so that they could be pictured in your mind wether there was a movie made or not. Each book contains it's own emotions and the action is well explained. It also contains light hearted moments. It's about friendship, unity, and love as well. There is good and evil. The Harry Potter series let's everyone know that love can conquer all. The Harry Potter concept is unique and the stories are well told.
 Wonderful book!!!! Can not believe I have waited so long to read it!  I highly recommended this to any one looking for an entertaining quick read.
 It must be tremendously difficult to terminate a series of books such as the Harry Potter Series. JKR has done a spectacular job of creative story writing overall. She has a unique talent and deserves the highest praise.
 If you are even browsing this page then it is pointless to read any reviews.  That means, you are already a fan and know how spell-binding the series is.  Every HP book is AMAZING!  A great read for all ages.
 How to get over with the Harry Potter book series obsessions? When you plan to read these series, make sure you have free time, lots of free time, or you don't prefer sleeping. These keep dragging you into the wizarding world and seems no way to go back to your normal muggle life anymore. Sleepless at night coz you wanna know what will happen next. Perhaps JK Rowling hexed the books. Thank you for these great books and thanks amazon for sending these box set to my country before the holidays! I hope they have book 8 for another ending version, Snape and Lily happily together. Harry Potter books are very sad, indeed! It makes me cry when see all those great characters vanished.
 Super fast shipping during the holiday season brought this product into our home. The item was in perfect condition upon arrival and was just as described.<br/>Would purchase from this seller again! Very happy customer :)
 This book is very much worth the cost and is totally spellbinding. I did not want to stop listening, even to sleep. The ending was not what I expected but has very pleased with it.
 I've seen the Harry Potter movies before, and while I found them entertaining, they really lack the personality and sparkle that the books have.<br/>I plan to keep this collection and re-read it many times before I ultimately give it to my son.
 J.K. Rowling did a fabulous job of quelling our worst fears and taking the best of what we knew might happen along with some sad and scary surprises to end her great series.  The only thing that let down this sad excuse for a muggle is that it's over.
 "People need to chill out just a bit......<br/>By R. Goan - April 26, 2008" was absolutely right on the mark! Hilarious review, too! Mr. Goan definitely has a future in comedy writing if he's not already doing it! It's truly comforting in this day and age to witness some prevalence of commonsense in the world. Buy this book set for the amazing literary work that it is, not for the flimsy cardboard, chest-like packaging it comes in! Remember, you're not paid any extra for the packaging!
 It is a gift.  The recipient likes it.
 11 year old son just finished it. He enjoyed it and wished it wasn't the last one.
 This book is excellent--really keeps you hanging on by the edge of your seat.  Just one (very slight) negative--about 20 pages in the book near the end are upside down and misnumbered--they go from page 314 to 363 but I just found page 315 turned the book upside down and continued on.
 The thing is that the worst Potter is better than anything else anybody else is writing. I think what hurts this one is the dark story of the chamber of secrets clashes with her need to keep this one kiddy. Still characters and setting are so good it overcomes any shortcomings.
 I concur with Julie's review. This is an extremely poor print. 48 pages in book 5 are duplicated, with the intervening pages missing. In other words, pages 687-734 don't exist. I would have expected a better quality, especially with the commercial success this series has had. Although, it appears they cut corners with the print, probably to save/make money. In all my years, this is the worst printing job I have ever seen. Amazon has kindly sent new copies, even over night. I will post an update if the problem persists.
 Excellent!
 The book was great and I wish it was not the last.  Also this was the last good response I recieved from Amazon.  My next orders were all mess up.
 Having all 7 books in a treasure chest is a great idea.  Unlatching the hasp, lifting the lid, and finding handsomely bound books added to the drama of opening the package that Grammy sent.  My grandchildren are just starting to read the books, and I know they'll be protected and well-loved for the next one reading in a few years.  Great idea, great gift.
 Always a fan!
 All the books and the box they came in are in perfect condition! No bumps, scratches, bends or marks anywhere! I got this with the money I got from my brother for my birthday and Christmas and I have to say, I couldn't be happier! Came in a timely manner and I can't wait to get a chance to sit down and begin reading them!<br/><br/>I never got the read them as a kid, only have seen the movies, and I could never find anyone to borrow them from, so I'm more than excited to have my own full-set and get to finally read the original written series!<br/><br/>NOTE: I got the Paperback Box Sex, not the Hardcover.
 This series has been and will always be the best of an entire generation
 Since watching the Harry Potter MOVIE series, I immediately became a fan. Until I finally gave the books a try. What can I say, they are the best books I have ever read! Books have to be good for me to keep turning pages and pages and these books series definitely do that! If you are deciding whether to buy the books or not, trust me. Do it! You will not be disappointed whether you are a child, young adult or an adult!
 SUCH AN AMAZING BOOK!!! It's intense, funny, emotional, and adventurous. The book came in great condition, too!
 This was a very special gift for my 2 growing boys.  The box that this collection comes in is wonderful.  I bought the hardcover set because if I was going to spend the money, I figured it was best to have the best.<br/><br/>This is a set that will hopefully be cherished and passed down throughout the years.  It's a very very nice set, in wonderful packaging.
 Best books I have read over and over again. Every time I read one I remember things I had forgotten reading the first several times.
 This is a great book for Harry Potter fans especially if you've just started reading the series. It took me 5 days to finish this book and I plan to finish all the books this year!!!
 J.K. Rowling is a master of her craft! There is honestly no other book series that I have read repeatedly and picked up a new piece of information each time. These book engage you from the beginning of the first sentence, delight you throughout, and have you sad to see it end. I can not recommend this book series enough, especially at such a discounted price! I have the entire physical book series, but seeing this able to purchase for my kindle all at once was too great to pass up! If you are looking for a book series that will keep you excited and turning pages, this is the one! I highly recommend if you haven't read them yet!
 words are so dang small, both of my kids complain. Makes me sad. I truly wanted them to read them, but truly words are too small for me too even with my reading glasses. I hate that. Wish I would have had someone point that out to me in the reviews.
 Rowling has out done herself this time! But if you read this before you have read the other books you spoiled it for your self.
 By golly what a read.
 Reading through the 2nd book and the binding starts to come apart.<br/>I can't find a way for them just to send me a new book because its past 30 days.
 I purchased this item and received it two days later! As far as I can tell they're the real books and not a counterfeit from some magical foreign country. I see some people don't care for the box it comes in, they must be Slytherin fans. I particularly don't mind it. I haven't invested in a book shelf yet, so I find it rather nice it comes in SOMETHING rather than having my books dramatically scattered across my bedroom floor and risk tripping over them and breaking a valuable body part. And at the end of the day, it's the Harry Potter books I am concerned about, not fanciness of the box it comes in. At this price I think it's a wonderful deal and absolutely worth the buy!
 Remember when somebody first recommended this series and tried explaining that it was about a boy wizard and his adventures at school.  You gave them a strange look, didn't you? Think about that cliched plot idea and then look back at what JK Rowling has accomplished with this brilliant series.<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this book is that it had to end.  JK Rowling has said that this is her last book about Harry but her inherent talent is obvious and I would eagerly read anything else that she writes (no matter how bizarre it might sound at first).  It would have been easy for her to give us cliched tie-ups to the different plot lines but she doesn't.  Remarkably, she weaves a compelling story that draws the reader even further into the emotions of the characters than we ever thought possible and answers every question with surprising and very entertaining answers.<br/><br/>Even if JK Rowling thinks she can't match the Harry Potter success, who cares.  She is a brilliant writer and has an incredible talent - I hope she continues writing...anything.
 Loved ALL Harry Potter books! Didn't think I will. couldn't put it down
 Bought this as my 13 year is finally getting into the Harry Potter series after finishing the first novel. From the second this book arrived in the mail he was glued and hasn't been able to put it down. Glad he's busy reading a great book instead of playing video games. Ended up buying him the entire series. He's so excited for the rest of the books to arrive now. I think I may read them all myself.
 I am so excited about this product. I had been looking for the books individually and this set works out nicely. It also comes in a nice box and they all fit in perfectly. I am so elated to have this. I bought it for my 7 year old son to help him learn to love to read. It is working. He reads his books everyday. I believe this purchase exceeded my expectations. Thank you!
 I LOVE HARRY POTTER!!! WOOHOOO!!! I'M so happy I finally finished this book! I liked it very much. It only took me a lot of time to read it cause I never really liked the second of this series or any series. I finished it this morning in the bus and I just felt like I wanted to scream that I WAS FINISHED!!!<br/><br/>OK. Let's talk serious about this book now. ***SPOILER ALERT*** (even if everyone already read the book or saw the movie, like daw)<br/>-Professor Lockhart really got me on my nerves the whole freeking book! I'm so glad that ass lost him memory! He's so stupid and I am so mad at him that he stole all his stories from other wizards adventures. He's a coward!<br/>-I would not like to go to a school full of petrified people getting attacked and killed. But it's worth it if your going to Hogwarts and that Harry Potter is there to save the day :P<br/>-I love the character Dobby!! But, I'm mad at him from trying to save Harry Potter with the Budger (if we write it like that) or the letters that he stole... I just love when Harry says "Just please don't try to save me again", but we all know that that won't happen :( I pity Dobby, I think that he's just so cute and deserves to be free (well now he is and I'm glad about it).<br/>-I was suspecting Dobby or professor Lockhart all along for the air of Sliterin. I thought that maybe Dobby was helping his master(Lucius) that wants that Harry Potter dies by being killed by Voldemort. ( cause you know, Lucius works for Voldy). But, Dubby was only warning Harry that he might be killed by Voldemort on his second year at Hogwarts.<br/>-Well I can't think of anything else that you don't already know so.. ya<br/><br/>Goodnight people of the world &lt;3
 I ordered The Harry Potter Box Set on 13 June 2011.  All books was to be received by 5 July 2011.  I did not get the seven book until 20 August 2011.  And that was only after leaving a negative feedback did I hear back from Prime Fulfillment.  I sent four e-mail to Prime Fulfillment about the missing book and did not get nothing back from Prime Fulfillment.  But after I posted a negative feedback, did I hear back from Prime Fulfillment.  I will not be buying anything more from Prime Fulfillment.  But if you have a problem with Prime Fulfillment, just post a negative feedback about Prime Fulfillment.  In doing this you will get an e-mail from the company right away.
 This is a good binding for this book.  The paper is like a paper-back, which makes the book a lot lighter to hold.  Good for little kids and for BIG KIDS!  :)
 These books are fun and inspire kids' imaginations. My sevenyear old loves them...
 J K Rowling is a genius and I believe the Harry Potter series is one of the greatest fantasy series of all time and that J K Rowling is one of the great writers of not only our time but of history. I can envision in 500 years School children reading Harry potter the way todays read Shakespeare. Who said authors don't write like they used to? I'd say they write better than ever with authors like J K Rowling and Christopher Paolini!
 I can't put them down. I am glad that I waited to read them when she finished the series.
 I was very happy with the book, including cover and construction.  Of course, I love all the Harry Potter books and now have them!
 Amazon offered this complete collection for the Kindle at a steep  discount. The whole set for less than one volume? I believe I will, thank you very much. Harry has accompanied me on plane trips, waiting in the grocery store, sitting at the doctor's office...anywhere I have a few minutes with nothing to do. I already had the hard covers, so this is a matter of convenience rather than my first read. Even if they sell it for much more, this series is well worth it. If you've never read these, I envy you having the chance to read them for the first time!
 Very good reader. It makes you feel that you are right there in the middle of it.
 Beautiful set of great books, the box trunk is just cardboard and falls apart easily, excellent idea with extremely poor craftsmanship...a little disappointing... good gift set!
 I love this book.  Great conclusion to a great series.  A must read!
 Very good book!! Great to read on a lazy day!! J.K. Rowling was a great author in this book!! My favorite character was Dobby.
 The product was exactly as described on the web.  there was delivery damage though.  that packaging was ripped as if pierced by a hook of somesort and that damage also punctured the product packaging.  the actual books were not damaged, but the case that holds all the books was damaged.<br/><br/>the product and the company did their job flaelessly.  the packaging was also done well that is should have been protected by most bumps and normal delivery handleling, but the outside packaging was torn as if it was pierced by a large metal hook or piece.<br/>It went through the outside box, the packing material and ultimately pierced and damaged the case of the product.
 This set was nice, my wife really enjoyed them, Now my 12 year old is enjoying them.  Only problem, and this is weird.  In one of the books there were a couple chapters missing.  In another there were ink spots on about 10 pages, some covering words.  We were able to return the set no problem.  Got the new set within 2 days, before even returning the bad set. That was great service!  In the new set all chapters were there, and no ink spots.  Good deal, and worth it for my family.
 The Harry Potter series is one of the best I've ever read.  I have read through the entire series more than 5 times, and I actually bought these to replace my original books because the originals were worn out.  I actually had pages falling out of my Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets books.  Highly recommend these books no matter your age.
 Its Harry Potter. What could I possibly say, you all know how well the author did with this series. She deserves accolades for her work.
 I got these books and absolutely love them! As an avid fiction reader I was quite satisfied with the stories and although they are geared towards teens I found the stories just as gripping and well written as adult fiction. The whole series took me about 3 weeks to finish which is a lot considering most novels take me about a day to finish. The humor in them translates well.
 Bad print on some of the books. Unreadable. I ended up re-ordering (since it was cheap), selecting the best books from both sets, and returning the bad set for a full refund. Cheap, bad paper and print.<br/>I wouldn't buy it for a gift! You never know if the books will be readable.<br/>I guess you get what you pay for.
 Great finale to the HP series...providing some interesting turns &amp; twists to some of the characters.  Interesting to find out about Snape in the end...<br/><br/>Some things end sadly, but many do not, so don't be dismayed; just read it!  J.K. Rowling is a great story-teller.
 Fantastic - a must for long car rides,
 A great series, love it.
 This was a gift to my best friend and I have to say I was impressed by the product when I received it. These look lovely and the box is a nice touch. She was definitely pleased as punch! She'd been wanting all the books but had mentioned she felt a bit self conscious toting around the original covers that were so childish, so this was the perfect gift!
 Loved it.  Can't wait for the rest of r series.
 I thought I was ordering a box set of books, however, I received a box of used books.  They were all hardcover, but now new and in a box wrapped in celophane as pictured.  Disappointed with this order.  Some of the books have another person's name/sticker inside the front cover and some are wrapped in plastic as if from a library.
 It's Harry Potter. Of course it's great. I am required to write 13 more words before I can submit this.
 Better late than never.  I didn't get on the Potter broomstick until all the movies had been released.  I never saw the movies but heard they were terrific.  I thought I would read the books instead.  Not the target audience (I could be Harry's granny), I became hooked after Chapter 1, Book 1.  This series can be enjoyed by all ages.  Fantastic series
 I absolutely love all of the Jim Dale reading Harry Potter audiobooks. The way Jim brings life to all of the character and situations is amazing! I feel like a little girl, listening to a grandfather reading a bedtime story. I'm addicted!!! These audiobooks are absolutely brilliant.
 Overall I was pleased with the condition of the books. The box and bindings of the books showed a little wear but that was to be expected since the rating was "good" not "excellent.
 Wow. Heard the illustrations were awesome so we purchased the first two volumes. We are not disappointed. We have six years old, who are readers. But trying to read the original editions is a bit tedious. So we give these books a "Double Wow" because the illustrations are a way of reinforcing what was just read. Thank you JK Rowling for sharing words that span generations of readers!
 I devoured all the Harry Potter books and liked them all thoroughly, but I liked this one less thoroughly. I agree with the reviewer who said that the school of wizardry is itself an important character in all the Harry Potter stories and that, without the school, the time in the woods becomes, not exactly dreary, but less of the page-turner we expect in the Harry Potter books.<br/>I have another caveat. I agree with the insight offered by Sander Gilman and Rachel DuPlesis, among others, that "stereotypes can be (and regularly have been) freely associated, even when their association demands a suspension of common sense" (Preface to "Difference and Pathology: Stereotypes of Sexuality, Race,  and Madness" (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985, page 12).<br/>In this final Harry Potter volume, the classic stereotypical (but falsely attributed) characteristics of black slaves are attributed to Dobby and the other elves, who all (except Dobby) are depicted as cherishing their slave status.<br/>Another example: the goblins are depicted with the negative stereotype of greed which Europeans and Englishmen have long falsely projected onto Jews. To make this worse, Harry Potter actually proclaims that he dislikes the main goblin in the story. This proclamation, combined with the "explanation" of the nature of "goblin" characteristics, comes across as an implicit acknowledgement of these stereotypical characteristics. (In fact, statistics show that Jews donate to charity, for example, more generously than the national average.) In an apparent attempt to escape criticism for this negative depiction, the author includes among Harry's followers one student with a Jewish name--which means nothing, as the boy is not a leader, while many other minorities ARE included among the leaders of the book's "good guys". (It would have been best if the book had omitted both kinds of "Jewish" references altogether, just as it abstains from references to believing Christians.) But anyone who has read the series must read this volume too. You will want to know what has happened to Dumbledore, and why Dumbledore trusted Snape, and why "He Who Must Not Be Named" has never found a wand that works against Harry Potter, and.... You will also want to know the application of the legend of the three brothers who encountered Death. So I cannot advise against reading the book. I can only suggest, inadequately, that, in reading the book, the reader be consciously aware of the stereotypes and make a conscious effort to disregard them.
 Loved it!!!!  An easy read and entertaining.
 I love this new set of books. The artwork is lovely and it looks fantastic on the bookshelf. I ordered the paperbacks, and hope to add the hardbacks to the collection too.<br/><br/>Of course, the Harry Potter books themselves are timeless and fantastic. Even you love Harry Potter and even if you already own all the books, this is a great addition to your library because it's so beautiful.
 The book received in very good condition. A good one for a gift. The person liked it very much. The quality of the paper is very good. Feels good when you read it. The story is very good, unsaid. Received the book promptly on the promised date. I am very happy with this purchase.
 very good book!!
 The product was as descriped. The books are in perfect condition, still in plastic wrap. They were shipped in a timely manner.  The collector box is not as sturdy as I would have liked, but is a cute little addition.
 Exactly as described and quick shipping.
 Genius and Magic from the first word to the last!  Rowling's imagination and ability to create such an amazing story line filled with thrilling/chilling events, moments of terror, humor, sadness and philosophy is mind boggling! She slips in hints of solutions to the dilemmas one may miss if not reading with full attention.  I could not put any of the books down once I began reading.
 It took me a while to start the first book, and I am now into the 4th in the series. It is a fantastic series that is a fun fantasy. It is diffucult to put down as good overcomes evil. Can't wait to finish the rest of book 4, start book 5, and then get book 6.
 Great condition!
 I hope they do all 7
 On the whole I'm very pleased with the way the series ended. A lot of things were different than I'd guessed but hey, no problem there. I'm not going to write any spoilers in this review, unless saying that I wish the epilogue could have been less exculsive counts. That was my only standout complaint at any rate. Many people have torn this book apart, some a bit viciously, but having the internet, I see that sort of thing all the time. My opinion still remains intact and will endure. I loved this book as much as I have the others.<br/><br/>Thanks for such an enjoyable journey, JKR!
 My husband and I are listening the the books together.  We both enjoy them.  The author created such a magical world and it's fun getting lost in it.  Jim Dale does a great job of bringing each character to life and giving them their own voice.  We Highly Recommend the whole series.
 The whole Harry Potter Series for $30. That's about $5/book. Since some of the books cost as much as $10 by themselves, this is a great deal. I loved the series (I'd read it before buying it). Though I'm a little worried that, as with many fat paperbacks, the pages won't fall out some day; but it hasn't happened yet.
 Absolutely fantastic. Had priced the single audiobooks out but could not justify the expense at this time. Saw this wonderful deal and could not resist! I feel like I found a treasure. Having a reader like Jim Dale just adds so much -- the kids listen in the car and I get a kick out of watching their faces!
 I liked Book 7 - a lot of people tried to spoil it before it came out and none of them were right!<br/>I was glued to this one just like the other six and could barely put it down to get to work - sorry it's the last one.  It's definitely worth the read!
 This box set is well put together. I got this for my 8 year old who is obsessed with Harry Potter. She loves that she can keep all her books organized together. It's a little difficult to get them out but I don't think it would work too well if it wasn't so tight. The box set is such a great price for this collection. If you are a Harry Potter fan I strongly suggest you getting this box set.
 Birthday gift, loved it
 Beautiful book!
 I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who loves Harry Potter. It comes in cool packaging, allowing the person to set them on their shelf altogether and looking good while doing it.<br/><br/>I too just started reading HP for the first time (Never read or seen any of the movies) and I've quickly become a huge fan. Great books for both children and adults.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a nonstop page turner. It enthralls you from page one and takes you right back into the story of Harry and his friends going up against Lord Voldemort. I would suggest this book to anyone who has read the series and I would suggest the series to anyone who has not read any of the books. Even if you have seen the movies the books are worth reading. This is from a 43 year old woman.
 This is quite possibly my favorite of the seven novels beautifully written by Rowling.
 Wonderful ending!
 This book is really good  I love reading there books I'm actually on the 5 ,<br/>so this is really easy to read
 This book is a wonderful way to introduce young children to Harry Potter.  I read it to my my six and eight-year-olds and the pictures helped make the already fantastic story come alive.  There are just enough illustrations to capture the magic of the book, but enough to keep the mystery alive for children to imagine the world of Hogwarts. We can't wait for the next illustrated editions!
 What say about these books? They are perfect, I have never seen books more beautiful than these. This box was the gift I most wanted to receive. All Harry Potter fans must have these books.<br/>I was very anxious to buy this box and here in Brazil it is very expensive. So, I could know that Amazon site sell and send this book much cheaper than here.<br/>Then I made the purchase and the book arrived here two days earlier.<br/>I was very happy: the books are beautiful, well done and perfect. I really liked.<br/>Just a problem with two books. The jacket of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was with a small rip, and the jacket of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was bent. But this problems are not serious. Although them I really liked.
 books were sent in a box with no top.  padded envelopes tapped to the top were the only protection.  The supplier was condescending when communicating about the issues.  So I would say the supplier is sub-standard in my opinion.  Books were supposed to be used in very good condition.  They weren't.  They were a gift for my stepson, so I have to give them to him and let him decide if I purchase another set from somewhere else.  I may, but I have leaned a valuable lesson.  Never buy used from this supplier.  I will NEVER recommend this supplier, and will tell everyone I know not to buy from them.  It won't put them out of business but it will keep my family and friends from being taken advantage of.
 it took me2 days to ready it( called in sick to work 2 days in a row) JK did a great job...post office not so great job delivering by 10AM( came at 330p) like i paid for but thats not amazons fault.
 Great!
 Just as exciting as it was the first time I read it!" Look forward to reading the next book in the series.
 My book arrived shortly after I ordered it and was in new condition.<br/>The book itself was a rollercoaster of emotions that kept my interests.
 My mom originally purchased me all of the Harry Potter books, most of them in hardcover. Unfortunately, over the years I ended up losing them. With my mom's recent passing this past July I got very nostalgic about nights spent listening to her read me the books while I fell asleep, then I ended up getting a gift card for Amazon for Christmas and there was a sale going on for the full set, add that to my Prime membership and I just had to buy the set. Very, very happy with my purchase and can't wait to finish reading them all over again.
 Being an avid HP fan, this book is a must have. It is action packed from the very first page to the last. You will not be disappointed. Don't wait for the movie to come out, the book is so much better than what the movie will be, and everyone is or will be talking about it. Get caught up in the world of HP.
 Had read other reviews and knew the "chest" was not high qualtity. No big deal. The books appear to be exactly what I wanted - a complete hard bound set - and the cheap cardboard chest does provide compact sturdy storage until we move and I place the books on a book shelf.
 Got the British version for myself at last! The books are pretty standard, although the fonts of the first three books are pretty large; but it just might be the 'drawback' of getting the less expensive children's edition box set. Although it was meant to be a collectible (fancyish box), the lack of hard cover makes it less so. But don't think that the paperback quality isn't durable, it has hold up pretty good against my impatient reading style. I'd definitely recommend this box set to others.
 The Harry Potter series always gets five stars from me.  But this particular new binding set with Hogwarts running along all the spines for a combined picture is stellar.  Looks fantastic on the bookshelf!  So you get the great books and the added benefit of Hogwarts sitting on your shelf for you to look at.  Makes me wish I could have gone to school there.
 Great book, thanks!
 Best of the Harry Potter series.
 LOVE the series!
 It's a box set of all Harry Potter books. Not sure what more I could say. The product itself is just what the product description says. As for a review of the Harry Potter books themselves, I don't have enough time to write that review. But I assure you, they're best sellers for a reason. Great series, and awesome investment.
 I have only received 2 of the 7 books and they are not the Hard Cover Boxed Set in the chest like advertised.  I bought this on Nov 2nd for my daughter's birthday which was on Nov 10 and I received the 2 yesterday (Nov 16).  I am highly disappointed.  I paid over $75 for 2 used books.  I am beyond unhappy.
 Bought for my daughter who likes Harry Potter and trying to encourage her to read more and play less video games.  Already through the second book and starting the third.  Amazon fulfilled the order quickly.  Good value overall to buy set rather than one by one.  Wish they were available as ebooks for Kindle or IPad, but JK Rollins doesn't permit ebooks for Harry Potter... Guess if you are a billionaire author, you can publish any way you want....
 I finished the series finally, yesterday, read for the first time, all in 3 months. This will be stuck with me forever, truly magical and real. This book gives the perfect conclusion to a series that grew with love, magic and tragedy.
 As always, a treat to hear Jim Dale's voices again.  I was impressed with the packaging on this CD set:  folders of three or four CD's were sectioned together using different color/designs on top, so there was never a question as to what CD I was listening to.  (All my other HP audios are on cassette tapes).  Here's hoping JK writes more very soon!
 Amazing book
 The Chamber of Secrets continues the development of the characters and basic plot of Harry versus Lord Voldemort, although in this book Voldemort only appears as a memory.  It's a good book, but the series doesn't get juicy; i.e., develop its depth until the third book, The Prisoner of Azkaban.
 This is the first Potter book that I've bought. (I checked the other 6 out from the library.) Even though I thought it was a little expensive at first, I can see now that it was worth it. I plan on buying the previous 6 now.
 As a mature fan of the Harry Potter series, I'd been looking forward to the final book of the series.  It was well work waiting for.  Ms. Rowlings's imagination and use of the language make the Potter books wonderful reads for any age.  The last one certainly is on of the best of the series and I do hope this doesn't mean she'll stop writing.  I'll be looking forward to her first non-Harry book.
 AWESOME because I love magic and Harry Potter is one of the magical series that there is(for example Wings of Fire) ;-)
 I like the books. I did get them all. BUT---they are all very poorly made as far as I am concerned. The paper is very brittle and the bindings are poor. One good read through them could destroy them. When you buy a set, you expect to hold onto it or pass it on to others. I don't think these books would hold up. I am afraid of ruining the binding or ripping a page as I carefully read them. Paper could be so much better.
 I have never met anyone that did not LOVE these books. I have met people that just didn't want to read it, because "its a kids book", but when they finally read it, they became huge fans. Great for all ages!!!<br/><br/>Ejoy.
 A beautiful book, just like the first one!!!
 I like the series so its nice to have them all and at a reasonable price since I am on a fixed income. I bought the seventh book seperately as it was less expensive to do that way. I recoomend the set, no frills and the books are great.
 I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books, this one being the final of the series is definitely the best of them all.  The ending was a bit surprising, and almost left an opening....
 Ms. Rowling sustained the high quality of storytelling and writing style throughout the final book. She did a great job mixing the fast-paced, must-read sections with the mellower, time-for-chores parts. We look forward to reading these books to our children when they are ready. This is a wonderful series from beginning to end, with a nice closing.
 Fantastic illustrations!!!
 The book is just like new. My husband was thrilled to get it and the price is affordable with good service. Thank you
 I was really excited to find this set! The price was great, and I love that these are paperback! I have read this series twice, but never owned the books. I'm glad to add these to my collection. I read some negative reviews about the box they came in, but I found no issues with packaging. I also read that were issues with the books themselves. I looked through all seven, and all seven were brand new. No complaints here, I'm very happy with my purchase!
 This is the digital compilation Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. One file, all the original books. There were a few spelling errors that I noticed, but given the size of this collection they are of no consequence. I thought the price was a little high given the last book was published almost 10 years ago now, but since I was willing to pay it that complaint looses credibility.
 A wonderful book to end the series.  Very well written with no loose ends.  I won't say much here because I don't want to give away any of the book's content.  But, I wasn't disappointed and I don't think that many readers will be.<br/><br/>We are so fortunate to be able to read this now, as it was being written and when the ending was not known.  What a treat for our generation!
 This is not the best of the Harry Potter series, but it is certainly a wildly entertaining and fast read. It is a must read to continue on to the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire, which are both excellent along with the remainder of the series. The movies are also good, but they never do the books full justice.
 I've read twice, cover to cover, and I expect that from time to time, I'll go back and pick it up.  Loved the entire Potter series, having shared it with my daughter from ages 8 to 18, and look forward to sharing it with my grandchildren.  No matter what JK does in the future, nothing will ever take away her genius in this series.  One of the best stories, 1 to 7, ever written!
 The boxed set is a good value. I had read all of the books before but now I am reading them to my kids in order. It is fun to see them get into the characters and we will have months of enjoyment reading 1 chapter per day.
 I was thrilled to see art that was consistent from book to book as well as the image of Hogwarts on the spine and the delightful Hogsmeade art on the sleeve. Any of the art I was nervous about viewing images online, worked much better in my hand. Additionally the back of each book features the back of Harry, whether he's in the Department of Mysteries, facing off against Voldemort or looking at his parents in the Mirror of Erised. It was a nice detail. My only complaint is that the inside is exactly the same. The stars on either side of the chapter name, the art from the original releases. I would have liked to have seen a total overhaul. But it wasn't so significant to keep me from enjoying this set.
 I was introduced to the Harry potter series when I was young. It is my favorite! I have read the entire series at least 8 times. Five stars!
 Being a fan of the series from the very beginning I already have my own set of the books, I purchased this one for my boyfriend and I have to say we were both impressed. Not only was the cover art on this set breathtaking, the embodiment of the series being captured in both childlike wonder and an adult's need for display. The spines of all seven books for a side view of the Hogwarts Castle and the box set a street view of the village of Hogsmade. The covers are reader friendly in that they do not crease easily and they don't smudge or keep track of your fingerprints. Again, the beautiful artwork and choice of cover make this a beautiful set for someone who has been a long time fan and those that are headed to their first year at Hogwarts.
 I purchased the Harry Potter collection for my son. He loves to Read now that he has something that he loves to read it is just fueling that passion even more. Great gift set. Thanks.
 Well, if you're going to buy this bnook you are probably a fan already and reviews won't matter. Great reading, have fun and enjoy. It's a great gift for any Potter fan!
 Brand new item arrived timely
 I just received my order for the Harry Potter hard cover Box Set and all I receive was the books in a cardboard box. I'm pleased with the books but the case was never shipped with the books.  From what I have read the case that went with these books was cheap cardboard, not the wooden one that it shows. I would really appreciated it if you send the wooden case that is shown.
 Beautiful illustrations
 This book was the exciting and expected end to the wonderful Harry Potter series. When I first began reading this series I was not sure that I would care for it all the much but I definately didn't expect to love it. JK Rowling does a great job of showing the ins and outs of friendship, growing up and learning right from wrong. This last book, was in my opinion, the best by far. I loved the other ones but this one answered all the questions that had been lingering through the series. I love that the author took little tidbits from the previous books and made them important as she has done all along. I love the humor that comes naturally along with the battle and the struggle of good and evil. I don't want to say anything to spoil the book for others but I just couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to anyone and have already. Thanks, JK Rowling for such a wonderful adventure.
 When I'd stumbled upon this nice complete set of the 7-book Harry Potter series a couple of Christmases ago, I called our daughter-in-law to see if she thought our oldest grandson (who was 7-3/4 at the time) might enjoy this as one of his Christmas gifts - she said she knew he'd seen one of the DVDs (wasn't sure which one) and really enjoyed it... DVDs aren't the same as books though, and our grandson loves to read.  I probably would've preferred hard cover copies, but you couldn't beat the price for this nice box set of paperbacks.  Less than $7.50/book to introduce our grandson to this amazing series?  SOLD!!!  I hadn't had my old head in the sand those past 15 years, which would just about have to be the case not to have heard of extremely talented author J. K. Rowling and the wonderful fantasy book series she spent a decade - 1997-2007 - creating, the eight movies stemming from the series that were released between 2001-2011 (the final book made for a "2-parter" in 2010 and 2011), young wizard Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger (all students at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy), and his endeavors to defeat the evil wizard Lord Voldemort!<br/><br/>Since this listing's info section gives you a list of the included books and good general info, I thought the best I could add is some grandmotherly advice... whether it's Harry Potter or any of the other terrific children's book series that are out there, do what you can to get that first book into their hands!  Even if you need one of the DVDs to spark their interest, introducing your youngster to a well-written book series is one of the best decisions you'll ever make!  I recall fondly a Christmas when I myself was 8... I wanted Barbie and Ken dolls, and had my fingers crossed for the Barbie Dream House (wasn't even particular about whether it was one of the older cardboard models, or one of the new fandangled plastic ones!)  I ended up with Skipper (Barbie was a bit too well-endowed for my father's liking), some pajamas and a copy of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women".  A book?  Who wants a book when you could've had a Dream House?  In protest, I didn't touch it until my younger sibs and I were punished one day the following summer by being sent to our rooms for the afternoon so my frazzled mother could have some peace.  Opened the book, and suffice it to say that it was hard to pull me away from it when the family dinner hour arrived!  Must've re-read it three or four times that summer, it was followed by Ms. Alcott's "Little Men" and "Jo's Boys", and by Christmas, the top of my wish list simply read, "BOOKS"!  Numerous book series would follow and totally entrance me, and I can't thank my parents enough for giving me an opportunity to discover the joy of reading.<br/><br/>It was that memory that made me so excited about getting this series into our grandson's hands... he'd always loved our lunchtime reads of Dr. Seuss, etc. during the five years I spent babysitting him, but he was now a big-time second grader now, ready for "meatier" fare!  He'd typically received mostly toys from us at Christmas, and had a quizzical look on his face when he opened this set; every time I asked if he'd begun reading them, my daughter-in-law said he was just so busy with homework and extra curricular activities (understandable during the school year.)  Well, guess what happened over the summer?  History repeated itself, and I looked forward to hearing his periodic updates on the adventures he was reading about!  What an excellent series by Ms. Rowling.
 Uhmmm it's Harry Potter of course it's amazing!!!
 This is a Christmas Present.  I was a little worried it would be damaged.  My worries were Unfounded!!  The book arrived well packed w/ sections of air wrapped around it. It arrived early, Thank You, Jesus!!  My Granddaughter is just now getting into Harry Potter.  So this will be right up her alley!  Not to mention she Love's to Read.  I'm Exsighted to see her open this one!!
 I felt that most of the questions were answered in the final book. The nineteen years later wasn't necessary but did let the readers know a bit about how Harry's life turned out.
 I used to spend a lot of time on the road, and being a working wife and caretaker of all the pets, didn't have much time to read anymore. This is the unabridged story, and the narrator kept your interest while you listened. Arrived in good shape, and has been kept that way. And its still a story I can listen to when I don't have time to sit and watch or read.
 I am very happy with my purchase.  It appears brand new and completes my set. Thank you so very much.
 Fast shipping! Books were great!
 Wonderfully written. Will always love and support the Harry Potter series
 This was the best of the Harry Potter books.  I feel that this book and several before it were not written for the elementary child, but toward the teen and older reader.  Please read the Potter books yourself, before deciding to give to the younger readers in your home.
 Only because it wrenched my soul out am I giving it 4/5.
 The book was excellent. I want to meet Harry Potter.  He is an awesome wizard and can do anything. I also want to speak parseltongue.
 If you have never read a Harry Potter book, and can't see yourself sitting that long, CD's are the way to go.  I love to read, but with a CD I can be there and get where I'm going at the same time.  I have "listened" 3 sets to death.  This collection is one heck of a deal, too.  I priced the series out individually...cost a LOT more!
 The final Harry Potter book wraps everything up quite nicely.  The book moved at a faster pace than others in the series and came to an end much too soon.
 After watching over and over again all the DVDs, my children figured they would enjoy reading the actual Harry Potter collection. I needed the complete collection and found out that Scholastic offered a boxed paperback set. The in-store price was fair at $100 but a bit of shopping around secured me a set for 40% less. Anyway, the cover art and paper quality are quite excellent.
 Great finish to a great series!
 A classic Harry Potter book. Somehow it was missing from my collection, but now my collection is complete!
 Amazing. So interesting and great detail. It will hook U. Even better than the movies.
 I took my time listening to this final Harry book because I just didn't want it to be over. On the other hand, I didn't want to wait so long that anyone told me any secrets! I've listened to all the Rowling books in my car and have been spellbound by everyone. My only complaint is that it's the last Harry book!
 Gave as gift. Was enjoyed
 This is the best by far in the Harry Potter Series. No one but J.K. Rowling could write such a masterpiece. Well worth the read, and the money. Could not recommend it more highly.
 I'm so happy I could finally purchase these for myself! I will no longer need to barrow them from friends/libraries, etc. Now that I have my own complete set, when the time comes that I have my own children, I can teach them of Harry Potter. Not exactly a collectors set, but for the money, it's a great option!
 Love everything about this series. Wonderful series for kids and grown up.<br/><br/>Would be a good start for someone who are not much in to books.
 High quality, beautiful illustrations!
 Brilliant and Exciting finish to an amazing series. Was saddened that the ride had to end
 The boxed set books are nice. Yes the case is cardboard but it just added a nice bit of ambiance to set. I gave these to my GF for her birthday as she was denied access to the books by parents self consumed in their own fantasy bubble. Anyway I thought the quality was nice and she liked them very much.
 After all this time? Always.
 The books are never a let down! I absolutely loved this book, and the ending was well written.  As for the distributor on Amazon in which provided me this book...the book was in great condition, and they too should have 5 stars.
 My mother always read to us when we took long road trips.  I am not able to do that since it causes motion sickness, but I still love to listen to books when I travel.  Jim Dale does a wonderful job of bringing the story even more to life with all his voices.  Even his narration is very nice to listen to.
 I've been lazy about purchasing the books to sit down and read them. With the prices as high as they are for books nowadays, I figured the boxed set was the way to go. I was correct since it is the best value for all the books together. If you haven't read Harry Potter and are into wizards and fantasy, then I would suggest you read them. They're MUCH better than the movies in terms of depth and subplots.
 If you are a Harry Potter fan you will enjoy this book.  I don't want to give anything away, but the ending has a surprise twist...quite fitting though.
 These books are beautiful. I am a big Harry Potter fan and already have two copies of the series (one to read and share and another to keep high on my keeper shelf). I purchased these as soon as I saw pictures of the artwork on social media. I already have a line of people to borrow them (uh oh). Again, the artwork is beautiful. These are a must-have for any Harry Potter fan.
 We were listening to this in the car on the way home from vacation.<br/>There were still 8 or so CD left when we got home. Luckily I had<br/>one extra day of vacation so that we could listen to the rest the<br/>next day. Very compelling.
 This hooked me on unabridged books on CD..... I have listened to it several times and I still don't get bored with it.  I have leant it out to many friends and there kids... and got themn hooked on it.  I like to listen to books on tape in my vehichle when I take trips or to and from work and like me, my friends teased they didn't want to turn the car off and couldn't wait to get back into the car to see what happened. Absolutely love the person who reads the book for you, best ever!!!!
 So disappointing. The book set that I received was nothing like what is shown in the pictures. There are no illustrations in the book. I feel that I was deceived.
 Great, nearly perfect condition!
 As with the enotire series, this book held my attention.  I had to work hard not to read the ending first, but I did it and it was worth the wait.  I admire the way J.K. Rowling writes her books.  She gives attention to detail, which to me is the most interesting part of a book.
 Okay, I've seen several less than satisfactory reviews about the Harry Potter box set, so I'll throw in my 2 cents.  First, yes the picture of the box set on the Amazon website does give the impression that there is a high-quality box included with the set of books.  But think about it, if there were a high-quality box included with the set of books, wouldn't the box set be somewhere around $300?  Yes it would and you all know it-- for hard-bound books and a wooden box with metal (not necessarily brass but something close) clasp?  Most definitely.  So really we've paid for the books, all seven in the series which is what I, personally, was after in the first place.  I did not want to buy each book separately, but the whole set so that I could enjoy reading one book after the other without interruption.  The fact that the books are all hard-bound is a bonus!  And I could care less about the dodgy cardboard chest the set's come in; I'm a happy camper!<br/><br/>So I apologize to those of you who thought they you would receive more than you did.  Rejoice in the fact that you have these books, and regardless of the cardboard chest, you've paid an adequate price for them (if you pre-ordered, that is)!
 Ordered and recieved 1 then a couple of days later 2 and then 3 and had to send them off for my Grandaughter without the last 2 books for Christmas.  WAS NOT HAPPY about that. also some of the books did not have the covers on them.  Not happy at all. Really upset she didn't get her Christmas present all together for that special day since I can't be there with them.
 I believe coming out with a box set was a wonderfull idea and i had been waiting for a boxset.  My only problem was that the box the books were in wasnt better quality.  I belive they should have made it out of something else other than carbord.
 Excellent
 Our son loves these stories. He's watched all the way through the movies, but is only on book 2 of the series. They're just the right reading level and tend to step up some with each installment. This is the inexpensive paperback version of the book, which is nice and light if you want to travel, but not very sturdy if you (or your kid) tend to be rough on books.
 My 20 year old son wanted this for Christmas. We loved reading all the books often waiting on line at midnight for the lastest release when he was a kid. His Harry Potter books are all well worn having been read and reread several times by the whole family. These he'll save for his children.
 I have loved Harry Potter from the very beginning.  This is a book that answers all the questions and settles matters.  There is sadness in it but good does triumph over evil.
 I enjoyed the book on CD a great deal.  I had seen the movies but suspected that the books had a lot more to them.  I was right.  Normally I listen to the books then see the movies.  Not in this case.  I truly enjoyed this.  The used CD's played like new and I am sure I will enjoy them again and again.
 It is such a lovely book!
 My grandson is enjoying every word.
 Love it!!
 TONS of typos, miss spellings, incorrect punctuation- was this a translated version????
 This trunk is a great piece to hold your favorite Harry Potter books in.<br/>Though it's only cardboard, it is sturdy and has a working clasp to hold it close.<br/>All the books came in perfect condition and sealed, and the stickers were a great added bonus.<br/><br/>I bought this to replace my tattered old set of these books, and I am so glad I did!
 While the book did clear up many things, I find myself wanting more.<br/>What happened to Luna?  Is Neville head of Gryffendor house?  Who is the Minister of Magic?  Who is Hogwarts Head master? The list goes on....
 the condition of the book was great and the delivery was prompt.  After book one, I couldn't wait to find out what the second year at Hogwart's would bring.  Although I've seen the movies, the book allows me to look at the world of wizardry through a child's eyes.  A wonderful read no matter how old.
 Are you kidding me? What you still waiting for? Just get the books and read them already! Then come back and write something so you can move a few others to read them as well :)
 Fantastic. This series is my childhood in a nutshell.
 My family all enjoyed this book.  We feel it is the best one of the seven books in the series J.K. Rowling has written.  She did a great job in tying everything from all the books together and completing the series wonderfully.
 It's an excellent addition to the first story. Once I had read one, two and three were out and I went through them like tissue at a snot party. Seriously read it, but don't be a knuckle head, read book one first. Seriously, what sort of person reads the second book before reading the first. People like you should be sent to an asylum.
 Wow, this book came out fifteen years ago (I'm old!). While only the second book in the Harry Potter series, I feel as if this is a great start to the furthering of Potter's career at Hogwarts. The Chamber of Secrets leaves much room for curiosity as the book goes on, and is full of interesting content about the chamber and its history.
 Perfect and super fast shipping!!
 Only con is I wish the 7th book was in paperback already and included with this!  Great boxset, I like how sturdy the cardboard is.  It's great for the price.  Get it!
 come in time, consistent with the description
 I purchased this special edition Harry Potter Paperback Box Set for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas and was extremely pleased with it. She is very artistic and fell immediately in love with the artwork. She has also been a long time fan of the series. The story of Harry Potter will live on in the hearts of many for decades to come. J.K. Rowling is an amazing writer and told one of the greatest stories of our time.
 Good Book!
 All of JK Rowling's books in the Harry Potter series are exceptional from teenagers to adults.
 This is a nice set of all the Harry Potter books. The box in comes in is no great thing. It looks cool but is only made of cardboard with a cheap plastic latch. I read the reviews before buying it so I knew what to expect. My granddaughter, who I bought this for, thinks it's cool and if she takes good care  it will probably last a while.
 Love these books!
 This book was a gift for a young lady aged 10 years.  She was delighted.  It arrived so quickly (and correctly, it went to her address not mine) that I was delighted about THAT.  She loves the series and I loved getting her one of the books in it.
 The Harry Potter books have all been winners.  They grab you from the first page and it's hard to put the book down until you are finished -- then you want more.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the best of the lot.  Just what I have come to expect from J. K. Rowling.  The excitement builds throughout the book.  And the end is appropriate.
 As Harry and friends go on a search for the Horcruxes, they are introduced to something they would never have believed, had Harry's Invisibility Cloak not been there. The new something, or shall I say these, are the Deathly Hallows. Harry suddenly becomes obsessed with them and becoming the Master of Death. All the while, Voldemort is slowly becoming stronger and the angst is greater than ever before. One of her best in the series, I'd say (or would my daughter...) Great, in general! Buy it!
 I ordered 7 hardback books in a boxed set, what I got was 5 hardback books and 2 paperback books. Two of the hardback books did not have the covers on them and the box that the books were to be in, didn't come either. This was a set the was listed at being in "very Good Condition". Although the books themselves were in good condition it was not wat I ordered so I sent them back and I had to pay to return them.
 I was wary of getting this used because I have a SLIGHT addiction to HP. I was needing the audio books but had a hard time spending the money on something I already own (hard cover books). I bought these used and think it may be one of the best things I have bought from Amazon. Not only are they in good shape (minus the box but I can care less if the box is a little beat up) but they came faster than my Prime order. This may not seem like a big deal to most but for people who have a HP addiction time is of the essence!
 Nice
 This excellent CD collection of the seven Harry Potter books is a must for all Harry Potter fans!  Jim Dale does his usual exceptional renditions of all of the characters that brings the story to life.  I highly recommend it.
 It came on time, undamaged, and was what I had ordered. Not much more you can ask for than that when ordering things online. Plus I absolutely love these books.
 good magic fantastic
 I like it
 Sorry to see it happen but the Potter saga comes to an end.  While at time the final book seemed to drag on a bit over all it is a very fitting conclusion for Harry, Hermione, Ron and all of the rest of the vast cast that has kept us enchanted for the last several years.  I just wish the movies could be as good as the books but until we go to 6 hour movies I don't see that happening.  Well done and an excellan read.
 It come fast and it better than listed in description, near pristine. And in this space I will fill out the 8 more words required.
 The Harry Potter series is entertaining reading for kids around age ten and up...and adults of any age!  J.K. Rawling has a fantastic gift for creative writing. You can "see" her vivid descriptions from characters to places to quidditch. Reading the series provides common ground for literary discussions with multiple generations.  You will find yourself seeking the next book in the series immediately upon completion of one. Enjoy!
 I was so happy to find this for so cheap.  My best friend has never read the books and I am so obsessed with them.  She finally agreed to read the books but refused to check them out of the library and couldn't afford all of the books seperately.  I found this and bought it for her birthday.  She loved it and now she is starting to read the books.  ANOTHER ONE HOOKED!
 I found the Deathly Hallows to be everything that I had been hoping for and more.  After having enjoyed the series from the beginning, I had many questions.  I feel satisfied.  Not only have my question been answered I do not feel the need to have a sequel.  I am satisfied.  Thank you Ms. Rowling for this amazing series.  I only hope that another author gets the world excited to read as you have with such a worthy story.  I have enjoyed the journey but I am sorry to say good bye to Harry.<br/><br/>B.

 ...that it's ending is similar with cheap romance book... book 7 is the worst written one from all Harry Potters... I felt mad reading it and so disappointed at the end... why the author spent so much time with stupid details? ...this last book wasn't supposed to be so bad.:-((
 This is the best HP book I've read. The trilling is kept until the very end. J.K. Rowling has surprise me againg.<br/>The art of this edition is supperb, from the box, to the cover and the ilustrations. I am facinated.
 Awesome book, thank you!
 Great!
 Great!
 Written for children, I read them all and thoroughly enjoyed Mrs. Rowling''s characters and super-suspenseful stories.  I read them a couple years back = bought these for my grandson.  That is what he told me he wanted.  I am a grandmother or Nana who is delighted when a grandchild requests books for Christmas.  Even when they don't ask for them, they still get them.
 I'm not normally an audiobook fan, but these are great! They make my roadtrips tolerable and the character voices are fantastic.
 I bought this book for my father for Christmas as his old "Chamber Of Secrets" was literally falling apart. I do wish that they had kept the back cover picture design but the book was in great condition. As for this series, there are no amount of words to describe how much I love the Harry Potter books. They will change your world! :)
 This item was beautiful and in great condition. It also arrived much sooner than I expected, which was nice. My only complaint is that one book (book 5) was rather seriously damaged. It looked like a manufacturing fault - like something had gone wrong during binding which caused the cover to buckle.
 This is exactly what my 10 year old grandson wanted.  He just finished reading my copies and wanted a set of his own.  His 8 year old brother is reading them also!  We love these books.
 This was a gift and the quality is very good. The stickers are a nice bonus; the extremely heavy duty decorated cardboard is nice; would have preferred a stronger material to hold the books as the complete set is quite heavy. Overall, an excellent gift and a definite keepsake.
 The final book in the Harry Potter series ties up a lot of loose ends and shows how Harry finally defeats Lord Voldemort.  But first, Harry must die!  J. K. Rowling has created characters that are easily identified with and how people need to stand up to evils even when it's not popular or they are under duress.  A perfect ending to the saga.
 I hadn't read these books in years. I moved so often since the time I had them all when they were first coming out that I lost all my copies. Nothing can ever beat the story through these pages. Took me a month to read them all and may I say it was one of the best months of my life. I can't wait untill it's been long enough that I need to start over again :-)
 I resisted reading this for a while simply because it was so popular, but it was a spectacular read.  My only regret is that I cannot read it again for the first time.
 We purchased this set of books for our 9 year old granddaughter's Birthday.  She has not put them down since.  She carries the entire set around the house with her, and will not let anybody else touch them.  She was thrilled to receive them.  The best gift we ever gave her.
 What hold comes over me when I pick up J.K. Rowling's books, even as a 23 year-old, is unexplainable, but "Deathly Hallows" is no exception. I savoured the experience of reading it, especially because it is chock-full of both action and the details that us fantasy-lovers need to have.  J.K. emphasizes the point that nothing is black-and-white, as shown by her handling of Severus' and Albus' role in the book. Relationships are seen in a new light, secrets revealed, suspense built up, everything that keeps you turning page and page and fills you with grief, joy, and wonder - what you expect from Harry Potter. I really can't believe the journey has come to an end!
 I won't ruin the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet.  I got my copy in yesterday and ended up reading it all in one day.  All I can say, without ruining any surprises, is that the book does not disappoint.  If you've been a reader of all the Harry Potter books (and not just someone who has watched the movies) this book is the payoff for all your patience.  All the plotpoints are resolved and everything is explained.  Great series!  Kudos to J.K. Rowling!
 Beautiful book.
 Who doesn't love Harry Potter? It is a well written series that sucks you in and makes it hard to put the book down. It's hard to not identify with the characters and the turmoil that multiple characters go through. I enjoyed reading this series in high school, again as an adult, and I look forward to passing the series onto my children from them to read.
 Excellent &amp; received as promised.
 How does Jim Dale do it?  How does he read the books and make us hear each of the characters almost as they say it in in the movies and as we think of them as we read the books?  Impossible to say; however, he does it.  We listen to the Harry Potter tapes each time we drive up and back to our weekend house (yes, we've read the books numberous times).  Any Harry Potter fan must have these tapes and listen to a master reading them and giving HP fans another great experience.
 I just loved it.
 it was great sorry its ending
 The Harry Potter audio books are a lot of entertainment that can be revisited from time to time and are much more entertaining than anything on TV.  Jim Dale does and incredible job of reading this series.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and haven't listened to Harry Potter read by Jim Dale, you have missed out on some serious entertainment.
 Gorgeous illustration, and I loved rereading one of my favorites out of the series. My experience has  been with the American versions, and I loved Mary Grand Pre's work in those, but the illustrator is very talented. There are fewer illustrations in this one than in the first, and not all of them were what I was hoping to see. There were lot's of spiders and naked trolls, and Dobby's butt was hanging out in one picture.
 I was disappointed with the delivered books. They WERE the books I requested, but I expected more of the "boxed set." The box was a dishevelled, secondhand box like from the grocery store, not a box specifically designed for books. I've ordered secondhand books from Amazon before and they were in much better condition. Much better. The condition of the books themselves is fair at best. The covers were battered. Previous orders of secondhand books were in much better shape. But my granddaughter was interested in the words, and they were all there. Thank goodness she wasn't disappointed....like me. I'd rate the shipment barely okay.
 In reading the series, when I got to Book #3, I found the book was missing 29 pages.  My book went from page 116 to page 145.  That was a very disappointing.
 The set of books came in a slightly crushed box but the books inside were in great condition. They were not at all curled, not even the harcover shells. I enjoy ordering from Amazon!
 I purchased this a a Christmas gift for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  My only concern is that it was to be her "big surprise" gift.  Well, that didn't happen.  The day it arrived, she met the UPS truck at the door and stamped ALL OVER the outside of the box was HARRY POTTER SPECIAL EDITION BOOK SET.  There went that surprise...<br/><br/>Be sure if you purchase it as a gift, to be there when the delivery is made.  The packaging is not in anyway subtle as to its contents!!
 THE PACKAGING WAS REALLY GOOD! IT ARRIVED ABOUT 20 DAYS EARLIER THAN THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND WAS WELL PACKAGED IN A CONDITION THAT WOULDN'T DAMAGE THE BOOKS!<br/>THE BOOKS ARE IN AN EXCELLENT CONDITION! THEY ARE PACKAGED BRAND NEW AS WELL!<br/><br/>A GOOD PRODUCT TO BUY FROM AMAZON! THE SHIPPING CHARGES ARE A BIT DEARER THOUGH THAN THE AVERAGE SHIPPING COST! IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMPLETE SET COMES TO ABOUT $96.00 AUD. THERE IS NO CONVERTOR ON AMAZON TO TELL YOU WHAT THE PRICE WILL BE IN AUD- IF YOU'RE IN AUSYRALIA- SO DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE AMERICAN DOLLARS, BECAUSE IT SAID $70.14, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE $91.00! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOULD STILL SAVE $8.00! SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST VALUE I HAVE SEEN! THE PACKAGING CONDITION IS NOT EXCELLENT BUT GOOD! IF YOU WANT FANCY PACKAGING, GO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THE PACKAGING, JUST THE BOOKS TO READ! SO GET A LIFE! THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST VALUED SET OF HARRY PTTER BOOKS I HAVE SEEN! WHEN I SAW THE PRICE, I WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED, EVEN THOUGH IT SAID 54.16 IN US DOLLARS, IT STILL CAME TO APPROXIMATELY $68.00 IN AUD!<br/>:) :) :) :) 4/5!
 Love love love. This was a STEAL. I've been wanting the complete collection for my kindle for a really long time but haven't had it in the budget. When this came up for $14, I grabbed it up and was so glad that I did. I was a little bit worried about all of the books being in one file but I'll be reading them in order anyway so it's not a problem at all. Highly recommend!!!
 great buy, great quality
 This order has been a disaster from the start. 1st I was told I would have the order by Xmas and he messed up the order, he emailed me on Xmas day apologizing and would ship order out 2nd day mail and would throw in a DVD for my situation.  almost 20 days went by before I received the order and I had emailed him numerous times with no response.  When I received the order, it was not complete. I only received 4 of the 5 books I paid for 30 days previous...3 of those 43 were not a box set like I ordered &amp; the DVD he promised wasn't there.  I am extremely disappointed with this experience and 32 days later I still don't have the situation resolved.
 Really well-written book. Loved it. Recommended for children between ages nine and fourteen. If you like fantasy this is the book for you.
 👌
 The box of books arrived swiftly, well packaged with no damage. The 'collectible' Harry Potter 'trunk' is okay, but being printed cardboard, will probably get worn and torn quickly. The clasp is NOT self explanatory (unless, of course your name is Harry).
 THE LAST AND FINAL HAS BEEN A JOY TO LISTEN TO ON CD...<br/><br/>TOO BAD THE SERIES ENDS HERE
 This book did an amazing job ending this series!  Left you with amost no questions unanswered!  JK Rowling is one of the best writters of our time!  I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
 This was just the book I was looking for!  Great service, quality product!  I couldn't have asked gor the transaction to go smoother.  As for the book, it is a must read!!!  I can't wait to read it again!
 I see alot of people complaining saying their books were opened or damaged but I got paperback edition and my books came brand new, not even opened and very well protected in the box so they didn't shift around. Maybe the hardback books all got damaged but mine is fine and it beats spending a 100 bucks in the actual book store for the whole set. I am very happy!
 Amazing story about magic. Definitely worth buying and reading. Aimed for kids and adults age 10+. Read read read! You won't be disappointed
 Really nice boxed set.  I have put away in bookcase for now.  Nice box and great colors, grandchildren can read when they are older and enjoy as much as I have..Fast service from seller and boxed well, I would purchase from them again.
 I loved how she wrapped things up--true, life changing love saves the day!!! Voldemort didn't get it! Even the Malfoys are swayed by love! Read it.
 i'm very glad that i pushed through with my order from amazon,being a resident in Asia.i received the product in a very good condition,without a dent on the box!i recommend amazon.com to all of u who reads this review.amazon really takes care not only of your orders but of your satisfaction as well.in fact,i got my order a week before it was scheduled to arrive! thanks amazon!
 After years of our original Harry Potters' being over-read to the point of destruction, our daughter decided she wanted a new complete set. She had barely got to chapter 2 before the pages started coming lose from the binding. I appreciate that kids can be rough on books but I assumed these would withstand at least a few years of good reading, as the previous copies we owned did.  Very disappointed with this set as it just will not last the distance in this family of avid readers. The covers are flimsy and the binding is just too inferior to cope with books with these numbers of pages. Santa made a poor choice this time!
 I remember I used to refuse reading Harry Potter until a fellow book lover in her 50s told me to stop being silly and read them. I was hooked with the saga when I finished the first one. And now I reread them at least once a year. They are almost all amazing. Goblet of Fire bored me to death.
 Kind of scary but impossible to put down!<br/>Definitely  worth it. Get this book now you will love It so much!
 My friend is a HUGE Harry Potter fan and she started reading the series to the kids.  The younger ones have a harder time paying attention, so I bought this book so that everyone can better enjoy the book.  I can't wait for all of them to see this on Christmas morning.  Awesome book with beautiful pictures and very sturdy.  I'm going to enjoy reading it myself!
 This boxed set is a great deal for the price.  I would recommend it to any Harry fan!  The only thing I wish it had was the sixth book included.  I will have to buy that one separately.  These books are really nice though.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the perfect conclusion to the epic series by J. K. Rowling.  There is action from the very beginning and intense and vivid descriptions of every part of our heroes' adventure.  A great final battle decides the fate of many of our loved characters and engulf us in the marvelous yet familiar world created by Rowling.
 Is there a better review ?  I truly do not believe so.  All her books are simply wonderful to read and enjoy.
 This is an excellent collector's edition at an exceptional price!!!  (I got it at $115.00)<br/><br/>While it may be hard to find the first editions; this is a wonderful way to have all 7 books, in the same format and protected in a custom size box to help protect from shelf damage, mold, mildew, etc.<br/><br/>A perfect gift to put aside for your children, or yourself, that is sure to appreciate in value in the years to come.<br/><br/>Now, I just have to get J.K. Rowling to autograph them and I'll be all set.
 This is unquestionably the darkest of the series, and the longest, but as entrancing as its predecessors.<br/><br/>I appreciated the way Rowlings allowed the characters to mature, yet stay true to who they are. And taking the tale so completely beyond the confines of Hogwarts, yet returning for the finale, added another dimension not often visited in the previous books.<br/><br/>If there is any drawback here, it's that it's a very long read.<br/><br/> ..]<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Mankind-s-Worst-Fear/dp/B001RNONH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mankind's Worst Fear</a>
 I bought this set for my daughter.  When I ordered it, I thought "I wonder if it will be written on or what?"  When I received the set it looked to be brand new.  I loved it as well as my daughter.  Thank You for such a wonderful surprise.
 This is where you really start to notice the changes from the movie and the book. I much prefer the book version of Gilderoy Lockheart. He's a total git in the book, but I enjoy it. It's much more interesting to read. You also pick up on more of the dialogue in the movies. For someone like me who isn't British that's a big deal.
 The quality of these books are not as good as the original hard covers but that's to be expected for the price.  I love them!<br/><br/>I would recommend them to anyone wanting to get the set, minus the last book for a very reasonable price.
 One of the best ones yet wish there were more
 The illustrations are amazing.
 I bought this book for my grandson. He has read them all.  It's wonderful to see young ones read.
 This book was fantastic.  I couldn't put it down.  I only wish that there would have been more books.  Maybe she will do a spinoff or a before period of Harry's birth.
 This book is an absolutely great purchase. It is well written and a great choice for all ages in my opinion. The hardcover purchase is a great buy as well. If you stuck between choosing to buy paperback or hardcover go hardcover. Unless you are going to be truly gentle with the book, always go harcover. Because paperback books, especially for this series it seems, to rip apart really easily. Hardcover on the other hand are still in great condition, for my part at least. So go ahead and buy the book, its worth it!
 It came in great condition, I was very happy with it.
 I'm collecting different versions of Harry Potter. so far I have 4 sets, and this one looks like it's a Harry Potter Manga. It's cute and different. The colors are vibrant, the illustrations are different than other Harry Potter books. Definitely a great purchase!! I was worried though that I was going to get a different set, but luckily I got the right one.
 Bought this set for my grandson and we will read it together over the next several months. I am really pleasde with the volumes in their neat case. Looking forward to this experience with my grandson. (I've red them all myself and found them delightful, entertaining and, even, educational.) I highly recommended this product.
 For anyone looking to purchase the entire Harry Potter collection, this is an incredible bargain!  Imagine, the entire set of Harry Potter novels - in hardcover, no less - not shoved into the mere cardboard sleeve that most other boxed sets are housed in, but placed in a creative cardboard box meant to look like a trunk!<br/><br/>Right now, Amazon is selling this entire collection of books for $116.99 - that's just $16.71 per HARDCOVERED book.  That means you can get each and every Harry Potter novel for less than what you would pay if you were to purchase them separately.  AND, as a bonus, they're housed in a cardboard "trunk" with a little plastic "privacy lock."<br/><br/>Anyone who thought this mere $116.99 set was going to be housed in a wooden trunk decorated with gold studs, bound with leather, and lined with the finest velvet, probably also expected it to be delivered by owls.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're like me and want to own and read the entire collection of Harry Potter novels in hardcover for an excellent price, buy this set.  If you already have the entire collection and were thinking of shelling out another 117 bucks for a trunk to put them in, just go to a consignment shop, buy an antique case, put your books inside and slap a padlock on it.  Presto!
 Bought this book series for my grandson, he didn't want to put them down.
 This series is wonderful for introducing children not only to a world of imagination but also to a world which encourages thought about ethics, the choices one makes which have far-reaching influence on one's own life as well as others, the value of family and friendship and does it all using wonderful characters in a gripping story. Highly recommended.
 And just as beautiful as the first! Wish they were all out already, but my wallet is sighing in relief lol. First thing I looked for was the gnomes in the Weasleys garden and I was SO happy!
 You can't get any better than Harry Potter. I do not want to put it down. You want to keep reading to find out what happens. The movies are good but the books are so much better. I love the books so much more than the movies. I will definitely be reading them again.
 I thought this was a fitting finale to the series. The sugary ending 19 years later was a bit much.
 Love the whole series! The books pull you into the enchanted world and keep your interest with plot twists and turns.
 Lessons on honor and content,  love and loss, right and wrong. This is a book about that takes you into the dark myisteries.
 Jim Dale has presented Ms. Rowling creations masterfully!  Having read all seven books, seen each of the movies several times, I truly did not expect any surprises when I purchased these audio volumes.  How wrong I was!  It was as if I was experiencing Harry's journey all over again with fresh excitement, laughter, fears and joys!  A must buy even for those who are not familiar with the world of audio books.
 Look no further to find a great series for both kids and adults. This version has the original illustrations from the original US hardcover and paperbacks, and is collected into a single file so it's easy to navigate between all seven volumes. Some are being picky about this no longer being a complete version with "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" coming out soon, but that book is merely a script for the play, and not a narrative format, so I feel as if this is still the canonical complete collection. You won't be disappointed by the price or the contents.
 Ordered books for my 7 year old daughter and ended up reading them myself.  I don't think I could have received such a good deal on all four anywhere else.  You can't beat this deal with the 4 hardcover books and case for something that will be a classic colectors item.
 As good as it gets.<br/><br/>The genius of JK Rowling is truly brought alive by Jim Dale.  If you love to read these books, you will have to hear a master at work.  Mr. Dale has a remarkable gift and has made Harry Potter that much better for me and my family.
 The set of Harry Potter books are everything I hoped for.  Delivery from Amazon,com was fast and safe, and the price was right.  I am enjoying reading the adventures of this clever young lad and his friends.
 I bought these 4 books as a gift for my grandson who prefers hardcover books.  they appear to be wonderful, but he does not have them yet, so I guess his opinion is the one that counts
 Very nice, clean and undamaged.
 Great book, great price, fast shipping, what's not to like?<br/>Why cant JK write more Harry books? :(  Nice addition to the library
 I was wary about this book going in as the last book in the series was less than satisfactory.  The author did not let fans down in the last book though as it was well worth reading.  There was much to like in the reading and the  re was little left unanswered by the ending.  Can't wait for the movies to come out.
 I absolutely loved it.  I cried out loud.  And I'm so sad there are no more Harry Potter books to look forward to.
 The quality of these volumes is perfect: the original font, good paper weight, and they'll match whatever paperback Volume 7 you buy elsewhere.  Of course, that won't fit in the box, but who keeps sets like these in their boxes?  The price on this set is just right--a great buy for someone who doesn't already have the series.
 Harry Potter was a huge part of my childhood, and my original hardcover copies are a bit worse for wear after so many readings. When I found out this Anniversary Edition was going to be released, I knew I had to buy it. The new cover art is gorgeous, the books are high-quality bound, and the box in which the set comes is of good quality with beautiful design.
 I love this book myself.  My nephew had read and all but this book so I bought him this  book for his birthday.
 I am a HUGE HP fan.  This story moved me from all my emotions from happiness, sadness, laughter, anger, tears, joy.  I highly recommend anyone of all ages to pick this up and spread this story.  It helps you understand, that anyone, anywhere from no importance can be someone great!  I am and will always be in love with this story, the characters, the setting, the magic, the love....Always.
 I purchased the Harry Potter boxed set for my brother in-law for Christmas, not only did he love it, but my daughter and daughter in-law both want one. In fact, my daughter in-law stated it was the best gift ever !!. The box that it came in is what made it look special.<br/><br/>loved it.
 Puts a lot of things in the movie in perspective, good, interesting read. I think it's a good read for all.
 This is a great gift for any Harry Potter fan. I bought for myself as a Christmas present, i had to look before  I wrapped it though, and i absolutely love it. A lot of other reviews said that the trunk was cheap, i didn't think so. It is made of cardboard, with a layer of something, kind of like a think shelf liner. It is sturdy enough to hold all 7 hardcover books, what else do you need?
 My daughter and I shared an interest in the Harry Potter books and movies as she was growing up.When she moved out she realized that she didn't have a set of her own (she wanted to leave the family set with me!)She was very excited to receive this beautifully designed matching set of books.The box also serves as a small book shelf.
 A nice end to a great series. A few spoilerish observations:<br/><br/>1. Under the most intense scutiny imaginable, J.K. Rowling has the guts to finish what she started by providing an actual ending. There are no what-do-you-think-happened-to-Harry? moments, no it's-up-to-you-to-decide-whether-Snape-was-loyal-to-Dumbledore cop-outs. Non-endings are neither original nor clever. Tony Soprano, I'm looking at you.<br/><br/>2. The massive cross-references to past events and people demonstrate the care that went into this book (Ravenclaw's diadem - how cool!), but this time around it was a little too much of a good thing. The past locations and people were great, but by the time Oliver Wood showed up the gratuitous cameos were well out of hand and I was reminded of the Seinfeld finale.<br/><br/>3. You know what's really great about Rowling? She can explain without overexplaining. The connection between the Muggle and Wizarding worlds is explained adequately without a legal brief answering all the what-if's, and there's not a midichlorian in sight.<br/><br/>4. I am such a sucker for a good seige; all that was missing was a Henry V speech from Minerva. Rowling is so great at knowing where to set her scenes. The ending could only be at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>5. Can't say I liked the mechanics of how Snape was handled. I think his history with Harry called for more face-to-face time in this book, and there was something just too passive about Harry hiding behind a crate while Snape has his final moments with Voldemort. Also, Snape's backstory was good, but telling it in a chapter-long flashback was awkward. That being said, what a wonderful author's touch for Snape to ask Harry to look at him as he dies, so that the last thing Snape sees are Harry's (Lily's) eyes.<br/><br/>6. In some places, the book seemed to have the feel of a screenplay, with scenes constructed based on how they would appear on a movie screen. Maybe this is just my own hangover from having recently seen Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>7. I've always admired Rowling for earning the right (after her first book) to have her books published in the U.S. with the orignal U.K. language intact. However, this was the first time I found it a little distracting; did the other books have so many "had done"'s in them? Still, her style is like a direct download into your head, clean and efficient. The great ones make it look easy.<br/><br/>Man, I'm really going to miss these books.
 To a wonderful series. There is something so satisfying and yes a bit sad in finishing something that has been with you for ten years. Luckily Rowling does not disappoint, and wraps up the tale of Harry with finesse and brilliance. I'd rather not say anything about the plot and just say again how lucky we've all been to experience a series that has broken records and will go down in history as superb classics.
 I have been a fan of the movies since the first one came out over 10 years ago. But never made a plan to read the books. I was given the first book as a gift, and read it in a few days. Since, I have continued to read the books and rewatch the movies and appreciate both even more.
 Bought the entire set for a "senior adult" family member who had never read or seen Harry. I have personally read all the books several times. Everyone needs some magic in their lives and Harry is special because he teaches us many important lessons.
 I ordered The Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7 and am totally 100% satisfied<br/>with everything.......from the ease of ordering online , the price , the speed and unbelievably LOW price to internationally ship the box of hard cover books which is actually quite heavy.
 My nieces are and have been HP obsessed ever since they started reading! They would always take them out from the library for months at a time. I decided to buy the whole set for them for xmas and am glad I did. We chose soft cover books so that they are easier to travel with and pop in their backpacks. Each book has been read throughly and is incredibly loved.
 This book rather gives what most of its readers have waited for years ever since the first one came out. Not everybody gets to live on, but those characters that we love have happy endings.
 This was a great gift for my daughter.  She loves the stories and really loved the collectible storage chest!<br/>There is just something about having a hard covered book to hold in your hands.  eBooks have nothing on a great hard cover book collection like this one!
 Not only is this a wonderful book, but I love this edition of the book.  The Harry Potter series is imaginative and charming.  It takes you to another world, that is entertaining and magical.  A must read for anyone who loves to dream.
 The author certainly tied up the loose ends, but seemed to have trouble with the strings.  Spent way to long on a traveling sequence, understated some significant events, and created an after-story that seemed uninspired.  What a shame, since the series was a lot of fun!
 Rowling is a very good writer who has tapped the imagination (and wallets to the tune of over a billion something of the other) of the world. I cannot add anything more other than that these are the third copies of the books that I am getting to read to my kids.
 My own first exposure to the Harry Potter phenomenon was being beaten to death with it in the Mass Media, back around the Turn Of the Millennium, when the first book "Sorcerer's Stone" first crossed over to paperback. I hadn't yet relocated to South Florida from my Western NY home town so I was down here as a tourist, visiting my parents for the Holidays. I remember grousing about the whole Harry Potter thing becoming a secular mantra; "Hare Krishna, Harry Potter, Potter Potter, Harry Harry". My 14-year-old niece replied serenely in the manner of Someone Who Has Seen the Light; "I think Harry Potter is awesome." Oops, Uncle Dick--I thought. But on my way up home after Christmas I was on the airport concourse at Atlanta waiting for my connecting flight and I saw the new paperback edition of "Sorcerer's Stone" in a bin outside the bookstore and on impulse I grabbed it. And so began my becoming a Harry Potter fan after having dissed him page-unread in the presence of a teenage girl. Over the years I've expanded that to a complete collection of Potter flicks, as well as more recently downloading this Kindle version of the books.<br/><br/>It may not seem like that much genius on author Rowling's part that she chose to let her hero grow older with his audience, but a number of side factors are at work in there as well. For example, remember when a faction of the Religious Right chose to forget that all "witch &amp; wizard" fiction is fantasy anyway and give everybody dire warnings of the dangers of the occult inherent in Potter fiction to impressionable young minds? One masterstroke of Rowling was to avoid making her protagonists too good to be true in terms of character. Which is why the Ministry Of Magic in these stories--a government quite apart from Her Majesty's Government as ruled by Muggles--falls for a time under the leaden heel of a fascist regime which conducts organized pogroms against its people in the course of these stories--no, I'm not going to make the cliché blunder of calling such persecutions "witch hunts"--which are every bit as ugly as they were under our Muggle Third Reich and the Muggle Soviet Union.<br/><br/>So there's no special "purity" inherent in being a witch or wizard. Rowling chooses to present her protagonists as PEOPLE. One of the older brothers of Harry's best friend is a Ministry functionary who's one of those pompous white-glover types who refuses to acknowledge the flaws in the regime he serves, even down to alienating his own flesh and blood. Another is a cliché "bully magnet"--but matures into a key figure in the popular rebellion against the Ministry's attempts to turn Hogwarts into an "indoctrination factory". The teacher who Harry despises the most is actually working for the Headmaster to protect Harry. This is a guy who had been picked on by Harry's late father when the two were students at Hogwarts, as well as harboring an unrequited crush on the girl who would become Harry's late mother. Nope--you're not getting the simplistic story lines found in Frank Baum's "Oz" series here. Maybe halfways like Tolkien if it was set in a recognizable modern era.<br/><br/>One last thing--perhaps it's irrelevant, I don't know. There are a lot of "reviews" on here which are mostly if not entirely devoted to the not-very-good packaging of the book edition of this set. Maybe I'm in no position to judge that edition since it's the non-physical Kindle version which I bought. But I bought this one as seven BOOKS, already knowing what I was getting from having bought each print edition separately as it was released. Seven BOOKS. To READ.
 Yay!
 In the second book of the Harry Potter series Rowling takes Harry back to Hogwarts in the form of a flying car that the Weasley boys "borrow" from their Father as they spirit Harry away from his evermore sour tempered relatives the Dursley's who would like nothing better than to see Harry magically make himself permanently disappear. In his new year at school Harry, and his two best friends face many new obstacles as they become detectives and sleuth around the spiraling stairways and dark corners of Hogwarts trying to figure out who is attacking students and leaving cryptic messages on the walls; One of them even being accused and another attacked!<br/><br/>This installment in the series is full of adventure and kept me turning the pages, it was a bit fast  paced and the ending could have been spread out more, and explained in more detail as far as the details but in all I enjoyed the book, and am looking forward to continuing the series.
 The book is amazing! The illustrations give it a new feeling rereading it. Every collector should get these books and I can't wait for the others to come out.<br/>My packaging, on the other hand, sucked and the covers were torn so I would advise against ordering online from Amazon if possible and instead price matching at a store that also sells the book.
 This book like the other 6 in the series, left me wanting more, but unlike the other 6 there will be no more and that makes me very sad.<br/>Very good, highly interesting and as I said I wanted more. I did,<br/>however, find the way she tied up the ends somewhat edifying.<br/>Maybe she could write a series about the next generation.
 Can we go wrong with JK and Jim? No.<br/><br/>17+ hours of Harry! Awesome set. We have listened to it twice so far.<br/><br/>~Mary
 Excellent packaging and the books are hard covers with larger print and better graphics. This is far easier to read than the soft covers and most of the books are 1st Editions Hard covers.  Great to have a complete set with embossed jackets.  Has the poor american phonetic spelling but we can tolerate this, as its a bit of fun identifying the mispelt words.<br/><br/>In general a great cost effective set of quality books for children who have not read the series.
 Superb ending!
 Excellent transaction, this book was here the day it was released in perfect condition, can't even dream of that type of service, thank you.
 The quality of the books are amazing.I've watched the movies and is in love with the entire film..I've read the books already,but decided to get the set for my own :).So,I've decided to buy the collection and read em all over again and leave em for my newborn when he's older :)
 Ok so i read the first book before i got this boxset but i'm so glad i did, these books are amazing and the box it comes with is NOT as bad as people make it sound it is cardboard but so what its pretty cool actully and people say it will brake easy blah blah blah well so long as you dont play with it it should be fine and it looks cool so dont listen to those people with bad ratings because of some box and BUY THIS ITEM you won't regret it...... (i got this for my birthday in april but i was to lazy to post a review lol)<br/><br/>hope this help't
 Nice to have all the books on m kindle.  Just rereading the series because my granddaughter is into Harry.  The books are easy to navigate, and there don't seem to be any errors in the electronic copy.  If you liked the movies you will love the books, it's so nice to get more details and take your time to investigate the imagination of Ms Rowling.
 This series may have been written for young people, but is a great series for young or old.  Great book
 Love it!
 It includes all hardcover books for less than the price of buying them individually.<br/><br/>That said, I wish the box was something more substantial than cardboard. Maybe even plastic would have been better.<br/><br/>I felt myself having to be very careful with this because I thought I would tear off the handles if I touched them.
 I absolutely love the Harry Potter series. I love J.K. Rowling's writing because it's refreshing and I can visualize the story as it unfolds, and with Jim Dale narrating it, it never gets old. I listen to it while I'm cleaning house, mowing, driving, or working on my laptop. I'd rather listen to Harry Potter than watch TV. At least, I get more done that way!
 I purchased this gift set for my daughter for Christmas.  It arrived damaged and I can not contact the seller for an exchange.  Amazon does not list a web link or a phone number for the seller.  I have been trying to get this resolved for over a week.
 I absolutely loved this book! I also like to collect the audio versions because Jim Dale's narration just cannot be beat! However 2 years after it's release and the audio version is STILL over $50.00?!! That is crazy, I'll wait another 2 years for it.
 Bought this because my kid is reading the series and our local library runs out.  I now regret that I didn't go the extra mile and get the hardcover version.  This paperback cover is easily damaged.  Also the books are thick, so it bends when opened in the middle for a long time.  Oh well, at least it is reasonably priced.
 I'm a big J.K. Rowling fan and therefore a Harry Potter enthusiast. Excellently written. If you love the rest of the series you will love this one even more. Not for young children (under 8-10). This one gets even darker than the others. Spoiler Alert!!!  There is a lot of characters that die in this one.
 This is an affordable, beautiful box set!  I'm very happy with the set itself, &amp; of course the books are incredible.  I received the package in brand new condition very quickly, no problems whatsoever.
 Love it!!!
 great
 We got this for our 13 year old daughter, even though she has read every book in the series 20 times. She is an avid Hogwarts and Harry fan and hopes to keep this for years to come. I even talked her into a new tradition with these books. Every time she finishes one, she writes the date and her initials on the back inside cover. I think it will help her enjoy these even more over the years. Although the case is really just cardboard, she loved it just as if it had been leather. Another bonus is that it was almost 200 at the local big bookstore, cant beat the price here!
 My grandchildren love these DVDs and they make for great family viewing and discussions.  What's more important than encouraging families to do things together and also to create a desire in children to read and use their imaginations?
 Purchased from third party.  Item was received exactly as described.  Interaction was seamless and delivery was prompt.  Very pleased and so was the receipient of this gift.
 We are huge Harry Potter fans...All 5 of us.  Loved this book...have read it at least 3 times in the last 4 to 5 years
 These books were hugely formative for me as a kid, and I can always go back to them as an adult and still have an appreciation for the world and characters that JK Rowling created. I already have my own hard copies, but on very long trips when I can't bring stacks of books with me, it's nice to know I can call these stories back when I need them electronically (Accio!). I don't see myself saying likewise for any other series, since I love me some pulped tree slices, but for Harry Potter, exceptions must be made. This version also has the chapter illustrations I always loved, so the whole reading experience feels pretty complete. It's not a cheap e-book, but it's certainly less expensive than buying each in the set separately, and why wouldn't you have the whole set? The series is a modern masterpiece, and every child should read it; the earlier the better.
 I mostly purchased these for the new artwork, which is really beautiful. The covers of the books have a texture and vellum to them that is really nice. They are packed tight in that box and trying to get them back in is a task. I worry about warping in the future to both box and books but for now, they will just stay in there.
 Very appropriate ending for the series.  Can be read by all ages.  Would read another series by the author or single novel
 At first my order never got here, I had to email them to let them know and they did send me another book set. But then when I finally received that, it was a paperback set. I had ordered the hardcover set. I emailed them once again, and have not heard back still. It's been over a month. I will not be ordering from them again.
 As others have said, the box it comes in is just cardboard, but that didn't really bother me as I bought this for the books inside, not their container. I have a bookshelf to put them on display with. After reading the entire series twice through our local library I finally decided it was time to own the set for my home collection.
 Bought it as a gift and it is a great gift indeed.  The hard bound was an option that I considered - but I bought the paper back for its content and not its cover and ofcourse the 70% reduced price.<br/><br/>- San
 I was so happy when I got the messege in the mail.<br/><br/>I was thrilled, the books were in excellent condition,<br/><br/>and it came pretty fast!<br/><br/>I've read them all now. and I wanna do it again.<br/><br/>thanks Amazon.
 As the last installment of HP, it was a good run.  My family has and will continue to enjoy this book.
 I never had a full hardcover set. My first Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) was a paperback I got at the 5th grade book Fair. Absolutely fell in love. After receiving The Cursed Child and the Fantastic Beasts screenplay, I decided to treat myself to a full hardcover set. I also pre ordered the Hogwarts textbooks, because duh.
 It was easy to read, I have seen the movie and this has more exiting events and explains more about the story, I would definitely read the next book.
 I love having all of the Harry Potter books in one volume, even though I did purchase each one separately.  This is quite convenient and keeps my library from getting cluttered.  As for the books themselves, well there's a good reason Rowling's a billionaire; she's an out and out genius and her Harry Potter story rivals Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings."
 The final installment of the Harry Potter series is finally here and although at fist I didn't like the book and I was upset it was the end I came to my senses. The book was fantastic, from the very beginning when I was confused as to what was going on, till the final battle at Hogwarts where I bawled hysterically. I will admit the Epilogue was not my favorite but overall this book cleaned up a lot of the loose ends and I was more then happy to read about Snape and Dumbledore's amazing pasts.
 its wonderful to relive there stories with the fantastic illustrations. i have been reading the books to my young children, a little bit each night.  They have short attention spans, but the illustration help keep them interested.<br/><br/>Amazon is sellign these at a great price, and i was very happpy with the condition of the book as it arrived.
 If you want to shell out the extra money for a new boxed set, be my guest. However, I had a great deal from my used one and it was a fraction of the new price. After I purchased them used, I was so glad I did! They were still in very good condition and were plenty readable. The only reason I removed a star was that the third book of the series I purchased didn't have the protective sleeve and had the name of a previous owner scrawled in the cover. Despite this, they don't have any lasting marks otherwise.<br/><br/>Overall, a great purchase I will cherish years to come!
 Having seen the movies decided to see which was better the books or movies. Still can't decide.  Both are very exciting and but I am still reading the series and I am enjoying them both.  The movies are over but I can still see the books.  Special effects of the mind are sometimes better than on the silver scene.<br/>Let your mind do the work.
 So. So. Good.
 I wanted a paperback and got a hard back
 Not only is the series a great read for all the family as you follow the life of Harry from Jr. High through  to marriage and parenting.  Also Amazon was quick to respond after it was discovered that one of the volumes was missing a section of pages by replacing the set within 3 days after being notified.  Great job Amazon.
 A great conclusion, wasn't disappointed. Rowling sort of changed her writing voice in the sixth book, which I didn't like, but this one gets it back.
 Bought as a gift for my 9 year old, who is developing a bit of an interest in magic. She absolutely loves the books. The big 'ol box of books is great. I think my only complaints might be that the gold letting on the books comes off pretty easily, and a couple of the pages have what appear to be print smudges, making a few lines rather difficult to read.
 Perfect end to an amazing series
 I love the Harry Potter series.
 I ordered this hard cover complete set for my 5th grader. She loves them, and much better quality than the used library books she brings home. There was minor wear &amp; tear as expected and described by the seller. They are much better than I expected honestly.  Great stories, really gets the kids interested in continuous reading.
 My daughter is twelve years old and reads these books endlessly.  She loves the books and movies and appreciates all the extra details from the books that were not in the movies.  Easy to read and keeps their attention.  I strongly recommend these books.
 Love!
 This isn't something you can put down. Once you start the first book, you will become obsessed and want to finish all eight of them. This is a wonderful and fun adventure series!
 All the Harry Potter series is great. I finally got around to reading the first 2 books and I'm glad I did.
 Atlanta book company arrived on time and in great condition!<br/>I am very happy to order my stuff from this seller because i have<br/>bought other books from this seller and they came on time looking super!<br/>Thank you very much for your convenience!
 I liked this book a bit better than Sorcerer's Stone, just because it was a bit more action-packed. The best part I thought was either when Harry went into the Chamber Of Secrets to rescue the kidnapped Ginny Weasley, or when he learned he was a Parseltongue (person who talks to snakes.) I'd recommend this book to any Harry Potter fan out there!(:
 I bought this for my boyfriend to introduce him to the magical world of Harry Potter! For anyone who is now starting or even reliving this mystical, magical journey, I assure you that nothing beats holding these books in your bare hands! These are great for any collector and also great for catching the tears that are gonna pour outta your eyes! Great buy!
 So well written and a fast read.  Would not recommend for young children, but a great read for adolescents and teens.
 Just as described. Happy with my purchase.
 The Harry Potter box set came brand new, as promised.  One trunk handle was pulled out and not tied, but that was easily fixed.  I love the product!
 Books and jackets are in great shape.  They arrived quickly as promised.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-Hardcover-Box-Set-Books-1-6/dp/0439827604/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Hardcover Box Set (Books 1-6)</a>
 Amazing item! I have been on alot of long car rides recently and started to listen to the harry potter books on tape. All of them are amazing! altho this company sent me the wrong one. oops. better luck next time!
 As sad as I am to see the series come to an end, this was a great way to do it!  The book was packed with action almost from the beginning and Rowling keeps you guessing all the way to the end....will Harry survive?
 I love this book
 This was the best of all!  I had tears in my eyes when I came to the end knowing that I couldn't visit my friends anymore.....I sure hope Ms. Rowling 's decides to keep writing Harry Potter Books!
 This item was listed as a hardcover edition, but what I received was a paperback. While I was disappointed in this discovery, the seller maintained a level of integrity that is tough to come by in today's society (in my experience) and refunded my money without question. Not only that, but the seller also suggested I keep the item. Thank you so much!
 Really good! Can't wait to read the next one :-) ! I suggest listening to the movie soundtracks while you read, it's nice! 👻🔮
 Good
 I love this book. There were some unexpected plot points. Overall this is my favorite book from the series. It delivered the closure promise by the auther.
 Great story.
 Excellent product, excellent quality, shipped promptly, will be back. THANKS for the EXCELLENT service :) :)<br/>Bought whole collection :)
 The people who were surprised that this is a card board box need to relax.  Aside from the fact that it says in the product description that it's a cardboard box, it's $120 for SEVEN HARDCOVER BOOKS.  This is a great deal just to get all seven books in hardcover.  Did someone honestly think they'd get a solid wooden box for that price?  Seriously?<br/><br/>Return it if you don't like it, but please use just a LITTLE intelligence the next time you order something.
 How can you not love this book? If you are a fan of the earlier books in the series - stop reading this review, and go read the Deathly Hallows. This is the perfect conclusion to the series I grew up with, and any fan of mystery, adventure, loyalty, and magic will appreciate the incredible ending that J.K. Rowling has crafted.
 Just what my son wanted.  Although the box is cardboard it is pretty sturdy.
 Excellent book as usual for J.K.Rowling.  Starts off slowly with a lot of background information and then keeps one on edge.
 it was a present
 Loved the idea but was very disappointed with the chest.  For the price you'd think it would be more sturdy so it could be a collector's item.
 Absolutely amazing. Simply marvelous. Outstanding story, overall. However, it really leaves you hanging. I can't help myself wondering what happens next.
 The literally millions of us who have had the opportunity to follow Harry as his adventures played out were truly privileged . The Potter series is a rare literary feat and looking back, one can only marvel at its brilliance and looking sadly forward, wonder what will fill the void.<br/><br/>True, the movies, if done well will help, but ultimately, the Potter series will be irreplaceable.<br/><br/>Thank you Ms Rowling!!!!!!!!
 The Harry Potter series is excellent!!!<br/>Was very disappointed with the quality of the books as I see were several other people .... pages falling out. :o(
 one of my favorites! great ending to the series
 This was a great book and which I received from a really fast supplier.  Would definitely do business with this seller again.  I give an A+++++
 My husband and I read through the entire series as they were coming out. We thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and character development. Although we have the entire print set of the books we were glad to pick up this kindle edition to store and read again to our girls in years to come.
 wonderful British version!. .....I dont think they should be allowed to be marked up for high prices, but the book was wel recived! Beautiful book cover illustrations!
 I am a big Harry Potter fan and own several sets of the books, but the UK adult edition is absolutely my favorite.  The covers are gorgeous and I am so happy that I picked up the whole set.  I had every book in the set except this one and I had regretted not purchasing it and I was so happy that I did because I love having the complete set.
 This review comes a bit late, but I loved the series so I am going to post this now anyway.
 I was SO happy when I saw that Amazon had this Harry Potter set. This set is Amazing! It comes in a fun trunk like box. The box is made of cardboard but is sturdy and looks really nice. The books themselves are really nice editions of Harry Potter, the kind of editions you would get at Barnes &amp; Nobles or Sam's Club. As a Harry Potter fan and an avid book collector, I highly recommend this set.
 A nice little collection (missing the seventh book).  Very handy for those of us that have been procrastinating reading the series.
 i liked dobby. He was hilarious! "Dobby was so surprised he let his masters dinner burn" "even if dobby has to shut his ears in the oven door"
 I was worried that she would let us down with an unlikely end to the Harry Potter series, but JK Rowling has done a fantastic job once again.
 As soon as my grandson opened it he started to read and had trouble putting it down.It immediately became his favorite.
 Love this whole series
 WE RECEIVE THIS BOOK ON TIME,  THE QUALITY WAS JUST GREAT,  AND EVERITHING AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE. WE GREATLY RECOMMEND IT.
 These were really nice and stuff! It was great to finally have the full set series of these and they weren't a bad price, (as oppose to like the $100+ hardbacks). They are paperback, so you have to be cautious since they crease easily, but other than that it's really the words inside that count, and if your a Harry Potter fan, you love it! The quality was good, fresh look for a book, and I love the box :)
 :)
 I am a huge harry Potter fan and this entire Harry Potter book collection was amazing was packaged into  two different boxes to protect it and the collectors addition chest, I received the package as I said it was well protected not a scratch or a bump on the chest or books. I don’t know who posted that their chest was damaged but I strongly believe it is false that the damage it themselves. So if you love and enjoy J.K. Rowling and her beautiful books buy this set it is worth over $200!!!! Always❤️
 Our 8 year old granddaughter has been borrowing Harry Potter books.  She was absolutely amazed when she opened the treasure box to discover the 7 hardbound editions of the series.  I think she will treasure these books for her entire childhood.  Well worth the investment, and the treasure box is a very nice way to keep them together.
 I was disappointed with the last couple of books in the series. There were too many pages where the printing was so faint that I was unable to read the print. I had to guess what was being said by interpreting the parts that I could read.
 Great buy - I like how the book has a darker themed cover and is compressed into a smaller sized novel for a more adult look. Its nice to have as a copy that's smaller for carrying around in a book bag or something. The copies you usually find of HP in the children's section are either hardcover or large print (or both) and are sort of bulky and take up lots of space.<br/><br/>For the same price as a children's copy this one's smaller and looks way cooler (IMO)
 Finally I got the Harry Potter bug, and now I can read it from paperback - the way I prefer. This is a great set and looks nice on the shelf.
 My kids LOVE LOVE LOVE Harry Potter! Both my 7 year old and 9 year old read the book and wants the next one as soon as they are finished with one. We are now up to book 4 for my 7 year old and book 5 for my 9 year old and they can't read enough it seems. Definitely a way to get them away from watching TV and playing video games.
 My only beef with this product is that they haven't made all of them in the gold edition.  Other than that the book is of good quality and everyone knows the content is as well.
 The book is great! Non-stop action from the beginning to the end....I wish JK Rowling didn't end it here at book 7.....I highly recommend it!
 My box set came in flawless, no dents or damage. I've never read this series, and am just starting now, and to be honest I was interested in starting because I saw this box set design. I love the new covers, much more modern, and love the soft touch feel. I will say though, that the fit is VERY VERY VERY tight.
 The books are beautiful! The new artist outdid himself. And they still have Mary GrandPrè's illustrations are still on the inside and that is definitely a plus. My only concern (and it's really my ONLY concern) is that the box it comes in is really small, and it is really hard to take the books in and out of it. I almost tore a cover off of one that wasn't going in. But, all in all, the books are amazing, absolutely amazing. Anyone, Harry Potter-long-time-fan or a newcomer to the world of Harry potter will love these new edition books!<br/><br/>P.S. I get loads of compliments on them too, that's a bonus :)
 The product was brand new and came in excellent condition.  My son was very happy with the product and it came in the condition that was described.
 I have been a fan of the movies, but hadn't read the books until now.  Like most adaptations the books have far more detail and the characters are really developed.  This series works for any fan of fantasy or action from 11 years on up.  I was so hooked on her novels I also purchased the books Quidditch Through the Ages, The Tales or Beedle the Bard, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
 The audio book is teriffic!  I get lost in Jim Dale's interpretation of the book. I have listened to it several times and get something new each time.
 Perfect
 I've been a Harry Potter fan for as long as i can remember. I bought the Kazu Kibuishi special edition set because my original set as a child was sadly ruined in a storage building. The  bookset is lovely all around. The cover art is amazing.<br/><br/>One drawback is the box the books are set in. It is a very tight fit, and it is hard to get the books out and to get all the books back into it once they have been taken out. The first time i removed them from the box, their covers were bent, from the packaging i would assume. Other than that, the set is very nice.
 My wife and I have been avid readers of the Harry Potter series for a long time.  We used to have the hard back set but we gave them to our children in preparation for retirement.  We will be full-time RVers and have a concern about the weight of our RV so we got rid of all of our hard back books.  We intended on downloading those titles onto our Kindle's but we were disappointed to learn that many of those titles, including the Harry Potter series, are not available to Kindle.  So, we purchased the paper back set.
 I bought Harry Potter series for my 13 year old grandson who is a big Harry Potter fan.  He asked me to read the series, too, so we could discuss it together.  I have been reading non stop since!  It is amazingly well written.  I guess I thought it would be pitched to a younger audience and have been pleasantly surprised by the writing skill of Rowling.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes fun, light reading instead of so much re-run TV!
 This book was fantastic.  It tied up alot of loose ends and explained the questions I had up to this point.<br/>I would highly recommend this book as well as the other 6 in the series.<br/>This series allowed me, a person over 50 years old, to escape into a great fantasy world.
 I love Harry Potter and was very excited to finally be able to get it on my kindle app. My only complaint about this is that when you try to read with the iPad vertical instead of horizontal it messes up the pages. You get repeat sentences on almost every page. While this is not horrible, it is irritating. I would love it if the publisher could fix this issue and issue an update.
 Arguably, the best of the Harry Pottter books. Ties everything together, and adds more to the story. Loved it.
 Great set of hardcover books. The case is pretty cheap and doesn't add much to the value of the set, but the price of the books together was definitely cheaper than buying the hardcovers individually so it was worth it in the end. Highly recommended!
 I have the whole set of books which I read (even tho I have the movies and have seen them numerous time) at least once a year.  I love to read them to remember how they differ from the movies.  Very close but there are some things i love to read that aren't in the movies.  I highly recommend the books to all ages.
 Harry potter has been forbidden (thank God) by the .Christian community because all that's good about what a human being can be is in the finality book.  It bearings us a stirring end with all the truth. There is only one drawback to the book which I will not say for concern it will be truly listened to in the wrong way.
 I always wind up watching the movies at least once a year. I had the collection of books once the last came out, but gave them to my nieces to enjoy a few months later. I'm glad I opted to get the set again. There's tons in the books that the movies just don't cover. Rowling made a masterpiece when she made this series. I think the books will be popular for generations to come.
 I like the book. I recommend reading the whole series of books to all ages. It really keeps your imagination on it's toes. Even though the movies are out on DVD. The books are still great to read.
 I purchased this set of Harry Potter books for my grandson for Christmas.  He collects them.  He was very happy with them.  I am truly amazed at how lovingly he looks through the books.  He has many sets but always thoroughly looks at each new set as though it was the first time he'd ever seen the books.
 Great ending to a great adventure!!  I am going to miss the world of Harry Potter! I hope J.K. Rowling writes more children's books!!
 I am a Grandmother, and have read and own all First Editions of the Potter series. This last book was a great read, and I'm sorry for the series to have come to an end. MUCH better series than Fifty Shades, which would have sufficed at one book. Enjoyed reading the children grow up.
 My son really enjoyed the book and he was going to let his friends a bout it. Was very happy with the seller the book was as he describe it.
 Well better than the Percy Jackson,hunger games or magic tree house books combined.you should go to the store right now and buy it
 I bought this set because I wanted to read all of the books before the 7th movie came out.  I was pleasantly surprised at what a nice package this was.  I know there have been others that have complained about the packaging but I don't agree.<br/>This is a great gift for a Harry Potter fan! I will pass this on to my kids...
 J.K. Rowling's work in the 5th 6th and final Harry Potter Books, lacks imagination and the magic that drew me to read it in the first place. I found the ending to be cheesy and predictable and the novel as a whole very boring and unnecessarily dark.
 I purchased this box set as a Christmas present.  I was concerned about it arriving on time.  The worry was needless, as this order came lightening fast!!!!  It was just as described.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend purchasing from this seller.  I was 100% satisfied.
 I've been eagerly waiting for this book since I pre-ordered it in April and I was not disappointed when I received it today. It is beautiful! I feel like there are even more illustrations than there were in the first book.<br/><br/>People who are very afraid of spiders might want to be careful- there are some very detailed and creepy pictures of spiders. They don't normally bother me but there is one double paged spread of the giant spiders in the forest that creeped me out a little.<br/><br/>This book has a nice Halloween vibe to it too- perfect for this time of year.
 i bought this set right when the 7th book came out in hardback. this was a great deal for all of the other 6 books and the little box keeps them all together.
 Just needed a set that wasn't too expensive, and easy to keep together (paperbacks can get rather scattered.) Decent quality bindings, etc. If you need a second/spare set, this is a good choice. (and if you need me to review the Harry Potter series for you, really, where have you been the past couple decades?)
 Great price however some of the larger books (the last 4) have loose pages if you open the book too far, such as with a child reader. So be careful not to loose some pages! The binding on these books are minimal at best but for the price, you get what you paid for.....
 Was a little disapointed that the case was cardboard, not wood like I thought.
 Great
 I love the Harry Potter series and was really excited to read the final book. However, I was really dissapointed in the ending, I felt that it was too sappy and fairytaleish for Harry. I was expecting a darker ending, not for everything to be giftwrapped and tied up to a nice neat ending.
 Books are very attractive. They have a nice soft, rubbery texture to them. The artwork on the covers is very nice. I took one star off because the books are really crammed in there. Be careful, I tore the box a little trying to get one out. If you take out one of the thinner books, they all fit great. Could have made the box a bit larger.
 This seller was great, and I was thrilled with the quality of the books. I would definately do business with these people again!
 What is not to like - this is Harry Potter - just the right size for reading late at night, easy to handle - I gave all my hard cover books to the Grandchildren, but had to have my own set to read and re-read.  A boxed full set would be better, but when reading from the beginning again, 4 were enough.
 I love these new illustrated editions. It makes reading to a younger generation of Harry Potter fans easier with the illustrations and larger font. They are absolutely gorgeous. The cloth ribbon bookmark is a great touch and you can tell a lot of care and thought went into the making of these editions. Can't wait for the others to come out.
 Great ending. Such integrity. I can let my mind wander into Harry's children's adventures. Love truly demonstrated well.
 As a 12 year old reviewer (yes, I checked the over 13 box) I want to tell the adults that this is the best Harry Potter book. It is a very interesting book with all of its twists and turns.  Most of the story lines were completed and done well.<br/>I'm not going to give anything away, for the people who are still reading. I highly recomend this book to all ages. (just a tip, read very carefully, and read EVERYTHING).
 It was great to have the book delivered on the first day it was out.<br/>Pre-ordering enabled everyone to get caught up in the excitement and save a<br/>little money as well.  A very good read, as usual.
 Although I admit I was a little harried and even stressed at the darkness this last chapter of Harry Potter exposed me to, it was extremely satisfying and the end as good as it gets.  JK Rowling is a master story teller and shows that in this book in spades.
 I'm very disappointing with this set. It's all seven books in a crappy folded cardboard box. The "sturdy handles" are just pieces of string, and when I unboxed mine, on of the strings had already been pulled out. The "privacy lock" is a cheap feeling plastic latch that i am sure will break with just a little bit of use. I plan on returning this set as soon as I possible can.
 Harry Potter is the best! I love listening and imagining all the things that are happening. HIghly recommend this.
 All the Harry Potters are a great read...
 Who wouldn't want this! I was waiting for all the books to come out in a complete set and this one is perfect. Looks great. You already know these are great books to read for adults, teens and older children. I was hooked from the first paragraph. Still my favorite books. It's a buy.
 These books sure add more to the movies, you can get much more detail from them and they enhance the movie experience.
 This book captivated me from beginning to end, with each chapter containing action, excitement, and purpose.  This is, by far, the best book of the series.  It is one of the few books I will read again and again.
 Great price for this product.  Can't beat $5 per book!  Fast shipping.  So far i am halfway through the first book and love it!
 We are Harry Potter fanatics. My husband and I were delighted to find out they were releasing illustrated versions of our favorite series.  The art inside is so beautiful and really adds to the story for me. It is also easier to get our toddlers to sit through their HP indoctrination when there are lovely pictures to keep their attention.
 There are not enough good things to say about Harry Potter books.  My 7-year-old grand daughter read all of them!  They have been a great enticement for her to read! Her father is reading them separately but at the same time.  After each book, they watch the movie and talk about how they differ.  This was her favorite Christmas gift!
 Great for car rides
 Kids, adults.  Harry Potter is great.  My daughter is seven and quite likes the books as well.  It's written on a level for younger readers, but it's a great story.
 The book came quickly and in good condition.<br/>The book is the last in the Harry Potter series. It does well to detail and wind up the huge story of Harry Potter and his friends. The story is quite dark to the ending, so should be read by parents before deciding if it is too dark for younger children.
 I had already read these books and bought this collection to keep it for my grandchildren. Maybe they'll love it as I did - and if they don't, well, I'll enjoy reading them again!
 pretty good condition but smelled strongly of smoke :(
 I first read this novel several years ago, but had not reviewed it until now. Since I own a copy of "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child", I decided I needed to revisit the series.<br/><br/>This second reading was just as delightful as the first! This series just has a freshness, an amazing originality, that I know I'll NEVER get tired of!<br/><br/>Poor Harry Potter has not had an easy life....after all, he's been targeted for bullying and attempted murder. In the first book, not only was he nearly killed by Voldemort, but then grew up being constantly bullied by his nearest relatives, the Dursleys, who are Muggles (non-magical people). Then he started attending the magical boarding school -- Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and found two new enemies: Draco Malfoy, and Professor Snape. All of these characters continue to harass him in this second installment, too.<br/><br/>Amazingly, Harry manages to deal with it all, including the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is ridiculously narcissistic. And in the end, as always, Harry emerges as hero!<br/><br/>In this book, there's a new mystery to be solved, as several students, and one cat, are Petrified. This means they're literally turned into statues. At the same time, Harry is hearing something very unusual, that no one else can hear. And a certain villain makes a very unexpected appearance....<br/><br/>The three main characters are GREAT, as usual. Harry remains resolute in solving any and all strange mysteries that may arise, and he  has two incredible allies in Hermione and Ron, who back him up in all of his adventures! I love how Hermione constantly turns to books as the answer to every problem that crops up. When in doubt, head for the library! As for Ron, I really admire his loyalty to Harry. He's given Harry some very great help along the way, as well.<br/><br/>All the secondary characters are also wonderful, which is a Rowling trademark. This is very important, as I do feel that secondary characters can either make or break a novel.<br/><br/>Professor McGonagall, although very strict, is also very fair, as well as compassionate. Professor Snape is his usual nasty, detestable self, constantly directing his unpleasant remarks to Harry. The Weasleys -- especially Fred and George -- are very comical. I love how the whole family accepts and loves Harry, who is an orphan. And Hagrid is his usual sweet, adorable self! In this novel, we find out more about his rather shadowy past.<br/><br/>Three new minor characters are introduced here -- the house elf, Dobby, Draco's vicious father, Lucius Malfoy, and Professor Gilderoy Lockhart.<br/><br/>Poor Dobby leads a miserable existence, but, in spite of that, he attempts to warn Harry away from Hogwarts. Unfortunately, for some reason, he's not able to tell Harry exactly why it would be dangerous for him to return to the school. My heart went out to him!<br/><br/>I thought it was great that Rowling also threaded in some social commentary through this character. But then, she's been doing that since the first book. It's very obvious that she's against abuse of all types, as this is a recurrent theme in the books. Dobby is mistreated by Lucius on a constant basis. Harry is mistreated by the Dursleys, and abused by Draco and Snape. This is one of the elements of the books that, I'm sure, has contributed to their appeal. Rowling definitely sticks up for the underdog!<br/><br/>The portrayal of Lucius is very well done. He's cruel, despotic, and evil. He might come across as very stereotypical, as Harry's Muggle relative, Uncle Vernon, does, but again, I think Rowling is using some of her characters to speak out against abuse. Unfortunately, children in particular do suffer a lot of abuse worldwide, and so do other groups who have no access to power of any type.<br/><br/>Through these two characters, Rowling also makes a very important statement regarding bigotry. Lucius (as well as his son, Draco) detests "Mudbloods", which is the name given to magical people whose parents happen to be Muggles. Lucius also loathes elves, as they are powerless to change their own status unless someone helps them out. As for Uncle Vernon, he detests magical people. Both characters are constantly judging and stereotyping those who belong to other, "different" groups. Both are, of course, insensitive to the suffering of those they unfairly mistreat.<br/><br/>Gilderoy Lockhart provides a lot of the comic relief in this novel. He is incredibly FOND of himself! He's constantly telling people about his supposed magical exploits, as well as pushing his own books, making these a requirement for the subject he's teaching. It turns out that he's just a ridiculous windbag, but, along the way, he provided a lot of laughs at tense points in the narrative.<br/><br/>I also loved the character of "Moaning Myrtle", even though she was constantly complaining and whining. I do feel sorry for her. She had self-esteem issues while alive, and these continued to plague her even as a ghost. She just had a very raw deal. Even her death was totally unfair. She does help out our heroes, though. Without the clues she provided, they would not have been able to solve the mystery so easily, and lives would not have been saved.<br/><br/>The novel ended in a very satisfactory manner, as the first book did. Rowling is obviously not a fan of cliffhangers, which is something I really appreciate! Of course, it was Harry who saved the day. In fact, in this particular installment, I was very strongly reminded of Greek mythology. Harry could have been one of the famous Greek heroes, in that he battled some very great obstacles, and used his intelligence and resourcefulness in doing so. I'm sure this was intentional on Rowling's part. She certainly excels at bringing in all kinds of literary allusions to these books!<br/><br/>Rowling's imagination is amazingly fertile, as she brings in more plot twists, more incredible events, and makes her readers wish even more that they studied and lived at Hogwarts! I find it hard to believe that these books should have met with some negative criticism. After all, they fall squarely into the tradition of the hero who triumphs against all odds! And they do so in an entirely unique and very entertaining way, too!
 After a looooooooooooooooooong wait, as I live in Argentina, I recieved my books! The package is beautiful! very arty and great looking. The books have very nice covers with lots of detail. But in my opinion the paper of the pages is kinda... crapy... not sure if that is really the word i'm looking for. Anyhow, it is very recomendable and the price is good. =)
 Books do not come with the chest.  You have to click the "Details" button to find this out.  Buyer beware.
 Love it!!!
 The most awesome, delightful book ever! This is the 11th time I've read the Harry Potter series. I recommend this book to anyone 5 and over.
 I needed to complete my set of books for my library as I had borrowed a couple of books from a friend.  Needed to return them to him.  Buying these like new books on line was perfect to do that and the price was just right.
 The last book of Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, is magnificent. I mean, I'm totally in love with this book. The way J.K. Rowling has written the last book, is very impressive. I love this book very much. I recommend everyone to read this book. Please, do read it.
 I absolutely LOVE it! Not only is it the British edition but the box the books came in is wonderful. I feel like I have an entirely new series and gets me excited every time I think about it. I haven't had the chance to read through it yet but I do take the box out and look at the books inside before putting it away again. The books look very pretty and are thinner than the American published version but that's a plus to it. I recommend buying this if you're a big fan of Harry Potter.
 J.K. Rowling has written one of the best series of books ever.  I prefer listening to it as read by Jim Dale because he adds a demension to the book that lets your immagination run away with you.
 The book came the day it went onto the market. In fact, I found it in my entryway first thing in the morning. Great timing!!
 This is my absolute favorite book series ever! I've read it many times, but always borrowed from a friend or the library, and figured it was high time I actually own them myself. Definitely worth reading if you never have, and it does not matter how old you are! They're not just for kids or young adults, people much older, like myself, love them too!
 I received my package quicker then I expected - it was GREAT!!!  I have always liked these books and unfortauntely I had lost my copy of book 7 and was able to find it and complete my set.  Great price, hard back just as the other books are.  Thank you!!
 Ms Rowling is an excellent storyteller and writer.  I really liked the many themes woven throughout all the stories and was impressed by her ability to keep things fresh and interesting.<br/><br/>The one minor complaint I have is that she did get a bit long and preachy in the latter books, but it didn't affect the overall quality of her writing.<br/><br/>On a quality note, the formatting didn't work too well in landscape mode (it frequently cut off sentences at the end of columns) on my iPad. It worked fine in portrait mode.
 After deciding to purchase the entire H.P. set we started price shopping.  We found this same set at local book stores for around 200.00.  This set is exactly the same and considerably less making it a great buy!  I've read reviews that were disappointed with the packaging, but I wasn't concerned with that, nor was I disappointed.  I think the Harry Potter "trunk" they come in is a fun way to receive them.  At this price they would make a wonderful gift for any Harry Potter fan.  The books are quality books and arrived in perfect condition.  I highly recommend this Harry Potter Boxed volumes 1-7 set!
 These are a beautiful book set! The cover art is beautiful and more adult-like, and have a velvety feel to them. The print is slightly smaller but with an adult edition, I slightly expected that. I'm extremely happy with this book set.
 Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old grand daughter.  She and the whole family are deligted with the books.  She has all the movies, been to the Harry Potter exhibit at Universal in Orlando -- this set of books is the best of all of her Harry Potter collection.
 I had been looking for the series of books at bookstores with no luck. I found this on Amazon.com and it was perfect! The price was great! It was given as a gift and the reciepient was overjoyed with the great presentation of the books in the little set.
 I have read every single one of J.K. Rowling's books in the Harry Potter series and the last one is by far, the best of the 7 books.  To see the battle between good and evil, Harry and Voldemort come to a conclusion was very exciting and satisfying.  Spending the last twelve years with these characters, I was sad to see it end but what an ending.  J.K. Rowling did not disappoint.
 It is a great book and I was able to get it for about half the cost in the stores.  I was able to find a price within my means and was able to complete the buy in a few minutes.  It arrived quickly.  All in all a great deal.  I'll be back.  Thank you.
 Reading the series in an attempt to keep up with my 10 years old daughter. Enjoyed it quite a bit.
 I would have preferred for Neville to have a bigger imprint on the story, seeing as how the prophecy could have been meant for him.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the particular pairings down the road. Too predictable and easy.<br/><br/>Harry and Luna, perhaps?
 My whole family has enjoyed the Harry Potter series including my 85 year-old Mom.  J. K. Rowling's imagination is "WOW"!
 The book is just what our grandson wanted and came in mail quickly.
 it a very good book  series go Harry potter !<br/>my friends LOVE it· tom/he who must not be named is so cool!
 This book is one of the best books I have ever read!!!!!  Sincerely,  Davis R. Grimm<br/>p.s.  Best Book Ever!!!!!
 I love this series and this is my fourth set of the books. I love the box and the new covers. It's all very well made. If you love this series or this is your first time reading the books, this box set is perfect.<br/>My only problem is it's really tight. It's hard to get the books out of the box.
 I bought this set so I could have a readable, hands-on version of the series I didn't mind loaning out to people, dog-earing the pages, or re-reading over and over again. The stunning, rich new cover art is a joy to look at every time I see it on the shelf or on my bedside table. I'm in love with this paperback set!
 Thank you! It is great! Love it!
 El Objeto ha llegado en perfectas condiciones y en un tiempo menor al estimado en principio. El embalaje estaba correcto y tanto los libros como la caja donde vienen colocados están bien realizados y originales. Ideal para un regalo a niños o no tan niños.
 This is a very good book. I can't wait to read it again! I will show my family this awesome series!!!!
 The packaging is awesome! The feel of the books in the hands is lightweight! I love the size of the print on the pages as I have trouble with my vision! When I hold one of the books it feels like I've picked up and old friend!!
 My daughter has all the books and I read all of them years ago.  Since I love reading on my Kindle paper-white I wanted to have all the Harry Potter books so I could re-read the stories.  After seeing the movies so many times, I forgot most of the things that happened in the books that didn't happen in the movies.  I am really enjoying the books again.
 This collection in everything I expected it to be. Affordable and nice Harry Potter's firt 6 books in the series. Arrived in pretty good conditions and in the the promised. Great. Thanks.
 These books are amazing but the little chest that they come in is cheap and flimsy. Not worth the $200 bucks it was originally posted for. If you want the books just buy the books in hard cover for much less. The chest if absolutely not worth it. I got it for my wife as a gift and I was embarrassed to give it to her. It's folded cardboard and a flimsy latch. Wish it was real wood or plastic.
 It's Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Do I really need to say anything else?<br/><br/>Look, it's 2016, and if you don't know who Harry Potter is, you need to get out from under a rock and meet him, Hermoine and Ron.<br/><br/>All 7 books in one large file is the main drawback to this set.  But, easy enough to maneuver with your Kindle.
 Beautiful all the way around. I can't wait to share these with my children. Incredible- NON MOVIE- illustrations; I so appreciate how they pictures match the book's descriptions and are independents from the films. I own all three that are available so far and will reorder the next one. Can't wait to have a complete set.
 The best in the bunch of excellent books by J.K. Rowling. She sucked me in from the very first page of her first book. I have read the whole series several times. Sometimes makes me wish I had kids to read it to. Highly recommended for those who love mystery, thrills, intrigue, magic, hope &amp; love.
 Though this book couldn't be considered "literary fiction" the characters and environments are effectively fleshed out and fun to interact with.<br/><br/>I'm a bit late to the Harry Potter universe but am happy to have started. This book, while certainly childish, brings back memories of grade school and I enjoy revisiting that mindspace.<br/><br/>On to the next book!
 50,000,000 readers can't be wrong. My comment relates only to the e-book edition: my grandkids kids are disdainful of my Amazon Fire, much preferring hard copies themselves. I appreciate the portability of the reader and the ease of navigating the text, and the kids are tolerant owing to my advanced years and accompanying physical limitations
 I have been so happy with my boxed set of all 7 Harry Potter books.  I read all seven of them in 33 days.  It is something that I will keep and pass down to my grandchildren as a collector's item.  I was very pleased with the time it took to get them.  They were shipped on a Friday and I received them the following Monday.  I was very happy with the amount of time it to took for the books to get to me.<br/><br/>A very satisfied costumer.
 This was an amazing book. Just as good as or better  than the movie. I couldn't stop reading it. I loved it!
 I recently began a free trial of Kindle Unlimited. I was bored at the hospital with my wife, who was visiting her grandfather, so I figured I'd download the first Harry Potter book. I always looked down on Harry Potter as a children's story. I honestly do not know what piqued my interest enough to download it, but I am sure glad that I did. I couldn't have been more wrong about the books. They are amazing. Well writing and intricate enough that, even at thirty years of age, I was able to enjoy them. I finished all seven books before my free month of Kindle Unlimited was over. I enjoy collecting books, so I decided that I had to have these in physical form. I set out to find a collectors edition with all seven books and I finally decided that this one had the right balance of looks and economy. I could not be happier with the product and I hope to one day see my children enjoying these books as much as I have.
 Wonderful reading!
 This book is every bit as good as the rest.  I read it in two days!  The only negative is that it is the end of an amazing series.
 If you like Harry, you must read it. If you have not started don't start with this one. I enjoyed it but it is not the best. This series is a classic fantasy genre. It is not something I will save or read again. I think it is great entertainment.
 I checked up upon finding the English version of the Harry Potter series, sadly, in norway those resellers have figured that they would not need it (ignorants they are). Either way when I was to buy this set I read carefully the reviews. The packaging when recived was superb, the box was as expected; with a plastic clasp. It is NOT the box I was after; it was the BOOKS. The Books, all of them, for this price is wonderful!<br/>Aswell the fact that nothing was harmed and everything in perfect state made my day.<br/>-J
 The box itself was pretty lackluster and unappealing - but I had no intentions of keeping the box. The books are amazing. As far as paperbacks go they are sturdy and handle being read and worn in very well. The text is clear and big, the pages sturdy. I love this series so very much!
 Amazon makes you leave a heading and a comment so I am typing this up to say its a good product and does what it says. If you are reading this, buy it. I don't leave 5 stars unless the product exceeds my demanding expectations. If it falls short of doing 100% of what it says, I leave 1 star.
 I apologize for the clichéd title, but it felt most appropriate and says it all. This is definitely a three-star book as far as the rest of ther series goes.<br/><br/>As others have written in their reviews (and I won't repeat specifics here because many contained spoilers) much of the book could have been edited down. The book positively plodded along aimlessly in many sections (a "Deathly" bore, as I told someone). The plot really didn't get interesting until the last quarter of the book, then went tragically fast.<br/><br/>However, it was a solid ending to the series, and I think other hard-core fans like myself were satisfied in the end, if a little disappointed with the story development.<br/><br/>However, there was one mystery that has nagged me for a couple of years (and I am certainly not the first or last to ask it): What ever happended to Florian Fortescue?!?<br/><br/>I guess some mysteries will have to remain so.
 I ordered this for my daughter's 9th birthday. I am so glad I did. She loved the trunk it came in. I am happy I got the hardback books. She has seen most of the movies and has started reading the books. I am excited that she has found something she enjoys reading.
 As complete Harry Potter geeks, my girlfriend and I decided to buy this box set for a friend, as a birthday present. We KNEW she would immediately get sucked into the adventure and she certainly did.<br/><br/>The box itself is nice looking although it may be a little flimsy, but if handled with care, I don't think it will fall apart in the foreseeable future. Plus, who cares? It's not about the case, it's about the books!
 I had never read all of the Harry Potter series, so this book was completely new to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, even though I was sad when certain characters died. J.k. Rowling' writing is so dynamic and colorful that a person feels like they too can be a character in the book. I found myself fighting right along with everyone else at Hogwarts. I felt at a loss when I finished all the books.
 I'm a fan of Harry Potter series for more than ten years and bought this set for collection. I have to say I prefer this edition's cover a lot than the first edition. It's beautiful, clean and cute, while not childish at all. Anyway you must have this edition if you're a Harry Potter fan.
 I just re-read the series for the umpteenth time - even though I'm over 50.  I always enjoy the seventh book the most but they are all fun to read.  They fit so well together with minor events in the earlier books having a large impact on the future books - like the Vanishing Cabinet when it's thrown by Nick to get Harry out of trouble.  Who could predict the importance of that books later.<br/><br/>I wish JK Rowling included the following two scenes:<br/>1.  The Dursleys disaperating after they leave the house<br/>2.  Hermione and the cup<br/><br/>Oh well.  My imagination does fairly well.
 I purchased the boxed set as a surprise gift for my wife. The price was great for a new set versus a bookstore. They arrived on time and in perfect condition.
 This is a fantastic collectors edition for the true Harry Potter fans! Check out my book-instagram @aelynns_library for more pictures!
 This is a wonderful series for kids to learn about growing up and about the struggle we all face in our choices and battles with good and evil.  JK Rowling deserves everything she has received and more for the love she has brought into this world through these books.  A timeless contribution for us all.
 I enjoyed reading all of the Harry Potter series. This audio book is wonderful. Jim Dale, the reader, does a great job bringing all the characters to life; he does the voices of all the characters. This is great to listen to on long commutes or road trips.
 If you don't own these, you will be sorry.  I've never purchased audio books before, because I just usually read the books.  I received a free snippet of these, and was completely transfixed. Purchase this collection and you will not be disappointed.
 I still prefer the books to the movies. I don't think they're just for children. The whole story is a struggle &amp; triumph of good over evil.  I read them first when the kids were reading them. I read them now for me. I'm still a fan.
 Came even better than advertised!
 After looking at this product for several months my husband finally purchased it for Christmas. Although the box is not made out of wood like some think, it is actually quite sturdy for cardboard. The best part however is the condition the books are, most Harry Potter books have thinner pages, the pages in the books are so thick I sometimes rub them to make sure I am not grabbing two pages. The stickers that come with are a great bonus, you can choose to add them to the trunk or not. This item shipped very fast it arrived within a week of the order and that's saying something since we live in Alaska! Overall I am very pleased with this purchase!
 Well, my boy started reading Harry Potter at school. Many kids still want to read so I decided to get this set for my boy so he can read from Year 1. We are not a collector so this set works for us.
 My daughter is 10 and she loves these books. She signs them out every week at the library so I thought she should have her own set since they are so heavy to drag around! She loved them. It comes in a sturdy box set and sits great on a shelf. These are great, interesting, and fun books for kids to read
 As an adult, I  didn't know if I would like this series or not. I found it enchanting and enjoyed every page!
 As Harry Potter followers know, the books get better as you progress through the series.  This version does not skip a beat and the best one by far.  I wish the Potter series would not end.
 I enjoy the Harry Potter series but this was slightly disappointing. The box is upsetting. Every time I pick it up I think it will tear. It is a really heavy product. I bought this to keep for my child when they get older but I'm afraid it won't hold up that long.
 This follow-up to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an easy read which expands on the characters of the first book and takes the reader deeper into the shadow world of wizards among us. Smooth storytelling and likable characters in a fantasy world that appeals to the child in all of us.
 I LOVE these Harry Potter CDs. They are unabridged (not shortened versions) with JIM DALE reading the books and doing all the voices. He is FANTASTIC! Love to listen in my car while driving, it really makes an awful commute go quickly, as I get lost in the stories. I am much less stressed when I arrive at my destination!
 As a thirty-two year old male that's not really into the adventure fantasy type thing I wasn't really expecting to enjoy the Harry Potter series, however, I admit I really enjoyed it. Great read worth the time and the money. Before I knew it I was caught up in this series.
 I'm re-reading the series for the third time and this time reading aloud to my young grandson, who is loving it as well.  This is one of the most popular series in the world, ever, for very good reason.  It begins with deceptive simplicity and blossoms into a rich and complicated masterpiece. Thank you, thank you, thank you, JK Rowling!
 It's a little misleading because all the GREAT reviews were actually for the Hardcover set and not the Paperback set.  Amazon should not group the reviews together, should have read the reviews instead of depending on the number of stars and reviews!!!  I am gifting this, but if want a set you will read just once, then this will do, if you're looking to reading this several times and store it, this may not be the best set and the GREAT reviews do not accurately portray the product. The box and the paperbook is nothing special and quite a let down. Should definitely search for the hardcover and not buy the paper despite the "great" reviews.
 I enjoy these book better than movie at some part. J.K Rowlings is another person who inspire me to write, and to enjoy writing, which brings me to write this book, <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Moonlight-Witches-Book-1/dp/B009AIXFPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moonlight Witches (Book 1)</a><br/><br/>I always enjoy different magic and such. Voldemort quite scary and i wouldn't go up against him, but thank goodness Harry has courage to go up against him :) It was wonderful book and very magical adventure. :)
 Very good!
 The book set came in literally a day after I ordered it, and the books were perfectly packaged and were brand new. I had the free month trial of Amazon Prime, which definitely helped with the fast shipping. This was a great deal, and I would recommend getting this box set from Amazon.com!
 Glad I bought the whole series. Even though I have all but year 1 in hardcover, this was much more convenient and it was great to go seamlessly from book to book.<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have the option of getting the British edition for "Philosophers Stone" and the British spellings and original slang that I believe was Americanized.
 So glad that i pre-ordered this and didn't have to wait in a long line at the book store. Received it first thing in the morning the day of release and literally didn't put it down for almost 7 hours. Then when i finished i just wanted to start the series over again. :)
 I bought this collection for my teenaged son whom is a huge Harry Potter fan.  He loved that it came in the chest which is a card board construction of decent quality.  If I could have found a wooden chest of higher quality than the card board I would have. Overall I think this was a fair deal and would buy it again.
 The weakest of the Harry Potters, but still fun none the less. It lacks the depth of characters of the later books, and the new innocence of the first book, and never quite finds its place in the series. While the first book is effectively an introduction of the series and the characters and the third book introduces the true, dark plot of the series, the second gets lost in between.<br/><br/>That having been said, its still a wonderfully entertaining book and more than worth your time.
 This book is so good!
 I love the Harry Potter books and finally convinced my husband to read them. I bought this set so I wouldn't have to buy them individually. The quality of this set is absolutely horrible! The books are barely bound, so the pages are lose and falling out, and some of the books have the pages sliced up, from where they didn't cut them right. Really disappointed with the condition, but the novels are still fun to read.
 Reviews misleading. NOT ILLUSTRATED.  We love the Harry Potter books and bought this set because several reviews described the illustrations and even posted beautiful photos saying almost every page is illustrated.  NOT.  Just a paperback version of the books stuck in a box.  So disappointed.
 This was the LONG awaited conclusion to the Harry Potter series.  I love Love Love these movies and books.  The ending did not disappoint BUT I wish 2 things,  ONE that she had gone into more detail in the epilogue, and 2 that she had continued the story.  the 19 years later leaves a lot of gaps that I personally would like to see filled
 I bought the series to keep up with my grand-kids, Harry is one of their favorite topics and "play action figures," as I read, I became more fascinated with Harry and with following his adventures. I'm looking forward to "Deathly Hallows."
 It's Harry Potter and it's illustrated.  I already own the first illustrated version, and this one is just as great.  It is a must-have for any Harry Potter fans.  I can't wait for the other five books to be illustrated.  This would make a great gift for a Birthday, Christmas, or a "just because I care about you."
 Great looking set of books and grandson is thrilled.  But, I wish I had purchased the hard cover because they are so much nicer.  I was not sure if grandson would take good care of these books so the cheaper model works for him.  He's loving the books so I might purchase him a keepsake hard cover set in the future.
 Harry Potter is one of the greatest literary characters of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Everyone should read it.
 Outstanding conclusion to an outstanding story.<br/>Loved every word.
 delivered in great shape
 I wanted to have the hard copies of these books to pass on to my kids and this is an excellent collection.
 Didn't really care for the ending. Why r they still being sorted into the same houses did they not learn anything. Checks and balances must be maintained to promote a healthy environment. Putting bad people with good for the most part keeps checks on some and slightly liberates others.<br/>Putting all of one kind in one house will only promote one eventuality. After all that everyone went through u would of thought the school would of changed somewhat.
 I had been wanting to delve into Harry Potter for years but didn't want to invest in a box set since I wasn't sure if this type of fantasy would entertain me. 5 stars for the story, for sure. The formating in the Kindle version works well. It's one continuous book, but can be navigated easily in the submenu. Now, time to watch the movies.
 This was a great book. The author has only gotten better with every book she's written. It followed the story line perfectly and kept me interested through the whole story. If you enjoyed the previous books in this series, you'll love this one. I highly recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.  Happy reading everyone.
 Like I said it is Harry Potter. ;) I absolutely LOVE Harry Potter (well, technically Severus Snape, but that is far from the point). I was thrilled to finally get the entire series. It arrived in beautiful condition. I love the packaging. I can not wait to read them again and again.
 This book is incredible, I thing is a good end for Harry Potter and his friends
 I get this a few years ago and I sometimes go back and reread them.
 A very nice set with very nice packaging (despite what one of the other reviewers said about flimsy packaging).  Each cd comes individually packaged in a moderately sturdy, printed cardboard sleeve, color-coded by book (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, etc.) with a nice design on the front and a content summary with chapter titles and lengths on the back.  They fit neatly into a very study cardboard case (a lid folds back).  The packaging all has simple but nice artwork on it, and between each book set of dvds is a photo card with black and white pictures of the author and vocal artists.  There is also a bonus cd included with a conversation between Stephen Fry and J.K. Rowling, which I thought was very nice to include and very interesting as well.  In all, there are just over 100 cds.<br/><br/>This reading is superbly done, with great expression &amp; emotional inflections and separate voices &amp; accents for each character.  I've found that I would much rather listen to the book being read as I work or walk or drive than to ready the book myself or watch the movies.  Although I know that some people prefer the more recent reading of HP by Jim Dale, but I honestly love Stephen Fry and his deep understanding of people, his humor, and his reading.  He brings all of the accurate detail, humor and magic of the story to life in my head in a way that nothing else could (except his voice for Hermione is a bit high &amp; falsetto, especially in the earlier books, which took some getting used to).  I first heard of this set by borrowing a copy from the library, and I'm so happy I did!  The cost of the product is of course very high, but it's honestly a steal when you consider the hours and hours of professional skill, read-aloud time, practice and preparation, and sound splicing &amp; editing done to create such a smooth, seamless, animated re-reading of a wonderful book.  It is truly remarkable.<br/><br/>If you love Harry Potter but don't love reading or want something for long road trips for kids or yourself, this is a high treat and wise investment, and it's becoming increasingly harder to find.  I suggest if you're waiting or wavering to secure a copy before it's too late.
 Order was handled quickly and accuratly.  Arrived on time and in good shape.  It was as advertised.  What more could you ask for????
 I love the whole series
 Of course the books are great as far as the story. However this was a gift for my child and the pages has some issues such as very faded ink on a couple of pages, marks etc. If I had bought it at a local bookstore for that price I would have returned it for another set. Very upsetting for a child who collects books and takes very good care of them.
 Excellent! Just as described! Super fast shipping! Thank you!!
 I wish the paperback special edition box set and this "trunk, hardcover edition" had separate entries, because they're not remotely similar in any way! Anyway. The paperback special edition box set is the most beautiful set of books I've ever seen. I've been reading and loving Harry Potter since I was a kid, but I absolutely despised the physical books themselves. I think the artwork is just plain hideous. These new special edition covers however, are beyond anything I could have hoped for. They are so artfully designed, and I think they truly capture the essence of the series. Even if you already own the entire set like I do, it's worth a repurchase just to have this gorgeous edition.
 This product came exactly as depicted online.  It includes all seven books in a case designed to be a luggage bag bound for Hogwarts.  Included with the books are some bonus stickers.  This is a great buy for any collector or fan.
 It's in very good condition. Thanks
 The first time I read this I was a little disappointed, but a couple years later when I read the whole series again, this was my favorite book. The first half is a little slow, but the way she ties even the tiniest things together at the end is astounding.
 Read it over and over again?  Always.
 I initially purchased this series as they were written. I read each book twice and saw all the movies. Thinking I would never desire to read this series again, I gave them away to a younger audience. Changed my mind. I purchased this series again and find I am just as thrilled as the first time I began to read.
 Gorgeous collection of books with a nice presentation. I bought this set for my husband, and he loves it. The pages are edged in gold, there's a ribbon book mark in each one, and the covers have the original art from the series on them. These books are a joy to hold in your hands.
 We started off with the paperback versions which have fallen appart.  We have the last three or four books in hardcover, but thought it would be nice to have all of the books in the same format and in nice condition.  This is a very nice boxed set.  I couldn't pass up the great price!
 Great to listen to in the car. Long drives are no longer long :)if you haven't heard of these book...please read them.
 I received this box set in a timely manner. The shipping was free and the set was in perfect condition. I have enjoyed it! Good price compared to stores too.
 my son like it
 I was soo excited to give this toy husband as a Christmas gift!  He is a huge Harry Potter fan so I was so happy when I found this.  I am happy with the overall product.  It looks nice. Came in great condition. My unhappiness is entirely from the fact that amazon ships this in a box that in huge letters on the side of the box it says exactly what's inside.  If you are planning on buying this as a gift I would suggest to pay for the extra gift wrap or whatever is offered.  I didn't do this and bc my husband was the one to answer the door for the delivery man the surprise was runied.  I was very unhappy.
 Before I bought these books, I've never read any Harry Potter books. I never thought they were bad (movies or books), I just was not insanely attached to them as others were. I figured one day I'd read them, which is when I bought these.<br/><br/>If you are a Harry Potter fan, and you know it, I'd buy this. Unless you already have the series, anyways...<br/><br/>Really, the only thing I don't like, is the box itself. I love the art on it, it looks awesome. It's just kind of weak. I feel like it could have made it a bit stronger. Don't let this hold you back from buying this though!
 My kids wanted me to read these when they first came out but I put it off till the last book and boy I am glad I did! I'm 56 and enjoyed this set very much and bought another set to keep to read again and again.
 four stars. not bad for children's literature the books are well written but don't have a lot of new vocabulary. a little on the older side of children's lit. wouldn't recommend under 11.
 The first Harry Potter Book was released when I was in high-school, I saw all movies and really without read the books, so I've decided to do it after 14 years of being published by 2 reasons, to read ones of the best seller books, and for English practicing. I really love the book story, better than movies.
 Best entertainment for pre teens and older to adults and grandparents.  Imaginative and exciting.  The whole series was just the best.
 Great book in a fantastic series!!!
 I decided to reread the Harry Potter series after reading them several years ago with my daughter.  We did not have Year 7 in our collection.  I read this book in 1-2 weeks despite its length.  It keeps you interested.  I think it was the best book in the series.  So, if you liked years 1-6, you will love year 7.
 I give this book as many stars as it can get! I love it! I have read and listened so many times I about have parts of it memorized! Awesome story!
 The most special and unexpected part about the everything was that the books are soft to the touch. Basically all the covers/spines feel creamy and thick and it feels sensational while reading.
 Excellent!  Wish it didn't end!
 Awesome as always
 My kids love listening to the Harry Potter books on CD.  We've read them too, and seen the first two movies, but the audio books are actually more entertaining than the movies since they have much greater detail, room for all your imagination, and the experience continues over days!
 Everything I ever expected and more!
 Got this at the promotional price and boy, I'm glad I bought it then. I would have paid the current price too since I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan but good that I saved some money :). It's one book in Kindle but very easy to navigate. I have already re-read the whole series and love the convenience of not having to lug around the hard copy books.
 These were purchased for a friend who had never read them. He received them very quickly, and was pleased with the quality of the books.  As always, the reading is excellent.
 Great gift and cheap as dirt on amazon
 I have to say that I have issues with the fact that America decided they had to have their own version of the audiobooks (or even the books for that matter) as I've heard the Stephen Fry ones before and I enjoyed them. But Jim Dale also seems to be a decent reader. My reason for buying the American version is because it was significantly cheaper for me to order the American one than the British one (I live in Australia, by the way). All the same, I enjoyed it (I've only listened to the Philosopher's Stone so far) and I found it good for having something to listen to on long car journeys.
 BEST BOOK EVER!!! I laughed, I cried, I lost a friend!
 This last book completes my daughter's set, she was very happy! Thank you.
 It was the best book in the series. It explained a lot of crucial things and the climax was gripping. I was almost sure that she is going to kill harry potter but she managed not to.
 No spoilers here...I promise!  I've spent the last week pretty much staying away from the internet so as not to come across spoilers, so I wouldn't present spoilers here either!<br/>HP &amp; The Deathly Hallows was by far, JKR's best of the series.  It was dark, it was morose, it was humorous, it was everything she promised us!<br/>JKR asked us all, the fans, to be patient and all of our questions would be answered.  And she delivered!<br/>The only thing I will say, I was CORRECT about Snape!<br/>Shannon<br/>Tucson, AZ
 I've seen the movies; felt it was time to read the books.  What a great way to get 1 thru 6 inexpensively!
 A great end for and epic story line.  We have watched it several times and still find a line that helps explain something we didn't quite understand.  Great acting with characters you really feel invested in.  Definitely for older children and adults but the early seasons are for everyone.
 I loved the book. It shipped quickly and securely as well as on time. It was a great ending to the series.
 fun reading, great for kids and adults, great entertainment, the story is a good one.  Hope she writes more!!! Thanks
 This book helped me find a secret that was locked in a chamber, it was locked for a long time. Having read the Harry Potter series in the past, the adventures and the complete story were great. Sadly, I couldn't imagine anything correctly. With the help of this book's illustrations, I can now see things unfold in my head. Great book, great read, and great for story time with children.
 The book is the best out of all of them.  Wow! I can say many things of this story but one part in particular that was on my heart even now... makes me cry... dobby.  The Dragon scene was great and the the time they spent in the wilderness running from riddle was kind of dry and boring but necessary.
 awesome, fun and exciting. best book in the universe! :)  i love it! i can't stop reading it. it is soooooo good.
 The full page illustrations are spectacular. The problem is the full text pages. In book #1, many of the text pages had small drawings or drops of ink. There is far less of that in this book. Moreover, the text pages have a shaded pattern that repeats exactly for many pages. Plain white would have been a better choice. This is an obvious cheap compromise.<br/><br/>I hope they do a better job with the next books.
 Our favorite trio is hunting horcruxes and not at school.  I think we missed the school the most in this book but the adventures that Ron, Harry and Hermoine had were amazing.  The one part that we didn't like was the end...we really didn't want it to end.
 Excellent!
 As any Harry Potter fan knows, these books are awesome.  I LOVE the spine on these as they create a lovely picture of Hogwarts.  Be warned, once read they will fit Very tightly in the box.  I'm super careful with my books and never break the spine and even gently reading they expanded enough to be a tight squeeze.
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for a Harry Potter lover.  Although she has the paperback books, I thought that this<br/>would be a great start of a personal library.  I was very happy with the books and I thought the box gave it a nice<br/>presentation.
 Not as good as book one , but enjoyable.  I'm looming forward to reading book 3 The Prisoner of Azkaban.
 If you have read this and seen the movie, I am sure the movie disappointed you.  The books go more into detail.  Well I guess it will always be that way.  The movie would have to be extra long to cover all what the book has.
 Great book!
 It is rely cool to hear the book being read.  The way it is being read makes it come lifelike as well.
 I bought the paperback set of the first five books in the Harry Potter series, and they have been read and reread and are tattered from handling. I purchased the last two books in the series in hardback format, and wanted to buy the whole series in a easy to read and portable format. This is exactly what I needed.
 The books are wonderful, which is commonly accepted, but the box is made of carboard which is very disappointing.  If they made the box out of wood or even a real chest it would have been much better (i would have been willing to pay more for that option.
 This book is just as good as the rest of the Harry Potter Series. Sorry to see it end, but it had to some time!
 This Item arrived on time and in great shape.  I can't wait to give it to for Christmas.  She will love it!
 When we were planning our wedding, I asked my husband what he would like for a gift from me and he asked for this audio book.  He was living in Kansas City and I was living in Oklahoma City.  It is a 5.5 hour drive one way and he was coming to see me every weekend before our wedding.  I gave it to him early.
 I love the second illustrated harry potter book so much I can't describe! I do feel that the first one was hard to meet and beat and I feel I have a preference for the first illustrated version but this one standalone is amazing! I am very excited for the third and would recommend this and the first to anybody.
 I don't know why some people complained about the box...if you look at the picture, it is clearly a cheap cardboard box and not a well=made chest. Why were you expecting something else? I mainly bought it so I could have all seven books in hardcover without starving. Even then, I got it at least $60 off list price.<br/><br/>My cousin was extremely happy to receive the box though. I didn't want it myself, but I know she will enjoy it more than the recycling bin.
 Well worth the wait.
 I picked up this Harry Potter book for my nephew.  He received it and finished it within 2 days.  He laughed and cried while reading the book.  It is a wonderful book for teens and adults alike.
 I love the Harry Potter series and have them in hardback. I purchased this set for a college student who has worked for me for several years. She is a fan of Harry Potter and had worn out her books that she had purchased originally, one at the time. She is thrilled with her complete set and has already read most of them, yet again.
 Really liked the final book -- couldn't put it down, wanted to find out the end too bad!
 Books 4, 5 &amp;6 seemed to lose some of that magic.  Although dark, this book #7 is one of my favorites.  Rowlings pulled it all together.  K
 Still after all the years that have gone by, this book makes me fall in love with the wizard's world all over again.<br/>I purchased all the books as they came out years ago but to have them at my finger tips whenever I want to read them again is really cool.<br/>My soon grew up to me reading the books to him until he was 8.<br/>He has the books now, I like the trade off.<br/>Imaginative, character building and daring in her writing, J.K. Rowling will never disappoint with the Harry Potter series.
 This book is a great and awesome book! I loved it :)
 The illustrations are just as beautiful in this book as they were in the first, but there seem to be fewer of them and more pages in between than in the first. The focus seems to be on background drawings rather than on larger illustrations, which I have to assume will continue to be the case as the books get longer. A beautiful book though.
 Read them for the first time at 23. They were a birthday to myself. Glad I can finally call myself a "Potterhead" and now get all the HP posts that come on my Tumblr  dash lol.<br/>The descriptions were great. And it was fun to watch the movie right after. Might get the DVD set as an Xmas gift for me!
 After I lost my hardcover set of Harry Potter, I was pretty devastated, until I realized this loss gave me the chance to find a new set. After hunting around, I settled on this paperback gift set published by Bloombury because it features a gorgeous box, covers that are brand spanking new and still somehow evoke the old style of the traditional covers, and those pretty sparkly stars! And since it is published by a British publisher, you get "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," as well as all the original, unabridged books.<br/><br/>I was super pleased to discover that the covers are actually made of that soft, suede-like material... I have to stop myself from wearing out the spines by stroking them too much. Beautiful box set that is worth every penny, and actually came at quite a discount, considering the individual books retail for 7-9 pounds!
 I did not get into the Harry Potter books until recently.  I can now see why the books and movies are so popular with both teens and adults alike.  The magic world that J.K. Rowling has invented is both intoxicating and fun to be in.  I will read the rest of them up to the release of the 7th and last book.  Thank you Amazon for being able to purchase this at such a great price.
 These books run the gamut of young reader appropriate to adult.  I consider these a "must read" for all that have enjoyed the movies....so much more understanding....
 The books were still wrapped in the plastic, but the corners of the box are all smashed a little bit. It also didn't come in the box that was in the picture, but the box it came in is easier to put on a bookshelf, so that's good.
 It was the as I had expected. The print is large enough for a 6-7 year old to start reading. The books are the right size and weight to be read in bed too. The first three books are very good set to get young ones started on reading practice and hold their interest and attention.  The next 4 are probably best read at grade 3 and above.
 Great product specially for (young??)collectors.<br/>Extra nice touch with the stickers added to be attached on the "trunk" to personalise it.<br/>Looks great in the book shelf or on some sideboard. Also nice to just put the books in the shelf and use the box as storagecontainer.<br/>Would also make a great gift for other HP fans. Doesnt even need wrapping just hand it over as it is with the giftrecievers name on the printed tag on the box lid.
 This is a great set for my 7yo daughter. We got this at a great discount here on amazon, I only wish there were more books to the series. My daughter read through the series in about 2 weeks. Now we have a little Harry Potter fan on our hands!
 This is a great boxed set of the Harry Potter books. I had really hoped that the "trunk" would be made out of something more substantive than just cardboard, but after consideration, I'd rather have a cardboard trunk with stickers than just a boring cardboard box with a logo on it.<br/><br/>It's a great way to keep all of my Harry Potter volumes together and it looks interesting on the bookshelf!
 I have wanted to reread the Harry Potter books for some time, and finding the complete collection at an insane price clinched it. Beware, though, that this collection appears as a single volume rather than the individual books.
 This book wasn't for me, it was for a friend of mine. From what I know that she got it on time and she is in the process of reading it so, I think she like it so far. So far so good I guess. I'll probably order again from this seller in the future.
 All of these books are so clever and well written, and I was very sad when I got to the last book and the last page. Following one plot purpose where it all plays into a final magnificent conclusion. I love this story because it is creative and unique, and it captures the imagination. If your imagination is good enough, it transports you to a completely different world. The characters are well written and developed, the personalities and lives fleshed out as though they were truly real. I am a huge fan of the Potter series. And I recommend them as a very good read!
 This Harry Potter Book Set is very handy because you can keep all the books together. They are by far the best books I have read! Very entertaining.
 Product was in great condition, dust jacket in tact and no marks or tears. It was delivered on earliest delivery date, so I wasn't expecting it for another week and was pleasantly surprised! The shipping packaging was not good-it was in a simple envelope, no bubble wrap or box and no kind of extra protection. There was no damage in shipping, though, so I still rate the seller 5 stars.
 Rowling certainly has a gift for writing. An enjoyable read, well structured with just the right amount of detail and action to keep the story flowing and the reader entertained. Bravo!
 For those who already own the hardbacks of Harry Potter and wonder if it's worth it to spend the money on these illustrated versions, I would tell you yes.  The text of the book is still the same incredible Harry Potter story but the amazing illustrations do a lot to enhance the story.  I also love the two column layout of the text in this version.  It gives the book a different vibe.
 If you like the Harry Potter series you must get this book. The reason why I bought this book is because I have all the other books in hardcover and I wwanted the hardcover of this book because I had the paperback. Now it completes my books.<br/>It is a good book.
 Simply Great worth the time to read.  I know everyone says this about every book but they are soooo much better than the movies.
 I am still reading it.  I'm on the last book and I've totally enjoyed the first ones.  This is a book that grips your imagination and takes you to a totally different world.  It is filled with suspense, purpose and moral choices.  Once you start this book, expect it to become an obsession!  Totally LOVED it.
 I absolutely love my new case that I got for my cell phone.  I also loved reading the Harry Potter book.
 Was gift for my daughter for christmas. She loved it. The boxed set was in excellent condition as were the books
 I have only read the first two but as expected - very enlightening
 Nine year old grandson thought this was the best birthday gift ever.  Also got the DVD series through Amazon.  When he finishes a book, he gets to watch the movie.  This gift was a huge hit.  Book set was 40% off, DVD set discounted also.
 I loved this book it's amazing I love it so much ! Harry potter is amazing and I love him
 Great book!!
 I've read these books about a thousand times before, but now I have the convenience of having them on my Kindle. I've been reading them to my 4 year old son, and he loves them too. Raising a Potterhead ! ⚡
 Very good
 The case is definitely more flimsy then it looks so if you have kids, it could get broken easily but if you're just a single person living a single person life, the box is a nice plus and it holds all the books for me. It definitely is cardboard and not a metal box but it'll hold up if you leave it there and don't play with it.
 Exceeded every expectation I had for this book. I've been a Harry Potter fan since the first book and read every one. I didn't think this book could be any better than the Half Blood Prince....and this one did by far!! How Rowling managed to tie so many different story lines into one fantastic volumn I'll never know.  Meets and exceeds ALL expectations I had.<br/><br/>Buy it!!!  You'll LOVE it!!
 I purchased the original books for my son, but curiosity got the better of me and I began reading them. I discovered my adult neighbor shared an interest in the Potter saga and we enjoyed discussing the latest adventure for Harry and his friends. Rowling does a great job in making this story a great read after all how many of us as childre wished we had magical powers. I did!!!!
 This book was a great way to end a great series.  It was suspenseful and interesting.  The only bad thing about this book was it meant the series was finished.
 I sat and read this book cover to cover as soon as the truck dropped off the amazon package. The story is amazing and i was sad that it all has finally come to an end.  Regardless of age buy the series and keep them, they will be popular for generations to come.
 Big fan of the series, bought this at a low price and brand new quality. I recommend this to anyone.
 enjoy this item very much  i hav the whole collection  and listen to it very often  very very enjoyable
 My granddaughter has read the entire series about 10 times &amp; we recently visited Universal in Orlando so I was ready to read more about the characters I had barely met in the movies. Being able to borrow the complete collection on Amazon Prime was a bonus. It's fun to be able to discuss HP with a 13 year old now.
 I got this cause I had to finish out the series. Not my favorite book in the collection, but how could you not buy it if you've read the other six.
 The Harry Potter series is one of the few books my oldest will read without having to be coerced. I have been slowly buying the series since he has read it originally from the library, so this was a great and cheap way to get it. It arrived quickly and looking how it was described.
 these are good books for the serious reader (Adult)  to chill out for a while.  My genre is historical fiction and history and this set of books is my fantasy getaway.  I would tell anyone, older child or adult or anything in between to read these.
 This book is great. It was hard for me to get my 9 year old to put it down, all she wanted to do was carry it around with her everywhere we went. Every once in a while she would bust out laughing and would comment to me how exciting and interesting this book is. She's already read the previous books and is now asking me to order her the next book in the series. Way better than the movie.
 This set of books are nice, and for the price, it has fulfill all the expectances I had.<br/>Books are good made, well printed and covers are OK. I think I made a good purchase.
 For the price, this book set is incredible perfect. My ten year old is just beginning to read this series and was beyond excited when it arrived. The set looks much more expensive than it was. The books are easy to remove and return to the box and it seems very sturdy. I'm so glad I purchased this!
 I was so excited to see how it was all going to end. I thought the author tied up a lot of loose ends &amp; really brought everything together. I think everything I ever wondered was answered. The worst part of this book was it meant, it was officially time to say goodbye to HP.
 The particular books have their own way of letting you imagine things. Certainly many scenes, plots and particular situations are completely different from the commercial movies. This was a first buy on audio books. I can only resume my satisfaction in three letters: WOW!<br/><br/>This is something worthwhile, addictive, and very good for first time Harry Potter readers. Jim Dale does his job with the voices. I highly recommend these CD's
 This collector's item was shipped without any packaging and the collector's box was ruined from rough handling during shipping. I was forced to return this item.
 Only a sliver off from being perfect. The bottom corner of the cover is dog-eared, and the spine a tiny bit cracked, but otherwise very good.
 Even though I liked the book, it is the Harry Potter book I like least.<br/><br/>High Sir King L. the Great
 This series is one of my daughters favorites.. &lt;3 Great book, great price ;) Buy used books and save some trees..
 I loved all the books. I read the whole Harry Potter series in less than a month. Shipping was fast and the books were in perfect condition.
 From an 8 year old reader who has read the series multiple times (I am welcoming suggestions on other series that will capture her interests over more re-reads of HP!):  "The Harry Potter series is phenomenal.  I really like that it had lots of magic.  JK Rowling is very imaginative!  I hope more readers will read Harry Potter."
 I just got my box set, and am pretty happy with it. I read many of the reviews here, and a lot of them really put this product down, but i don't think it's so bad. Its very good actually for its price. If you are really looking for a collectors edition...well, dont expect it to cost you only 86$! most of the collectors editions are 100$+ the books are good quality, pages arent falling out haha! this is the kind of box you would buy for your children. but, like i said, for the price, its really good :)
 I finally got around to reading the Harry Potter series, have all the films and have watched them numerous times...however the books fill in all the gaps and bring the story to life.  I am glad that I saw the films first as it gave visual to the characters in the story.
 I think I liked the first one better but this one was full of adventure also.  I'm still trying to figure out how Harry can beat all these evil villains at like thirteen. But it is a book and it's fun to read so who am I to judge. Already have the rest of the series to read.
 After my second time reading the second book in the spellbinding Harry potter series. J.k Rolling has done it again.
 This is a great set for anyone who wants to read the series. It does not include book 7, so if you are looking for the complete set, then this isn't the set for you. The books are awesome, and are a must read for anyone who liked the movies.
 A nice set of books. nice price, prompt delivery, quality product. Make a nice addition to my home library. Not to mention the fact that they were awesome reading.
 My pre-teen granddaughter is interested in writing.  She has read all of the Harry Potter books.  She wanted to listen to see if she could detect more about the author's style.  I'm amazed how she listens to certain parts several times.
 I am reading Harry Potter to my 7 yr olds this year. We started the book using the regular paperback and then bought this illustrated version a few chapters in. It was worth it. My son is easily distracted. This book really made a difference in his ability to focus. He is way more interested in the story.
 I loved this whole series and I loved this book. Great series and I'm so glad I read it. Took me away to a completely different world..
 I must admit, I was so-so about this. Seen the films, they're ok. But the books are a lot better, and Jim Dale's narration is superb, the way one guy can do all those different voices and keep them unique and recognisable. No wonder he got an award for this.
 This review refers exclusively to the audiobook.  The book itself is nothing short of remarkable: perfect, no, but really, really amazing.<br/><br/>The audiobooks, however, are a lot less than perfect.  The positives are that the discs are unabridged, and that all the reading is not bad.  The bad part is the really the reader: he's terribly limited.  He thinks that a female voice is distinguished by elongated final vowels ("Harryyyyyy" is how Hermione refers to Harry; and how every other female speaks too).  I wonder if the guy knows any women or if he has ever heard a woman speak.  It's quite annoying after 7 novels (heck, it was annoying the first time).  I am no expert in British and English dialects, but he seems terribly limited.  Most British voices are lower-class dialects; it's hard to accept hearing everyone but 5 or so people swallowing syllables and distorting vowels a la Pygmalion (tho not as exaggerated as that; still...).  It gets tiresome and in the case of most of the females, it's exhausting.  Hopefully one day this will be recorded again in total and by a more talented or more careful reader.
 What an amazing author!!  What a fantastic finish to the whole story!!!<br/><br/>I could not stop, read the book in 11 straight hrs.<br/><br/>It's not often that a mere book gives me goosebumps, rushes and teary eyes.
 I am fairly new to Harry Potter but since picking up the first book in the spring I have obsessively worked my way through each one....can barely wait to start another.  This final one did not disappoint.  I have loved each and every one.  Am so happy they are on my kindle as I will revisit them often.
 My 8 1/2 year old son and I are reading the Harry Potter books together.  I am enjoying the story as much as he is, maybe more!  We read the first book, then watched the movie, and now we are doing the same with this book, and plan on continuing with the entire series.  HIGHLY recommend for all ages!
 Reading the series out  loud to my kids. We're on book 3. Good stuff. But you know. Quality box, quality books. Well packed.
 Excellent story telling, good for children and adults alike.  The story's complexity and character development grow continously from one book to the next.  I've read it twice so far, and will read it again.  The best series since Lord of the Rings.
 I remember when the Harry Potter books were first released here in the US in 1998 (renamed from the British Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone) and it was enjoyable to watch this unknown author enjoy huge success. However, it was being marketed as a kid's young adult book, so I was not remotely interested. It wasn't until about six months after the 4th installment, Goblet of Fire, was published that I found myself reaching for the first in the series. I was hooked. I read all four that were available in less than a week and was waiting another two years before Order of the Phoenix arrived.<br/><br/>All that introduction is to say that Rowling created an incredible universe that I thoroughly enjoyed and the Deathly Hallows was the perfect conclusion to what I feel is one heck of a fantasy/mystery series. And quite a mystery she spun for seven novels (in books that kept getting longer and more involved as time marched on).<br/><br/>In this book Harry must confront the evil Voldemort, who has been continually gaining support in his bid to dominate everything. Harry's friends and allies, notably members of the order of the Phoenix are with him almost every step of the way. Again, as she has done throughout the series, Rowling throws in twists and turns, making you think things are one way when they are, in fact, quite another. One of her strengths throughout has been character development and in Deathly Hallows all is revealed about the characters that readers have loved and loved to hate. When this book was released, shattering all sales records (with 15 million copies sold in the first 24 hours) I was one of those people that had to have it on the day of release. And, I am glad for that. I consumed the book in a bit over a day of non-stop voracious reading (759 pages).<br/><br/>I highly recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys fantasy but also to all those who relish a great mystery. Then watch all of the movies. Then read the series over again, like I just did.
 Ms. Rowlings ia a brilliant author.  The stories flow well and the characters are just so endearing (or despicable) and believable.  Worth the time.
 My favorite Harry Potter book by far. Rowling's writing is at its best in this one, and the catharsis is bliss.
 This set was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old grandson. He was very excited to receive these books and said the books were better than the movies because "the movies leave a lot of stuff out"! I was very pleased with the high quality manufacturing of these books and believe it was a good purchase!
 I love harry potter books and this is one of the best books. it is a little scary but the scarier the merrier. read it!
 I hadn't read any of the books yet so thought it was time.  I started 2 weeks ago and am going to start book 5 tomorrow.  I am enjoying them emencely.
 The mythology hinted-at and told for so many years finally came to a dramatic close in the final Harry Potter book. The whole Harry Potter story has been well told and thought out to the last detail.
 Although I had to wait a bit for my book, it did arrive within the allowed time and in perfect condition even though it was a used book.  I have ordered quite a few books from Amazon and have always been satisfied with the results.<br/>The only sad part is that this was the final book of what I feel is a great series.  Fun for all ages.
 Super heavy, and the box falls apart a bit which is sort of disappointing. One of the strings came off immediately, and the cardboard on the inside popped out too. I was able to put it back together so it looked fine again, but I expected it to be put together a little better. Other than that, the books were perfectly fine and my boyfriend loved them.
 Love JK, awesome plot
 I love this movie and book!!! this book had me literally kept me on my toes at all times. at times i would shake with laughter and at other times i would quake with fear.
 I bought this set as a Christmas gift.  The person receiving the set was absolutely thrilled!  Not only with the set as a collection but the books themseleves have proven to be hours of wonderful and imaginative entertainment!
 I was afraid when I picked this book up and started to read it that when it ended I would feel like I wanted more. I could not believe that when I finished it that the series was so full circle and complete. Everything tied together and left me feeling fulfilled! I love her writing style and how thorough and complete she is with her characters and story lines.
 This is even better in person than in the photos! Its an amazing box set, the books are well protected inside the case, and the case is just amazing for any Harry Potter fan!! I will be buying another set for myself since this one was a gift.
 This is a very nice boxed set and my son was very excited to get it for Christmas however he just pointed out that 23 pages are missing from the Goblet of Fire.  Almost the entire "the Yule Ball" chapter is absent from his copy.
 This book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was in PERFECT condition. I got the package and was surprised to see that there was no folds or bends! I am very happy with the condition of this book.
 Habia leido varias reviews que decian que era una caja de carton muy berreta, pero me arriesgue a comprarla para mi novio y la verdad que esta muy linda. No es un "cofre" de verdad obviamente, pero es resistente, a los que se les rompio no debieron haberla tratado con mucho cuidado que digamos. Estoy muy satisfecha con la compra y la edicion de los libros es bellisima.
 I, the notorious cheapskate, paid money to have book #7 delivered on 7/21.  I then sat down with my box of kleenex to read it cover to cover. I stayed off-line and read no papers so no one could spoil it for me. It was so worth it.  I really enjoyed the way JKR tied all the ends together and still surprized me.  I'm very sorry to see the series end, as it was Harry Potter who finally convinced my daughter that reading is a pleasurable thing to do.  For that alone I will be forever greatful.  Thank you J.K. Rowling, for bringing some magic to my life.
 I think this is a must have for any young reader. My 8 y/o loves this set because of the trunk. I wish it could have been wood and the latch seems a bit flimsy but it looks good and has stickers that you can decorate it with.
 The shipment arrived in time and I was able to enjoy all the books except for the 7th and last one, but my BIG problem was that the third book was missing about 100 pages!! I couldn't believe it, it was seriously frustrating when getting into the book and it was missing a huge chunk. Make sure when you get your order to see all the pages are there.
 I've reread this so many times, I know it by heart. This one is my least favorite, but I still reread it often. Every time, New meaning pops out.
 Amazing
 This book made me cry so many times, and this last installment of the Harry Potter series did not provide as much closure as I needed after following Mr. Potter throughout my childhood and teenage years. I wish the outcome was not as it is in this book, the writing was just so damn captivating that I couldn't put it down. There are also a lot of life lessons that I learned from this series and recommend it to all ages.
 The Harry Potter series is not to be missed.  This generation has grown up on it.  Not only is the story excellent and genius, It is what got many children reading for the first time when the first volume came out.  Deathly Hallows (Book 7) doesn't disappoint.
 So...I'm hoping they'll discover this cool boxset in their closet someday when they are able to read.  It's something i would totally be excited about when I was young.
 The publisher has printed the books on very poor paper quality. It seems they found the cheapest quality paper in the world and printed the book on that. Its highly unsatisfying to turn pages and touch paper of this quality.
 I lost my set of book 7 in a move and had to replace it. Amazon was the right place to go to get that replacement
 It was great! Here fast and quality awesome!
 As a late fan of Harry Potter, I enjoy all of the books (especially the unabridged CDs) and will read (listen) to them over and over.  Jim Dale has become a comfortable narrator for us, and an excellent companion on long road trips.
 I read the books in high school and I had just borrowed them from my neighbor. When Deathly Hallows Part 1 came to theathers I had wanted to reread all the books plus have them for my collection! So I began to buy them. :]
 I loved how the books were narrated, however Hermione's voice gets really whiny after the first 30 minutes. Great for a commute though.
 I don't know what everyone else was expecting but I loved the chest and it has never came apart, NOT once.<br/><br/>It may not be a real chest but seriously, who thought the Harry Potter hardback books in a real wooden chest would only cost $114.07?<br/><br/>The books are brilliant, the packaging is everything I expected it to be, and shipping came fast, even with super saver.<br/><br/>Yes, A+ from me, A++ really.
 The perfect ending to the series.

In this video, I ask you to relive your memories of where you were when The Boy Who Lived completed his journey and moved forever into our collective imagination.
 I think this was an excellant buy. The price was the lowest that could be found anywhere and the books came in record time, a day ahead of the schedule and arrived in excellant shape. You can't go wrong with that.
 loved it! the whole series was amazing...I couldn't put them down.  A satisfying wrap up for most of the characters.
 I was leary to purchse this with the poor reviews and I do agree with the fact that the trunk is very cheap for the books, but I do like having all 7 books in hardback and the case is nice to keep them in.
 My grandson was asking about the books as his father and I were watching the Deathly Hallows #1 and said he would like to read the books.  He is seven. I started looking foe the first one and found if I bought the whole set it was less expensive and would save a lot of time and money running around to just buy the set. I had them sent to him and he was thrilled with getting a paclage mailed to him and has been reading a little everyday.  He loves the movies and I hope he will learn to appreciate the books as well.
 I was so excited to receive this box set!  I was surprised to receive Book 7 (since it's only listed as Books 1-6).  However, I guess the price of receiving Book 7 is that Book 1 is paperback.  That was a little disappointing since it was advertised as all hardback but I won't drone too much over it since I also receieved Book 7.
 I ordered these books for my son to read.  I read them years ago but borrowed them from the library.  I have the last 3 books that I purchased as they were released.  So it was great that I could buy the first 4 as a set.  The books were in great shape.  They were used but I don't think the first book was ever opened.  Very pleased.
 I love every single chapter of this book. It keeps reading it for hours. I even went to bed at 4 in the morning because of the last chapters. I hope J.K. Rowling continues writing about Harry Potter :)
 The best book ever!!!
 We bought a used set as a Christmas gift and the books were in unbelievably good shape.  Quite honestly, the spines looked as if they had not been opened and the dust covers looked hardly handled.  We haven't thumbed through every page of every book but what we have seen so far hasn't been marred.
 A fitting end to a wonderful adventure. I'm sure I'm joined by many in wanting more. Maybe pre-books ~~stories of the years James, Lilly, Sirius, Remus, and Severus roamed the halls and grounds of Hogwarts. Maybe a post~~ book telling of the adventures of the next generation of Hogwarts students and their parents. But if there is never another, we can read and re-read these Harry Potter books, as they will never lose their magic and will probably reveal something new with each reading.
 The books came quickly and in perfect shape, I can't vouch for<br/>anything else because they were a gift and came in packaging I didn't<br/>open. When I hear back from the recipient I can further comment.
 I read the books in high school and I had just borrowed them from my neighbor. When Deathly Hallows Part 1 came to theaters I had wanted to reread all the books plus have them for my collection! So I began to buy them. :]
 Got this for my husband for his B-day. He loved it! The books are hard cover and embossed, with paper book covers to protect them. The trunk is made of sturdy cardboard and adds a special little something, in my opinion. All 7 books of the Harry Potter story. Nice little collector's item, I think.
 Great book
 Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows has one of the greatest endings to one of the most famed books in our time. Keeps you wanting more but alas this ending to this wonderful story is the perfect to end my fantasy land of Harry Potter. Like so many others who have fallen in love with these series I also have slipped and fallen into its magical world every time I read them. DO NOT read this if you have not read the others, it will completely defeat its purpose. No, if you are a newcomer then you must encounter the journey we fellow fans have gone through. This book is fantastic and it is so much more than a story.
 I am so glad I got them, I never read the books but I was in love with the movies but couldn't get off my mind like I can't be a true fan if I dont read these and finally got the box set because I probably couldn't handle only getting one at a time. Great quality I wish I could have had enough money for hardback books because I hate when the spine creases and tried my best not to crease it
 I bought each of the Harry Potter books the day they came out. My youngest son had seen the movies, but now at age 16, wanted to read them. I am all for reading, but I have since become a book collector, and all of my books are first,, firsts -- some even European, as we were in Germany when some came out. So, I didn't want my son to read my books. I was willing to get him his own book of paperbacks, however. He was happy to receive them.
 This is by far my favorite buy I have purchased on Amazon. Thank You!! Couldn't expect more and only $15 for all 5!!
 As you know from hopefully reading the first book(and also<br/>hopefully reading the review for that book also)is that the<br/>main characters are Harry,Hermione and Ron.<br/>some of the other characters are Malfoy,Crabbe,Goyle(which<br/>are all in Sletherin).<br/>It has a good length and is a good book for all ages<br/>except for the part inside the chamber of secrets<br/>in the movie perhaps.<br/>That's my review!
 The Harry Potter books are classics.  Their perfect structure makes them so easy to read and the stories make me want to just keep reading them.  I find myself turning to them in times of stress.  They have become my "comfort" books.  AND no calories!
 I did not acutally start reading the books, but had see the movies, until Book 7 came out. I immediately ordered 1 &amp; 7 from Amazon. Within 2 weeks, I had ordered all 7 books and my husband now read in the evening instead of TV. We are 42 and 45 and our youngest is almost 19 so it just goes to prove, Harry is not just for kids!!
 Wow, came the first day it was released...Thank you so much..I will do business with you any time!
 Most EPIC book ever!!!!<br/>I can't wait for the next book,"Prisoner Of Azkaban"<br/>P.S.I already have that awesome book on my Kindle.
 As an adult, I enjoy these books as much as I did growing up with them. The package came quickly and was in pristine condition. I highly recommend this purchase to anybody and everybody with an open mind and a bit of free time.
 My granddaughter loves to read. See read the first volume when she visited me last Oct. She said she would like to read the rest of the series so I ordered them and she called to tell me how much she is enjoying reading the books.
 A great conclusion to a captivating series.
 The final book of the series and the hardest to read. You won't be able to put it down, but won't want to finish it either. 80 pages in finds 3 characters dead and that's just the beginning!
 Contrary to many reviews, when I revived this set, it was in perfect condition, no broken edges, or rips! The box itself is so vivid and sturdy too! The books are in order, and all from the same type. All around, this is a great set, just be certain to order t from the main source!
 It is no secret that these books have entertained the masses.  I have them all as hard copies, but I am SO GLAD that they are finally available on Amazon for the Kindle.  Now I can take them with me and read them whenever I want!<br/>Even as an adult, all the details and foreshadowing and creativity continue to entertain.
 It has less illustrations then the Sorcerers' Stone one but I imagine their will be less illustrations every year since the books got bigger every year. Still a beauty and should be in every Potter fans collection. I can not wait until my son is a bit older and I can start reading these to him.
 Read this a long time ago.  JK Rowling's Harry Potter books seemed to get longer each time.  Each successive book was a little darker than the last.  I can't really complete this review without giving away the ending... so let me just say that I was hoping for something different.
 I have been a huge fan for years, but this is terribly disappointing! I was expecting better packaging, not a beautiful wooden trunk, but something better, this JUST A CARDBOARD BOX!!! Maybe a leather-like covering to the box, a lock that isn't cheap plastic and difficult to open, for instance I have a "Lord of the Rings" book in a box that is a good example . . . just anything. They sent us Book 7 in packaging addressed to muggles, when I saw this I thought it WAS the packaging, NOT THE ACTUAL TRUNK. I figured that it would be better quality considering the expense and the fact that loyal fans have waited years for this box-set. These books have made millions upon millions of dollars in profit, this is crazy. I never return things, but I might return this. If enough of us officially complain, do you think there's any chance they'll tell us that this was all a big mistake, this is just a temporary trunk and they'll be sending us the real one soon?
 I bought this collection for my 8-yr old who recently became Harry Potter obsessed. The books come in a colorful, neat package that appeals to young readers. I was glad to find the first six books in one collection. It's a very affordable option to buying them separately. The books keep her interested in reading with fantastic characters and storylines. A great buy!
 This is quite the collectors purchase.  I bought them for my son for Christmas.  They come in a box luggage package (from Hogwarts) and we are reading a chapter together nightly.  I hope this is something he will be able to keep and cherish memories of family time together. Great  quality!
 The book was better than the movie because it linked both films. I also got a good clue that Hermione was going to marry Ron in Book 6 rather than this tome. The book also explored how Snape got to know James and Lily Potter, but was really shocking was his deep affection for Lily. This is the same guy who can't stand her kid!
 I didn't realise until I got my boxed set that there was a different American and British version of Harry Potter. The most glaring being the change of title from The pholosophers stone to The sorcerers stone I would not have bought it if I had known. Having said that the books are of good quality and the trunk is really cute
 Ok, let me first say that I have always been against the Harry Potter books and movies. I can not explain why, and I am not going to write this review telling you about the story, instead about why I love it. I remember Harry Potter coming out when I was in 5th grade and my teacher reading it to me. (I am currently 24 years old and a graduate student/ social studies teacher) For some reason this series never stuck with me, it could be because it seemed like a kiddy series, and being a boy, none of my friends were into it. Books came and went, movies came and went, and I never cared about any of them. Having recently gotten back into pleasure reading, I began with series I wanted to read; Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, etc. I loved all these series, but never thought about Harry Potter. I had a co-worker ask me if I ever read them, and when I told him no, he said I had to. He told me they were his favorite series ever, and told me to read the first book, if I loved it, then continue, and if I hated it, then continue anyway. He said you have to get through the first two books, which were more primarily for little children, before the story really gets going. I was so hesitant to buy these books, and eventually decided just to order the entire box set, because if anything, I had to be able to explain why or why not I loved/hated the series. Let me tell you, I wish I had read this when they were coming out. The stories are amazing, from the first to the last. Even the first two books, which are the smallest of the seven, still have intriging stories which held my attention. I read all seven of them back to back, and along the way order the movie box set, and the "Tales of Beedle the Bard" and "Harry Potter Schoolbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them / Quidditch Through the Ages". The stories are simple enough that anyone can understand, but complex enough to make you have to recall previous events, not only from the book you are on, but from previous books. Comparing the "Harry Potter" series to my other favorite fantasy series "Lord of the Rings (including The Hobbit)" and "A Game of Thrones", I absolutly love this series more. With other series I had to take breaks in-between because I began to zone out, with Harry Potter I could not put them down. They are pretty fast reads, with me being able to breeze through about 80 pages an hour. The author has the amazing ability to describe a scene in a few sentences and make you feel like you are really there. I sometimes daydream about how it would be if this world really existed. If you are any kind of fantasy fan, you must read this, no matter your age. I feel with a series of this magnitude, everyone should read it atleast once, because this is a once in a lifetime type series. I have become a Harry Potter addict, and am so glad there is going to be a movie prop exhibit in NYC this year which I have to go to. Do yourself a favor, scroll up, click buy, wait for it to come, and begin reading it immedietly. Remember my friends advice: Read the first one, if you love it, great, keep reading. If you hate it, great, keep reading anyway. Read atleast the first three books before deciding if you are going to ditch it, but trust me, as the story progresses, the last thing you are going to want to do is ditch it. I have not watched all the movies yet because I have been so hooked on the books, but being that I ordered the entire movie box set, I am going to finish them soon and wish there were more.
 A great wrap-up to an epic series!!
 This is coffee table edition of the book. For any Harry Potter fan these Illustrated editions are a must have. They add so much to the story. I read aloud to my son quite often and he appreciate the the accompanying images. I can't wait to have the entire series in this same edition.
 As usual, Amazon didnt let me down with the fast service i always come to expect.<br/>Thanks!
 This is an amazing book full of adventure and many mysteries<br/>It really caught my eye just like the rest of the series did.
 It's really expensive but worth the cost if you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan. It just barely fits all the basic books. I wish it could fit a few of the supplemental books, like Tales from Beetle the Bard, Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them, etcetera. Still, it's an amazing box and it feels really sturdy.
 The book was in fantastic condition, as promised!!!!! Thanks so much I have a VERY VERY happy 12 year old!!!!!!
 Great book
 This was a Christmas present for one of my grand daughters.  It arrived in time for Christmas and was as advertized.
 I love ALL of the Harry Potter books, but love this one the best.  It is sad and happy and answers all of the questions that I had going into this book.  If you love a complicated plot, with lots of sub-plots, as I do, then you should read Harry Potter.  There is a great diversity among characters and they are well developed.  Harry is not perfect... and that is why he needs help from his friends and teachers.  He is very human.  There were a few surprises in this book for me as all of the loose ends tie up by the end.
 I bought this set for my kids. My daughter, 12, loves reading them. After reading she sought HP movies to watch. The books are a little bit challenging for my 9 year-old child, but I am sure he will enjoy them in the future. The set is held in a box with an excellent price.
 A great addition to my HP library.  Just wish there were going to be more!!!
 I am a harry potter fan. I've watched all the movies and now I am reading all the books just to see what was left out of the movies and I have to say the movies are awesome but the books are better!
 Great readv
 A perfect introduction of Harry's world to a Potter neophyte. We bought this for our 6 year old nephew so he can experience the Rowling books as he grows up. A great set at a great price.
 This book was filled with all the action expected of a Harry Potter novel plus some. I definitely recomend this to anyone who loves adventure novels!
 exactly as described. Book has plastic cover over jacket.
 I like it. A lot. Very a lot. Super super a lot. Yup. I like it. Okay bye now I'm going.
 This Harry Potter book set is incredible. I never owned any of the hardcover books that I read, so it is great seeing all of these brand new books together in a set. It isn't the fanciest "trunk," but it works well as a holder and protector. I love the stickers it came with, but I hesistate to put them on the cardboard trunk. I can't wait to reread all the books :-)
 Our order finally arrived just before Christmas.  For the most part, the book was as described.  Packaging left much to be desired.  The book was swimming in an exceptionally large padded envelope.  I appreciated the padded parcel, though.  In terms of the final HP story; we haven't finished to book.  Will update this post later.
 It's Harry Potter, how can you go wrong! This is a great original paperback set with all the books. Exactly as described, we just bought them all at once, not only saved money but now our twins can enjoy them once they are old enough. For now they get to listen to mom read the books to them!
 Purchased to complete the Harry Potter series as a Christmas gift for my niece. Last book in the series, which answers almost all questions for the progress and witchdom, Harry and his friends.  So glad the "next" generation in the family is eager to read and share in the adventure!
 As I turned each page -.-.- I wasn't sure what would happen next: laugh, cry, cheer, or race to the next - fighting exhaustion and desperate to continue. Of all my accomplishments, the single greatest is the ability to read. This collection will always hold a very special place in my heart.
 Love all the Harry Potter books!
 Well, this is by far the best of the books in the series for me. The last 10 chapters were very difficult to tear myself away from. The entire series was well constructed and all the clues to how things must turn out are there, but you'd have to be pretty crafty to pick up on them. My only complaint is in not knowing what ever became of Luna Lovegood as she was one of my favorite characters.<br/>In my opinion formed by over 50 years of reading, Rowling is throughout this series, a competent writer, but not a great one, which is sad, because the story itself is a very good one and could have been an even more amazing read had it been done with more skill. There were many moments that I felt like I was "reading a book" rather than transported to a magical world. Her skill certainly improves with each book, and if I could rewrite history, I'd have her write about 10 novels to improve her craft before setting out on this series. But, we live in the real world. There are no wands, giants, centaurs, witches, wizards and things that exist just because you can't prove that they don't. There is magic in storytelling however, and I'd give Rowling an A+ on her efforts.<br/>This series is available in excellently read audiobook format and there are the 8 movies, both of which I intend to consume next. Most interestingly, there is a website (http://hpmor.com/) that teaches philosophy using characters (including Harry) and settings from the Potterverse. It's an ongoing project and when it's done, I plan on reading it; mostly because a vast majority of its readers claim that it's much better written than the J K Rowling series.<br/>I give my undying thanks and love to Tara Hale for convincing me to read the entire series when everyone else had failed to overcome my objection to the fact that Harry never farts and laughs anywhere in the saga. He may be the boy who lived, but how he could have done so without ever farting is the greatest magic of all.
 Whole world waited for this finale and Rowling did not disappoint them. The whole fandom roared with pride as Harry, Ron and Hermoine searched and destroyed Horcruxes. Even after so many years of getting this book, I am still a Proud Fanboy of this tremendous saga.
 I won't bother reviewing the books themselves, you all know what they are. I bought this so my son would have all 7 books in hardcover, and the price at Amazon is the best I could find. Paperbacks just don't last long enough. The trunk looks cool, but it won't be used to store the books. The books are more accessible on the bookshelf. If you want all the books and haven't already bought them, this is the set to get.
 As always, this book was a page turner.  Whether it is because of the attachment to the characters and knowing this is the last book, or because the story is compelling is difficult to say.  The book is very entertaining, however, I will say that, while I give it 4 stars, it fell short of expectations, and short of Book 6.  While filed with action, Book 7 doesn't command the emotional committment that Book 6 evoked.  I won't put in any spoilers, but I wil have to say that the ending fell far short of Book 6's ending.<br/><br/>Still, a great read.
 so great! at times hard to read because there is so much action, you almost never get a moment to just enjoy whats going on
 We bought this as a gift. Over the years we had read all of the Harry Potter books to our children and it was nice to actually have the hardcover book. Something about the actual hardcover in your hands when you read the sections on being in the Hogwarts library seemed to make a lot of sense. Just my 2 cents...
 A great value for the entire series of books, plus the box.  Buying the books separately would have cost more than the box of books!  The Harry Potter series is an excellent saga, with good writing and an enthralling plot which carries smoothly from one book to the next.
 Probably the best written of the entire series.  My wife read the whole book twice in about five days, before she would let anyone else read it.  The usual exciting (and fantastic) plot shifts and threats.
 Couldn't put it down, a delight begining to end. I love the back stories in between the main story line.
 My young daughter can't get enough of these books, she is engaged and motivated to read. I'm sure the hard covered books are a better long-term buy but these are great for travel to and from school.
 An excellent way to give your Harry Potter fan the whole reading experience.<br/><br/>This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was so exited when she opened these up to find all of her Harry Potter books in one collection.<br/><br/>This is a very well put together set that will give many hours of great reading and be something that anyone could treasure for years to come.
 I bought this in Amazon few weeks ago, all because i've seen the movie and yet i've never got the chance to actually read it. So, this whole set is AWASOME. I'm now halfway through reading it and so far, i've got no complains about it. I am not really a Harry Potter fan, just wanted to get to know the story more. This set works perfectly good for me!
 Nice collection in a box set. Bought this as a gift and finally read them for myself. Got stuck on book 5 but finally powered through Harry being a winey little turd to finish the series. Great to be able to read all the books and watch the movies concurrently
 This is at least the third time I have read all of the books. And eventually I will read them again! J. K. Rowling is one of the most creative and brilliant authors of our generation. The lessons learned in the books are about the strength of love, family, friendship and loyalty. I couldn't ask for more.
 Jim Dale brings his creative voice work to this endeavor like he has done for the other six books. A good listening experience all-around.
 A few people on here have made remarks about the packaging and the shipping, good and bad.  I'd like to give a little more depth on both of these topics.<br/><br/>First, the shipping.  Some have complained about their set being damaged (rips, bent corners, etc).  I purchased mine directly from Amazon and it was shipped by FedEx.  I was worried because of the reviews that it'd be damaged, but those fears were soon extinguished.  The box the set was shipped in contained some of those plastic bags full of air for padding, and sure enough, when I took the set out, it was 100% spotless, perfectly new.  I'm hoping this will continue to be the case for others, because it really is frustrating to open a new item and find it damaged by poor padding or incompetent boxing.<br/><br/>Now, the actual packaging of the set.  If you've read any other reviews for it, you've certainly been made aware of the gloriously beautiful artwork done by graphic novelist Kazu Kibuishi.  And I agree completely with them; the artwork is one of the main reasons to own this set, even if you already own the books.  Having read Mr. Kibuishi's Amulet series and Copper comics, I can safely say that this is the best artwork he's created.  It's remarkably, wonderfully detailed, and you will no doubt be compelled to admire every subtle inclusion of characters and accurate environmental depictions.  It's lush, perfectly colored and toned, obviously passionate work.  I'm so glad they got him, of all people, to do this.<br/><br/>Concerning the physical descriptions of this set besides the artwork, I've been surprised at remarks of the paper being of cheap quality, though the covers have been lauded for their "softness."  The covers are indeed soft and have a milky texture to them.  Very high quality stuff.  The artwork is crystal clear on them and the box.  But the paper is NOT cheap; it is of a rich material, certainly not the "mass market paperback" quality that another viewer opined.  It's very good, especially for paperbacks such as these.  Scholastic has impressed me.  The box has also been an issue, with many saying it's too small.  It IS a bit of a tight fit, I'll admit, but some other reviewer said it took them 30 minutes to get a book back in.  They must have been being extraordinarily meticulous with it, because that is not the case, I assure you.  The box was thicker than I imagined, sturdier, and that's always good.  Even if you end of not using it for storage, you definitely will not want to throw it out.<br/><br/>There's one more thing concerning the packaging that I'm surprised people haven't spoken much about: the binding.  These are paperbacks, so if durability is your utmost concern, the original hardcover set is still the way to go.  But these Scholastic paperbacks are of better binding quality than the Arthur A. Levine published ones, a few of which I used to have.  Those creased very easily, their bindings aren't durable at all; they operate mostly as reading copies.  This set, on the other hand, has much more durable bindings.  Yes, it's still Scholastic, so they aren't as durable as a hardback or an expensive paperback, but they are glued quite well, and won't crease unless you  crank back on them.  This is good, because it would truly be a shame if the image the lined-up spines create were tarnished in any way.<br/><br/>I hope this has been helpful to any potential buyers.  This series is exemplary reading; consider it a must-own.
 Packaging was good, product was perfect. The trunk is cardboard, looks good but could be made better. Opened the cover and my son was real excited and ready to read. Stickers were fun too.
 Squee!!
 It is new and clean, looked like a brand new book as advertised, and it arrived on time. I am happy with it.
 I needed to order these books for my sister, and it was great to be able to buy them all in one package. And even considering the shipping cost to Brazil, it was cheaper than bying the imported books here.
 i have enjoyed this book as well as the others in the series.  i would recommend this book to all adults and to children over the age of 10.  some may need help with some of the words but otherwise it is a good book for children too.
 It's a good set of books. My son wanted it and after visiting the local stores and comparing prices I ordered this box from Amazon. It arrived pretty fast and I was impressed, because the price was significantly lower for the absolutely same box. Good deal!
 My son loves these books.  I'm not sure why though, lol.  But whatever encourages today's youths to read instead of playing video games I try to promote.  I saw this exact book series at Barnes &amp; Noble for $85.  I couldn't believe it was so much cheaper. Love Amazon. The print is large for older people to read.  Also, each individual book is a large number of pages, so my son feels that added satisfaction of reading a book that is over 300 pages.
 This was a gift for three grandchildren from 11, 14, and 16 years old. I was visiting and saw that the 16-year old was re-reading a Harry Potter book--again. It was literally worn out. Just like this grandmother they re-read favorite books, then read them again.<br/><br/>I found this boxed set while searching a full set of hard-bound Harry Potters. This was a very bit hit. They were particularly thrilled with the cover art.<br/><br/>By the way, grandmothers would likely love these books, too.
 This was a gift for my 14 year old grandson and he loves the books.  The shipment came fast and we were all happy with the product.  Great value for the money.
 The books arrived quickly in great condition. My children, ages 6 and 8, are enjoying them immensely as we read them together as a family. That alone is worth the cost. As an adult, I find the stories entertaining but not nearly to the extent I would have expected after all the publicity around the series.
 I really enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I was going to. I got through it a lot faster than I figured since again I have seen the movie over 10 times it seems. The book however covers a lot more enjoyable events than the movie does and of course goes into greater and more fun detail that really brings you deeper into the story.
 I enjoyed these books very much. I loved the font size and that the books are light. I enjoyed the movies but I enjoyed the books more. Well-written and existing.
 Hello,<br/>I am a boy, 13 years old, from the Netherlands.<br/>I've read all the books in Dutch and now I'm reading them in English.<br/>This beautiful box contains all 7 books, for a very fair price.<br/>So..... buy it!
 Loved the book and read it all in one day. Rowlings is a very creative writer.
 The new cover illustrations are a delight to look and it's nice to see a different perspective on the imagery of HP's world. The packaging is gorgeous. Too bad they didn't have new illustrations in the books though. Still looks wonderful on the shelf.
 I was excited to have an interesting box set for the Harry Potter collection.  So, when I got the books today in the mail I was utterly disappointed when I open to see that there is no trunk!  Not even a fake cardboard box type trunk that everyone seems to be disappointed about.  I'd have been much happier with that at least.  Considering I paid for THAT! It's just all the books in a small cardboard box.  No lid, no fake privacy lock, not even stickers! I'm so upset...
 nice shop
 Well presented set. two things to say. 1. should of left room for the final book and 2. the third book's sleeve was mis bound so that you could not read the title. Otherwise they are Harry Potter books.
 This was one of the best book sets I've ever purchased.  I've only had it for a couple of weeks, and have finished the first 2 books already.  It's nice to be able to finish one and essentially start the next one right away!!
 My daughter and I are huge Harry Potter fans. We love reading the books better then we like watching the movies because they allow us to use our imaginations and feel as if we were part of the story.
 The book was in pristine condition and arrived ahead of the expected delivery date! The book is an excellent read. Getting my 13-yr old to read has always been a struggle... but he doesn't want to put this book down!
 Superb book by jk Rowling she was always an amazing writer. If you read this I hope you love it as much as me!!!
 After purchasing the last Illustrated Edition, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next book. The last edition was a wonderful interpretation of the scenes and characters, and this one is even better. This may be in part of Jim Kay gaining more confidence in his interpretations as he had previously been nervous about releasing his illustrations to a rather popular series.<br/><br/>There seems to be a higher concentration on the creatures in this edition rather then the characters. While I would have liked to have seen his interpretation of some of the characters (Tom Riddle included), the designs of the beasts are gorgeous and look like they have come out of a textbook from the Hogwarts curriculum in some cases.<br/><br/>If there is one legitimate complaint that I have it is that, as like with the last edition, the binding seems to be ill-suited to constant use. Merely a few days after moderate use, I started to notice the pages becoming much more loose with heavy crackling sounds just from opening it up a third of the way. I worry that in the future I may not be able to open it for fear of the pages tumbling out.<br/><br/>Regardless, this edition is beautiful and I highly recommend any Harry Potter fan, or those with children, to purchase this volume.
 I was so happy to find this set! It's a great deal for all 7 books! I also love the cute little box it comes in. Very happy with my purchase.
 five stars<br/>temple run brave is awesome!!!!!!! thanks so much for seeing my review! I am so awesome! die! goodbye!
 This is one of my all-time favorite books.  It wraps up every question any reader could possibly have in a nice little bow, and it makes sure that the answers are satisfying and sometimes even unexpected.  The way that Rowling wrapped up her series with this most stupendous of novels is incredible.  The world she has created and populated with characters of all different shapes, sizes, and magical orientations is one that every child - young and old alike - should take the time to read.  The magical aspects alone are intoxicating (especially since I wanted to be Samantha from "Bewitched" or Sabrina from "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" when I was little), but the relationships among characters and the way she finds to describe the past and how it imposes on the future is ridiculously well-crafted and realistic.  Anyone can identify with at least one of the emotions that Harry or his friends feel within this novel, as well as any of the others that Rowling has written.  She appeals to the masses, and this is not an easy task.<br/><br/>Beth Rodgers, Author of YA Novel 'Freshman Fourteen'
 i love this book. my faverit cartier is genny wesly so awsome she has a curush on harry and is the youngish  in the weasly family. harry and his best frends ron weasly and Hermione  gragher try to solve who and where the seacret of cambers is and who opend it turns out genny getss traped by who must not be named and was the one who opend it and harry has to save her.i am only ten ind i liked this one soooo well that i am on book six
 This set was for our 15 year old granddaughter who loves their series and didn't care which books we gave her.  They were in good condition and arrived in a timely manner.
 I had to order this book as a replacement for a school library.  The cover on the original library book got torn.  I was very pleased with the quality of the book and the quickness of the delivery.  A new book was very expensive.  I was able to save time, money, and stress with this order!
 I ordered this book set to read with my children.  We have even held off on watching the movies because I want them to read the books before seeing the movies.  I am very pleased with the product and packaging.
 I purchased these books for my son for his birthday. We read a few of them together and we liked them so much that he wanted to get a set of his own and reread them!! I love the slipcase it comes in as well!
 THIS IS THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANYONE WHOSE A HARRY POTTER FAN. MY WIFE THANKED ME SO MUCH WHEN I PRESENTED IT TO HER AS A GIFT. AND IT ALSO COMES WITH A COLLECTABLE BOX THAT LOOKS LIKE HARRY'S TRUNK IIN THE MOVIE.
 I bought this product as a gift, i wasnt expecting much from it exept all 7 harry potter books. When i recieved the package my first reaction was wow!!! its much larger than what i had percieved after seeing the images. Each book was in exellent condition and the box was a marvelous surprise. Looking for the harry potter book collection or just a really good gift, than this is the item to get.
 I have all the hard copies, of course.  But I have gotten so used to reading with my kindle, that I broke down and bought the set.  It was great to reread them cover to cover.  It won't be the last time!
 This set looks fantastic, and I love the stickers that come with it.<br/><br/>I couldn't give it 5 stars because unfortunately the artwork on the individual dust covers, while done in wonderful colour and style, is atrocious.
 Very good book. My favorite of the series. Once you start it you don't want to put it down. It is a must read for any Harry Potter fan.
 I really enjoyed this book.  In my opinion Rowling has continued to grow into a wonderful writer and a comsumate story teller.  From time to time I hear complaints on her "clunky" prose, but I disagree.<br/><br/>The story is compelling, consistant, well constructed, and just a heck of a lot of fun to read.  I am sorry to see Harry go, I don't think that my kids could possibly have enjoyed the series any more than I have.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see what Rowling writes next.  I am hoping for adult oriented fiction.
 I love Harry Potter and enjoy rereading the series every so often. I purchased the digital version of the complete series when it was on sale for $14.99. The price was way to good to pass up!  That way I can read the series anytime, anywhere without having to have my hard copies on hand.
 Awesome!  It's great to have all the books in one place!  This is my second time reading all six books, and it's still a great story.  Can't wait for #7!
 great book
 Jim Dale narrates the Potter stories with great emotion. He gives a voice to each charcter making them as unique as Rowling did in writing. Great for new readers, long trips, and background "noise". I put them on while I am working around the house I love it!
 I ordered this book separately when I ordered the box set 1-6. I'm very happy with all 7 books and this was the cheapest way to get all of them in great quality.
 Bought to complete the collection on daughter's shelf.  Spent plenty of time on hot summer days lying under the trees in the yard reading them with her.
 If you are reading this book, you have most likely read the other six. All I can say is, an extremely satisfying ending to a wonderful series. JK Rowling is a top-notch story teller, and so much rich backstory is revealed here, expanding so much on the previous installments. You won't be disappointed.
 My whole family and friends have read JK Rowling series many many times. At least a dozen for me! I love these books!
 The Harry Potter series is brilliant. Perhaps the people who didn't like the ending should remember that they are reading children's books? I only wish we could see goodness overcome evil and corruption in the real world...<br/><br/>The story was totally captivating - I didn't sleep until I finished every page! Not much else to say as I think the books speak for themselves.
 Even if you are not a kid these books are a good read.  JKR's imagination in developing these stories is inspired.  The whole saga together here is a good investment in a classic series bound to stand the test of time.
 Only finished the second book and I know that the rest will be great. I can't wait to finish the series and movies!
 I bought this set for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas.  He was so happy with it. It is nice that the whole set fits compactly in the cardboard case, since these books increased in size as they went on.  Great for a grade school aged kid, so that they don't have to carry around a heavy hard-cover book.  The set was also cheaper than buying each one individually. It shipped very fast, no problems.
 My son was reading along and the text got a bit confusing. Turns out the book goes from page 76 to 125, skipping everything in between.<br/>Further investigation found that when it reached 172 it returned to 125 again.<br/>Seriously, I have never seen such a thing before.<br/>We looked it up, and apparently this is a common enough problem with the Harry Potter books. It makes me wonder why there hasn't been a recall when the printers know there are defects going out.<br/>Anyway, we had a good laugh about it. And we have a hard back copy we borrowed from a friend so that he can finish it.<br/>But yeah, we will be seeking a refund.
 When I received the set of 6 hardcover books, one of the books was not  hardcover (Philosphers Stone) and they could only supply the advertised book in paperback. When I asked why, they said it was hard to get. When I asked why they kept saying they were all hardcovers in their other 2 listings, they said they would amend the listings. They have not. If you are truly looking for a set of 6 hardcover books, do not buy them from this vendor. While they adjusted my payment for the other 5 hardcovers, I expected and paid for and wanted the hardcover. Whatever happened to truth in advertising...especially on Amazon!
 The books came on time and in good condition. I cant say they were new they come in some plastic that looks like a trash bag taped with paper tape. But they are in good condition. They also don't send a book mark but it tells you that in the description. The biggest thing that got me peeved off is the fact that it's supposed to come with the collectors box and it did not! I would use someone else they take forever to get there and not everything you see is included so be warned!
 Purchased this as a Christmas present for a friend.  Its a really nice complete set that comes with a decorated case to protect them.  I like it so much I may have to purchase my own.  Its well worth the cost to have one nice consolidated set.  I prefer the paperback because they are easier to tote and read, and again the storage case will provide them with protection to keep them like new when you are not using them.
 Read the books as a kid and they're just as magical now as they were the first time I read them.
 My 10 yr. old granddaughter requested these for Christmas.  She was quite excited to get them and so is her mom who can't wait to read them.  Excellent transaction.  The books were packaged nicely and arrived in plenty of time for the holidays.
 There seldom comes along a truly great series.  And neer before one as timeless as this one.  No atter the age of the reader, this series is so magickal as to enchant any and all ages!  This second book in the series is just one of the stepping stones in the wonder of this series!
 Great book. If you are reading this review then you are one of the few people on this planet that hasn't seen the movie or read the book. The books are basically an expanded version of the movies. They tend to give background to some the things done but not built up in the movies.
 This book and the first one are the ones that the corresponding movies most closely follow.....it also contains one of my favorite sequences - when Arthur Weasley gets home from a night of raids, meets Harry and discovers that Fred, George and Ron flew the family car "....to Surrey and back....".
 I'm Zach<br/>I have a comodo dragon and an owl and a fish who won't stop making faces at people.
 We love the book and love it even more as movie! Wish there are more books and movies available soon
 I love Harry Potter so anything related to him is perfect.  Now, my parents didn't buy me each book when they came out. I had to borrow them or rent them from our library.  So, once I got out on my own I purchased each book for my collection.  Best idea ever.
 the series is so good it'll drepress you when its over, may even flatten you, youll never forget harry potter.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the best book I ever read. I read it in Spanish and was so good but in English is better because is the original language.. I love it...
 Received as described. Thank you.
 Great condition.
 The Harry potter books are a wonderful read. The books can b  read over and over, you are sure to find something you may have missed the first few times.
 Well I can only say that I loved the book, like I have loved every other HP book. It's a shame it has come to an end, but well JK said that there could be a another book in a very far away future, who knows.
 this was my son's favorite birthday present. now i'm reading the books and enjoying them.
 I jumped onto the Harry Potter bandwagon just before the last book came out and I don't regret it one bit!  The books get progressively better, which says a lot considering that the first one is great to begin with.
 I recently purchased this item because I've had a hard time finding all of the books in this series at my local library. This is an absolute must-have for the Harry Potter fan. I can't wait for the release of the next book!!
 Of course the hardback books are enough to be a collector's item, but the fun "trunk" these come in is an awesome bonus (and protects your books).  You can decorate it yourself! Call me a kid again.
 Harry Potter Hardcover Boxed Set of 7 Books arrived safely and on time, as promissed. My daughter was anxiously waiting for the books, she finished the whole set in less than a week, it's so interesting.
 This was purchased as a gift but these special editions are very cool I have 3 of them now and I like that they are the original text with the british words as is.
 I have a daughter who like collections and this fits the bill. The fact that she enjoys reading the books is  bonus. The art work is wonderful and the picture that all the books make is great. I am hoping that this set will be around for a long time.
 These books are great. The presentation box is neat and my son is not hard on things so the box should hold up just fine. Unfortunately the shipping box is labeled with the words "Harry Potter boxed set 1-7". My son greated the UPS guy in the yard, and was thrilled to know what his birthday present was going to be. All is fine, but just be aware the shipping box will reveal the contents. All seven books in hardback make this a great deal!
 There are several HP book sets on the market right now, but I picked this one out automatically!  I chose this one because I'm not a huge fan of the original American release illustrations, and this cover art is more refined.  The chapter heading illustrations are the original, however.  The outer box is sturdy and well made, and the covers of the books themselves are smooth and pleasent to hold.  As for the stories themselves, they truly are magical!
 Not as goood as the first three novels. Lots of unnecessary waiting around for the plot to contine on to the end. About 350 pages were kind of dull for Harry Potter.
 Best one of the series
 I received item before expected delivery and the Harry Potter set of 6 books published in the UK. was new and had never been opened. It exceeded my expectations.
 I love Harry Potter. This is the climax to an awesome series. I can read these books over and over. I must admit I watched the movies first before reading the series. Although the movies are great. The books are better. Must buy, add to your collection, and enjoy over and over.
 I'm in love with the harry potter series.<br/>I recommend this book to pretty much everyone.<br/>In this harry potter book we get to see how hagrid got expelled and why.<br/>Awesome monsters that will have you hiding under your bed.<br/>Very well written characters and more secrets of voldemorts past.<br/>Everyone should read this I loved it and so will everyone else.
 I have enjoyed all of these books and to hear them come to life is great fun. Jim Dale is very skilled in his narration and the voices he uses make the characters come to life. I definately recommend this series.
 I've wanted this for the longest time and I finally got it from my mom and dad as a 16th birthday present! I have loved Harry Potter ever since I can remember and these books are beautiful. I can even pass them down to my own kids in the future. The box itself is sturdy but I really wished it was wood instead of heavy cardboard. The books were in great condition except for Deathly Hallows. The pages/book kind of broke loose from the spine but I fixed it with some glue so it's fine now. Other than that, they were all in great condition and they're all first editions as well so I'm pretty happy knowing that.
 The Harry Potter series is definitely the greatest phenomenon in recent history.  The 7 book series is a MUST READ.  Thank you JK Rowling for creating this amazing world.
 A great collection! You can't beat all 7 Harry Potter books for such a cheap price! Real fans are looking for an easy way to bring their favorite stories along. There's no need to have them all separated into different files on your Kindle. A nice bargain for fans, new and old!
 loved the book<br/>still managed to capture all the essence of JKR previous books of charm and magical mystery even though we know it is the last book.  i think we partly live in hope that it could offer us a world like Tolkien left.  that she could be able to write a book or two a bout his fathers time in school or about the seedy pasts of voldemort before he became who he was.. alas i doubt that will happen but it can always be a dream
 This is niw my 4th time reading this book series and each time i feel like its my first time all over again. The Harry Potter series is not an ordinary series. Many books feel like they are no more than just a cool story, however, the Harry Potter book series is one that makes you feel like you are there. It makes you believe that magic is real and that all of these characters are as well. Like I said, I've read this series 4 times now and parts still bring tears to my eyes, while other parta cause me to shout with joy. Ive never found another series that was as brilliantly written as this one.
 JK Rowling did an amazing job with the last book of the HP series.<br/>I highly recommend this book to everyone!
 I have listened to all the books several times and just love them.  I had them all on cassette and thought I should have the CDs because it is getting harder to find Cassette Players.  I have also have enjoyed J.K. Rowling's other books altho they are nothing like Harry Potter.
 This is a great set! I was a little worried about the trunk after reading the reviews, but I bought it anyway thinking that it was a great deal just for the books alone!<br/><br/>It turns out that although you do have to be somewhat careful with the trunk, it is quite adorable! It also comes with really cute stickers that you can decorate your trunk with.<br/><br/>I would recommend it, even if you just wanted the books!  For the price, I don't understand how all the other reviewers expected so much more. 5 stars all the way!
 This was extremely well constructed, and heavy to boot. My sister is a huge fan of the series, and her original collection was stolen by a former friend. When she opened this up last June for her birthday, her smile rivaled the Joker; I was relieved that she enjoyed it so much.
 I borrowed books 1 thru 6 from family and read them.  We purchased the 7th book and decided we wanted books 1 thru 6 for our library.  It was a great way to fill in books 1 thru 6 in hardcover.
 When I first saw this exclusive "Harry Potter Boxset", I knew I had to have it.<br/>It made me feel like I had attended Hogwarts with all those books in what looks<br/>like the chest. All seven books are there, recapturing the life of Harry Potter.<br/>I totally stickered out my box. ITS A MUST HAVE!!
 A masterpiece. Everything falls right into place.
 I ordered the product and did two day delievery...<br/>Tracking my shipment was a breeze... the product arrived in two days as stated...<br/>Packing was great and my order was recieved in one piece...<br/>However, some of the DVDs has a littel scratch on them but no big deal.<br/>I would order from Amazon again and again... excellent stuff....<br/>Thank you
 Very nice box set.  The case is a nice touch.  I used a fine-point Sharpy to put my girlfriend's name on it for her birthday.  The case is a little cheap for the price point but it looks neat and it was just the right touch for a great birthday present.  All about that presentation.
 Harry Potter Hard Cover Boxed Set books #1-7 = I just love this set.  A small part of my little home library got tossed out inadvertently.  All of my HP books got tossed........  (I bought every book - 2-7 --even 'book 8' -- at midnight releases!).  This is a great collection to replace what I had lost and think my favorite part is the 'trunk' they come in!  I think this is a very good deal.
 this was supposed to be a set of seven paperbacks but was instead a set of four paperbacks and three hardcovers.  Total false advertising.
 very nice. I was a bit disappointed that the box was cardboard, but the books themselves are very good. I bought sets for my grandchildren.
 i really like the book, i thought it was better than some of the others in the series
 I was worried that these were going to be used or not in perfect shape but they were! I got them for my girl friend a huge Harry Potter fan. and they were perfect better than i could ask for! Unopened and still sealed! Great buy for half the price!
 Excellent edition.  Large enough for young readers to handle with ease.  Great art work!  I am an "old" fan and couldn't wait for the next Harry Potter book to come out.  Now I can't wait for the third book to come out in this edition ... for my grandson, of course.
 Great condition.
 Harry Potter! Started reading these when I was in elementary school, and loved every second of every book. Awesome price for the whole series. Only bad thing is that it is one HUGE book. You can't just open up the third Harry Potter book, you have to navigate to that page where it starts.<br/><br/>Everybody needs to read this series, it is just awesome!
 All the Harry Potter books are outstanding-We have 3 grand kids under the age of 10 who love the movies and reading the books- 2 8yrs. and 1 10 yrs. they love to read and these books are easy reading-We purchased the books from Amazon because of the good service we get from them-new and used books-keep up the good work-Thanks Esperanza
 I've read this series so much that my hardback copy of it finally just fell apart! Thank goodness for my Kindle. Love this series more than any other series in existence. If you've only watched the movies, you're denying yourself the depth and originality the books have to offer.
 I feel like I've watched these kids grow up.  Are you sure there won't be a College Years?
 I was disappointed with the box that the books came in didn't realize that it was cardboard.  It was still nice to be able to get all books at the same time.
 I received this book in perfect condition! I bought it to add to my collection and it looks amazing on my book shelf!
 So glad I finally got to read the books I bought multiple copies of so each child would have their very own set. I loved every minute! I have seen the movies, visited the Universal attractions, and made costumes for my children and their friend's to attend opening midnight showings (Neville, Luna, Ron, Hermione, and a Bellatrix from our group lol), but the books, as is usually the case, have greater insight to the characters thought processes and motivations. Kudos to Ms. Rowling, and the things she overcame to be such an influence and mentor to the generation that belongs to my kids and future generations to come.
 The only real problem was that the book was described as "like new" and we got it with bent, worn corners. Could have been due to the way it was packed. None the less, it was a little disappointing. Probably not a big deal in the long run but it would have been nice to get exactly what we thought we were getting.
 The order was received within 5 days.  It was security wrapped and packaged for shipment.  there we no defects of any kind, dents, tears, scrapes, etc.<br/>Quality and service are excellent.
 The books were in perfect shape and I was very pleased with the timely arrival.
 I bought the complete children's softcover 7-series from scholastic. I believe it offers the best value among all available series. When i received the set, i was not disappointed.
 Loved the series .. disappointed with the ending.
 Our son recently started reading Harry Potter in school so he became interested in it.  He was Harry Potter for Halloween and thought he would love this set.  At a fraction of the cost of the hardcovers, it is still a really nice set in a nice box.  He loves chapter books now so this will be a great Christmas gift!
 The imagination put forth in this set could only come from a witch with a powerful insight into what muggles enjoy.  J.K. Rowling has truly earned the Order of Merlin, First Class with her biography of Harry Potter.  I give this set my highest recommendation.
 As advertised. The hard-bound set, in used but excellent condition. NO problems. Moving the Harry Potter saga to a new generation as my granddaughter is picking up the stories....
 I know everyone is really upset they didn't get a wooden trunk with metal embellishments, a keyed lock, a lifetime supply of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans and a puppy. But really folks...if you seriously thought it would be that you should have questioned the price. Wood and metal and handcraftmanship are significanly more in the money department.<br/><br/>It's cardboard, it comes with stickers instead of a puppy, but most important of all: The Books Are Hardbacks. Finding any of the Harry Potter books in hardback, in good condition, is nigh-impossible once they've gone paperback. And when you consider Amazon's discounted price, you are getting a mega-screaming deal.<br/><br/>And you know what? I like the cardboard trunk. It looks good on my coffee table's shelf. I think it's a cute bit of marketting and a good offer to the fans as their last chance to get the hardbacks new and pristine.
 I'm in the process of reading the series for the ninth time, the story, along with the way it was written is completely enticing, and with the fact that there is little magic left in our world one can't help but to want to escape into the pages of Harry potter and his magical world
 Good book. Arrived on time made the movie understandable. The whole series a good read to understand the movie s better.
 The binding and case of these 7 volumes are very good quality and the books would survive many readings and handlings.  Since the books regularly refer back to events and people in previous volumes, it's worth it to have all seven volumes.
 J.K. Rowling gives you all six hardcover books, and she justs gets better and better as Harry gets older.  She has shown the world of true magic and wizardely.  Gave kids and adults interesting stories for us to enjoy over a span of time that will always be remembered.<br/><br/>This is the collection you want if you don't have any of the Harry Potter books, if you don't care for the hardcover books I advice you to get the soft cover collection.<br/><br/>Overall: To me Rowling continues to get better and better and this is a colleciton that proves it I gives this a 5/5.
 Older grandson is in to reading bigger books and like thick ones so I thought of the Harry Potter Series, He thought that was one of the Best Gifts He got.  Thank you for making this a great Christmas for our grandson.
 A lot of effort went into searching for this item yet when delivered was totally dissappointed. Decision was made to purchase hard cover  &amp; not paperback which would have been a lot more affordable but the "collectible trunk like box with sturdy handles &amp; privacy lock was nothing like it was described. The delivery box that is was shipped in was a better quality than the supposedly sturdy trunk. Totally false advertising &amp; dissappointed buyer.
 I purchased these for my granddaughter.  She had the paperbacks...all 7 volumes and had read them so many times they were falling apart.  She loved these in Hardcover....her favorite was the chest that is a copy of one Harry Potter uses in the movie.  It even comes with labels.
 What a great deal on ALL Harry Potter books in one collection. These books are a treasure, loved by young and old as they spike the imagination, yet contain life lessons we can take away at any age. I think I would want to read these books for a long time to come.<br/><br/>so like most, I've purchased these books many times already. In paperback individually, then hardcovers in a set, not to mention the DVDs and Blu-Rays of the movies. But finally after lugging a bookshelf of just Harry Potter books through 2 moves I finally donated them to the library.<br/><br/>Recently, they were released by Pottermore again and I've been seeing them feature on the Top 100 list of Kindle Books. So I wanted to read them yet again, but had already given mine away. I thought it would be wonderful to get the Audible version as it has some great narration, but it was a little too expensive in addition to the $9 price of each individual novel.<br/><br/>So this $15 price for 7 books is amazing, AND now I can ask Alexa (Amazon Echo) to read me Kindle Books as it's a newly added feature. It's not as great as the Audible narration, but there is nothing better than slipping into bed, and first asking Alexa to turn off the bedroom lights, and then saying, "Alexa, read me Harry Potter" and she begins reading from where I left off last time!<br/><br/>Now excuse me as I get the lights turned off and dream about Hogwarts as Alexa reads me to sleep with Harry Potter.
 Great set for those who don't already own their own copies. Great price as well
 Absolutely wonderful!<br/>My favorite part is that the artist for this and the first book really drew from his own imagination for the artwork. The characters and situations that are portrayed do not look like previous renditions or in a similar fashion to the movies. The illustrator also decided to add additional content to support the story, such as pages from wizard book.
 Loved it, would like more Harry Potter books
 My child just loves these books.  Concerned about the paperback and keeping the books in good condition.  The box really helps to keep the books orderly.  Best price and delivered very quickly.  Love Amazon!
 The book ties up all the loose ends and wraps up the story beautifully.  I will miss Harry Potter.
 Great boxed set, I have read the whole series however they were my children's set and I wanted a set of my own. Great price on Amazon.
 I love how Harry Hermione and Ron go on adventures.  It's fantastic bedtime reading.  My little girl and I love it
 I don't know if anyone is aware but in the fourth book, HP and the Goblet of Fire, there is a printing mistake. After page 660 previous chapters are in place of the next pages instead, so it goes from 660 to like 65. I was very displeased with that and it doesn't return back to normal format for another 25 so pages and then it continues from page 690 so you've then missed a huge chunk of the chapter. Anyone who has previously bought this: I'd like to know if you have had the same issue.<br/><br/>But otherwise, the books are beautiful.
 If you haven't read any of these books... what is wrong with you!! THESE BOOKS ARE AMASING!!!!! You will fall I. Love with th characters! You will cry!! The book set is great the pages are a little thin but it doesn't really matter because you get the full experience for a great value!!
 What can you say about Harry Potter....I wish it was a continuing series...a never ending saga.
 Purchased this box set for our daughter for Christmas as she loves Harry Potter. We already owned the first 4 books but she really wanted the entire set. It was a better value to buy the box set rather than each of the final books in the series separately. Nice quality books.
 I mean, it's Harry Potter, how much is there to say?<br/><br/>Being the last person on Earth to read them, I did not have the child perspective that most had when enjoying the books.<br/>Because of that, it certainly got to a point when I was dragging along and reading just to get the series over with.
 Easy to read, the first two titles in the series are my favorites - before the dark turn in POA. Which is also more than entertaining and enjoyable, but COS will always be my favorite title. I love the books' interpretation of pop culture/relevance in comparison to the movies.
 The Harry Potter books were the first books I tried out on Audio Books and I was quite surprised.  Jim Dale does a terrific job of narrating.  I listen to these on long trips to and from the Desert.  Great set... Definately recommended.
 The book came exactly as promised...in perfect condition, and right on time.  Can't ask for any better service than that!
 I love audio books especially and the narrator in the HP series is great. It was like I had seen the move after I had listened to this book. The subplot of the deathly hallows movie was greatly diminished  in the movie so if you haven't listened to the audio book you missed a large part of the story<br/> and several characters too.
 Beautiful books! So glad to have the whole set. They come all together in an illustrated box. The box has very minor dents along the edges, but overall everything is in great condition. I got this paperback set because it is half the price of the hard cover set, but I kind of wish I had given more consideration to the hard covers, just because paperbacks can be so fragile. Great purchase, though.
 I love this series. I'm sorry to see it go. And I enjoyed the wrap-up at the end. Not many books wrap things up so nicely in a tidy bow, for those that like to see loose ends tied up in books and movies.
 Beautiful set with hard backs, but, treasure chest it is in should be heavier. It is pretty flimsy though very attractive.
 We have been reading the illustrated versions to our kids at night. However, this one felt a bit more rushed than Soceror's Stone. There aren't as many illustrations, and some chapters are just a few scattered objects here and there on the page. I hope Prisoner if Azkaban is a bit more exciting!
 Great book, great series, sad it's over. Jim Dale reads awesome! I so hope she goes on to write of the marauders!
 We had the book but misplaced our copy when time came to read the last of the series. I bought this as a replacement and as a copy for one of my children when they grow to read to their children. It came much faster than anticipated and was in new condition; a Great value for a timeless classic!
 This item is in great condition, was shipped in a very timely manner, I'm very sastisfied. MY SON IS VERY HAPPY WITH HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT. THANK YOU.
 The Harry Potter series are phenomenal books.  They are creative, imaginative, and superbly written.  I highly recommend these books to everyone in every age group.
 This book is amazing.  The writing is brilliant and the characters are fleshed out so well.  J.K. Rowling is a master at building a great plot to an incredible conclusion.  I highly recommend this book.
 I loved this series &amp; I am a 65 year young woman.  IN Rowling is a fantastic writer &amp; I look forward to hearing more from her soon!  I would like to know about what happened in the 19 years that elapsed before the last chapter.  I'll bet it was interesting.
 I bought this to have the complete Harry Potter collection and I am very happy with the quality of the books.  They come in a very nice slip case (makes storing easy).  It was also an excellent buy.  Highly recommended for Harry Potter lovers.
 Books were for my wife. She is reading these books with our grandson over the telephone. We find it a way to maintain contact with grandchildren
 I find that Harry and his cohorts grew up very quickly in this action filled somewhat sad tale.  The ending seemed fitting but quick and the epilogue was sweet.  All-in-all, a good read.
 I love this collection and plan to keep it for a long while. I just wish for the money, the case was a little more well built. The lock on the front is a little cheap, some kind of key one would have been way cooler. The quality of the cardboard box is good, for cardboard. The edges of the decorative overlay are lifting a little, but a little glue works. So even tho there's some little things wrong, I still love the overall case..
 These Hardcover books are definetly worth the price! Since these books are somewhat a legend, they will always be valuable. To get them in hardcover is the best way to keep the books in mint condition.
 It was exactly what i asked for... and it arrived 2 weeks before the expected... something that i would like to ask is that for overseas costumers (like my case) the shipping costs are too high... it would be great if amazon.com figures out a way to reduce them a little because there is heaps of people willing to buy stuff from your web page but sometimes the shipping costs just make things unaffordable...<br/><br/>ANYWAY.... the specific product (harry potter collection books) is great!
 This book set is a fabulous price! The books are terrific. You can't read just one. They get better and better.  My 8 year old son loves them! It's amazing to see him with an 800 page book!!! I've been reading along with him and, much to my surprise, am LOVING them just as much. Great books, great buy!!!
 Deathly Hallows never really wowed me when I read it years ago, and it still doesn't wow me today. My main gripes of this book are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Harry won't tell anyone about his mission to destroy the horcruxes. Only he, Hermione, and Ron know about what they are and how to destroy them. There are multiple points where the Minster of Magic asks Harry what he is up to, Professor Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, Charlie, and loads others. But Harry doesn't confide in anyone because of some misplaced honor he has. Half of the people who asked him could easily have helped him on the journey. I know Harry was worried about putting people in danger or having Voldemort find out, but people were already dieing and things were going wrong. How much worse could it get?<br/><br/>2. The story drags quite a bit in the middle. It seems like Rowling wasn't sure how to advance the plot and just had Harry happen to overhear someone mention a person or place and he immediately decides to whisk himself off to that location. Everything just seems to contrived.<br/><br/>3. There is waaay too much exposition. Too many instances where characters have to explain to great lengths what is happening in the story. What are the Deathly Hallows - well here is a two page story to explain it. Who is Grindlewald - another story. Was Dumbledore really a bastard - story time. The reader doesn't get a change to experience anything but instead gets told what to think and know. That is lazy writing. You should never have to explain things to the reader like that. The story should develop through the actions of the characters, not a page long description of why this is important. Granted this is a problem Rowling had since book 1 and introducing plot devices that were conveniently never mentioned in previous novels.<br/><br/>The book isn't bad, but the middle suffers quite a bit. The beginning and end are brilliant, but just so much garbage happens in the middle.
 This was a Christmas present for my 14-year old stepson. He loved them!!!! Read all of the series within a month. The paperpatk version is an affordable way to gift someone the entire Harry Potter book set. I received this item within 2 days of purchasing - thank you Prime!!!
 Just an amazing book series, and even great BOX SET.  I love the pictures that are not illustrated on all the covers.  I saw a few reviews from earlier saying that the box is really bad.  I will disagree.  I like it for it being a box holding books.  It does its job!!
 My childhood dream the HP books. The books are in great condition, however the box is not as it is shown in the picture, but it do the job of keeping the books safe. I think it was better that way since the seven books together are very heavy already the packaging do not need to be heavy as well.
 Don't take a long car trip without it. A must for all Potter-philes. Great way to appreciate the book. Top rate.
 The outer box that holds the books was blown out. Will be prett useless to hold the books, though I will attempt to tape it all together - will look ridiculous with all the tape needed.
 I owned all 7 books as a kid but somewhere along the line, I lost the 7th book. I ordered a used copy to hopefully match the ones I have loved and worn in. It's perfect. No tears and no stains on the pages (which as far as I can tell are all there) and it's just the right amount worn in. Love it!
 Even though I am a thirty year old woman...I think these were the best books I have read!
 This is a great gift set who is a fan of J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter. This complete set comes with Harry's trunk and stickers to decorate the trunk.
 The book came before expected and in great condition. No dents, no cuts, just perfect. I was more than happy with the condition and the price. With the free shipping it was cheaper than most of the retail stores.
 This book was a good ending to a long series that captivated the world, I liked it because it was more realistic (as realistic as fantasy books can get) than a fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after.
 It's a great series and this version has the most beautiful cover art (by Kazo Kibuishi, who did the Amulet graphic novel series). I found the cover art on most of the other editions amateurish. These are beautiful and the spines form a picture of Hogwarts.
 Great box set of all the Harry Potter books.  The price is excellent and the quality is very good.  The books are paperback but are very sturdy, made with good quality material.  Love that they all fit into a very nicely constructed box.  Excellent buy, great value!
 I initially only wanted the hardcover versions, but they were much more expensive. Since this one comes in a nice box that keeps them from excess shelf wear/dust and was a far more affordable, it's the best version I could have. Thank you!
 I bought the series to read to my husband and 8 year old son on a cross country move, knowing the hours will be easily filled with entertaining, engaging brilliant writing and story telling in the series, which is the best in our time.  Its something special when a series can be fully enjoyed by parents, grandparents and children.  We will read this over and over again...
 It was a present to my girl to complete her paperback collection of the harry potter series. It was on time, and (like promised) brand new!
 Happy to finally have these in a boxed set! I am reading these with my kids to introduce them to the magic of Harry Potter, and they are loving them. The paperbacks are fine and sturdy enough with care. The box is a sturdy cardboard with the cool illustration as shown.
 The 7th Harry Potter arrived within days of placing my order and the actual book was, of course, phenomenal. Always on the edge of your seat wanting more!
 This paperbook set will be a great addition to my collection.  The only way it could be better is if it also had the final book.
 Have been a fan of the movies and stories of Hogwarts. JK Rowling is a genius with her ability to craft her tales and characters. I wanted to have the books as part of my collection even though I read them all.
 I was finally glad to get this book after not being able to find it for a while. Thanks much!!
 I received the Harry Potter Seven Book Set and promptly started reading from book one.<br/>However, once I got to the Fifth book I was shocked to see that nearly 40 pages have been hacked off.<br/>Pages 831- 870 are severed at the top and two full sentences are missing from the tops of all of these pages.<br/>Very disappointed as I have grown to love the Harry Potter books.
 Beautiful set, packaged nicely. If you love the classic artwork of Harry Potter this is the one to get. If you get it on sale the price for all seven hardbacks is excellent. They are in a cardboard Hogwarts chest but the cardboard is durable and very nicely put together.
 The new covers look great, I love how the spines together form Hogwarts, and it also comes in a nice box as well. It's a great special edition set to have if you have a die hard HP fan in your life.
 There was no dust cover and book was in worse shape than I expected .
 I got this book for my 8 year old son and he loved it.  He loved book number one as well.  I would highly recommend this book to children of that age group, either for them to read themselves (if they are up to it) or to have read to them.  Starting with book three, though, there is a pretty jarring shift in terms of linguistic complexity, pace, and content.  In my experience, the first two books are the best for young children, and then book 3 and 4 seem to be better for kids who are a couple years older.  My son powered through those, but was noticeably less interested. There is another pretty jarring shift in content and complexity in book 5, and at that point we decided to set aside the series until he is a bit older.  All the books are great, but i just seems that they appeal to kids at different ages.  This makes sense since the books are about children growing up, but still it makes it kind of tricky to know when to introduce the series to your child.  Book one is cute and funny, and by book 7 it has become pretty dark and death-obsessed.
 Awesome
 These books are beautifully illustrated.  I have read the whole series, and am trying desperately to get my 8 year old to read them.  He's not interested (yet).  I think I will steal them for the mean time.  I've bought year 1 and year 2, and both are spectacular.
 What more is there to say? Loved this series as an elementary school student and still read during my now graduate studies. This set was for my sister who now cherishes them since I wouldn't lend my copy to her (she is prone to spills and food dribbles on her books!)
 I received books 1-4 from Debra D books in great condition.  There was a mix up and was sent 1-3 and 5 but she fixed it very quickly!  I now have 1-5!!!!!!!
 Great purchase from GoodWill. They shipped a very good condition copy. We love the Harry Potter series and it's a great way to encourage imaginative reading. Affordable and fun. I would recommend this series.
 Who doesn't want one of these smackaroos?! This is my favorite book series ever, and I've had to constantly go to a library to check and recheck the HP books. Now that I have this, I never have to go to a library again.<br/><br/>Now, unlike a bunch of boxed sets, this one has very great art on the box that looks good on a bookshelf, or on display. It also has a firm box, that won't break easily.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is the difference in price for the hardbacks from the paper backs. The paper backs are around $50.00, but the hardbacks are around $100.00.<br/><br/>Other than the price, it was worth my baby sitting paycheck to buy this.
 I found the audio for Harry Potter 1-7 excellent. I believe I ordered a new set, either way, it was in pristine condition. The narrative was great, especially using different voices and tone for the different characters.<br/> While I recommend it for everyone, but it is a must have for Harry Potter fans.
 Avery(age9)I hope other kids will read this book. Soon I will start a Harry Potter collection. I will start with wands  and end with the map. I do not like reading as much as my sister but I really like these books with adventure.
 I think this Boxset is awsome!! its really beautiful and the books are hard cover so its much better for reading. The Chest is really nice aswell. The books are in a bigger format than I expected but its more of a bonus than a downside. If you're thinking should I or shouldnt I buy it than the answer is YES YOU SHOULD!!!
 Purchased for my 10 year old son for Christmas in 2015, he was able to read all 7 books within a 5 months. He LOVED them and now LOVES all things Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The books are paperbacks and come in a storage box, which makes keeping them all together easy.
 this set of books was a wonderful addiction to my collection.  I had moved and lost a number of my books, wanting them all so that they maybe read in order this collection is perfect.
 My 8 year old niece has been begging to read Harry potter and I was not about to give her my original harcovers. She loves this set and is super excited to read the series. Don't feel I need to explain the story because I'm pretty sure everyone knows it. Lol
 I bought this book set for my 7 year old daughter and she blew threw one every couple of days. Of course there were some words that she needed help with, but she still loved them. We watched the movies afterwards and it made her want to go back and re-read the books.
 Bought this and several other books for my grandson for his birthday.. He just turned eight and loves to read and I thought this would be perfect. He can't put it down so I made the right choice. Excellent delivery time.
 The book would be great if I recieved the correct item. What I recieved was Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone with the cover of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It was a gift for my daughter and she was very upset. Not happy
 What more can someone say about Harry Potter. I read my previous books until they fell apart and bought these to replace them. I am already on my third read-through on these babies and won't stop anytime soon. These books shaped my childhood.
 As an avid fan of the books (my friends and family say I'm addicted, but I can stop anytime I want, I swear) I bought the audiobooks to listen to on my twice daily commute of 45 minutes. Jim Dale is simply superb as he brings all of my favorite characters to life with their own unique voices. Now I can take Harry Potter with me wherever I go without having to lug around those bulky books.
 My son is halfway throught it, he loves it.  I know everyone think  J K Rowling is an amazing woman, so do not need to say more.  I recommend it.
 I consider this author the best fiction of my time. I have read all seven books several times. Ms Rowling created an entire vocabulary in addition to fictional characters that appear so real I believe them. The books are fabulous. I wish for more. Thanks Teri
 I sent the book to my son ... he was happy to get it. Thank You
 The last installment of Harry Potter is always a good read. It's a fun and exciting conclusion to the Harry Potter series. I would definitely recommend this for people to read.
 Just as described.  Nicely packaged.
 I grew up with Harry - I was the same age as Harry was in the books each year they were released. It was enthralling then, and it captures me brilliantly now.<br/><br/>It's a great story that shows no matter where you grow up, there are always challenges people face, and you're not alone. It also showed similarities to what can happen when people give in to feelings about power and exclusion. Don't leave people out because they're different from others - everyone deserves to be treated fairly.
 My favorite of all of the books. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and have read all of the books multiple times. But I have read this one, and book five (Order of the Phoenix) the most frequently. This book has some unexpected surprises and some great resolutions. It is amazing that JK Rowling was able to keep certain relationships a secret until this book was published. Well done.
 The books in this series are great  for reading with and to your children; I suggest you read it with your  child and then see the movie together.  If you have no children, read them to yourself and recapture a piece of your childhood.
 I loved this book. The characters are so likable, especially the Weasley's. Gilderoy Lockhart is hilarious! So many funny things happen in Chamber of Secrets. It is a very creative &amp; imaginative book. The muggle car &amp; the whomping willow is a favorite. I love the way people in pictures wander out of their frames &amp; into others; the way the staircases move and the house ghosts fly all over.<br/>Of the 7 books in the series Chamber of Secrets is my favorite.
 Read it first when it was published and just finished re-reading it.  Very much like revisiting a great friend I had not seen in years. The Harry Potter audiobooks, narrated by Jim Dale, are fantastic as well.
 I wanted to emphasize what other reviewers have said about the "chest."  It is very poorly made.  I saw this set in Borders (thankfully I hadn't bought it).  The chest really is flimsy, folded cardboard that won't hold up to being handled much, or to holding the heavy books enclosed in it.  I lifted the set in the store and the chest seams bowed open!  The picture on Amazon is much better than real life.  I'm not expecting wood, but this could have been made of hardened, bonded leather.  If you just want a set of HP hardcover books, this might be worth it but I'd check the individual hardcover prices to be sure you're getting the best deal.<br/><br/>The books, of course, are phenomenal.
 Good book, unexpected ending. Didn't care for the final chapter, seemed more like an afterthought as to " how am I going to end this series"
 Best book ever totally worth to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:-) :-) amazing bet you you will love it? Wonderful book to read read
 All of the books come inside a plastic package. The books are the original ones that came out when they were first publish. It is true, the box feels very cheap but it does the job for me. I found it a really good boxed set when talking about the price and quality
 The book is wonderful.  My daughter has finished it and I've just begun to read it.  Thanks
 JO! I love this, as much as if not even more than the first.  So beautiful.  I said it with the first release and I'll say it now, please illustrate the entire series.  Please?  I'll find room on my shelf somewhere amongst my other harry potter collections.... ;)
 Wonderful , what a great conclusion to this fun fun series. Was on the edge of my seat all the time, great great GREAT nove....
 Beautifull book set, hardcover, magnificent ilustrations,I recomend it to readers of all ages, It is a comtemporary master piece of literature, Ms. J. K. Rowling its the true wizard behind the Harry Potter saga!!!!
 The book is well written and original. It catches the reader's attention and holds it throughout. I would, however, advise parents to read it prior to allowing their children to read this book. Some scenes may be disturbing to some children.
 I just realized that I haven't reviewed this book yet.<br/><br/>Without reading one other review, I know that there are people who will sum this book up much better than I.<br/>But I will say this.<br/>I was at the book release in Oak Park for book 7, hosted by Mugglenet.  The looks on the faces of the kids reflected my own, in their hopes for how it might end.<br/>We all had amazing expectations.<br/>J.K. Rowling's writing somehow exceeded our unworldly dreams.<br/>Book 7 contains a few surprises that I won't spoil here.  I will, however, repeat my favorite thing about J.K.'s writing; previous things that seemed unimportant become important.  The complex relationship between the three main characters is rewarded in all of the best ways.<br/>There is one scene that makes me weep every time I read it, for its bravery.<br/>There are quotes that you will use as wise touchstones for your life.<br/>You'll be moved by sorrow, reminded of real life evil, and never want to put down the book.<br/>There is humility, love, nobility, sacrifice, humor, and joy.<br/><br/>I'm a writer.  I hate most fiction, because I keep thinking: I could write this better.<br/>J.K. Rowling had a lot to live up to when she created characters that I fell in love with.<br/>She honors them with this book.
 Came in very fast with Amazon's same day shipping. For the price, it is a heck of a deal. The only issue I found was that book 7 had a small tear at the top of the binding, but that could be just me being nit picky. Over all its a great buy. I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for the Harry Potter set!
 Getting the books all in one set...AWESOME!  But the box...wow.  Totally cheap cardboard.  I'm so disappointed because a set of books like these really deserves a great box to keep them in.  So, of course, keeping the books...but the box is going in the trash.
 I wasn't disappointed at all.<br/>Alot of questions were answered<br/>a great ending to the series.
 I ordered the audio collection to give as a gift. My only disappointment was that the collection was simply the 7 books shrink-wrapped together. I had hoped that the collection would be housed in some sort of presentation case.
 The case and books came very timely. And were in great condition. My only concern is that the box they are delivered in said "Harry Potter 1-7" in huge letters. With work there was no way for me to always be home in time for the mail. So my gift was spoiled and I ended up giving it a week early. If this is a gift and the recipient lives with you, be cautious. I also read other reviews that said the chest they come in isn't sturdy, but I found that it is actually really nice. It's a tougher cardboard material but will seem to hold up nicely for years to come if taken care of.
 I love reading these books to my grand children. However, the box is not worthy of the books and what not it holds.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an excellent finish to a wonderful series. I started reading HP when I was 14 and the last 10 years have been quite the commitment. It is sad to see an end to such a great story but there is always re-reading!
 This is probably my favorite book in the series, even though I cried through half of it. It starts with a bang and just keeps going. It wraps everything up very neatly. Just make sure to have lots of Kleenex handy.
 One of the best in the series.. One of the stories you cannot put down a Fed must read for everyone
 Amazing series
 I am not a regular novel reader, but I was entranced by the writings of J K Rowling. I simply could not put them down. One after another, I read constantly for about a month until I finished the 6th book.
 Great books.  Only negative the back pages of my Chamber of secrets books were ripped as if the cutting was off.
 My 9 year old grandson is enjoying this book after reading book 1 in just a few weeks. He is hooked on the series. Fact is I alread ordered book 3 and have it waiting for when he finishes the second.
 these books are imaginative, creative, and really wake one's powers of entering another world. the books are excellent for children and adults alike and will keep you guessing all the way through the series!
 Seriously, if you've come this far (as a reader), go ahead and get the book. It doesn't disappoint.
 I WAS SO VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BOOKS I BOUGHT FOR MY SON..HE WILL TREASURE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES WE PURCHASED FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE..THE DELIVERY WAS PROMPT &amp; THE BOOKS WERE IN PERFECT CONDITION..I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AMAZON HAS TO OFFER I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS &amp; FAMILY..THANK YOU FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING SERVICE &amp; ALL THE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS YOU HAVE TO OFFER..I WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE..
 I love listening to the Harry Potter CD's. The quality of the used set that I purchased exceeded my expectations.
 Pretty sure everyone knows who Harry Potter is by now.  This is the complete series in one.  So glad I spent the money on it!
 My favorite book series - I grew up on Harry Potter. I purchased this paperback as a gift for my nephew whom is now old enough to read books of this level. Books are the best gifts!<br/><br/>Quality of paperback was good and the usual - nothing shocking here.
 The books are in very good condition. The description described them just as they were. The bindings had a tiny bit of wear and the book cover had a bit of scuffing but what is a book and its cover without a little wear and tear? The cover did its job and endured the scratches to protect the books which really matter. I am very satisfied with my purchase; this was a gift for a friend. Thankyou very, very much. =)
 Excellent value.  This is not a special edition collectors set or anything, it's just all 7 books packed together in a sturdy cardboard box.  I think $56 for the entire book series is a great deal.
 I used to hate Harry. Partly because I was too young and partly because I misunderstood it. I took a liking to it and bought this trunk and fell in love with the world. I cannot tell you how much I used to hate reading. Now, I love it. Great books and great product. If you don't have the books, this is just what you need. The hardcovers are so much better for both quality and durability. GREAT books.
 I will highly recumend anybody to read the Harry Potter Books.  There is so much more in these books then the movies show.  They are very easy to read and keep you looking for more.
 Shipping was quick, price was great and book was as described.  My daughter was really unhappy that she had a summer reading assignment but she was very happy with her Harry Potter book.  It was such a good story, she almost forgot she was doing an assignment.
 My daughter is away at college and my younger daughter has custody of our Harry Potter collection. So, for her birthday my older daughter toot her own collection. She was thrilled. The 'trunk' it came in was great, too.
 Reading the book was awesome. Hearing Jim Dale "read" the book is the closest thing to being there.
 I ordered the complete book set and the full DVD collection together. Both received in brand new condition. Classic childhood memories that I still enjoy even as an adult. Would recommend to every HP fan and to those who have never read or seen before!
 I loved this book.....it was a very fast read and kept you on your toes.  I love how it tied all 6 previous books together and showed you exactly why the characters had the roles they did.  I loved the Epilogue.....(...)  GREAT book!!!!!!  JKR is one of the best writers I have ever read...Thank you!!
 This is a beautiful set. The dustcovers look and feel amazing. Very high quality construction. I bought this as a gift for my wife and her eyes filled with tears once she opened the box and saw the books. I am very happy with these fine books. Would recommend as a gift for any reader or a must have for any book collecter.
 Love these books. Ordered the paperback set for my children. However the cardboard bookcase that the books arrived in was badly damaged. As was the spine of two of the books. This is the first time something I ordered from Amazon arrived damaged. Thus the low rating.
 I used this product as a guest book for my daughter's baby shower and had all of the guests sign it so that in later years when my grandson grows up and gets into reading he can see how many people truly love him and enjoy a wonderful world of adventure.
 Packaging is so cute, and I love the box it comes in. The books are all in wonderful shape and it comes with stickers too! I got this for Christmas in 2011 and the books are still in wonderful shape. I would recommend this to any Harry Potter lover.
 The Harry Potter books, 1 through 7, in the boxed set are a lot of fun, especially since the box looks like Harry's scool trunk.
 EXCELLENT OVERALL!  The only disappointment was the TRUNK is actually just cardboard.  So, they're charging all of this extra $ for a "cardboard" storage box.  Great though!
 Personally, I don't like the illustration on the covers and box; I would have liked Mary GrandPre's original work. It is nice to have the full boxed set, and having them paperback cuts costs down. The books themselves are phenomenal. By far my favorite book series ever.
 The book arrived in a timely manner (Faster then Expected). And they were in great  condition. Would purchase product from this seller again.
 my sister tried to get me to read these before i even started the movies, but of course i didn't.. but now that the last movie is set to come out soon, i read them all in about a week and they were great!!!
 Love it
 This is a great book and J.K. Rowling really outdid herself.  I wish it wasn't over but I guess all great things have to come to an end.
 I enjoyed all the previous Harry Potter books.  Kind of disappointed the series is ending.  This book ties up the series well.  I have always had good luck purchasing books from Amazon.com  They always arrive by stated date, and have always been in good condition.
 This was a gift for my our son. Everything went well. It came on time and it was not damaged
 Same great book, different cover, smaller margins, no pictures.  Sigh.  Hoped for something more, but I should have known better.
 what's not to like about harry potter. saw all the movies, but never read the books.now, i am reading. hollywood changs so many things sometimes, you don't recognize the book when they are done with it.  we will see if they are true here to the book .
 The books are fantastic!  The packaging is so great.  The box is sturdier than you think (though it is not wooden or anything)..I can pick it up with the strings on the side and carry it just fine.  Love the stickers.  All is great!
 J.K. is such a fantastic writer! I read books 1-6 in about 3 weeks. I just couldn't put any of these down for long. I'm eagerly awaiting the final book!
 My son had these already in paperback. But after reading them over and over some of the pages were coming loose. He really was surpised when I got these for him. The hardcovers and their storage box should last for his children to enjoy.
 The books are amazing very nice hardcovers and all that you would expect from this set and for this price.<br/><br/>The box is pretty tacky, its just cheap cardboard, I live in Australia and mine arrived torn on the front corner. I cant even be bothered sending it back to Amazon because it will most likely just happen again in transit. This set would have been 100% amazing if the box was a wooden box as it appears to be.<br/><br/>Still very happy to have a nice set of this series in hardcover but the box is far from what you might expect to see when you open your parcel.
 So i have a list of complaints.<br/>1. i received my books 2 weeks after i ordered them<br/>2. when i recieved the books, it was not what i ordered.<br/>3. two books were missing their coveres.<br/>4. one book was not even the right copy that i ordered.<br/>5. i ordered books 1-6 and recieved books 1,2,3,4,5,7<br/><br/>Im extremely irratated with this
 JK Rowling did an outstanding job ending the series.  There is a great deal in the book that will never make it to the screen.  Whether you're reading the book or listening to Jim Dale read it, you can't go wrong.
 Bought this to listen to on a road trip.....awesome reading. This was totally understandable and I got all involved with the story. I've not read the books but I've seen the movie. This was excellent to have as a companion to driving.
 Loved it
 Excellent condition!
 I was caught up in the story line, and was very happy with the way it ended.  Any ohter way and I would have been very upset.  I love the series and wish it was contining.
 We purchased this set of Harry Potter books for my nephews to read while on summer vacation.  They absolutely loved it!
 3rd time rereading the HP series.  Still exciting and the feels still hit the same spots.<br/>May I suggest a comic book or tv series?  How about a 3D animated series, where each chapter is a fully transcribed episode?<br/><br/>A worldwide classic this is.
 Seen the movie countless times and love it. The book ads so many more layers and complexities - you forget you saw the movie.
 This is a great price for a really nice set of hardcover books. It looks great and will last a long time with good care.
 My item came in own time adequately wrapped. Also, the item was as advertised, except the book I purchased didn't have a dust jacket. Overall, I was glad that I purchased from this seller.
 My 10 year old grandson  is a avid reader and has never watched the movies. He jumped right into reading these books the day he received them.  Has not put them down since.  Great price on Amazon and quick delivery.  A win for all.
 ended the storyline with a feeling that everything can be right with the world.<br/><br/> the evil are vanquished.<br/><br/> the good go on to better things.
 I could say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a good book but that would be the understatement of the year.  This book is lifelike and imaginative.  I love how it fits in with the rest of the series.  If you like reading Harry Potter books, then I recommend this book.
 I bought this as a gift for my sister. She has been wanting this item for years now, and got it here on Amazon for an awesome price!! Since she opened it, I have not seen her without a HP book. hahah!! Great product for a gift, and awesome edition for Harry Potter fans!!
 The price is attractive and all the six books are there. Nothing to lose for a reader. However, if you want to keep these books as collections, you'd better buy hardcover ones. Some of the books are so thick and pages are small, thus the spine of the book can be easily damaged during the reading.
 I'm a huge HP fan, so you should know that from the start. However, the way JK Rowling ties up the loose ends of her seven-book world in this novel is perfection. As a lifelong fan, I was highly satisfied with the way the series ended. I am part of the HP generation.
 These books are beautiful. Seriously!!! I cannot stop staring at them. Part of me didn't even want to read them because they were so beautiful. Even the feel of the book is great. The story itself doesn't need a review because I doubt I could do it justice.
 It's Harry Potter. It's awesome. There didn't seem to be quite as many pictures in this version as  there was in the first, but I imagine it's due to the book potentially being longer for text? I'm not sure but just a guess. Love reading these to my kids.
 I only recently decided to finally read the series. I loved it and was sad when it was over, and plan to read it again. That makes it a rare series. The books actually got better and better as they went on, which is rare. I really do love these books!
 The paper is not great, but the covers are sturdier than I expected. I was not looking for archival/heirloom quality, but something that didn't fall apart halfway through the first reading. These seem to be very good quality for the price, and well packaged.
 Did not receive all the books. They were not a complete set.
 This book had such an epic ending to such an epic book series that stimulated my reading and imagination like it hadn't been stimulated since CS Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia I had read when I was of elementary school age. The book is way better than the movie. I highly advise that you read it before you see the movie if you haven't already.
 Its Harry Potter how can you not love it? also loved this price compared to others, it was even cheaper than the Ebook edition which is rare. I also love the little box the books are in, it makes it easier to store and prevent the books from getting damaged.
 We'll. First off. They're books so as long as it has words on paper they're legit. Has many folds/creases in the pages and some lines barely have ink on them. Even the edges or sides have clearly visible creases on them.was cheap, got what I wanted but not quality whatsoever. If you want these books as a set for collecting and want to show off, might want to spend a little more.
 I wanted the entire set of Harry Potter Books.  I don't usually collect sets of books.  I really like the stories of Harry Potter and will buy more if He surfaces in more stories in the future.
 When I started reading Harry Potter books was when one of my best friends recommended reading the first one,I was 9 at a sleepover and started to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone,I was a little doubtful at first for I was not very into magic and things like that.But when I read the first couple pages I was immediately sucked into the miserable word of Harry Potter with his miserable aunt and uncle. When I finished reading all the Harry Potter series I realized how inspiring they were to me.Thank you for such an amazing read!
 This book was wonderful! I hate that I didn't start this series sooner, but I was able to read all the books in one year rather than waiting in between so that is a plus. This was a wonderful ending to a fantastic series! Now I have to watch the movies!
 When I first received my order, it was a cheaply-made copy with thin pages.  Found out later that it was a "library binding".  Looking at the title on the webpage, it was the default edition.  Amazon had a very helpful customer service rep.  He helped me get it all sorted out, told me how to return it for a refund and place a reorder for the regular edition.  Be careful if you order online without a person to guide you, or take careful notice of what edition you are ordering.  The replacement was received promptly, and it was the high-quality, well-bound edition with thick pages that I was expecting.  The story needs no review.  This book was to replace one we'd gotten at first release, loaned to a friend and never got back; so we'd read it before and knew it was worth getting again.  The same for book #7.  I cancelled my order for the library edition before it was shipped and reordered the standard edition.
 Great read.
 Jim Dale does a miraculous job reading these books!  His ability to change his voice for each character makes it that much more realistic.  I will be listening and reading these stories for years to come!
 I bought this set for my 8 year-old grandson and he loved it. He already read the 1st book and is now a big Harry Potter fan.  I believe in encouraging reading in kids so I try to find interesting books for my grandchildren.  This was a perfect choice.
 This set is beautifully packaged. I was happily surprised with the quality of the chest. Based on previous reviews I was expecting a flimsy cardboard box. However, everything was well made and my daughter loves having all seven books in hardcover format.
 Rowling did wonderful things when she concluded the series with this book.  She threw a lot of "holy cows" with a lot of the events and tied together many of the things that were left unanswered in previous books.
 I'm currently re-reading this book since I bought this edition with pictures.  (My original hardcover was ruined by a water leak).  One thing I can say is it takes longer to read when you spend time looking at the artwork and have a much larger book to handle.
 Die Hard Harry Potter Fan. Amazon always delivers on time everytime a book is released. Best place to purchase books from and again JK Rowling never disappoints. I know this review is long overdue I got this when it was released however reviewing it now.
 Perfect. Jim Dale makes you feel like you're watching tv. I wish it would come with a digital download but having the hard copies has worked out fine so far. Packaging is a cheap though. I've been looking for something to put my audiobooks in that can display the beautiful cover art but also remain sturdy.
 Great illustrations, these are wonderful. I'm buying them for story time for my future children. Plus, I just love seeing the artist renditions of the story. So much more accurate than the movies. Great present for any person, whether you are a fan already or not!
 What a great book. I gave this to my sister as a Christmas gift this year, but couldn't help thumb through it. The pictures are fun and would add a great feel to reading the story. I will probably borrow it back from her to check out the illustrations and re-read the book!
 The illustrated version makes it interesting for younger children who aren't reading on a higher level themselves yet. Great way to spend time with your children when the weather outside isn't good enough to go out and play or spending time before bed.
 I loved each of the first 4 books, it took me 5 days to read thru the series the 1st time, and am eagerly awaiting the 5th.  I couldn't put them down!!!
 Wish it hadn't ended at all, but I loved the whole series and think that J. K. Rowlands did an excellent job with the suspense and mystery of it all, right up to the end.  Harry Potter RULES!
 The last installemnt keeps the tradition of a well-written story that keeps the reader engrossed to the end. Well done!
 Finished up the serise nicelly.<br/>Only issuse i have is shoty work manship on the book binding
 It was pretty good book.  I didn't like the ending showing them 19 years in the future.  I thought that could have been done differently.  Other than that, pretty good book.
 My grandson is reading the Harry Potter series, I was missing book 2,(borrow, missing in action) he didn't want to read book 3, I order the book to complete my colletion. He is happy now.
 Truly amazing read
 bought these as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It makes a pretty-looking set as a gift, arrived safely, nothing bent...perfect. She will  love them as I did. She has a Kindle, but some books you just have to "HAVE", and Harry Potter series is a prime example.
 I loved this book series growing up, and now my 9 year old is in to it! He loves it so much that he has an owl with a similar name to Hedwig we call his Hedgewig just so shes a bit unique. We are also collecting the library books that go with the series.
 Our 13 year old grand daughter requested the complete Harry Potter series in hardback edition. She reads them over and over and paperbacks were not holding up. The joy on her face was priceless. The sturdy cardboard trunk which contains all the books had rope type handles and a special place on the top for writing the childs name and address. Her parents were pleased. It seemed expensive but when it's the perfect gift there only needs to be one. We hit a homerun.
 We needed something to listen to for the whole family on a long trip ti Idaho- this was perfect.  Love how J.K. Rowling made a series that even adults enjoy.  I especially love her sense of humor.
 Books were fine, and the Grand Son should love them... Would have given a 5 star, but the box they came with is cheaply made and won't hold up to the weight of the book set... Will make a new box in the spring... Still all in all a great gift...
 We just love these books, and anyone with kids knows how hard it can be to get them to keep stuff where it belongs. Having the cool box to go with these is a huge help and my son things it's great!
 Turned out to be a really great book! It was in perfect condition just like the description said it would be.
 Great story, and the book will withstand the abuse my 10 year old gives books.  Way more affordable than the hard cover version!
 My daug hr er left her cherished bharry potter books outside and was de c a stated when they got ruined in oregon rin as she read them every morning with her cofee. I got this to surprise her. She lov e d it and it looked really nice, well packaged etc.
 I suppose I should always read the fine print but this was a gift for my son who keeps things in perfect condition.  I did not see until I received the order that there is no trunk and although they are in good condition there are two jackets missing. :(
 My Grand Daughter Loves to read and she has not put the books down since they have a arrived. Reading is a forgotten tool for learning these days but the way I see it a child that reads is a child with a great future. Thank you
 I received the product in a very good condition, almost like new and before the date expected. I'm very happy with this purchase and I plan to buy from them again in the future.
 We just love it!
 I have always hated ebooks. I mean on every level that get on my nerves and I never use them. Harry Potter has actually been with me ever since I was a little kid, and I thought I hadn't read them in awhile, and I had lost my books over the years so why not? I read all the books in like 2 weeks. It was so easy to carry around, and it always kept my place l. I didn't have a lot of space taken up in my bags, and when I finished on, boom next one was ready, and I can read them repeatedly now. It's even got me buying other books, and revealing in how easy it is. I have read 10 books this month, I haven't enjoyed myself like this in awhile.
 If you're expecting a big, heavy, real wood case, this isn't for you. I on the other hand, love it. I've been wanting to rebuy all the books (I have a mixture of hard and paper back...plus they were falling apart from reading them so much). This is a nice way to get all the books in hardcover, plus get a little something extra. If you're not a GIGANTIC fan, then this probably isn't for you.
 Purchased this as a Christmas gift for grandson - He loves it. The box configured as a chest was an added bonus to the books. Totally satisfied.
 J.K. Rowling is at her best in this book! She balances a magical world with situations that hit really close to home. An unforgettable ending to an epic tale!
 Having sworn to never read the Harry Potter books, and then giving in after the third movie, I find them to be excellent, this one being one of the better ones.
 The saga of Harry Potter and his friends comes to an end as all those who have followed him know. This series turned a generation of young people back to reading books for fun. Thanks for the trip.
 Received my copy yesterday, and It's beautifully illustrated!!! I greatly missed the anticipation of new harry potter books to come out, once the series ended, and with these new illustrated versions I get to feel a little bit of that excitement again!
 Excellent
 I have now purchased three sets of Harry Potter books and have two more on the horizon.  One for me, of course, but the others to give to young readers I know.  They arrive well boxed and as promised.
 This product was everything that Amazon said it was.  Amazon did a wonderful job listing this set.  I would definetly suggest this product to anyone that is interested in getting the Harry Potter set.
 A lot of reviews on here complain about the cardboard box, but I didn't buy this set expecting it to be a super nice collector's item; I bought it to get the entire series in one shot and in their less-hefty paperback form. And they are fantastic! All 7 Harry Potter books plus a box to store them in for $50 is a fantastic deal, and I highly recommend, unless you are looking for a collector's set.
 I haven't even cracked these open to read them yet. I bought them for the beautiful cover art and the new book smell. They're sitting on my shelf still in pristine condition. I have two other Harry Potter sets.
 All I can say is that I was actually sad when I got to the end, not b/c the story was sad, but because that's the end of Harry Potter.  Almost definitely the best book in the series and that's saying a lot.
 Purchased this for my niece so she could finally read this series now that she's older. It's a really great box set and it's nice to be able to give her a piece of my childhood while she's going through hers. It's nice to be able to pass the magic on.
 I bought this gift set for my pre-teen sister in-law who is a big fan of the series...and she hasn't put them down yet! This is a great gift for a young avid reader!
 This set allowed me to read all the books in order at my own pace. I had started reading this story using the library, but when I went to get the next book it was never in. This purchase fixed that problem.
 Rowling continues to prove that she is one of the greats.  This book is my favorite of the series.  It is action-packed, with an excellent writing style and much attention to detail.
 Recently I received my Harry Potter Paperback Box Set, and I have to say that it's awesome.  I searched for them in my home town, I'm from Guatemala, and they don't sell it, so my box set it's pretty much unique in here.  The box has great pictures and also the books, about the story I can't made to much comments because I'm still reading but I saw all the movies and the books are even better.
 Also the "sturdy" handles, are small pieces of string that go into the cardboard box.  Save yourself some money, and buy the books without this garbage.
 These books are some of my all time favorites! I just ordered this set cause it's been a couple years since I read any of them and I am so excited to dive back into Hogwarts and see all my old friends and re-live all the magic. The Harry Potter series was the first book series I read to completion and to be completely honest, as much as I love reading, there are few books I pick up very many times after reading for the first time. This series is the exception. In fact, I may even go as far as saying that it just gets better with every read. Thank god for two day shipping!
 Perfectly Perfect in every way!!!! (The seventh book in the series, don't read if you haven't read the first six)
 Our family loves these books.  Our son is currently devouring the series.  I am ready to reread them.  Great series.
 i love harry potter! Even more now that I read the books. lol I wish the series could go on forever! I am trying to become a write and reading about how to do so and I think J.K. Rowling is an amazing writer! BUY THIS!
 Even thought the box is made of cardboard.  It is very sturdy cardboard and will preserve the collection nicely.  I loved Harry Potter.  And am now passisng the tradition on to my grandson.  Great Keepsake after reading ....
 This is a great series of books.  O have read them over a few times.  I enjoy it every time.  The box set is perfect for any fan of the books.  The artwork on the books and the box is very well done.  It is one of my favorite impressions of the story.
 All reviews on here are mixed together.  The hard cover box set is in a crappy cardboard box, but the soft backs are packed real well... the books are awsome that goes without saying.
 I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it. And she's 7 years old. She's reading through the whole series again and I just love the fact that I could give her these great stories that I know she will always cherish.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was a wonderful story &amp; a really satisfying ending to the Harry Potter series! I loved it!
 Got this as a gift for the wife. She is a big Harry Potter fan. It can in neat box shaped as a chest and was in great condition. Nice for the collector and Harry fans. At the cost per book it was a good value. I would recommend the item and dealer. by SA
 good condition but didn't come with dust jacket like shown in picture, so I was disappointed since it didn't match the rest of my set.
 Love the whole series!
 I know it's second hand but maybe they should have posted that every book has Aunt Jan's in huge letters along the book.  I'm not upset I'm still happy with the purchase because I love books and I love Harry Potter it just would have been nice to know before hand.
 Great product, but I expected a hardcover book, but a paperback. I do not believe it was in the description.  But, good overall.
 This box set makes a great gift for all Harry Potter fans. Comes in a nice box to keep the books together for many years.
 When we moved I stupidly got rid of most of my books not thinking about the fact that I read these at least twice a year. It's awesome to have them back!
 . . . for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it! The package arrived exactly as it should and it was what it should be. There are not any defects. All in all, a good transaction and I would recommend this set!
 I have had these cds for a few weeks now, and I absolutely love them! I listen to them to and from work, or when I'm stuck in traffic.  I just finished a book when traveling for vacation the other week.  It made the drive go by so much quicker.  The guy does such wonderful voices!  You get as lost in the series while listening as you do when you read it yourself.  I would highly recommend for all those die-hard fans. :D
 I was able to get this wonderful box set during a gold deal for under $27. I love the illustrations for this new box set and I cannot wait to experience Harry Potter all over again.
 Why wouldn't it be good
 What else can be said about the HP series.  Search "reasons J.K. Rowling is a genius" to see all the reasons explained better than I can.  I haven't actually finished this one yet, because I'm dreading getting to the point where  SPOILER ALERT] dies..  :(
 I enjoyed the "Treasure Chest" of books. The books are good quality and the print is easy to read over extended periods. It was nice to sit down and read this fine collection without any pause from story to story.
 Delivery – great<br/>The book was wonderful as I expected, and I really enjoyed it.<br/>I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.<br/>What more do you need?<br/>I recommended it to my friends.
 My copy just cam in today and Jim Kay does not disappoint!!! I have the philosopher's stone and am very excited to add book number two. The artwork is phenomenal and it brings the story to life in a whole new way. A must have especially for a collector or someone with children!
 Looked forward for Book 7 but I didn't like the story line. There were killings more than usual. Well, I don't like the story doesn't mean that you won't like it. The quality of the book were good. If you are a Potter fan, buy it.
 What a fun read!  While I consider myself an adult in chronological terms I could read these "kids" books over and over.  What better way than to have an inexpensive set available at all times.
 This is a very good book. It js very intresring. I grew up on rhe happy potter seriers :-). Yea
 Love these books the third time through.  Had to replace the set I gave my mother.  Gotta finish reading before the final book comes out in July.
 Its wonderful to finally get some answers and figure out who Snape really is and why he was such a conflicted character.  The whole story was packed with adventure and intrigue.  I love the whole series (and I'm a grandmother, not a kid!).
 I'm disappointed!  I'm a 50 year old woman and I thought books one and two were wonderful!  I couldn't put them down, in fact I stayed up most of the night to read them when they were released.  From that point on things became dark, then darker.  Book 4 was weird and depressing.  Book 5 and 6 were OK but not something I thought my preteen grandchildren should read.  Then book 7 . . . all the hype and the build up and instead of having a hard time putting it down, I had a hard time sitting there reading it.  For most of the book, it was boring.  The last 200 pages were good, and they held my interest.  I liked the way the book ended and felt a sense of closure to the series.  Overall however in review, the whole series doesn't live up to the quality of the first two books. As some reviewers have stated I believe Rowling must have had ghost writers after the first two books.  Some people will forever be fans, but I leave with a sense of disappointment that this will not be a series I can sit and read to my grandchildren.  If they read it (or see the movies) they will need to be much older since it now is on the edge of a nicely ending horror story.
 I really like all the audio books for this series. Having read all the books I sometimes like to listen to them in the car or while relaxing. Jim Dale does a fantastic job. Highly entertaining.
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and I've read and listened to this book many times.  I bought this audiobook to replace the cassettes I've had for years.  I knew I was ordering a used version and the CDs were OK, but the box was in bad shape and I think it was advertised as VeryGood.
 These did not come with a box to hold them as depicted in the picture
 I bought this last month, and it arrived in Brazil in a great condition and faster than I thought. I didn't pay any importation taxes, and this was great. The books are beautiful and very different compared to the Brazilian version. Though the pages and the covers seem to be fragile, I think it will last all my life if I take care of them. Anyway, I recommend this box to all the fans, in special brazilian fans, that want to have the Harry Potter books in English! Thanks Amazon!!!
 I have all of the print books, but this makes it easier to take my favorite series with me wherever I go!  I'm very happy that I made this purchase and would encourage other fans of the HP series to do the same.  This is a great buy for my Kindle because there are no big breaks between books.  It transitions seamlessly to the next book so I never have to leave the magic.
 This red leather US edition is far superior to our UK deluxe edition (I have both - as an avid Potter collector!) and very reasonably priced.<br/><br/>(I WAS a little disappointed with the clear dust cover however, as, although purchased brand new from Amazon, it had a lot of scuff marks which detracted from the overall excellent quality of the book).<br/><br/>It has a lovely pull out frameable small picture at the back and is beautifully gilded.<br/>A super collector's item and a great investment!
 I bought this book because it was reduced in price, 65% off I think.  I have no intention of actually reading this book as I already have the original.  However the artwork in this book is stunning!
 Love the books, so I had to buy this all together case. It's sturdy and the books are in great quality. Couldn't be happier to have the set again, first time in years after some got lost or misplaced. Definitely a good deal as well, the cheapest I have found. Worth it for sure!
 The Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7 was priced fairly and the items came in a timely manner and were exactly as advertised.  We enjoyed the look of the box set and will display it in our library.
 We have all these in hard back but it is easier reading the paperbacks and to get them all for this price they would be great for anyones collection as they are going to be classics
 HUGE Harry Potter fans here. This book is GORGEOUS.  The drawings bring so much to the book and makes it magic all over again.  A definite buy for any HP fan!
 For everybody complaining of the case the books presented in.  What did you expect for the price.  You are getting 7 books for $50.  comes out to $7.14 per book.  For that price you cant expect any different kind of case.  There are other  Harry Potter book sets that cost more, which come with special book covers and a different case.  But as I stated, they are more money.  That is the "Special Collectors Edition".  Not this one.<br/><br/>This set is what I expected and what I payed for.  Its is basically just a reduced price for all 7 books.
 My wife is huge fan of the books, she loves them. I was hugely disappointed by the quality of the packaging/case it came with. It's just cheap flimsy cardboard. I feel bad dinging it one star because apparently the books are supremely awesome.
 i just got them loaded to the computer for my phone so im not sure yet ill use them this coming month while i drive .
 This set of Harry Potter books is reasonably priced, probably the best deal you will find.  I priced them out everywhere and found Amazon to be the best priced.  I bought this set to have for my 'future' kids.
 I purchased this item as a gift, but I have already read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it.
 I purchased this set as a Christmas gift. My husband expressed interest in reading the Harry Potter series but purchasing the books separately, especially in hard cover, was more than I wanted to spend on this particular gift. The product arrived in great shape and was easy to wrap as a single gift. So glad I found this deal!
 Even though what I received was two paperback books and what I ordered was two AUDIO books, I am still giving this review 4 stars, and here is why:<br/>First off, I was very excited to listen to these "books on tape", as I have never done that before; I much prefer to read a book in hand.  I've heard good things, however, and will soon be traveling, so I was excited at the prospect.  I was very disappointed to open my package and find paperback books (at audio prices) and the cynic in me expected to be out of luck.<br/>However, within short hours of sending my email, I got a reply from the company, expressing their apologies, explaining that they are out of stock of what I ordered, and that I am free to keep the books or donate them as I see fit.  My account was credited the money spent IMMEDIATELY and no further problems arose.<br/>If you ask me, in an age when we can do everything online, we get snotty and expect more than we should.  Mistakes happen, I am okay with that, just fix it - and this company did, right away.  Much more than I expected and shame on me for that.  Good for them, would order from them again.
 I'm reading book 7 of this set.  The stories are obviously fabulous (so much more compete than the movies, obviously...but just as, if not more enjoyable).  The books themselves were used but came in great condition.  Happy with this purchase.
 This is horrible! I am reading the book I go to the next page and nothing makes sense. I then realize my book is missing about 50 pages. I flip through to see if they are out of order and nope they are gone! And pages 125-175 are duplicated. I need someone to send me a new book by tomorrow! I will be making calls this is completely idiotic. I mean it’s 2018!
 The books were in excellent condition, just as described.  You could hardly tell that they were used.  The description made it clear that the box was no included--no surprises.  The order arrived as scheduled.
 Once again, Ms Roland did an excellent job. it was a great book, and too bad it is the finally of the Harry Potter series.
 I cannot say enough good things about this series. The books came out when I was a kid, and I learned to read with them. I owe my childhood to JK Rowling. As for the physical quality of the books, the case is sturdy and the bindings are solid. These will definitely hold up to heavy use!
 All 7 books are there, with links to each book at the very beginning, links to each chapter within books, and everything accessible from the Go To function. And it has every appearance of being legitimate (with a great price - perhaps introductory? - it was a question in the back of my mind).<br/><br/>The purchase was handled entirely within the Amazon website. I have not purchased any of the separate ebooks, and had read somewhere that those purchases went through the Pottermore website. I don't know whether that is currently the case or not, but it was not necessary for this complete collection.<br/><br/>I assume that the books themselves need no review. I have read through the series at least twice, and enjoyed them, though I may have a few quibbles with some of the plots. But I see no reason for the quibbles or the format of this collection to require a rating less than 5 stars. Enjoy!
 This series only gets better with age. I read them as they were released in my younger years and fell in love. I've reread them more times then I can count. Reading them as an adult has given me a whole new prospective and a great reverence for J. K. Rowling. Her deep seated ability to write in a way that captures and recaptures her audience is incredible. If you've never read the books, or if you've only read them once...you are simply missing out.
 Best book of the series. Read the entire thing in 2 days after it arrived. Have read it 5 times since.
 I purchased this collection for my Kindle.  I have the full hard-cover set, but am getting older and wanted to be able to read the books whenever and wherever in a font and lighting that is best for me.  I am not disappointed.  I also like the cover art for the individual books.
 This is the second of the Harry Potter books and I am more hooked  with every line. My favorite is reading the book and then watching the movie so I can note all of the differences!
 Great paper-back book set.  Some of the pages in the books are bent over, I think from being made and put into the box.  This doesn't bother me at all, but something to be aware of.
 Very pleased with the transaction and condition of the book.
 enjoy reading this book. Good reading and excellent characters. :<br/>I will recommend this book to people who like a great story.
 There are spelling mistakes and a very poor printing quality in places.By the time I found these it was too late to return the books(30 days is not enough for one book,let alone seven!).The publishers have been very unhelpful skirting responsibility or being downright rude(one e-mail was blatantly sarcastic!)and have done nothing for me.WHAT ABOUT YOU ,AMAZON,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?I have yet to bother trying to read the last 2 books.And to think,I was going to pass the set on to my grand daughter!
 This was my favorite Harry Potter book and one of the best books I have read.  I thought J. K. Rowling did a wonderful job with this series and I was left, if not a little saddened that the series had come to an end, with a feeling of fulfillment as I have not enjoyed from a book in years.
 Very easy read.  If you have seen the movies,  I would recommend reading the books first if you can.  Most of the movies go with the book for the most part.  I am going to go back and watch the movies again when I finish reading the books to see what if anything changes.  All around good read though.
 I have actually read these before but wanted a copy of them for myself so I can read and re-read as I wish. I really enjoy the fantasy of them and the entertainment they provide.
 THESE BOOKS ARE AMAZING!  I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM.  THE MOVIES PALE IN COMPARISON TO THEM.  A MUST READ, NO EXCEPTIONS!
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, enough said. Great book, amazing edition with the extensive artwork. Definitely pick this up!
 Love this series of books and what a great way to have them all.Great value as well.
 I grew up with these books and shall continue to love them forever! Each time I read one again, I gain something new that I missed before. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have a lot to teach us if we pay attention!
 The pictures are so wonderful and enhance the story so the younger reader will enjoy the experience!  I LOVE the Harry Potter books and am getting this for a grandson who is just getting into the story. He will love it and the stories.
 Simply amazing!
 Bought quite a few for my entire extended family.  All have been kept on the shelves since reading.  Have the entire collection.  Including a few of the encyclopedias and calendars.  At least they did not split the book, like the movie did.
 If you are looking only to have a complete set of hard cover books for the series, then this is the product for you..  IF, however, you were looking for something nice to keep your books in and put on display, then I would not waste my money here.  I bought this thinking it would be a nice box but when it arrived I was sorely disappointed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the "privacy lock" is no more than a cheap plastic latch.  The construction is very poor; the inner box doesn't even fit snugly in the outer box.  The outside of the box, again is poorly designed, at the very least they should have made the front where the "lock" is, presentable.  When looked at from the front you are looking at the corrugated edge of cardboard on either side instead of a nice smooth corner.  As for the sturdy handles, they are not even rope, seems more like yarn.  I sent this back the very next day after receiving it and asked for my money back.  I hope this review helps you and gives you a more clear idea of what you are buying.
 I've been wanting to buy this boxed edition for quite some time now and I'm so trilled that I finally did it ! I already had seen this box at the bookstore so I new the box itself was made of cardboard  material, so I wasn't disappointed at all when I received mine. I was more interested in the books inside of it. The box does gives the set a fun and nostalgic feel. Also the package came nicely packed and preserved just as the books inside.
 It was delivered was quickly, and the book looked brand new. It was a gift for my sister, another big Harry Potter fan. She loved it!<br/>Thank you!
 I've enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books and movies, and this is a fine ending to the series. These may have been intended as a children's series, but I know many adults who find the books enchanting.
 i felt obligated to read this one as i had read all the others when i was younger , and when i finally got around to it i was a little dissapointed. This series is great for the kids though.
 I don't understand how people thought this was supposed to be a wooden box.  It is a decorative slip case that houses all seven books.  I love it and wouldn't think of returning it.  It is definalty sturdy enough as a collective item.  People need to quit over reacting.
 A great series of books, only second behind the hobbit and the lord of the rings by my standards.
 I had always had the books as a kid but shared them with my siblings. When I moved out I wanted to get them all without breaking the bank. This is perfect. It looks great on the book shelf! Definitely Recommend!
 Love this product, it arrived earlier then expected. The item description is exactly what I received. Couldn't be happier &amp; will recommend Amazon to everyone I know!! Given as a gift for my son.... He loves it!!
 Jim Dale is a consummate actor. The many voices he invents for the characters bring Rowling's book alive. If you've read the books, listening to them adds a whole new experience of enjoyment. Great fun for a family road trip!
 I read reviews after I ordered this and I was really worried because lots of people said the books and/or the box they came in was damaged. The box it came in was great and there was no damage to it. The only "damage" was the bottom of the books on the spine, the paper was pulled back a little and ripped. But it's not too noticeable so I can manage. Overall, I'm really happy
 All of the Harry Potter books on CD read by Jim Dale are FANTASTIC.  I have enjoyed every one of them and are always sad when they end.
 The book was shipped and recieved in a very orderly fashion. I was a little surprised when I opened the package and found the British version of the book. I was unaware that I was purchasing the British text. I did not see anywhere that it was Clearly stated that it was not the American version. A little clarifying would be helpful. Thanks for the unintended addition to my collection though.
 The workmanship by the publisher is substandard. The hard cover immediately seperated at the spine on one volume. Not as good quality as if I purchased the books in a store.
 Oh my gosh!  What a roller coaster ride of emotions!  This has to be the best Harry Potter book of them all!  Have you ever felt such a roller coaster ride of emotions like this?  Excitement, fear, horror, confusion, happiness, sorrow, awe, resentment,and on and on .... so much to feel!  After 22 hours of reading my eyes hurt and I am exhausted... yet I don't want it to end.  I must read it all over again from the very beginning!  I so loved it all!  But so much loss.... so so sad.  But it was so perfect!  It all made such sense.  I wouldn't have had it any other way.  Way to scribe, JK Rowling.  Genius....pure genius!<br/>JMHO  //(*_*)\\
 I wanted to re-read the series and did not want to pay the $95 from the bookstore. Once I received the box set, I was impressed with the packaging and how the box set looked exactly like it did I'm the bookstore. Only $30 cheaper. I will definitely purchase from Amazon again.
 I love the boxed set of Harry Potter books which were delivered promptly and in excellent condition. The books are great.  I was a bit disappointed in the "chest" that they came in as it is cardboard and not real sturdy. The stickers that are supplied are easy to put on, but must be done very carefully to avoid air bubbles.  In short, since I would have bought the set without the "chest", I am very happy with my purchase.
 My wife wanted this. I dont like soft cover, but she asked specifically for it, for ease of use/on-the-go. Nice little set.
 These volumes will wrap you up and not release you till you are done!  Imaginative, creative, just astounding tales to transport you to the world of wizardry!  Characters and scenery were crafted so well, reminded me of Dickens.
 I bought this as a gift for a Latin scholar, who also happens to be a Harry Potter fan.  It turned out to be a good gift.<br/>It would also make a great gift for someone who is learning Latin--easily expand your vocabulary.
 I purchased this for my daughters 18th Birthday ~ she absolutely adores it!<br/>This was by FAR the cheapest price I could find for this set of books! It had to come from the UK to Australia, by expediated postage, and the postage/shipping &amp; handling was STILL way cheaper than anywhere else (including Australia)!  It arrived in a matter of DAYS!<br/>It is a VERY heavy box, and arrived in excellent condition, so I was most impressed!<br/>Thank you very much Amazon.  =)
 I've collected each book, one at a time. This was the hardest one to find in hard cover format, and affordable. I'm so glad I finally got to finish my collection, even if it was years after the book came out.
 Love the books, can't wait until my son (4) is old enough to read them too!!
 Binding is better looking then the regular book.  Illustrations are a great addition.  The dust jacket is amazing.  The book "cover" is an added bonus.  Definitely keeping this one in the Harry Potter trunk.
 I have the DVD of the movie but it is so dark that many time I couldn't figure what was going on. There is a great deal of difference between the book and the movie but the book helped make sense of the dark portions of the movie.
 When it arrived we were amazed at the quality and the beauty of the books and packaging.,My daughter is 26 and a school teacher,she thought it was fantastic and loving every page she reads.Also its a masterpiece in the home as the chest is beautiful.She has it on display.Harry Potter fans looking for a beautiful gift set you cant go past this one.
 My son already finished the entire series when he was 9 or 10 but he's wanted to have them for his collection, so he was very happy to get them. One of the books did not have a jacket, but that was okay. Also there was no case as shown in picture.
 I bought this for my fiancee's sisters, but ended up reading it on the plane to see what all the fuss was about. I was totally blown away with the creativity and intelligence of this book - I can't wait for the movie!
 My 11-yr-old loves the series.  She started reading the series when the summer break started and she is on her last book (7).  Although this copy is used, it is in very good condition considering the price price.  Thanks,
 Book 2 of 7. Who among people who would buy this at all, don't like it?<br/>Book 2 is my least favorite, but even at that it is among the best books I've ever read in my 59 year career.
 The set came extremely quick. Its smaller than i thought it wouldve been, but its paperback so of course its small. The set came sealed and i refuse to open it (im beginning a collection...just received the trunk too)
 This book arrived in pristine condition!  It is a hardback book, which was a great surprise!  I am still in the process of reading it and I am certain it will be just entertaining as the rest of the collection.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was one of the best books I have read. It kept me guessing and wondering. It was of those few books what put you in a position of what would happen next. J.K. Rowling has made another master piece.
 Better then the movie. I am glad I finally decided to read it. Thank You J. K. Rowling. On to the next book.
 I don't even think I need to comment that the HP series is amazing. So I'll talk about the trunk it comes in. It is made from cardboard, sturdy enough to hold the books, comes with stickers to decorate. Very nice box set.
 The package series when it said it would. Great price and so convienent. Love the book series. Great for gift giving. Did most of my christsms shopping on here
 The box is crappy, but whatever. I just wanted the whole set of books and they are exactly what I expected!
 WOW! The new covers are SO GOOD!<br/>I really love the designs for the characters and paper quality is very good.<br/>The box is a little small, books are too tight inside, but it is a very good item for a HP collector! :)
 The last book in the series. If you are reading this review, I assume you have already read the other six books. Is there really a review that could persuade you to stop now? Buy the book and finish the series.
 I loved the movies but the books are better.  The narrator actually manages to sound like the characters from the movies, he is fantastic.  The best part though, is all the Rowling's wonderful writing and the details of the stories that were not part of the movies.<br/>I listen to them in my car, they are best cross country companions I can remember having.
 Great deal on the hardcover set! The only negative about the purchase is the cardboard box that it ships in. It's very easy to tear/damage which is what we've already dealt with.  Other than the box it's a great purchase for any HP fans.
 The books are amazing and so is the carrying case. Yes, the box is cardboard, but it is thick which allows it to last if taken care of properly. I would definitely recommend this product to others, and I was very happy with how quick the seller shipped my order.
 This is not only a childrens book but one for grownups. A great book and the last in the 'GREAT' Harry Potter series.  Everyone should read this book.
 I absolutely love this series, it is so well written.  This is something the whole family enjoys.  I read a lot of technical/medical journals and such, so when I read for enjoyment I like to be taken out of this realm.  This series definitely does that.  I believe this will be an enduring series that our grandchildren and so on will be reading.
 One of the books had a musty odor to it.
 The books themselves were in good shape, however, the keepsake treasure chest was cheaply made.  It was smashed at the edges, torn inside and had to be taped together, and the handles were off the side of the box and had to be reattached.  I bought this box set for my daughter who is a huge Harry Potter fan, she was happy with the books, but the treasure chest was a big disappointment.
 I always knew the Potter series was fantastical! But I don't think I really gave Rowling the credit she deserves until now. This is deep stuff... like Tolkien-deep. I don't think C. S. Lewis was even this detailed and deep. *I'm in love!*
 The story was great as are all of the Harry Potter books, but there were 2 major problems with the printing of the copy I have.  There are 31 pages missing completely (pages 339 through 370 missing), and pages 307 through 338 are repeated twice.  Very frustrating, and of course is was ordered and received long ago so no way to replace the book.
 This is a wonderful book I enjoyed it more the second time around I red it about 10 years ago and I enjoyed every little detail and the whole plot. If you have not read this series what are you waiting for and if you did. Read it again!
 We watched the movies first and we wanted to see how close they were in relation to the books. So far the books are better! My 8yr old gets close to 2hrs of story time a day, he's really into them!
 What a great price on this set! I bought my 10 year old the first book as a standalone to make sure he was going to like it and quickly ordered the entire set after he finished. He is so excited to read the whole series and so are my other kids.
 Nicely done and ends leaving the watcher in suspense as to Voldemort's next move as he has now acquired the elder wand. You know that he will use this weapon to further destruct Hogwarts and go after Harry in earnest.
 I read these books over and over again! I already had a set but my son took them when he moved. I like that these books are all together in a box that I can easily slide under my bed since my shelves are loaded with my little ponies lol
 BEST Series ever!<br/>I had seen the movies and decided I was going to read the series. I have read them all once and plan to start them all again soon. Just an excellent series for all! I'm a HP addict!
 I love the Harry Potter books, but when my paperbacks started falling apart, I decided it was time to splurge and buy them in hardback! This set is amazing and I love the "trunk" it comes in!
 A great collectors item for Harry Potter fans. The person I gave this to was really exicted to receive it.
 I had been wanting to buy the entire set in hardback but didnt want to spend too much. This set is great and I couldn't find a better price anywhere, it's about half the cost than what the big bookstore chains charge.
 There were some printing issues so some pages are way too light so I can barely read it. Then others are smeared and too dark. The books are of cheap material and look awful after 1 reading. Love the actual stories though!
 I love this series. I had to buy a new set after wearing out my first set. I had a problem with one of the books and I contacted the seller. He sent me a replacement free of charge. Awesome books and amazing seller!
 GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. ONLY DOWNER IS IT'S THE LAST IN THE SERIES. NO MORE CHANCES TO ESCAPE REALITY. J.K. PLEASE CREATE ANOTHER MAGICAL BEING.
 Got this as a gift - and even though I had already read the books, I LOVE IT! The box is a great way to store and protect the books. I've gone back and read these books several times.
 This was a Christmas gift for my 10 yr Grandson. He loves to read Harry Potter books. He was so happy &amp; was especially happy that I got the hard back book.
 I thought it was perfect. Everything that happened had such a purpose and such meaning. I spent a very long time on the last fifty pages being wowed at what was happening and becoming saddened at the fact that it was all coming to an end. I loved the ending. The last sentence in the epilogue was perfect. Without the epilogue there would be so many question marks. It definitely was amazing.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time<br/>and feel free to comment<br/>this review,<br/>Loran
 These books are amazing.  They were all in very great condition and were great reads.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good story!
 I have all these books on both my Kindle and my Audible app. My daughter wanted to read them, so I ordered her the paperbacks for Christmas. She was thrilled! She has already finished the first one and is part way through the second. Always wonderful books!!
 If you haven't had the audio experience of a Harry Potter book you are missing an excellent dimension of this outstanding series.  Jim Dale reads the story with great voices that you can easily "see" the character in your mind.
 As always I had good service and found Amazon to be very efficient. And I live in Farmington not Farington.
 Glad to complete the Harry Potter series! I was fortunate to start reading them with all seven books available, so I could read them one after the other without having to wait for the next to be completed.  All were a great, well-connected saga. Enjoyed the books immensely!
 All the Harry Potter books make for excellent reading. This book however, is the best of the series. Rowling out-did herself for the final book.  Book #7 drew me in from page 1. I couldn't put the book down. The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath in anticipation for what would happen next! It was fantastic reading, I hope to read more about Harry Potter in the future.I have loved the story from book #1, and I hope Rowling does more with Harry Potter.
 Have enjoyed it repeatedly since released. Audio books great for the car. Jim Dale does a good job. Will keep on listening.
 I purchased this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday. She was very happy with the set. The product arrived quickly and was a reasonable price. Would recommend this seller to others.
 I got this for my 7 year old daughter who is a new Harry Potter fan.  She absolutely loved it.  The trunk is cardboard - I would have been happier if it came in a sturdier wood version.  But still, a wonderful gift.
 I’ve read this book before and the book itself is amazing.  However the particular print I got was unreadable.  When we got to Chapter 31 the book started skipping around to different chapter.  Then Chapter 31 started over.  I thought we would be able to read it but then halfway Chapter 31 it turned into Chapter 33. I’ve never seen this in my life.
 5 stars because lets face it, who doesn't like Harry Potter. I bought this book for my 6 year old who is currently very into wizards and magic. It arrived a day late but that was due to Hurricane Mathew. The package was not damaged and the book was in perfect shape! We did finish this book and have moved on to book 2.
 I think these books are excellent, whether you are 6 years or 60 years old.. The story lines are very good the books are easy too read.The packing was very well done. Shipment came faster than expected. I have already read all in the set and there was a lot more information in the books than I expected. A must get for anybody who likes fantasy!!!!!!!!!
 This trunk set is exactly what you should expect if you gave any real thought to the price and description.  It is sturdy cardboard put together to look like an old trunk.  A very creative idea and a very nice set.  In addition you receive a free book of stickers.  This is 7 hardcover books that you are paying $120 for.  Do you really think that they are going to offer an expensive wooden box with lock and key?  That is absurd.  It may happen in the future, but it will cost a lot more.
 I purchased this set for my granddaughter who had started reading them for school book reports.  I had given a set to one of my grandsons, so had promised her I would get her a set also.  She was so delighted that she phoned me as soon as they were delivered to her home.  She has finished 4 of them already.
 Great Book. Need I say more.  Ending was a surprise and wrapped things up nicely.  A must have for anyone that has started collecting the series.
 Everything was as the seller stated.  The book was in mint condition and I loved the story.  I couldn't put it down.
 I like this illustrated version for reading together as a family.  I rather have a smaller book if I were just reading to myself, but since I am reading it out-loud to kids, I like having the pictures for the younger listeners.
 We love harry potter and loved the prior book. This one is really nice but I think it is done by another artist and there are less illustrations than the sorcerers stone version. I would still get it but not at store retail of $40
 Picked up the first Harry Potter book when my daughter was a teenager and just started reading it and couldn't put it down and I've been in love with the books and movies ever since. The beautiful writing, imagination, magic, love, etc. is unbelievable!!!!
 I love this series. It doesn't arrive in a chest thing, like what's shown in the picture, but the books are all obviously new. I really enjoyed the series- which i'd already read before i ordered, so undeniably i'm in love with Rowling's work.
 I haven't read it myself but my 15 year old daughter loves it.  It's the first book she's read in a long time that wasn't required for school.  Have already ordered book 1 and 3.  She wants the whole collection.
 All of the Harry Potter books are wonderful and I promise once you sit down and read one you will be hooked to read all 7.  This is the way to by the books because you get all 7 for a much lower price than buying them one at a time.
 I thought this was great Harry Potter.  I am sorry there are no more to read.
 My son enjoyed this book very much as he loves all kinds of books, so when each of the Harry Potter books came out, we made sure we got it for him. He preferred the books to the movies. I would say he was very happy.
 Perfect condition and one of the few sets that came with the decorative trunk to hold the books.  Great transaction.
 My six year old son says this was his favorite Harry Potter! Mine was Half Blood Prince, but I agree, excellent. It wasn't an easy book to read aloud,but we still could not stop reading and thoroughly enjoyed the exciting conclusion.
 This was a much awaited book.  It was satisfying to read, but wish it would have ended differently.  Recieved the book promply in great condition.
 It's fantastic box.<br/>Very very beautiful!!!
 I have read the entire series over and over again, I can't seem to stop!  This final book answered so many questions and explained so many things.  Rowling has outdone herself.  The only downside is that we will never get to read about Harry again.
 It is always nice to have all 7 books in once place.  With this collection and handy dandy box to keep them together, you won't ever lose them.  I enjoyed this package very much!
 The end of an era, I can't believe the books finally came to an end, it is so sad. this book had be hooked form page one and I was balling by the end. Had it finished in a day and went to read it again! Perfect way to end the series.
 Beautifully packaged.  I thought I was getting 7 loose books...wrong!  These books are nicely packaged in a Harry Potter box.  Yeah!
 This was a great book.  It had so many twist and turns that surprised me. Great reading.
 My 7  year old loves these illustrated versions as that she just started the Harry Potter series. Only wish all the books were out in illustrated form already. She loves the pictures every few pages and the built in bookmark.
 I couldn't help but laugh when I saw others complaining about the box. I didn't buy the set for a show case box, I wanted the books to read, and they are sold at a really good price here. They definitely serve that purpose. Love Harry Potter!
 Amazing story. Author does a good job developing the characters. Harry, Hermione, Ron and even Draco are delightful and well developed. A fantastic world of magic and mayhem. Sure to delight the reader and leaving them wanting more.
 Nice set, all the books, well worth the price. Not sure what else to say but if you want all the books and are OK with paperback this is a much better way to purchase the set than individually. HP rules!
 Bought a copy to pass on the love of Harry Potter to my nieces and nephews for Christmas. I know they will love it because it's always going to be a great story.
 I sent this book set to Brazil on December, and it arrived before Christmas, in perfect condition. Great international delivery. The price and time were great!
 Like others reviewing this set, I'll admit that the packaging is less than desirable. The cardboard box was a big disappointment. Beyond that, this is an incredible buy. Add up the cost of these books individually and you'll spend around $200 easy. If you want the Harry Potter series cheap, go for this. If you want pretty packaging, pick up the British version and pay nearly $400.
 Books came in excellent condition from the UK.  I’m enjoying re-reading the books the way JK Rowling wrote them, i.e., without the US edition changes made by Scholastic.
 The book is in perfect condition. I've tried to find this version of it before, but now I have my own. Thank you.
 It's HP so it's great, but the illustrations in this one aren't quite the same as the first book Kay illustrated. I was a little disappointed.
 These books are a must read for all ages. Even if you are skeptical, try them out. I promise you will love them.
 This was the only Harry Potter book that I didn't own. I stumbled across this and thought that it would be perfect! The art is beautiful and really adds to the story! My 8 year old brother is in love with it too and can't wait to start reading! The only issue that I had was that part of the cover had a tear in the upper right corner.
 I LOVED the book it was mt favorite when i first got it i was dieing to read it and finish harry potters books but now its over i am sad i have grown on the book or they have grown on me i wish she would write more stories about a second generation i shall not spoil this book for the readers by describing this sensitive and wonderfull book i cryed my eyes out on chapter 34 and i love the books so wonderful and i hope you will like it!<br/><br/>love<br/>djc
 paperback, the images on the covers will fade a bit, but i like the rustic edge it gives it. they are sturdy. I've had it for 4 years or so now.
 I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and it was her most wanted gift for Christmas. The set is well worth the money if I say so myself.
 Great collectible gift. The chest it comes in is essentially a cardboard box, but the external is nice and still great as storage space for the books or something else. Came with a nice sticker sheet with the houses and various Harry Potter things.
 The box and books are in the perfect condition and the books themselves are wonderful. They bring you to a whole new world, filled with exciting and exotic things. Harry Potter is a must and this particular edition just reflects the greatness of the inside on the outside covers.
 I enjoyed it but the Author didn't bring the continued magic from the 1st book. I missed some of her background characters, especially Neville
 It's nice to have been around for the begining of this series which will become a classic for the ages.
 I've read and re-read this series of books nearly every year since The Sorcerer's Stone was first published. I am now 66 years old and it is still one of my favorite literary works. I do believe that I too will be reading it in my rocking chair when I am 80. I will love it ALWAYS.
 I purchased this set for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised to find the extra copy of "the tale of Beetle the Bard came with it! Great find!  My daughter loved it!
 Bought this Harry potter series for my son, he said the books are so much better than the movies.  I finally understood what I was trying to tell him for years.  If you want the whole story read the book.  Thank you J.K. Rowling
 I love J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter series. I have always been a fan, and re-reading this novel took me back. This is a great read for all ages and continues Harry's journey on his path at Hogwarts with his mischievous friends.
 Set arrived as advertised: factory sealed and no damages.  Bought for grandchildren to have at my home.  They (boy 9, girl 10) were so excited to have their own copies.  These are wonderful books that help keep young voracious readers enthrolled.  Great purchase !!
 The collection was as advertised  It is a compact set, I have just begun to read them, The print is a nice size.<br/>It arrived sooner then I expected which was a pleasant surprise.
 The cheapest way to catch the Harry Potter star. Lovely drawings inside and decent size. Loved it.
 Everyone at this point knows the stories. If you haven't read the books but have only watched the movies, you are missing out. Get these books and read them.
 Step into a world of adventure and magic. The complete set allows each reader to follow the adventures of Harry and his friends without a gap in the story.  These stories are suitable for reading outloud or in private.
 Harry and friends are solving problems, having adventures, and having fun in the second book of the series. A must read for Potter fans. Relationships develop between the characters and plots thicken in the battle of good versus evil.
 This is her best written book, except for the last chapter. It was out of place and seemed like it was written previously; otherwise a masterpiece, and a great ending. The reason only 4 stars is she took a little from Lord of the Rings with the Horcruxes (compared to the ring), and ending in War. The books a little cliché, but so is life, and what did Harry Potter become? Still some questions, but overall I loved it and highly recommend it.
 I started reading these books so I could have discussions with my GRANDDAUGHTER about them. I was amazed at how quickly I was caught up in the plot lines. Instead of continuing the series for my granddaughter, I was avidly reading them for ME!
 I received the package and was very exited when I saw 7 books inside. Upon closer inspection I found out I had only received 6 books of the series.I was sent 2 copies of the Chamber of Secret. And was missing the Sorcerers Stone. Was going to send it back, but it would cost less to sell it to half-price books and pay the difference for the missing book.<br/><br/>Very disappointed with my order. Would not order again.
 I bought these 7 months ago for my 11 year old daughter. The books arrived with a very strong smell of stale cigarettes mixed with dust and mold. I decided to air them out and keep them. About 6 months later I started reading them to my younger child and every single time I read, my eyes start tearing, I start sneezing and my nose starts running.<br/>I have now ordered brand new books and will throw these away.<br/>what a waste of money
 Such a shame to have such a low quality case material for such a beautiful art edition, I got mine with a dent on the back due to awful package protection material also the case is not sturdy to hold such heavy although paperback books that you have to squeeze just to get it back in the case itself.<br/>Material of:<br/>Box Case 0/5<br/>Books 3/5<br/>Paper quality 3/5<br/>Cover Art 5/5
 Recieved books in a timely manner...just what I thought I was getting at a decent price.
 I never thought I would read this series because it's not in my normal genre,  but I found it to be so fun and so well done.  I loved all the<br/>characters and how well the surroundings were described, it was easily visualized.
 It was everything I expected and more. The end is brilliant, and as someone said, it's the only one it could have even though one would never imaigne it.
 A very good deal for people who like Harry Potter and they miss some of the volumes. The only drawback is that the paper quality of very poor even for the standards of the paperback versions.
 have watched and read all the series. I just had to buy the last one for a collection. I love harry potter so much of my childhood revolves around harry potter. thank you J.K. Rowling.
 Honestly, I couldn't put this book down. I finished it in two days, rotating between Pokémon Go and reading! I highly recommend the Harry Potter series to EVERYONE, for this is  by far my favorite book ever (after the Bible). Can't wait to read the next one!
 Excelkent
 My son absolutely loves the illustrated Harry Potter books as he's not old enough to read just yet. The pictures are really nice to look at and give the book a whole new life. We can't wait for the other ones to be released!
 My 11 year old son loved this series!  He is in love with reading now!  So sad it was the last book!
 As a huge Harry Potter fan I was thrilled to see this collectors set of all seven books, especially since they were hardback. I was however fairly disappointed to see that the box that it comes in is cardboard, and my box was fairly beaten up in the corners and had a missing handle. All in all I think the books are fantastic, 10/10 would recommend the actual books. But if you are looking for a high quality collectors item this is not the box set to get.
 First of all, I completely sympathize with everyone complaining about the quality of the "chest."  Its designers did an excellent job of making a cardboard box look like a real chest from 10 feet away...<br/><br/>However, I bought this because it was the only box set available containing all seven books in hardcover, which is exactly what I wanted, and received.  The book quality is superb, as many first editions are (these of course being the US editions), and you cannot beat the price of just over $16 per book.<br/><br/>For those of you wanting a real keep chest, I would definitely look elsewhere, as I'd imagine its cost alone would equal that of this entire set.
 My granddaughter wanted books 1-7 for her birthday.  I got her this set.  The books are paperback but come in a nice box/book shelf of sorts.  I'm pleased with the quality.
 Great book for young and old alike. I have enjoyed reading these along with my 12 &amp; 9 yr old daughters.
 Wow, all the Harry Potters, brand new, for only $100! It's true, and I finally can appease my addiction as much as I like without having to wait at the library.
 Purchased for my teen daughter for her birthday.  She was so happy to get the entire set, she is a Potterhead.  The set was in perfect condition, and the box keeps them neat and protected on her bookshelf.  Very happy with this purchase.
 Regardless the fact that the price for the 7 books alone is worth the purchase, I was nevertheless unsatisfied. I purchased this collection a while back for my gf as a gift for her bday that is coming up soon. I am quite unwilling and discouraged to tell her that now she has two sets of Harry Potter books and a cardboard box.
 Love the stories and now have a complete set in audio.  Great response from the seller, items arrived in a timely manner, and as advertised.
 I've now read, listened to and watched all the Harry Potter books.  I will probably re-do the list in another couple of years.  I really enjoy the books, in all their forms.
 Purchased this book for my stepson since he had read all the Potter books form the very first one. He liked them all, some more than others but this was a good read according to him.
 We can hardly believe that we had our son wait in eager anticipation for 3 months for this HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT of a product.  Why didn't you advertise it as 'The 7 Harry Potter Books in a Flimsy Cardboard Box'?  Having this item appear like a trunk in the advertising is so incredibly misleading.  The box is seriously a thin piece of cardboard with printing on it.  And forget about the lock and key idea...do not waste your time thinking you're getting any more than the 7 books here.  What a downer.
 Great book
 I used to be a definite Harry Potter hater.  I read all seven books in about 2 weeks, and am glad that I did.  They are excellent reads, and everyone should at least read these book once if not more than that.  I am more than willing to suggest that someone should read Harry Potter.
 Just got the illustrated edition in the mail. Unbelievable quality for the price! Can't wait to read the whole series! I own many different editions of Harry Potter and this is BY FAR my favorite edition. I will be getting the whole series (again).
 Because these books are Scholastic paperbacks, I had expected them to be very tiny. They are actually good-sized, and the box they come in is colorful and very cool. I got them for my son's birthday (15th), and he loves them!
 This was an excellent book. I wish the epilogue was a little more fleshed out, but otherwise brilliant.
 It's fantastic!!!!! I really loved it. I recommend it to every harry potter fan and i hope you'll like it as i did
 These came wrapped in plastic and in perfect condition.  A MUST for any Potter fan.  I can't say enough good things about the series.  They are not just for children!  Shipped in time for Christmas.
 Very well done edition.  The print is excellent and the books are a great size.  The slipcase makes a nice appearance on my bookshelves.<br/>The price is outstanding.  This would make a great gift.
 Excellent ending to a fabulous story. I'm almost sorry that it's the last chapter.  I'm thinking of re-reading all the books.
 I was the same age as the characters when these books came out, so I have grown up with them. I can't even remember how many times I have read this series. I love them!
 I keep them to read again when I retire and need to know how all those dots were connected. Liked Harry Potter characters more before they got darker. Once you travel that way it's hard to turn on the light again.
 Paperback set, in plastic and boxed set, brand new! In stores full price around $90 with sales tax, on Amazon less than $50. Perfect bday present for a HP loving mom who most certainly will love reading these to her kiddo. ❤️
 As a set of hardcover HP books, this is a worthwhile purchase. I had never invested in my own copies of these books before, so I decided to get them all in one shot with this set. However, if you are only buying for the packaging, you might as will skip it.  As other reviewers have said, the box is made out of cardboard with a plastic latch--not very impressive.  As I said, if you are looking for a full set of hardcover HP books, this is great.  If not, save your money for something else.
 Oh man this book is good. Beautiful illustrations and quality binding. I am jealous of my baby daughter because she will get to have the illustrated HP books as her first introduction to the amazing world of Harry Potter.
 All seven books come with this set, and for the hardcover version, it comes in an adorable cardboard trunk. I hope that this would be wooden, but it is still very well made and a great way to keep all the books together.
 Just received it today and it's beautiful. I personally don't like hard covers so I got the paperback. It comes in a nice set. I'm so excited to read them again. This time, I get to enjoy them with my nephews. A must buy for any Potter fans.
 The box is beautiful and the books fit wonderfully in it, which helps to display them on my bookshelf. I would buy this again for a family member or friend for a gift. I am extremely happy with the book collection.
 I can't wait to read them all when my son is done! he was so happy to get the box set. he has book 7 but doesn't want to read it until he gets all the way through the first six.
 I have to start with the fact that I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  I have read many of the books on speculation, enjoyed talking to others on the forums, and tried to dissect the books to get clues for what was coming in this book.  I read the first three books back in 1999, and have loved watching JK Rowling grow as a writer.  It was so fun to read the books for the first, and discover all the hidden aspects of the story, especially when I re-read the earlier books.  I thought that she was a genius for her ability to hide things in the earlier books that jumped out once you read the later books.  I was so looking forward to finding out all the answers to all the questions that popped up.  Once I got the book in my hands, and started reading, my excitement started to fade.  After the first 4 or 5 chapters, I knew I was not going to like this book as much as the others.  First of all, there were just too many miraculous escapes to make the story seem plausible.  (Yeah, I know I am reading a fantasy story, but it seems that the rules JKR set for the magic world just come and go as she pleases.)  The book drags on and on and on with the three kids camping on their own for months and months and months.  I started getting the feeling that JKR was just bored with the story, and anxious to get it over with.  Just write and write and write, and who cares if the words are gripping or exciting.  There were certain parts of the story that had the old JKR popping through, like when they had the Pottercast.  But these are few and far.  I am not saying I disliked the story because it was so dark or because it was a blood bath.  I disliked the story because many of the questions we had were not answered.  The first 6 books led you in one direction, making you think one thing, and had a surprise that had you gripping your seat.  You could hardly put the books down, and when you found out that things were not the way you thought, it was exhilarating.  This book was lacking that.  The story was not at all exciting.  There were no huge surprises that knocked you off your feet.  There were barely any hidden clues from previous books.  The epilogue was a joke.  I read where she said it was written years ago.  Yeah, back from when she was not an experienced writer.  I am sorry that the series had to end with such a dud.  I truly would have been happier waiting another year or even two, just to have a book that showed that JKR poured her whole self into.  This one just seems to be so rushed.  Bam, kids get into trouble and BAM, they are saved.  Again, more trouble, and wow, look at that, they luckily are saved again.  They did NOT use everything they learned in their 6 years at Hogwards.  They survived from sheer luck or coincidences.  I mean, how many times can the same group get lucky?  Apparently, this trio is the luckiest kids around.<br/><br/>If you really must read this book, then save your money and get it from the library.  This on is NOT a keeper.
 I absolutely like the hard book cover collection, it was worth the price. For those people who review that it came in a cardboard bow, yes it did ..but if you want a wood box then purchase one. In others words there is nothing wrong with the books, all of them are nice and perfect
 The box is just cardboard and the latch is plastic, but it's a nice way to keep all your books together. The first box I got had a slice in<br/>one of the book jackets, under the cellophane wrapping - like a box cutter had got to it. Swapped it out with Amazon for a new one<br/>that was just fine.<br/><br/>It's a cute way to get all the books at once.
 Box is cardboard, which I knew already, so no surprise. The books fit fest which is a big plus so they don't get bashed up if you move the box.  I will say since though, since I bought this I found the cherry wood steamer chest and have transferred my books to that instead.
 Good value for money; however, the binding is not as good as I had expected. I can see that pages will start falling out before my sons finish reading the six books
 Our granddaughter was thrilled to receive the books, they were something she wanted, but did not want to ask her parents because of the cost. You should have seen how her eyes lit up when she pulled them out of the gift bag.
 Bought this for a Christmas gift for my daughter who loves to read and likes Harry Potter. Bought it early because of a good price. She will love them. Buy if you know of anyone who likes/loves anything to do with Harry Potter.
 The narrator is superb!  These make housework or long drives so much more enjoyable.  I have read the books and watched the movies, but the audio book is probably may favorite format.
 I had already read these and bought them as a birthday gift. I think she did an excellent job with this series and the books got better as the series went on.  She is a gifted story teller.
 Bought it as a gift, was loved.  Although the cardboard box is very cheap like many other reviews said.  The books came in perfect condition and that was my main concern.
 This book is realy the best of them all...can't wait to see the movie to see what do they do with it
 This item arrived in mint condition within a few days of purchase.  The books are in a sturdy and attractive case of their own and are a welcome addition to my book collection.  I won't hesitate to order from amazon.com again and encourage others to do so, as well.
 This set is beautiful!  I was a bit discouraged when looking for the Harry Potter Set because it was so expensive everywhere I looked.  And then I ran across this one.  At $45-50 it is a total deal and the set is gorgeous!
 Fast ship, honest, good to deal with! Item was as advertised, received in good condition. We are enjoying the books as well as the storage box.
 It is the Harry Potter series.  What is there to say.  It is awesome.  We already had a set in hardback, but my son wanted a set of his own that he could beat around, so I got him the paperbacks.  These were the right price.
 The box set is beautiful! To those who complained about "poor packaging" or "it's only cardboard" should expect that for the price! Yes it is a cardboard box but is extremely sturdy and the images are spectacular. My ONLY complaint was that the books were very tightly packed in the box so it was sorta hard to get them out but I suppose thats a good thing too.
 Was so suprised when I received this box set, as it was better than I expected.<br/>It comes in a big chest which is just so amazing and the books are so good.<br/>The size of the writting is bigger than i expected and is shows little pictures<br/>on the front of each chapter which i must say is the best part!<br/>I definatly recomend this, and is is the best box set I have seen and it is definatly at a<br/>fantastic price! :D
 I am reading these books to my child and she raves about them! She loves the plot and the characters. At five, she can follow the story and I would suggest these to any parent or kid interested in a little bit of magic.
 Exactly as described - not sure why other reviewers are having trouble, thought I'm assuming the description was updated and clarified by the time I got to it. It's a paperback book set of one of the most beloved series of our time, and it is perfect.
 I know, worst book pun ever.  Anyway, this should be part of anyones fictional collection.  Yes, there are parts where Rowling obviously feel victim to writer's black, but for the most part they're just fun and a fast read.
 These books sell out for a reason. I have read all of the books and I am going to read all of them over again and again. I will eventually have fun reading them to my children.
 This is the third set of HP books that I own, and I've been rereading them in this beautiful edition. I love that the inside illustrations aren't changed, because the book wouldn't be the same without those chapter headers.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so naturally I was super excited to get these and see the new art work. I was blown away, even after I saw the pictures of them online! Really beautiful covers for an absolutely amazing story!
 The UK versions generally are the "collector" editions but this is a very nice US. Special Edition.  Arrived in great condition!  Very glad to have the opportunity to purchase this through Amazon!
 Books are fine but the little decorative case was broke when it arrived. One of the handles had one of the sides loose. I have seen other reviews stating the same. I mostly bought it for the books which were in great condition.
 To J K Rowling you made my childhood filled with stories of magic thank you very much. It's not about the magic you can or can't do its about the magic of love. Since 1997 I have been reading these books and at 22 years old I still love them thanks again.
 It's Harry Potter, what's not to like? This is a great version. It includes the entire series and you can fairly easily navigate from book to book and chapter to chapter if you're an obsessed fan like me and get it in your mind that you want to check a "fact." As with most Kindle purchases it is also easy to switch devices and pick up where you left off.
 If you have not read this series, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  For kids and adults alike, it is a fantastic read.  For fans who do not own all the books, the case containing them makes a nice collectors piece too!
 I never got around to reading the seventh book-- even though all of my friends had completed the series as well as watched both of the final movies. I kept my promise to myself and let the story unfold organically for me and me alone. I am beyond grateful, the story was wrapped up in a magical little bow. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through and it finally showed arc in some of the major characters. I highly recommend this to imaginative readers who can let themselves escape as they read. I will now allow myself to watch the movie 😇
 I purchased this set for my granddaughter for her 11th birthday.  I already have the full set but knew she would love to have her own since she had begun borrowing mine (not that I mind that).  She's an avid reader and was delighted to have her own boxed set of Harry Potter.  This set would make a great gift for any Hogwarts fan of any age.<br/><br/>I was also on a bit of a "time crunch" and they arrived in a very timely manner.  Thanks Amazon!
 I loved the book.  It was as lively and wonderful as all the other Harry Potter books.  I would recommend it to everyone who loves fantasy type books and movies.
 It is a beautiful, beautiful set!  Well made with a chest to house he collection that comes with a key!  So fun!  A wonderful gift for the Potter fan!  My daughter loves it!  What's not to love ?!?!
 Definately a good ending, though I wish that more of the kids' lives would be explained during the epilogue.  But definately a good final ending for the series.
 This book was perfect, like brand new!  cover jacket attached, no hilighting, bent pages, smugges. It was like I bought it brand new in a book store!
 Very good book
 Honestly, this is one of the most beautiful book collections I've ever purchased. The combination of red and gold in the box is amazing. And it is a very sturdy box. The books are awesomely detailed. I recommend this collection for every Harry Potter fan out there.
 Beautifully illustrated version of JK Rowling original work.  Makes it a lot more interesting to read with your kids each night!  Also a great gift (for a great price) for any HP fan!  Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!
 The set was amazingly good quality for paperback books. I did have one complaint and that is that there was some adhesive on the face of the spine of one of the books which made it feel bumpy. All 6 of the other books did not have this problem. But that was completely superficial and did not affect the art or the aesthetic of the set.
 Not going to comment on the story as I am sure Amazon has plenty reviews on Chamber of Secrets.  I will only say it is perfection.  My comments are directed at Jim Kay's amazing illustrations.  The beauty of these drawings bring to life a story that everyone loves.  I feel that Kay's illustrations enhanced the experience.  The pictures, for me, match my imagination when reading the book.  I cannot express the urgent need for every Potterhead to buy this RIGHT NOW!  You will not regret it!
 What a great series, I am sad it has come to an end.  It just means I have to re-read the previous books!
 I have always been a Harry Potter fan ever since the first book came out and I have always wanted to buy this collection. I was so happy when they lowered the price to about $50 and had to buy it since it contained all 7 books altogether. What a steal! True, the "trunk" is only printed cardboard, but I didn't care too much about it and I still think it looks great. I get to reread these timeless classics again and relive the adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione through their 7 years at Hogwarts.
 Came right on time! Very happy with what we got and would order again! More words are not needed for this.
 Didnt want to spring for individual books great value for a fun series to read
 One of the best set of books ever! For every age, these books are truly enjoyable and can be read over and over again.
 I gave this set to my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  She adores it and has declaired it "off limits" to her younger siblings.  They are doomed to re-reading our dog-eared paperback editions.  It is a bit costly, but in the end the joy it gave my daughter was worth it.
 I am a huge HP fan and this book is great. They really gave it all that it deserves. the book has a great layout and adds a lot to the overall story. The illustrations are great. Can't wait to buy all the rest.
 Hopefully, the unanswered questions will be answered in the Encyclopedia based on the HP world Rowling is said to be working on from previous unused work.
 Very pleased!
 This box set is a very nice set if you don't want to splurge on the hard cover set. The box is sturdy and the book covers are very colorful. I bought this set for my two children to share and I'm sure it will last for many years.
 I love each of the books, and it's easier having them all together on my Kindle. If you haven't read them -- maybe just seen the movies, which I also think are great -- there's so much more breadth and depth in the books.
 The product was delivered extremely quickly, and was more than I was expecting. It was packaged beautifully, and would have made a wonderful Christmas gift - so wonderful, I decided to keep it for myself!
 I purchased these books for my son for his birthday. He loved them. We got them on sale and so they were a great bargain and a perfect gift.
 These were the hardback expensive box set, instead of the cheaper paperback box set- it was such a lovely surprise at a fraction of the cost and they look like they are brand spanking new! Thank you so much!
 I purchased this for my daughter, an avid fan, who was a little disappointed that the box itself was little more than a flimsy cardboard product.  Something more lasting would have been in order.
 This is a beautiful paperback set.  I am another one of those "Harry Potter Grandmas".  My grandchildren lent me their movies - the first2) and told me I HAD to see them. (Their mother won't let them see the later ones in the series yet - and I much agree) Well after seeing those 2 films I wanted to see the rest buy my library &amp; Netflix didn't have them all so I read the books for the films I couldn't rent. I found out that wasn't working as the films naturally have to cut out a lot. So I started all over just reading the series and I have to say I was hooked.  So very well written and although I'm not really a fantasy reader, I decided  I had to have the set.  And I've read through the whole set again since I've had them.  The artwork on the book covers and the case are beautiful.<br/><br/>I agree with many others that this is a series for the ages and someday I'll be able to read them all to my grandchildren.
 We have four grandchildren, ages 9-1/2 years to t-minus 3 months and counting.  This complete Harry Potter hardcover boxed-set (...we got the complete 8-DVD movie set, as well) will get a lot of use over the next 10-15 years, and will become a familly heirloom... hoping we'll have the opportunity to read the books with our great-grandchildren, too!
 It took me less than 24 hours to read this book, I couldn't put it down.  Defintely one of the best books I've read.  It has a lot of heart, mystery, suspense.  It walks that fine line between what's appropriate for children and what will keep adults entertained just perfectly.
 I was very pleased with the expedient shipping time. The product was exactly what I ordered and it arrived in perfect condition.
