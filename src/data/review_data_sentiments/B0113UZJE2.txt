 This scale is terrible. It is true, you get what you pay for and I only paid $8. The weight reading continues to move up and down. I used a calibrated scale side by side and weighed 4 grams. This scale went back and forth from 3-5 while the other one gave exactly 4. Honestly wish I had spent a little extra money on a better scale. I work in law enforcement and need more precise weights than +/- 1.
 I received my sleek new digital scale today and figured I would be good to go for a long time. NOT ! Got the batteries squared away, read the rules and started weighing things. Then everything changed. I tried weighing 4 grams of a powdered herb. It would not weigh 4 grams. When I got to 6 grams it started weighing. I tried resetting, repositioning the batteries, you name it I did it. It would not weigh under 6 grams. So I'm going back to my old retro kitchen aid scale and giving this thing to my daughter who said she will never be weighing grams. So much for the future.
 Not sensitive to low weights. The scale is almost useless for measuring out spices and yeast and other items which are in the low single digits of grams. You can only work around it by putting something heavy on the scale (like a plate), then putting the measuring paper on top of that and then pouring on the ingredient. The last scale I bought from Amazon did not have this problem.<br/><br/>The scale is also grossly imprecise, on the order of 10-20%. This can be tested easily - put a cup on the scale and measure a significant amount of ingredients, say 14 grams of salt and 6 grams of sugar. Remove the cup and put a different cup on the scale, tare the weight, then pour in what should be 20 grams from the first cup. It will come out WAY different.<br/><br/>This scale is basically trash. The last scale I bought from amazon was routinely accurate to within 1%.
 I considered long and hard about how to rate this product. It is designed to do one thing, weigh small amounts of food. It is aesthetically designed well. And that is as far as it goes in delivering on its intended function. The "tare" or zero function is coupled to the measuring function. Meaning, when you put a dish on the scale then zero the display, the resulting value will include the weight of your finger pushing the button. The product fails to do what it is advertised to do; accurately measure the weight of food. The designer must not be an engineer. I would recommend another product to weigh food. I will be returning this and finding a better product. When I do I will update this review with my findings. (I gave it two stars because. It looks nice)
 I meal prep and I bought this to weigh out all my food for the entire week and then cook. The one day I cook a week I use this scale for maybe a half-hour in total on time. I turn it off and then the next week I go to turn it on the batteries are dead. I've changed the batteries everytime I use it essentially. This thing drains the battery even when not in use.
 Bought this scale to weigh my litter of puppies. It's fantastic so far. I just put a plate on it, tare the plate, and then set a puppy on it. Works like a charm. Would definitely recommend it. Plus it's very nice looking. Great for the kitchen if that's what you're buying it for.
 Worked great for about 6 or 7 months. After that, the scale would only display the unsettled/uneven error. I absolutely loved this scale, so I'm really disappointed that it had such a short lifespan. The piece-of-junk Walmart scale that this scale replaced was many years old, and is still working to this day. In fact, the very day that this scale failed, I pulled the hideous Walmart scale out of storage. Started right up, worked like a charm.<br/><br/>Easily would have been 5 stars if it would have lasted for a reasonable period of time. Such a shame.
 Easy to use, pretty accurate scale, love the way it looks (very sleek and easy to clean since its a stainless steel top)<br/><br/>The only issue i had is looking at the actual read out... Since the entire thing is pretty flat on the top, if you place any sort of decent sized bowl or plate, it completely obstructs the digital screen. You end up having to see if you can push back the bowl and get a look at while bending over to look under the curve of the bowl or placing a thinner box and the plate or bowl on top of the box.<br/><br/>Honestly the scale would have been 5 stars but the fact you cant see the display without going through a mission is pretty annoying.<br/><br/>EDIT: After giving it 3 stars Etekcity contacted me to let me know that they had a larger version and sent it free of charge, it was theÂ <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction-Food-Scale-with-30-Wider-Platform-11lb-5kg-3-GP-Batteries-Included-Stainless-Steel/dp/B01HNSRYAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale Multifunction Food Scale with 30% Wider Platform 11lb 5kg, 3 GP Batteries Included (Stainless Steel)</a>, which pretty much negates the issue I mentioned above. And after I looked it up they have a newer version of the one I was sent that has the read out to the side which seems even more practical.<br/><br/>For customer service alone,  I had to raise my initial 3 stars to four!
 I purchased this item Sept 28th 2016 and got it Oct 1st.  I opened it up to make sure it was not damaged in any way and turned it on.  I then put it away and never used it.  I got it out on January 31st to check the weight on a rifle part and got different readings.  Depending on where I placed the item it measured anywhere from 3gm to 12gm.  I emailed Etekcity with a video showing them what it was doing  at 11:08am and asked for advise.  Without any hesitation they responded at 2:06pm for me to send them my order number from Amazon.  I emailed it to them at 3:44pm and got a response back at 4:39pm saying they would be sending out a replacement on February 1 and would take 3-6 business days to arrive and it wasn't necessary to return the defective unit.  On February 2nd the new one arrived in the mail.  I immediately opened it and tested it with the same part and moved it to 12 different parts of the scale.  I got the same measurement no matter where I place it.<br/><br/>All in all I am totally pleased with this scale and especially pleased with their customer support.<br/><br/>I give the scale a 5 STAR<br/>I give customer support 10 STARS.<br/><br/>Recommend this company to anyone looking for a scale at a decent price.
 It worked until it didn't.  For a KITCHEN scale you'd expect it to be able to handle a small splash of water here or there, or a minor spill when pouring something and weighing it.  Nope.  A few drops of water got onto the digital display and it was dead.  There are plenty of other GREAT kitchen scales available that ARE waterproof for the same price.  Get one of those.<br/><br/>2 stars instead of one because it works and it was a nice scale until it died.
