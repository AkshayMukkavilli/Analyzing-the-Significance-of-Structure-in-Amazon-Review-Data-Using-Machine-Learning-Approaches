 Pro: This is a good wireless mouse. The USB receiver is small and fits inside the mouse when not in use. It takes 2 AAA batteries that angle in when installing (took me a sec to figure that out). My Dell laptop recognized it immediately and works identically to a wired mouse in every other way.<br/><br/>Con: It is shorter than a normal mouse, which is going to take some getting used to. I wish it were the same size as a normal mouse, but this seems to be a trend with this wireless ones. I've attached a pic.
 Bought 2 - both stopped working. I do not recommend this mouse. I bought one and one month later it stopped working. For the price, it wasn't worth returning so I just bought another one thinking I got a fluke bad one because I do like the light weight and feel. But the second one stopped working after a few months. I tried changing the battery (with 3 dif sets of batteries in case my batteries were bad). I tried it on my desktop and my laptop.  It just stopped working.
 I have been using Microsoft's basic optical USB wired mouse for years. Everytime I try something different I end up going back to MS mouse. The thumbwheel usually goes first in my experience.<br/><br/>I have had this mouse for a month now. This mouse feels and performs exactly the same as the MS basic optical mouse. Pointer movement is accurate and scroll wheel feel/operation is very good. Button clicks are good. Not too hard or too soft. I have med-lg hands and never had a problem with this size mouse.<br/><br/>Installation was plug and play with Windows 7. No drivers to install. Wireless operation has been flawless. The top of the mouse is rubberized synthetic that does absorb oil from your hand and fingers.. Easy to clean with windex though. I got the mouse on sale. I really like it. I will keep using it until stops working.. Oh. almost forgot it tracks well on my sofa as well. Considering sale price -$15 and smooth operation. 5 stars<br/><br/>Batteries are easy to install. The +/- terminals are molded into body. Don't understand the complaints about difficult installation.<br/><br/>Update 7/5/12 5th month: Still working perfectly. Batteries last one month if you don't turn it off.<br/>Update 1/25/2013  1 year still working fine<br/>Update 8/8/14 2.5 years and still working. I use it everyday.
 I bought this mouse in October and, for a little while, it worked quite well.  In the last week or so, though, it seems to cut out.  I thought that maybe it was just a connection issue, so I changed the USB ports.  That didn't fix the problem, so I thought maybe it was just because of the software (maybe an update, or something) on my work computer, so I tried it on my personal computer and experienced the same issue.  I decided that surely, the batteries I had recently put into the mouse were on the verge of death - maybe they were defective or something, and so I changed the batteries.  Again, there was no improvement in the connectivity issue.  I also tried the "connect" button on the mouse and attempted turning it off and back on, restarting the computer, and telling my computer to "forget" the mouse so that it could reinstall the driver... none of which have resolved the issue.<br/><br/>When it works, it works well.  Unfortunately, though, the one I received does not seem to be sturdy or reliable.  From the other reviews, it seems that the mouse is pretty reliable and works well... so I am assuming that I just received one with some sort of manufacturing defect.  Still, given the amount of work I do on the computer, I think I would probably be better off with a Logitech or some other more recognized product.
 My job is in IT and I work with several PC's nearly every day.<br/><br/>This mouse has never had a driver-related issue with any of them, and the optical reader hasn't had a problem on any reasonable surface I have used it on.<br/><br/>It is also heavy enough to be comfortable for long-term use, but small enough to carry easily in your kit.<br/><br/>The usb-receiver tucks away within the battery compartment as well, so you do not lose it.<br/><br/>Here are my 2 negatives:<br/><br/>1. If you drop the mouse on a surface such as concrete or asphault, the rubberized exterior is easily damaged.<br/><br/>2. The USB-receiver's range is short and needs to be relatively unobstructed. It can work through a desk if the PC is under the desk, but that is about it. You could get a USB M to F extension to fix this.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this as a daily-use mouse at a desk: No<br/><br/>As a portable mouse for a laptop: Yes!
 The Amazon Basics cordless "mini" mouse is one of those "wireless mouse plus little USB receiver" devices. It seem sto be positioned to compete with the Logitech m325 model.<br/><br/>The USB receiver is hiding in the battery compartment, which is accessed by removing a door in the underside. This must be plugged into an available USB port for the mouse to function. The mouse must also be switched on using a tiny switch in its underside.<br/><br/>The mouse takes two AAA batteries. There is a sort of plastic ribbon thing that is used to help pull the batteries out when they need replacing.<br/><br/>The mouse is fitted with the usual two buttons and a wheel. The wheel is the sort that softly clicks as one turns it. the wheel has a vertical click movement too.<br/><br/>On connecting the receiver to a windows machine the drivers will start to download. I have no idea what you do with linux or Apple machines, but I expect the process is similar. If the mouse does not connect properly after the drivers finish downloading, there is a button in the underside of the mouse to signal the receiver to try again.<br/><br/>Upsides:<br/><br/>Inexpensive at around $18. Good size for the hand. Once installed works well on desk-type surfaces or on fabric upholstery from my tests.<br/><br/>Downsides:<br/><br/>As expensive as the better (in my opinion) Logitech m325.<br/>Two AAA's less convenient in my household than Logitech's single AA.<br/>Contour less comfortable in my hand than Logitech m325.<br/>Mouse wheel lacks the "side click" capability of Logitech m325.<br/>Plastic battery removal ribbon gets in the way when trying to refit battery door.<br/><br/>Annoyances:<br/>Switch very small and fiddly.<br/>Battery door pops off when mouse dropped. Good luck finding it under the furniture. The design is an "unlatch, swing out and remove" one, with the door itself being small enough you'll want to take care to put somewhere it can't walk away from while you install the batteries.<br/>The drivers seemed to take forever to install from Windows Update, far longer than the Logitech m325.<br/><br/>The whole seems to be an older design than the equivalent Logitech m325. If you have the choice I'd say go for the Logitech m325, which costs about the same on Amazon right now. It just seems to be better thought-out.
 I've had some bad luck with off brand mice (Anker, etc...). Thus far I have been presently surprised with this one. Good size / feel. It is small than a typical corded mouse but frankly I've never liked dragging those monsters across the table. My hands are above average size and this mouse is still fine to use. It has an accessible ON/OFF button. I have some with out and some where you had to access the switch inside the battery cover (pretty dumb, no?). Anyway this is right on the bottom and makes it easy to click it off when dropping it into your computer bag. If you want to store the dongle you have to open the battery cover but for me this is no big deal as I do not do it often. The only strange thing about the mouse is that the batteries angle into the unit and there are no clear +/- markings. You can figure out which way the batteries go in by looking at the shape of the terminals but it isn't instantly clear when you first look at it. Connect instantly on my HP laptop.<br/><br/>**Edit - The AmazonBasics batteries that come with the mouse are flaming turds.<br/>**Edit #2 - Right click button no longer functioning after a few weeks worth of use. Tried on multiple computers.
 This mouse eats batteries like crazy. I'm lucky to get 2 weeks out of them and I turn it off whenever I'm away from the computer. I expected a whole lot better and am very disappointed.  Next time I'll spend a little more and get a decent mouse. The ones I use on my other 2 computers  combined have used less batteries in a year than this one has in 3 mos or so.
 I really have nothing against a basic utility mouse.  The problem is that I bought 2 of these and both of them have the same problem, about a 2 week battery life.  If you turn it off when you're not using it, it'll last much longer, but who does that?  I've tried, but it's tough to remember every time... and nearly impossible when there are others in the house using one of these.  While this may seem cheap, it's not if you're replacing the batteries at least once a month, for a computer used a couple times a week.
 I regret buying this product. Normally Amazon basics are  well constructed, sadly this mouse is not !. Many previous reviews have noted the failures of this mouse,  I stupidly thought "how could Amazon  get it wrong with such a simple item", and thus ignored the bad reviews.<br/><br/>As the reviews have noted the battery door pops off continuously. This is simply poor design, the battery door is super thin plastic and the tongue of the latch is about 1mm wide giving it little chance of staying closed under any normal use.<br/><br/>The battery location is also poorly designed causing the batteries to pop put if you simply pick up the mouse and place it down. It could be the batteries banging on the battery door that cause the door to pop out, I have used this 3 times ( and had the door come off and batteries dislodge twice already).<br/><br/>The upside ( and thus its a 2 star ) is the rest of the mouse is fine, it feels good in the hand, the electronics works well, resolution is superb, it doesn't lose bluetooth connectivity with my macbook pro ( unlike Apples magic mouse ). In all it feels great, looks good, it just needs a working battery door, and a change to the battery holder, then it would be a 5 star product.<br/><br/>Do not buy this product. And dear Amazon, I am happy to discuss this with product control, mouse serial number is 6F18605082B, you know how to contact me.
 After going through 5 or 6 mouses (yes, the debate on mice vs mouses for computer is still going on...), I've finally settled on this one. What I was looking for was a mouse that doesn't have a three button wheel (center, left and right) because I use the center wheel button to open a link in a new tab in Mozilla; the problem with other mouses (or mice) was that they many times went back or forward because of the three buttons. This one is perfect in that respect.<br/>The original batteries drained in a few months (there was a red blinking light on it and functionality was reduced) so I'll see how long the new ones last.<br/>It was a little small at the beginning but it took me half of day to adjust.<br/>It's not loud and it looks rather classically professional, if that makes sense :)<br/>Overall, a good buy.<br/>Hope this helps :)
 Purchased this mouse in August of 2016.  It lasted until May of 2018, two months shy of 2 years.  This mouse worked relatively well while it was working.  It does come with a manual ON/OFF switch, which is necessary as it eats through batteries.  I gave it 3 stars because it works pretty well, but I didn't like how quickly it went through batteries, 2 AAAs at a time, and I don't think it has good longevity.  It did not get heavy use.<br/><br/>My wife also uses this mouse and had to replace hers in less than a year although honestly I can't remember why.  It may not have been due to premature product failure.  Anyway, this time I'm trying an equivalently priced mouse made by VicTsing. I just received it today so the jury is still out on this one.  All I can say at this point is it works. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/VicTsing-MM057-2-4G-Wireless-Mouse-Portable-Mobile-Optical-Mouse-with-USB-Receiver-5-Adjustable-DPI-Levels-6-Buttons-for-Notebook-PC-Laptop-Computer-Macbook-Black/dp/B013WC0P2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VicTsing MM057 2.4G Wireless Mouse Portable Mobile Optical Mouse with USB Receiver, 5 Adjustable DPI Levels, 6 Buttons for Notebook, PC, Laptop, Computer, Macbook - Black</a>
 This is a solid mouse for the price. I bought this to accompany my MacBook Pro. The mouse works well and I have had no latency or connectivity issues with it. I would say the only two drawbacks are the following:<br/><br/>1) The mouse is a bit small for my hands. I'm a 33 year old man, and my hands completely engulf this mouse. My wife really likes the size. Since this is traveling around with my laptop, the smaller size might be appropriate. I wouldn't use this for a desktop, however.<br/><br/>2) Apple is forcing the issue of using USB C as a standard. My MacBook Pro doesn't have a standard USB port, so I have an adapter with a USB port. Unfortunately, the standard Apple adapter only has one USB port. If I need to use my flash drive, then I have to give up my mouse. Given the popularity of Apple laptops, it would be nice if Amazon provided a version with a USB C receiver instead of the one included here.<br/><br/>The above comments are really specific to me. This is a solid option if you want a wireless mouse, and I recommend it.
 bought this mouse on 6/29/16 and loved it. then about 2 months later the battery cover wouldn't stay on the mouse. no problem, i used it without the cover fine. now the mouse keeps turning off involuntarily during use ... very annoying.<br/>now I have to buy another, non-microsoft product since I'm not adept at using the touchpad on my laptop.<br/><br/>Update to my initial review: sent defective mouse back to Amazon BUT apparently they are claiming that they did not receive it and I can't prove that I sent it so guess what, they billed me for the replacement. It's only $11.69 BUT it's doubly annoying that I've had to buy a second one.<br/><br/>Update 5/22/17: My second replacement mouse just died. Replaced batteries but mouse just keeps turning off. Charged for two of these and none of them lasted a year. Going back to Best Buy and Logitech.
 I have tried many variations of the standard computer mouse over the years. You probably have too.  From weird angles, extra buttons in the scroll, funny side buttons that only make you go backwards on your web browser...Sometimes, you just want a point, click, scroll...and that's it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> - This mouse delivers on simplicity. It doesn't have fancy advanced features.  This basically functions as a point and click. It has a left and right hand button to do those old fashioned right and left button tasks.  It has a basic scroll button. It's low tech features, but quality built for those features that it has.<br/> - It seems to work on most surfaces without a mouse pad.<br/> - Cost is ridiculously low.  It's almost so low that you question its quality.  In this case - it's Amazon. Amazon has really delivered on their Amazon Basics division. This falls neatly into that category of awesome but inexpensive Amazon Basics stuff.<br/> - Connected within a second to my computer (Mac).  I don't see any connectivity issues.  I didn't have to download drivers at all.<br/><br/>Cons<br/> - I haven't used it long term yet so if there is a break down, or the battery life turns out to be poor, I will update.  For now, it's behaving beautifully.<br/><br/>Overall, if you miss a nice, simple, uncomplicated mouse - start here.  Worst case scenario, you can return it. After all, Amazon has been standing behind their stuff for a while now so I'm not afraid to start with theirs and see how well they did.  This is another one that didn't disappoint and it cost 50% less than its nearest competitor (at the time I bought it at least).
 The mouse is too small. Worse yet, after inserting into USB and pulling out, the metal part of the receiver stayed in the laptop. I am disappointed.
 The process of opening the package and setting up the mouse is maddeningly difficult and requires use of a spotlight and a magnifying glass,  The mouse comes in a cardboard box which does not reveal its contents without ripping the cardboard to shreds.  Installing the batteries requires figuring out the plastic strip (which is intended to help remove the expired batteries later but just gets in the way when the mouse is new) and finding the "+" and "-" marks that show which way to insert each battery. Finding the nano USB transceiver and removing it was much easier than I have experienced with other similar models,  The mouse-- smaller than the old-style wired models-- is a comfortable size although I have large hands.  The scroll wheel does not roll smoothly but moves in a soundless click-click-click motion-- I can't say I like it, as the screen I am scrolling moves in a jerky fashion.The mouse has only very basic functions, but it does them well enough for the price.
 This mouse has worked great through 6 months of daily use so far.  I got one for me and my wife and we are both very happy with them.  It makes such a difference to not have to use the track pad on the laptop.  It is nice that you can turn the mouse "off" to conserve battery or if you are travelling with it so it doesn't run the battery down or annoyingly shine its red laser in your bag.  The USB connector also stows conveniently inside the battery compartment, but I mostly just leave it plugged into my laptop since it is so low profile (it sticks out just over 1/4" or so).  Great mouse, great value!<br/><br/>Update: As of month 7 of use, my wife's mouse began acting erratically.  Sometimes the clicks worked, sometimes not.  Then the computer wouldn't register mouse movements.  It would work for about a minute after turning it off, and replugging the USB connector into the computer, then it would stop working again.  I tried cleaning it and replacing the batteries, but this did not help. I also tested it on a different computer.  It seems that the durability of this mouse is not great.  I have adjusted my rating to 3 stars since 7 months is not an acceptable life span for a mouse.<br/><br/>Update 2: Amazon provides a 1 year warranty on this product, which they promptly fulfilled after I sent the above information to them.  I have received the replacement mouse and am, needless to say, very pleased with Amazon's customer service.
 I bought two of these in September 2015 for work. One just failed a couple weeks ago; I'll never know how the other one would have lasted because I let one of my attorneys borrow it for a presentation - the nub was still hooked into the laptop when he came back, but he has no idea where the mouse went (schmuck).<br/><br/>As far a functionality goes, they're awesome. I do a lot of courtroom work with both mac and PC laptops, and they're just simple, efficient, plug/play devices. I'm ordering two more (and will never loan them out again).<br/><br/>8/6/2016 update: Yep, I'm an idiot. It wasn't the mouse that failed; it was the pack of AZBasic batteries I was using. I pulled the never-used set out from the "dead" mouse and put them into the new one, and it failed. Then I pulled another couple sets from the same pack out and tried them on all three, and the meeces failed. So, then (sorry, this is already boring), I used a completely different batch of AZBasic batteries in all three, and all of them work fine.<br/><br/>It was just that pack of batteries. Bumping the mouse up to 5 stars; these things are great. Now I have to figure out what to name the three of them.
 Bought this to replace an old Microsoft USB mouse that was falling apart. Like the blue color, and the shape and size is similar to my old mouse, but after a few minutes use I have the feeling that the mouse wants to slide forward from my hand - this might become annoying.<br/>Major drawback: The dongle storage is inside the battery compartment. My old mouse had it in the bottom of the mouse, which was very convenient since I removed and stored it every night after work.<br/>Minor drawback 1: The dongle sticks out about a full centimeter, larger than my old mouse.<br/>Minor drawback 2: Battery insertion is confusing<br/>Major plus: Came with two batteries! Nice packaging too, all recyclable.
 mouse is great, got two of them bc for christmas my partner and I figured the other could use one, but I had already gotten myself a bluetooth mouse. So I needed to return this one.... Amazon.. of all sellers... wanted almost $9.00 to ship this back. The f-ing thing is 11. I had to return a hat I got from Amazon seller and they didn't charge anything, this dinky mouse and they want $9? Its just disrespectful and aggravating as all hell. Magically, when I go to "leave seller feedback", the ONLY item in my order (out like 10 items) that is mysteriously missing to review about, is this mouse. So, yes, the mouse is great, its a basic simply USB nano mouse, they've been around for years, its nothing new. Good, cheap, functional... but if you happen to get one too many, or oops you don't need it like you thought... be ready to lose 95% of the value of this thing automatically. Obviously I'm not returning it, ill resell it or give it to one of my students. Like its almost 2017... could we stop charging people f874628759024562387462 dollars to ship a 5 ounce mouse? Expected more from Amazon.
 At first when I got this mouse, I was so excited about the quality and user-friendliness of it.  The soft material on the top of the mouse was comfortable to use (although gets dirty kind of easily since it is matte) and I liked that I did not have to have a mouse pad underneath it in order for it to work.  After a couple months of use, I became a bit frustrated with the battery life.  I've already had to change the batteries 2-3 times even though I always turn it off when I'm not using it.  Co-workers of mine with other wireless mouses haven't had to change their batteries for 1-2 years, and their models only use 1 AA battery vs. the 2 AAA batteries this mouse requires.  Finally, again after only a few months of use, my mouse has inexplicably stopped working.  It won't connect to my laptop or desktop, even though I have tried all USB ports, hitting the connect button, and restarting my computer.  I was considering ordering a new one, but based on some of these other reviews this seems to be a constant issue.  Will be ordering a more reliable mouse this time.
 Several months ago when the keys on my laptop mouse pad started to go out, I was really irritated because I have gotten so used to using the mouse pad that I was worried that I wouldn't be able to work as efficiently using a wireless mouse. I knew that it would only be a few days before the keys got to the point that I wouldn't be able to use them and started looking on Amazon for a wireless mouse that I might possibly be able to stand using on a daily basis. I spotted the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse and thought that it wouldn't be that great because it was way cheaper than most of the other wireless ones that I could find. I went ahead and placed my order because I needed something and thought that if it didn't work that well, I wouldn't be out of that much money. When it arrived, I was happy to see that it was a tad bit smaller than other ones that I have used with desktops in the past since I have small hands. I opened the package, popped in some batteries, plugged the nano receiver into my USB slot, and it was working instantly. I thought that it would take some time to install ( I did not read much on it when I purchased it honestly, I just needed one quick!), but was SO happy to see that it needed nothing to be installed. I have been using this wireless mouse for about a year and half now and I have recommended it to SO many people who were looking for one. I work at home on my laptop 7 days a week and anywhere between 12 - 18 hours a day. I only have to change the batteries about once every two months (sometimes it will go a little longer and sometimes a little bit less - not sure on why though). This mouse has worked flawlessly since the day of purchase and I was SO wrong to think that because it was cheaper than the others that it wouldn't work as well. There has never been a time where it disconnected from the computer or that there was any issue using it. A few times when it has needed the batteries changed and I wait a few days, there is a tiny lag - but that is all my fault. The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse has a little red indicator light that lets you know when the batteries are getting low and need to be changed. I like that feature so that I'm always aware of when they need to be changed. Since I travel a lot, this mouse is great because it doesn't take up a lot of space in the laptop bag. I also never have to worry about losing the nano receiver because once you remove the little door to the battery area, there is actually a space that the nano receiver clicks into making it perfect for travel. If you are in the market for a great wireless mouse, I would recommend the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse because it has been through over a year of my all day, everyday use and still works just like the day that I purchased it!
 Some of the issues are minor, but one really makes it hard to use.<br/><br/>First, the minor issues:<br/><br/>* The wheel is too easy to click. I found myself accidentally clicking it many times while scrolling. I guess I could get use to this, over time.<br/>* The nano receiver sticks out pretty far.<br/>* The bottom of the mouse comes off too easily. It can pop off just by putting it in your computer bag.<br/>* The "soft touch" texture easily collects dirt and oil, and from previous experience I know it will eventually rub off.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is the sensor. I had a lot of trouble finding a surface that it worked with. Even then, the mouse cursor will sometimes shake or jump around, like it's detecting movement even when left still. I've miss-clicked things already and even watched the mouse cursor "dance" when I wasn't even touching the mouse.
 Not worth it. It truly isn't. Not when for not much more money you can buy a Logitech mouse that is proven quality. This mouse is inconsistent at best. It EATS batteries like crazy. And do NOT use this for any photo editing as it skips and its scroll wheel misses quite a bit. It's a cheap product being peddled as 'quality'. It isn't.<br/><br/>Almost forgot, I had batteries leak in this mouse. When was the last time you've seen that? They were Amazon AAA's and they leaked. Same environment as Logitech and Microsoft mice. And they never leaked.
 Purchased in February, but I don't think I even started using it until the start of summer. But now here it is August. It started about a month ago, being buggy. For example, double clicking, per se when I would only click once. Trying to move the cross hairs in excel, it would highlight many more cells that I was attempting to. In Word, I would try and copy or cut paragraphs, and it would highlight much more than I was attempting too as well. In photoshop, same issues- trying to edit photos where trying to change the size of say a selected area, I would have to stop and redo so many times because it was not expanding as I intended, or it would stop. In games, when "looting", I would right click to loot and within a half a second to one second later, the mouse would right click again on its own. I thought it was me for a bit, until just all sorts of bugginess kept continually happening. I changed back to my old logitech mouse and everything was back to normal (usually I used logitech). I really liked the feel and how the mouse worked to start, such a shame it did not last. I liked that it was smaller in size. I do not necessarily have small hands, I usually wear a woman's medium in gloves, but I felt with the smaller size I had more control and it was just so much more comfortable in my hand.
 This is a pretty good mouse, especially for people who don't need DPI adjustment like I know some users do. As a regular wireless, optical mouse, this mouse definitely gets the job done and for a nearly unbeatable price. However, it takes 2 AAA batteries instead of one or two AA batteries like most wireless mice do, and while replacing the batteries isn't a frequent occurrence, it is something of a pain, which is why I'm giving this mouse 4/5 stars. Trying to pry the batteries out by hand or pen is difficult. The mouse comes with a little wedge thing that is used for aiding in this process, but I still found it relatively tricky to do. Additionally, the wedge makes it difficult to then replace the batteries after taking them out. So, basically, you're either going to have some trouble getting the batteries out or getting them in, perhaps both, hence my 4-star rating. Other than that, as a wireless, optical mouse, it's great - it's sleek, it's functional, has great reception, etc. In all important areas except battery replacement, this mouse shines.
 When I purchased this mouse about a year ago I honestly didn't expect much.  The price through me off.  I thought that something this cheap would just be a cheaply made product and do the job for a while.  Here I am a year later with the mouse still going strong and looking great and I am really impressed.  This isn't a top of the range mouse but it has all of the high quality things that you really need in a mouse.  The tracking on the mouse is accurate and not jumpy.  The buttons have lasted really well for all of the shooting I have done on COD and even the feel of the material and balanced weight of this mouse really impress me.  Well worth the money.  I have a $100 wireless mouse at home and I use this one for on the road as it is nice and compact and it has really served me well.  Good job Amazon.  Keep it up.
 The reasons it's basic and inexpensive:<br/><br/>1. Most small wireless meeses I've purchased used one AA battery. This uses two AAA's.<br/>2. Most had a docking transceiver stick that powered down the mouse when docked. This stows the stick inside the battery compartment. One has to manually power it off.<br/>3. Most had a more positive locking battery compartment.<br/>4. Most had finger grooves for better ergonomics.<br/><br/>I had two Logitech's and a Microsoft that all just failed. So, I once again trusted Amazon Basics to offer a product that worked at a low price. In spite of its trade-offs, I felt much better when I ordered three that arrived with other stuff in a Prime shipment.<br/><br/>I put two out of three in service immediately on Windows 10 laptops with no issues except my failure to read the instructions on polarity of the battery contacts. I already remedied that problem for future battery changes (see picture).<br/><br/>I don't mind switching the mouse off when it's not being used, and leaving the little wireless transceiver in the laptops' USB slot is not a problem due to its teeny size. I figure after booting my laptop, if the mouse doesn't work, an LED light will go on over my head to remind me to power it up.<br/><br/>The best thing is if these puppies fail after a reasonable time period, it won't seriously change the cost-benefit ratio.
 This is a standard mouse with no bells and whistles.. It's of a nice size and classic shape that I really appreciate...I'm no fan of the new fangled space age shapes that are around today that I happen to find uncomfortable and hard to use...I also don't have any favor for the mice that you can program the buttons.  I have had them in the past and have never had any use for the programming...This mouse has none of that as to some weird shape, nor any programming that I never use anyway.  As for its installation and performance, there was nothing to it.  I still use an old laptop with Vista and all I did was plug in the USB adapter, waited about 10 seconds or so and then it was recognized and up and working ever since...No software needed or drivers to be found.<br/><br/>Now for the down side...This is one heavy mouse.  Back heavy, with the rear end on it just being too heavy for regular use in my opinion. Once you install the two AAA batteries that come with it, forget it... I found that even in a level surface I had to pick this up and re position it for it would just get stuck somewhere with the back weight on it...I have used Logitech mouses in the past that are not only not back heavy, but perfectly balanced which means it hardly ever got stuck and had to be re positioned,  In fact I have one of both going here in different places and was able to swap out the two for comparison.  This one did the same thing on the other computer where it was temperamental.  This mouse has to be perfectly flat on a surface to function properly, and, it won't move your cursor at all if you lift one side of it off the mouse pad, even just a smidgen...And this is why it gets stuck and stops working all  the time. It just loses contact too easily with the surface.. I can lift one side of the Logitech a little from either end or side and it still works perfectly.  It's near perfectly balanced on both ends..Maybe others use this on a perfect surface and do not have the tracking problems I have had.  But in any event, I am going back to the Logitech that isn't so back heavy and sensitive.. Not recommended by me...
 If I was voting/reviewing on just the mouse alone...it would probably get 4 stars but with their wonderful customer service, they deserve 5. My issue with this mouse is that it goes to sleep after 8 minutes. It is not a huge deal, just a little inconvenient for me. To "wake it up" all you have to do is click the mouse once, so again, it is not a big thing, just personally I did not like that feature. It does save on battery usage though so I can see why they would add such a feature.<br/>My excellent customer service came when I emailed them (about 7 months now after my purchase) asking if there was a way to shut off the sleep mode. Unfortunately, there was not, but they could not have been nicer and even offered part of a refund due to any inconvenience. I actually declined the refund. They never misrepresented their product once and it honestly works great. It just contains a feature I don't like, and that is just a personal preference.<br/>I did suggest maybe making the sleep mode an option that you could turn on and off for future builds and they said they would forward that situation to their supplier.<br/>I would highly recommend this company. I would also recommend the mouse if the sleep mode feature is not an issue for you. It has a solid build. It's a perfect size with good button response.<br/>I will be purchasing a new mouse due to the sleep mode feature but it will certainly be from VicTsingDirect. Thank you for the excellent customer service.
 Summary: Great mouse, but too small. Needs to be offered in small, medium, and large sizes.<br/><br/>Setup was very straightforward. This mouse is great for situations where you have a desk or workstation and will use multiple laptops; or if you don't want the hassle of pairing a bluetooth mouse.<br/><br/>Why only 3 stars if the mouse is so great? It's uncomfortably small. The mouse will only be comfortable for someone with small hands. It will probably be perfect for a petite woman or child who's hands are smaller than mine. I wouldn't use it as a "laptop bag" mouse, though. The thin, bluetooth mice that don't have dongles are better for that purpose.<br/><br/>What's disappointing is that the larger mice cost twice the price, (and have lots of buttons I will never use.) All I need is this exact mouse, with just a little extra plastic to make it larger. It's like the mouse needs to be offered in small, medium, and large sizes.
 Bought this to go with my new desktop computer to decrease the number of wires, but doesn't work when Windows 10 says the device is ready. Also tried it on a laptop with the same result. Pressing the rest button on the mouse doesn't help. It's been too long to return it and I was going to just not worry about it, but maybe I'll try a replacement and see if it works better.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>Just got off of the online chat with Amazon, and the rep was willing to refund the item even though I am outside the return window. Way to go Amazon! On further investigation, I was looking at the user manual and it only says it is compatible with Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000--I expect the product was manufactured before Windows 8/10, but maybe these newer versions are not backwards-compatible. The product details page does say all versions of Windows as well as Apple OS X.
 About 7 years ago I had carpal tunnel surgery due to using a keyboard and mouse.  Since then I thought my problems were over and have used cheap OEM keyboards and mouse(s), with no problems.  Recently my mouse stopped working so I borrowed a different mouse until I could order a new one.  No problem with the borrowed mouse, it fit my hand perfectly.  I have large hands but never really thought a computer mouse came in different sizes so wanting a wireless mouse I ordered this one based on the #1 most popular and near five star reviews.  What could go wrong?  Everyone loves this thing. Except me.  It is considerably smaller than any other mouse I have used.  When I opened it I thought it might be used by children and I received the wrong product.  No, the product numbers matched.  In conclusion you might want to buy a different mouse if you have large hands or joint pain.
 Overall, this mouse works and seems reliable. Unfortunately, my mouse has a slight issue where the front-left corner of the mouse sits above ground level. Thus whenever I try and hit the left/main button, the whole mouse leans towards the front-left and then the button clicks. While I thought that I could ignore this issue, after only a day of using it this issue really start to annoy me.<br/><br/>However, this is not a hard fix to make. Just like with a wobbling table or chair, you need to put a prop under the bad section in order to level it with everything else. I have bunch of circle stickers sitting in my desk that I used as the prop-up. I just stuck three of them stacked on top of each other under the front-left corner of the mouse, and there was no more wobbling.<br/><br/>Even though I fixed the issue and now the mouse works better, I still feel irritated about paying for something with an issue like this. It is quite annoying and made me feel like tossing this mouse the day I got it. Thankfully it is usable for me now, but I am not sure I will buy another one of these again. A friend of mine has this product too, and his does not wobble. So maybe this was just bad luck for me and if anyone decides to buy it, the mouse will hopefully not wobble on them.
 In most ways this a decent, basic mouse.  I am becoming more and more annoyed with it over time, though, because it doesn't glide smoothly enough.  It must be a problem with the four glider pads on the bottom.  It slides reasonably well when moving quickly, but when you slow down to zero in on a spot to click, it starts lightly grabbing, making the motion a bit jumpy.  This results in it taking multiple tries to land on a clicking spot, as you overshoot, back and forth.  I've tried cleaning it, and I've tried various surfaces, and none of it helps (except for a teflon sheet, which was viable only as a test).  Putting silicone lubricant on the pads helped briefly until it quickly wore off.  UPDATE:  I gave up on this mouse and stopped using it for the above reason.
 I sent a wireless mouse to my mother a month ago.  I went to visit her a week later and installed it for her.  She used it for almost three weeks and it pooped out.  Changing the battery did not help.  Reinstalling it did not help.  I started the process to return it and have it replaced, but my mother has no transportation to deliver it to a locker and no printer to create a return label.  The 30 day warranty was set to expire in 2 days, but I live 200 miles away.  Very disgusted.
 I use the Amazon Basics mice, and I've had good luck with them. I like to have a smaller mouse that fits into a pocket inside my backpack. It has been more reliable than other wireless mice I've used, which don't seem to agree with the dust in a backpack, and various conference rooms tables. I have four, at the office and at home, and none have failed yet.<br/><br/>The USB receiver stores easily inside, and isn't very large, so I usually just leave one plugged into my various laptops.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see there are some interesting colors (I ordered purple), though they could tone them down a bit and add some pattern. It's good to have some style, and when you need to have both personal and work laptops on the same table working from home, or in a backpack, it's great to be able to tell the mice apart.
 This mouse was adequate for about 3 months; then it started exhausting batteries like crazy (every 3 days - 3.  .  weeks).  Changing batteries on this mouse is more difficult than it has been on any other battery operated device I've ever had!  This uses AAA batts; the batts have to be placed PROPERLY  1 up; 1 down...no mistakes as to Left and Right allowed!  There are markings for + and -- down in the depths of the tiny battery slots; I  can't  see them without a flashlight! (I refuse to memorize how batts are inserted in each of my ridiculously numerous gadgets, just on general principles!)]!<br/>As if all the battery problems weren't sufficient, in the 4th month, the left and right "clickers" began acting  very unexpectedly!  Sometimes they worked and sometimes not.  I had to move my fingertips all over the place to find the spot where a clicker would actually click and had to hit that spot harder for each click!<br/>\
 I have been using an AmazonBasics wired mouse for several years but got tired of the cable so I decided to get a wireless one. After several days with it I would not recommend it as it very picky on what surface it will work on. I use a wood laminated table as a desk and this mouse will not work on it and some times not even on the Belkin mouse pad I have. It stutters at times when you move the mouse and does not always work. I have a few games I like to play but I will not even try with this mouse, that is how problematic it is. The problem could be because of how close it is to the tower and three monitors but that is not something that can be done. I am more than likely going to go back to the wired mouse. A better option would be one from Logitech but I have heard they go through batteries quick. I have never had a problem with Amazon branded electronics but I con not recommend this one.
 This is definitely NOT a Logitech  mouse!  I had always bought Logitech wireless mice in the past but thought I'd try and save a bit and take a chance on this Amazon brand.  (I had previously bought an Amazon Basics shredder and am very happy with it.)  Well, I am sorry to say that someone must have been napping when this thing went through Quality Control.  First of all, it did not work at all with the batteries that came with it.  Once I swapped in some new Duracell batteries, it came to life.  So now it's working---sort of.  It often freezes for a few seconds but eventually wakes back up.  This is an annoyance and not the quality I was expecting.  Bottom line, it works well enough for noncritical work but if 100% reliability is important, splurge on Logitech. Nice colors though.
 I love Amazon, and I love Amazon Basics batteries. I do not love this Amazon Basics mouse. Its on the smaller side from my old Microsoft wireless mouse, which I dont mind. The problem is it has been only working intermittently, sometimes in the middle of doing something it just stops working. I dont know if it is a signal problem or what but it is very annoying. I should just have to plug it in and only worry about it when the batteries die. I know technology isn't always perfect, but something as simple as this shouldn't give me issues.  I plan on returning it and buying a Microsoft wireless mouse, I never had issues with that one, it lasted years and years and I only replaced it due to me eventually just wearing the darn thing out!
 I hate to do a negative review because I really want to like a product I've chosen.<br/><br/>I bought this mouse to replace a Logitech MX Anywhere 2.  The Logitech had started giving false clicks, something I've seen is a common problem.  I thought I'd try something less expensive that seemed similar.<br/><br/>The price is right.  The receiver works well.  But the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse just doesn't move smoothly on the smooth plastic surface next to my keyboard.<br/><br/>It thought I might just be remembering wrong, so I switched back to the Logitech.  It is smooth as sik!  The AmazonBasics is jerky enough that you just can't easily get the precision needed to highlight text or click on a small button.<br/><br/>Too bad - I like the price!
 I've been using it for nearly a month and it has not failed in any way. That said, DO NOT try connecting the mouse's dongle into a multi-port hub connected to your computer with other devices connected to that same hub. It almost certainly will produce unacceptable anomalous behavior. That is, herky-jerky mouse pointer movement at the very minimum. Plug the mouse's USB dongle into a "dedicated" USB socket in the computer.<br/><br/>** CORRECTION ** update on 20 NOV 2018:<br/>My initial apparent malfunction connecting this mouse to my Sabrent 4-port USB3 hub was anomalous. I've since connected all manner of USB devices to the hub along with this mouse's dongle without any problems. This mouse is one heck of a bargain!
 I needed a quick replacement when my Logitech mouse decided to corrode in the battery compartment and forever stay off. I looked at the same mouse or similar and they were just not what I wanted to pay.<br/><br/>Long story short, Amazon kept popping this little guy in the results over and over again. Finally said I'd give it a go and it works better than all of the expensive ones I've purchased in the past. I don't think I could use anything but the Amazon Basics mouse.<br/><br/>AmazonBasics has some good things and this is another item they make now that's a value and works perfectly as well as the expensive versions!
 I just needed a wireless mouse because wired mouses are a huge pain for me - the mouse moves ever-so-slightly and resists ever-so-slightly with the wire, and it's super annoying.<br/><br/>This is on-par with basic wireless mouses you'd find at a big electronics store like Best Buy, and the price is about the same (or slightly cheaper) and it gets the job done. Nicely compact, really comfortable and familiar, and is mostly precise and smooth. I'd never drop $50 on a mouse (I don't think!), so this fits my needs and (lack of) nuance perfectly<br/><br/>UPDATE (09/30/16): Still works fine, ergonomics are nice. What I've found frustrating (mostly because I'm using a Mac) is the scrolling. Because the Mac scrolling is brilliant on a trackpad and a magic mouse, it feels harder to get used to the scroll wheel on a Mac. But also, the scrolling on a Mac is worse than it would be on a PC - scrolling the wheel one little interval 0 to 0.25 lines (an estimate) and scrolling more means it moves too much. So I still dig it and it's still serviceable, but Mac users should be aware that it won't scroll too cleanly.
 Updated review:<br/><br/>This was purchased: March 27, 2016, and Broke: March 4, 2018.<br/><br/>The mouse no longer will right click, I've tested with another computer and I've tried drivers and various other methods. The right button still makes its clicking sound but nothing happens.<br/><br/>I want to note that out of the two years I've used this mouse, I've probably used it about two or three dozen times, it was used lightly. It mostly just sat on a shelf, batteries were just replaced for the second time a few days ago. I rarely use my laptop, sticking to my desktop for nearly everything.<br/><br/>This could have just been a dud but who knows. I've contacted Amazon customer service and will go from there. I will probably try getting another one and seeing how it handles with everyday use. I've reduced my rating to three stars due to the fact that it broke with such light and infrequent use.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/><br/>I'm rating four stars because the quality of the material used is cheap. It's a mouse and honestly, there is not much more I can say. It does its job and does it well but nothing special is going on with this thing.<br/><br/>My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series, it has a touchscreen and touchpad. The mouse just gives me another option for using my laptop.<br/><br/>It's small and easy to load into my laptop bag. The receiver is also small so I can leave it in the USB slot and not worry about it being damaged like those earlier flash-drive sized receivers use to be. (I really hated those).<br/><br/>I do recommend this mouse if all you need is another option for scrolling/clicking. This is not a gaming mouse, you could use it for simple games like Farmville or Bejeweled but not much else. It takes two triple-a batteries. (AAA) It gives more precise clicking than the touchscreen and does not agitate my skin like the touchpad.
 It's important to understand what this mouse is. This is a cheap mouse for you to use while on the go. If you're expecting more than that you're going to be disappointed. I actually bought this mouse for my grandparents. I built them a computer when I was 16 (almost 10 years ago). It finally died last week. My grandma said she wouldn't mind having a laptop but would probably wait until after they pay their taxes (Upper Middle-class taxes are rough for a retired couple). I went ahead and bought her a laptop I thought she could use without her needing to call me everyday for troubleshooting. I picked up this mouse to go with it.<br/><br/>I love this mouse. It's smaller than the wireless one I use with my laptop. It's very light. It's cheap enough that if I forget it somewhere I'm only out a small amount of money. I can buy multiple to have in storage as just in case mouses. This is a great mouse. It's simple.
 I have a new laptop - I am a DESKTOP PC person because I just like the keyboard and weight of it all....but I digress.  MOUSE.  New to laptop.  Got a 17" HP Envy to break myself into laptops.  HATE the built in "mouse" that really isn't.  I mean, who could ever use that with any speed and efficiency.  I have a pricey Logitech wireless mouse for my desktop (which I do love) and decided to try this VERY economical Amazon wireless for my new Laptop/Notebook.  I am extremely happy with this mouse.  It is smooth, doesn't go on landslides of fast scrolls and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  For those who use the mouse more than the keyboard, perhaps they would want the pricey ergonomically perfect mouses....but for those of us who TYPE a lot and cruise the internet and just need the mouse to click now and then and scroll when we want to do that, this is an excellent choice.  I have had absolutely no problems with it after using it a few months.
 I plugged it in, turned it on and I was mousing like a Boss!<br/>I am so pleased!<br/><br/>I just recently decided I needed another wireless mouse. My last one was a Logitech that I purchased in store at a local Staples. It's great, still working but I like to leave it connected to my desk top computer and wanted another mouse for dedicated use with a new laptop.<br/>Since this is a total, first world sort of, luxury purchase I looked on Amazon instead of doing a local in store purchase. Since I could take my time and wasn't in desperate need of one.<br/><br/>I love the idea and affordability of A,mazon's Basics line. (I have an awwwwesome tech bag they make) so I decided to give this mouse a go. It's quite a bit cheaper than the Logitech mouse I got for my desk top, like...6 to 8 dollars cheaper, I don't have the exact LOgitech mouse price in front of me. It was affordable enough this Basics one that I wondered "What's the catch?"<br/>The awesome reviews and Prime shipping convinced me to give it a try and I am soooo pleased!<br/><br/>It's kind of pretty much exactly like my Logitech mouse. The only differences I can see are colour, styling and.....*jumped up and checked out my desk top mouse during this pause* that's it! Those are the only differences, a styling and colour difference!<br/><br/>They both have the little USB Nano receiver thingamajig, both take a couple of batteries that are included, both connected instantly and thus far work smoothly and well...except this Amazon Basics one is a better deal!!!<br/>The Logitech one takes a couple of AA and this Basics one takes a couple of AAA in case that sort of thing interests anyone.<br/>We keep a small supply of rechargeables of both sort of batteries in house here to supply power to various and sundry things so the AAA is no issue.<br/><br/>Yay, I like saving money.<br/>I'll be sure to post long term updates if anything changes but you can go on the assumption if I don't pupdate it's the "no news is good news sort of thing" and that all is functioning well :)<br/><br/>Anyhoo, I highly recommend :)
 I purchased one of these a couple years ago for my home computer and it's been great.  This year I purchased the exact same product and the base of the mouse is warped.  Which means that no matter which surface I place it on (dining room table, desk at work, kitchen table, etc) it has a wobble to it.  If I use a mouse-pad it's less noticeable.  Some people may not be bothered by this, but it's annoying to me.  Maybe I'll make a small paper and tape shim to even it out.  If amazon wanted to QA/QC this, they should place the product on a machined surface (such as a table saw metal table) to see how many millimeters it's warped.  It's probably due to a cheap battery cover. (see image)
 After purchasing a laptop, I found certain tasks to be slightly annoying to complete with a touchpad. Ultimately, using excel became extremely frustrating at times.I also did not want to spend $30-$50 on a mouse that I would use occasionally. With that, I ordered this mouse. Here is what I have noted:<br/><br/>Things I Like:<br/>-The mouse connects to the computer very quickly and responds to movements accurately. The Nano USB plug has a nice slot inside the mouse and holds firmly inside of the computer. Because of its small form factor, you can simply leave it in your computer at all times without worrying about damaging it.<br/>-The quality of the mouse is great. Amazon Basics has really outdone themselves with a mouse at this price range. It has lasted a few months so far and still looks and works as if it just came out of the box.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/>-There really isn't much.<br/><br/>Ultimately, This mouse connects quickly and responds accurately. Additionally, although value is opinion based, the mouse is extremely good for the money; I have not found another one of such good quality at this price range. For such a low price, I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this product to anyone who needs a simple mouse for every day tasks or day to day work. I will be looking to Amazon Basics for future electronic needs.
 The distress set in when the trackpad on my computer broke. I went directly to Amazon to get a new clikity clicker ASAP. I found this Amazon mouse and bought it right away because it was cheap and made by Amazon. I thought I could trust Amazon, they had delivered that last minute gift for my brother on time and had gotten me the book I needed for a class the next day. Amazon was my hero and savior swooping in to save me from potentially terrible situations.<br/><br/>Yet in this situation, Amazon let me down. Amazon, buddy, please, don't do this to me. It was so disappointing when after a month the mouse broke. Just stopped working. Out of thin air the little itsy bitsy mouse wouldn't move the curser on my computer. I was frantic. I did everything to try to find a solution, but nothing seemed to work! I changed the batteries and tried different ports, but to my dismay nothing worked.<br/><br/>I loved this little mouse, but am so sad to see it go. It helped me out when my computer failed me, yet now it has failed me too. I guess I can't trust any technology.
 I have now gone thru 3 of these...very frustrating!  The same thing happened with all three...after awhile the battery on the right side will not stay in place.  Which means the mouse will not work until I remove the battery, put it back in and press down hard....continually repeating this while working is as I said, frustrating.  I am now going to order another brand...too bad because this model is very comfortable to use.
 I purchased this wireless mouse for use at work, and I'm so impressed at the agility and ease of it.  I feared that it would be too small (I read too many reviews, but hey...in the end I always make up my own mind), but it fits just perfectly in my hand.  Having said that, I DO have small-ish hands.<br/><br/>If you buy this product, please note that the receiver is in the base of the mouse -- I nearly returned the mouse because I couldn't find the receiver.  It's right there within the battery well.  Also, the batteries (and they are included) go in at a weird angle, so you might have to fiddle with it for it register.  When the red light on the back becomes solid, you know you've got them in correctly.  I haven't had any trouble with the "Off/On" switch.  I use the mouse vigorously, and it stays securely "On" while I'm using it, and turn it off (and put it in a drawer) when I go home at night.  I'm definitely impressed with AmazonBasics -- bringing you quality at such a great value.  I have a Logitech wireless mouse at home, and I dare say, this one is more agile than that one.  I'm considering buying another one to replace it!
 This wireless mouse works great. It takes two triple A batteries and has a USB receiver that you plug into your laptop every time you want to use the mouse. When not in use, there is an on/off switch underneath the mouse and the USB receiver plugs back inside where you install the batteries. It's perfect for traveling since this Amazon mouse is smaller than the standard size mouse. I use it with my Dell XPS 13 laptop and it works perfectly, no complaints. It doesn't lag or have any interference. The roller to scroll doesn't make any noise at all and the mouseclicks are subtle but definitely audible. I definitely recommend this mouse, especially with the price point. I have yet to encounter a bad amazon electronic product.
 For the money this mouse is a good performer but not without a few niggles. The first and foremost requirement in using a mouse is comfort. No matter how accurate, expense or inexpensive a mouse is, if it hurts your hand using it then it's not worth the asking price. This uni-hands mouse is comfortable for most size hands. No cramping or prolonged aches in the joints or fingers from using the mouse or clicking on the buttons.<br/><br/>With regards to pointer accuarcy and movement, the mouse is highly accurate with no adjustments to pointer speed or acceleration in Windows 7 or Windows 8. Movements from side to side on the screen accurately translate to your hand movements. On some low budget wireless mouse they can exhibit cursor bounce. That's where you click on a link and the mouse cursor jumps. That's not a problem with this low budget mouse.<br/><br/>I found that Windows 7/8 quickly loaded the appropriate driver to the mouse. Because no user mouse drivers are included with this mouse in some cases certain features maybe missing such as wake up computer with the mouse. That will depend on the type of computer you have so in some cases that feature might be available in the power mgmt tab in device mgr.<br/><br/>There are two small issues I do have with the mouse. One of the is battery life. It could be better as some low budget Logitech wireless mouses offer 1 year battery life. I find with moderate use my batteries will last 1-1.5 months. I purchased Amazon Basics AAA rechargeable batteries. So that added to the cost of the mouse. The other issue that has developed is vertical wheel scroll bounce. That's where you scroll up and down and without any further input from the wheel, the webpage or document page jumps up or down, sort of like a recoil effect. It doesn't happen a lot but it has started to become a little frequent. I will keep an eye on that.<br/><br/>So in summary, it's a good buy but consider battery life and possibly scroll wheel bounce. So -1 Star for the two small issues i've encountered so far.
 I have bought dozens of these mice for work purposes.  Overall I thing they are good mice for the price.  But I have found they are not all created equal.  Having held or used as many different ones as I have had, I noticed many of them do not operate as well as others. The wheel and clickers are where I see/hear the biggest differences. Some of them have a wheel that makes almost no noise, some of them have a wheel that makes a loud enough clicking noise to be heard way across the room.  Same with the left and right clicker buttons.  Some of them make almost no noise, some make a very loud annoying noise.  I wish the mouse feet were raised a bit higher.  The smallest grain of dirt seems to get stuck under these mice and slow them down. I also don't understand why these mice need two batteries.  I have used plenty of mice that got along fine with just one. All these grips aside, for the price, it feels good to hold and performs well for a no frills mouse. Recommended if you get lucky and get one of the quiet ones.
 For the price, I can’t say that I could have asked for much more from a mouse. It feels great in the hand, and both buttons click nicely. I’ve been using it for about 2 months without a mouse pad, and the laser just about never results in the cursor “skipping” or getting stuck. Additionally, the setup couldn’t have been easier. I just plugged in the USB wireless receiver, and the MacBook instantly recognized it.<br/><br/>The only negative I have is with the mouse is that the matte finish that Amazon chose. It looks awesome and feels great in the hand, but if you are like me, greasy fingerprints do show up occasionally and require some wiping. It’s not enough to discourage me from enjoying this mighty little mouse, though, as everything else about it is great for a sub $15 mouse. range could be better.
 It's ok. I wanted a cheap wireless mouse with no side buttons on it. This was it. It's close, but has a few issues. It's a little small, but not too big a deal. You get used to it after a while. However, the cursor can be a bit jerky from time to time, especially when you're in a program that has lots of features. I don't know if it's the mouse itself or the receiver or the driver, but it's a bit annoying to use. Not terrible, but not great.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Well, it seems the issue I had was not the mouse itself or the driver. Instead, it was the wireless signal. My receiver wasn't far from the mouse, only about 5 feet, but my computer is under the desk and I guess the signal has a tough time. I used a USB extender that I had from my previous mouse so now the receiver is on the desk a couple of feet from the mouse and the jitter is gone. I would think if you use this for a laptop it would be fine or if the receiver is in clear line with the mouse there shouldn't be any issues. I added a couple of stars since it's working fine for me.
 Very simple - no extra web browsing buttons and such to get in the way. Small, but has a good feel. The soft, rubbery texture on the top surface is actually quite luxurious. I wish that more expensive mice felt like this one. (May wear off over time - not sure.)<br/><br/>It is small, and definitely intended more for portability than for extended mousing sessions on a desktop PC, but it gets the job done. See pictures for size. This mouse runs from the tips of my fingers to the balls of my hand. Laser is visible, red light. The nano receiver is about the same size as Logitech receivers, maybe slightly larger with square corners.
 This mouse is a great, simple solution for a laptop. It has a comfortable feel and the color (a deep purple) is fantastic. It is a smaller size mouse, which makes it great for the laptop bag, but maybe not the best for standard use, unless this is for a kid's computer. Overall, I have been impressed by the AmazonBasics products, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>The one downside is that, unlike my Logitech wireless mouse of a similar size, the red LED appears to never turn off. While I like to make sure my wireless peripherals are powered down to conserve battery life, I appreciate mice that simply turn off the LED after a few minutes of inactivity (or that don't have this feature).
 The features are great, you get a plastic strip inside that will help you pull out the batteries when needed, the batteries are located at the bottom of the mouse so if you get battery leakage, it's not too problematic to clean up and won't damage the internal stuff. The dongle stores neatly/securely inside the battery compartment. The only complaint I have with the mouse is the very front of the mouse is not clickable which can be inconvenient for some, especially if you have a big hand. I can't comment on the durability since I just received it.<br/><br/>UPDATE: While all the features are well thought out, I found the tracking is pretty lacking, especially when I needed small precise movements, I've tried a brand new mousepad and a plastic mousepad with the same results. I dropped 1 star.
 Generally, I like this mouse.  Rolls easily, buttons click smoothly.  I don't use the tilting left or right of the scroll wheel so can't talk about that.  My only issue is batteries.  Goes through them rather quickly.  About 6 weeks between battery changes.  And it is abrupt.  No gradual slow down, just all at once, you can't move the mouse.  So it is a good idea to just keep a package of batteries in your desk drawer or your computer bag as the case may be.<br/><br/>Unlike others complaining about difficulty changing batteries, I can't say that is an issue.  Only an issue if you put them in backwards.
 Except for battery life this is an excellent wireless mouse.  It is reliable (after 8 months usage), comfortable, and has a multi-function scroll wheel.<br/>Battery life is fairly poor.  After almost exactly 9 months I am on my third battery change even though I often turn it off if I am gone for extended periods (days).  The unit provides no indication of low battery on my Win 10 system and just dies abruptly, which can be somewhat annoying.<br/><br/>Update: Device failed after 20 months - had brief intermittent operation then quit altogether.  New batteries, "Remove Device", reinstall, etc. Dead<br/>Further update:  Happened across another reviewer complaining about the dongle - yep that's the problem.  Worked with mine a while and it now works, at least for a while.
 I love AmazonBasics products, and this mouse is no exception.  AmazonBasics makes excellent quality accessories for very reasonable prices.  For example, I no longer purchase charging cables from Apple because Apple's cables are poor quality and start breaking down after a few months.  I only purchase AmazonBasics iphone charging cables because they LAST.  The first AmazonBasics cable I got was right before my daughter was born, so I've had that cable for 3 years now.....and IT STILL WORKS.<br/><br/>The great quality extends to this wireless mouse.  It has a great feel to it - the way it's shaped makes it feel very comfortable in my hand.  It has a kind of matte finish to it, so it has a little grip (I don't know what the material is called).  The mouse is really responsive.  I plugged the wireless dongle into my laptop, and it was recognized immediately.  Absolutely no setup, no drivers to download, nothing.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the wireless dongle is inside the mouse - you have to open up the battery compartment to get it.  I didn't realize that at first, so I was searching through the box, thinking I had dropped it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
   Update - 4/5/2016 ] Mouse is starting to die out.  Despite changing with fresh battery, I am noticing that signal is weak sometimes (cursor would lag before moving).  I suspect it maybe the USB receiver's connecting plates maybe wearing out.  I am now changing my primary mouse to Microsoft bluetooth mouse - so that I wouldn't have issues with plugging micro USB receiver on &amp; off.  It was good mouse while it lasted.  But it lasted no more than 1 1/2 year for me.<br/><br/>  Update - 5/18/2015 ] Previously, I've mentioned my complaint regarding gliding.  This can be easily solved by putting glider tape which can be bought for just few dollars.  Now I love this mouse with smooth gliding.<br/><br/>I have used Logitech Anywhere MX and Logitech Nano for many years.  Bought this as replacement for Anywhere MX as its left button started to not work (as reported by many for Anywhere MX review) after years (3+) of usage.<br/><br/>- For the price this is a great mouse.  Shape fits on my hand (medium/large male).  However, using it side by side I like the feel of Logitech slightly better.  This one is tad tall.<br/>- Gliding.  4/5 here - Logitech mouses glide much smoother without resistant.  I hope they can improve on the glide.<br/>- Tracking. 5/5 - no problem at all so far.<br/>- Battery life.  Have not used long enough to evaluate on this yet.
 I purchased a mouse, roughly two months into use it stopped working and I had to return it. The return process was very simple and easy, Amazon's policy is phenomenal. I received my new mouse approximately four days later, that one also lasted about a month and a half or so. So while the price point is there, the quality doesn't surpass the price.<br/><br/>In terms of actual use, it is a typical mouse - very reminiscent of the 90's, a little bulky and isn't exactly fit for your hand. By no means is it uncomfortable, but looking at other (more expensive) mouses (mice?) that are crafted to fit the user's hand, you can feel the difference in fit. Cursor movement is on point of what I would expect - no lagging, and it doesn't fly off the page at a sudden movement.<br/><br/>Overall, I would be likely to try this mouse again in the future - the price is great, and I would like to think that the two I received were flukes.
 I purchased this mouse many years ago, and it was a great tool for most of those years.<br/><br/>However at some point, I'd worn through the grippy-matte material on the scroll wheel. I wish this mouse's scroll wheel had notches, like a lot of other mice do. Once that grippy-matte material was gone, I would try to scroll and my finger would just glide over the button instead of scrolling.<br/><br/>It could have lasted longer, but unfortunately I needed to replace it. This time I'm purchasing something with scroll wheel notches. However, since it was so useful for 3+ years, I'll give it 4 stars.
 Laptops are great for portability, but sometimes you need just a little more desktop-style functionality in order to work efficiently. I prefer to use a fancier wired mouse in my permanent office, but these basic wireless ones are pretty handy to throw in a briefcase or backpack. I have bought several of this Amazon model, and both kids and adults use them in our household.<br/><br/>This mouse is smaller than others we own, which I think is a good thing both for carrying and for using in confined spaces. It doesn't feel as solid in hand as my others, but it is responsive with or without a pad. Battery life is acceptable since we aren't using this constantly, it's simply a better alternative than trackpad for some applications. And it's an inexpensive piece of kit so I'm not crying about it if the kids break or lose it.
 Lightweight, moves effortlessly, excellent mouse! Replaced my Logitech "Anywhere MX" mouse with this and could not be more happy! The Logitech was driving me nuts with selection errors and random weirdness that was going to cause a serious case of unintended consequence, if I didn't replace it.<br/><br/>I was never completely happy with the Logitech because it is heavy and difficult to move. It is also 4 times the cost of the AmazonBasics mouse. Quadruple the cost and nowhere near as "smooth" as the AmazonBasics mouse - this mouse is a winner!<br/><br/>And, yes, if you are used to pressing the center wheel to open a link in a new tab, this mouse does it!
 Looks and performs very good. Small and comfortable in the palm of your hand with fashionable outward aesthetics. I also have a similar Logitech mouse (M310 ?) that I use with my other laptop that is similar to this Amazon mouse but slightly more pricey that I purchased from BestBuy a couple of years back. They both look good and performance is the same. The biggest difference is when you look underneath. The Logitech has only one battery (instead of two), and the on/off switch is larger and easier to activate than the Amazon. The battery compartment door is also much more fragile looking as is the battery compartment overall on the Amazon mouse that you tend to notice when you first insert the new batteries that come with the unit. Considering the prices it is probably a toss up on selection depending on your priorities.
 When I first got this mouse it was wonderful. Fit my hand, wireless for flexibility, easy to use. But, after 3 months it died because of batteries were discharged. The light in the back of the battery stays on all the time and that runs down the battery. I am a long time computer user and have tired several types of mouse. I really liked this one. I loaded new batteries and I will see how long this lasts. If it is the same short time as before I will look for a different mouse. It is too bad, too, as I really found this mouse comfortable to use.
 I searched Amazon for a Bluetooth mouse.  I was in a hurry and didn't read what Amazon sold me closely enough.  Hey, Amazon, Bluetooth is not the same as Wireless.  When people search for a Bluetooth mouse, it's likely a Bluetooth mouse that they need.  I'm sure this is a great mouse, so five stars.  I put it in a public place for anyone to take who needs a "wireless" mouse.  My computer only has USB C ports so, without an adapter, with which I don't want to bother, this is just a careless purchase for which I have to take full responsibility.  If you want Bluetooth, read the fine print.
 We had the original magic bluetooth mouse by Apple.  I liked it, especially the feature that allows you to use your finger to move up and down the mouse to scroll without a scroll button.  However, not long after purchasing it, we noticed the battery would run out so quickly, and often times the mouse would disconnect then you'd have to "reset" it and reconnect, and eventually, the mouse completely stopped working.  I searched for a wireless mouse that would be compatible with our iMac and this came up as a top contender.  I am very satisfied.  Considering the price, you are really getting a a great value here.  The mouse works great, the battery doesn't run out so quickly like the old one did, and I have had no issues thus far.  And even if it started malfunctioning in 6 months or a year, I would be happy to repurchase for such a low, reasonable price.
 I have gone back and forth between 3 and four stars. This is a bummer because Amazon usually makes some really good stuff. The mouse is well made and very comfortable to use. The problem I have had with it is that the pointer floats around a bunch when you are not moving the mouse. At first, I used this mouse on weird surfaces so I thought that was the problem even though my last mouse handled it fine. Now I am using it on a mouse pad and have the same issue. Not sure if mine is just defective but it is too late to return it. I would recommend spending an extra $5 to get a better quality mouse.
 This is an excellent wireless mouse at this price point.  It's got a bit of a rubbery non-slip texture to it.  It takes two AAA batteries.<br/><br/>However, I personally like this one better: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Logitech-Wireless-Mouse-M185-Swift-Gray-910-002225/dp/B004YAVF8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logitech Wireless Mouse M185 - Swift Gray (910-002225)</a><br/>The reason is the Logitech's USB dongle is smaller (the smallest I've seen), it takes one AA, and I like the feel of it a little better.<br/><br/>Both the Amazon and the Logitech mice have on/off switches underneath to conserve battery, but even if you leave them on all the time they seem to last forever.
 I've had this mouse for two years but have recently purchased a Bluetooth mouse instead.<br/><br/>The reason?<br/><br/>The darn FOB/dongle for this wireless mouse seems to be fritzing out (issue started about 20 months after owning this mouse).<br/><br/>The cursor will jump around randomly or simply refuse to move. I thought it was a battery issue (replaced, no change) or dirt on the optics (cleaned, no change).<br/><br/>But when I apply pressure to the underside of the dongle (while it's plugged in), the cursor issues go away.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure if I can replace the dongle easily (seems like you should be able to) but with the time it will take me to figure that out and deal with it, I figure I'm better off buying the $15 Bluetooth mouse instead.<br/><br/>So, months 0 - 20, A+ mouse; months 20 and up, C- mouse.
 I've had this mouse for over a year and I use it constantly. It's held up quite well, although it's showing some wear, which you can see in the closeup. It's definitely on the small side, like other reviewers have noted, and the batteries are awkward to get out. Just make sure you leave the little plastic strip under the batteries when you replace them, and that allows you to pop them right out next time. Battery life is fair--it takes 2 AAA batteries, and I think I've changed mine three times in about 15 months, so not too bad. For the size, I would expect it to only take one battery, but oh well.
 I really wanted to like this, I used it for a couple months largely because I didn't want to have to spend more money replacing it, but eventually it just became too much of a bother. The mouse pointer has very poor accuracy, even when not moving it has a slight jitter to it. I play a lot of games on my computer and this mouse really made that difficult, it just didn't have the accuracy it should. I tried multiple mouse pads, matte, shiny, cloth, nothing seemed to make any difference. If I just used Facebook or word processors I doubt I would have even noticed, but for gaming this mouse was just terrible. I ended up going back to the Microsoft wireless mouse brand I've always used, the couple extra dollars was well worth the lack of aggravation.
 It's a great inexpensive mouse. Does the job. Battery life isn't great, but for my kids and as abusive and forgetful as they are, it's cheap to replace if lost or broken. I keep an extra one in my laptop bag as well for a backup.<br/><br/>Only downside is that it would be nice if you could program multiple mice to one dongle. Since I've got many of these mice, sometimes dongles go missing, or a mouse breaks, but still has a dongle, I can't pair any two together, so have to scrap both a perfectly good dongle and perfectly good mouse.
 I received this the other day. I was a little baffled because I could not find the nano receiver. I was about to contact Amazon and let them know about my issue when I looked down and found the nano receiver tucked between the two batteries. What a fantastic idea to be able to store the receiver within the mouse! The reason I am replacing my previous mouse was due to damage of the nano receiver which hangs off the side of my laptop. Now, I have a safe place to store it and is it is available when needed. Brilliant!
 This is the 2nd Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse I have ordered.  The first one (maybe 4yrs ago) worked great for along time.  Eventually  it seemed to loose connection and sometimes worked and sometimes did not.  I finally decided maybe it was just 'worn' out and tossed it and ordered another one.  This last one I ordered in January.  It started doing the same thing.  I can't even get it to work now and hasn't for about a month.  It is really frustrating.  I guess for the money what can I say.  But I think I will invest in another type this time around since this one didn't even work for a full 3mths.  It is so annoying especially when I am not used to using the touch pad!
 The mouse works fine, but I find that it eats batteries. I tried this with my boys' chromebook as I did not want to invest in an expensive mouse, they would most likely tear up, but I got frustrated by how fast it went through batteries. It does have a power switch on the bottom and I am sure that my boys would more often than not forget to turn it off, but other travel mice will auto shutdown to conserve battery life and this does not seem to do so. I purchaed another mouse with the auto off freature from Logitech, but will keep this around as a spare.
 I needed a new mouse and I guess I should have looked more closely at the shape. This mouse is not shaped well for my hand. It's fine if you just need to use it once in awhile but if your hand is going to be on it constantly it's uncomfortable.<br/><br/>All the buttons and wheel functions as expected it connected to my computer no problem, but I do dislike how hard it is to turn the wheel and you can not remove the resistance feature so it's just really hard to move.<br/><br/>I am sorry I can not recommend this mouse. It's just not shaped like a hand and is uncomfortable and makes you hand feel sweaty and awkward while using it.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review.
 The price point is great. However, the performance and durability have been less than pleasing. Lesson learned? You get what you pay for. The mouse after several months lags on the screen. Fresh batteries and a reconnect fix the problem for about 15 minutes. Also, the USB connection that must be plugged into the computer being used has had issues coming into multiple pieces (not designed to).<br/><br/>The one plus I give this product is the internal storage for the USB connector. It can be stored during transportation inside the actual mouse which is very handy.
 This mouse lacks precision control.  If I'm just using it to click on buttons or open and close windows I'm alright.  If I'm trying to select and highlight text or doing detailed work in Photoshop it's not good at all.  I trusted that Amazon would provide me with a reliable product because they usually do but if I were you I would purchase a different mouse.<br/><br/>Update: (10/19/2018)<br/>I've had this mouse for 15 months now and out of nowhere it decided to reject one of the batteries.  No matter what I tried I was unable to securely wedge the battery back into place.  Each time I replaced the battery it would pop out of place after 5 to 10 seconds of use.  I am certain I received a defective unit.  I am in the minority obviously because the reviews reflect that this is generally a good product.  However,  in many cases the buyer is not so lucky.  Just keep that in mind when considering your purchase.  If I were you I would keep looking.
 This mouse follows the K.I.S.S. principle, Keep it Simple Stupid. You take the little USB dongle thing, toss in on your computer, flip over the mouse, turn it on, and your done. It works every time, and it works well. There is even a small compartment within the mouse to store the USB piece if you don't wish to, or are unable to leave it constantly connected to your computer. So as far as a mouse goes, its simple, efficient, and just works.<br/>  Ergonomically though, this mouse is somewhat strange. I wouldn't call it slim by any stretch of the imagination, nor would I call it bulbous. So when you throw it into a backpack, it will leave a lump. But not so far as to call it in the way, just noticeably there. Similarly, I would neither call it extremely comfortable, nor unbearable. It feels slightly large in my hand, and when I think about it I don't particularly like it, but once I use is I immediately forget about it. The texture on it is also very nice to touch, so that may play into it.<br/>  That is pretty much how this mouse is overall, it's neither the best mouse out there, nor is it the worst. It's astoundingly neutral in almost every way, which means your opinion of it will most likely be just that, neutral. You won't fall in love with it, nor will you despise it. Which is exactly why I recommend this product. It does exactly what it intends to do, and leaves out everything it doesn't. It's a simple honest mouse with a simple honest price.<br/>  So
 Just received this wireless mouse today and got it hooked up after spending about 5 minutes trying to open the battery  package.  Wrapping was much too tight around the batteries.  Had to take a pocket knife to separate the batteries from the vinyl wrap.  Stupid!  My first impression is that this mouse is quite small for my hand not to mention too small to even easily accommodate those two batteries.  At least a half inch longer would have been better.  I may go searching for a larger model from Amazon.
 Well done, Amazon!  As their goal indicates, the Amazon Basics team has once again put their logo on a perfectly functional, comfortable, and fluff-free product that far exceeds other products in the price range.  I needed a mouse for work after the scroll wheel started acting wonky on the Insignia my company provided.  Knowing they would take forever, and the replacement mouse would likely be crap, I gambled $10 on a brand I'm beginning to know and trust.<br/><br/>- The mouse feels solid, without that hollow feel and creaky plastic I've come to expect from budget mice.  It feels heavy, which I like.<br/><br/>- The buttons provide a satisfying dull click when pressed.  Much quieter and premium-sounding than I was expecting.<br/><br/>- The scroll wheel is quieter than most, and reasonably smooth.  I would have preferred a click-less wheel, but I'm certainly not complaining for $10.<br/><br/>- The plastic on top is rubberized, and feels very comfortable.  The overall fit and finish is on par with more expensive mice I have owned in the past.  The inclusion of a storage slot for the receiver dongle, and a strip to easily pop out the batteries were nice touches, and further prove that Amazon Basics strives to provide bare-bones value without compromising attention to detail.
 I needed a mouse for my second laptop. I currently use the Logitech brand and really like it.<br/>Since my kids are using the second laptop. I wanted to go with something a little less money. I know Amazon is a name that I can trust, and they did not fail production wise with this mouse. The only issue I do have is the overall size of the mouse. In my opinion, I think  Amazon should redesign the mouse to be able to fit, and have a sleeker design. I didn't care for not having finger rest indent on the left/right side.<br/>Overall, the mouse did work flawlessly, with no issues. This mouse takes 2 AAA battery, FYI there is a piece of plastic that sits in the battery area, DO NOT tear out. This plastic makes life easier when removing the batteries. Lay the plastic down first then sit  the batteries into  . It also has a great little storage area for the receiver.<br/>The battery compartment is a little tight but not an issue for me in adding or removing batteries.
 Purchased when looking for a mouse to use for office work. Have had this mouse for two months. Usage has been great. With no mouse pad, this mouse has never had any tracking issues on a dark stained wood desk. After two months of everyday office (no gaming) use buttons and scroll wheel still operate well. Range to receiver has never been an issue, but have only occasionally used mouse from across 10~15 ft room. Still using the first set of batteries and I usually forget to actually turn off the mouse, so power consumption is low. Haven't had any interference with other wireless mice. Has a built in compartment for storing usb receiver so it doesn't get lost during transport. Ergonomically comfortable, have not developed tendon polyps or wrist swelling like I have previously with other brands. If mouse continues to operate well will bump up rating to 5 stars.
 I had previously purchased a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 after my beloved very old Microsoft wireless mouse died and is no longer made any more.  In just six short months of limited use, the new Microsoft 4000 developed problems with the scroll wheel and it became "lumpy" as others have described in their reviews.<br/><br/>I wanted a simple, basic mouse so I ordered the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver and was surprised at how comfortable this mouse is and how smoothly the wheel and buttons work.<br/><br/>The only problem that I have found is that the drivers that are downloaded for this mouse by Windows 7 Professional are very basic and nowhere like the Microsoft Intellipoint or Windows Mouse and Keyboard Center drivers that are available for only Microsoft products.<br/><br/>I keep several windows open during the day and like to use the center wheel to click between open windows; but the drivers for this mouse will only allow scrolling  activity. Searching the Net failed to reveal any solution to this problem.  Otherwise it is a great mouse and I will keep it as a spare for possible future needs.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with this mouse if you don't need the center click function, especially for the price. It looks as if I will have to purchase a Microsoft or Logitech product to regain the center click function.
 It worked for about a month and a half and then it got to a point where it was loosing signal even though i was about 18 inches away from the receiver. Then it stopped working. I got it to work again for a brief 30 seconds and now it does not work at all. The mouse is on, plugged in reciever, tried on 4 different laptops  (my personal, my work, and 2 co-workers), still does not work.
 My first bluetooth wireless mouse.  connects easily movement seems accurate and fast.  buttons click nicely.  only complaint i can think of is that the bluetooth dongle sticks out of the usb port a little more than i'd like.  if it was more flush i wouldnt be concerned to just leave it in there all the time.  Also not a problem with the device, but i keep forgetting to turn the power off on the mouse...hopefully it goes to sleep when not moved for a while otherwise the batteries may not last all that long.
 Yes, this is a pretty nice little wireless mouse, or so I thought until it mysteriously died after about five months of pretty light use and I had to go back to a wired mouse that has been working for about ten years.  No amount of battery swapping or antenna re-plugging would revive it. Obviously I won't be getting another one of these.
 I have been using this mouse for almost 2 years now. It has been amazing!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The mouse works exactly how a mouse should, very precisely<br/>-I use this mouse for gaming (Overwatch, TF2, general fps games) works excellently!<br/>-The battery it comes with lasts for a very long time and if you don't buy garbage batteries the replacements will also last for a very long time<br/>-A status light warns you when the battery is low by blinking slowly (It isn't annoying but it is effective)<br/>-Easy to carry around because it is pretty small (fits in my headphones case which is really nice)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>It is a little small, I am a 6'4" guy so most people might not care too much. Just keep in mind that it is a different form factor than most mice.
 I own one of these which I really like. I bought a second, which began to work sporadically after one week. We tried new batteries, different computers. It kept being sporadic then quit, so I am returning it and purchasing a Logitech which we've had good luck with. Have had the first Amazon Basics about 5 weeks...will be interested to see if it lasts.
 I have a love-hate relationship with this mouse. To paint a picture of how much I love it and hate it, I've already bought three of these. But not for the right reasons. I love how compact this mouse is. It's instant plug and play and it's simple. It's responsive. It's great as a mouse. What I don't like is that it's actually very easy to lose. I can't explain it but I've lost these mice about three times and I think it's much due to the fact that they are wireless and they are so small. The other thing I don't like is that you don't know when the mouse is on or off. Let me elaborate. When you lift the mouse, you see the bright red light. So you know the mouse is working and is also using the battery. But when you put the mouse down, the lights go off. So I'm not entirely sure of the mechanics of the mouse but I was always under the impression that it was sapping my batteries each time I left it in the "ON" position and with the way the mouse is set up, you don't really know if the mouse is on or off unless you see the red light underneath. Still I'd wholeheartedly recommend them.
 We recently moved and I tried several wireless mice.  They would work out fine for a few days, but invariably they would act up to the point I had to bring in an expert.  He gave me some possible reasons of why I was having problems - none of which I understood completely.  So, I decided to forget using a wireless mouse and just get myself all plugged in.<br/><br/>But, the darn cord continually got in my way, so I decided to give wireless one more try.  When I checked this product out on Amazon, the price was right.  Even if it didn't work out, I wouldn't be out very much moolah.  I'm very pleased with how it works.  It's a bit lightweight, but that's okay.  I point and it will cooperate which is a very welcome relief.<br/><br/>My Windows 7 Operating System immediately recognized the mouse once I put the Nano Receiver into a USB port on my computer.  Within about one or two minutes, I was up and running.  This mouse even came with three batteries.  Yahoo!
 Quick and easy to setup.  However, the distance from the mouse to the receiver is quite small where it continues to function.  If the mouse is a bit far away, it acts choppy.  This is only a specific case for me, and not many people use mouse far from their desktop.<br/><br/>I use it for my raspberry pi connected to TV while I sit on couch or receiver plugged into my SmartTV so I can manage apps and internet browser.<br/><br/>Overall I've had 4 of these purchased, I keep losing the receiver, so I keep on buying a new one.<br/><br/>Good solid mouse to get work done.
 Dude I love this mouse but my second one just broke.  The mice seem to have a really short lifespan; only a few months before the usb that you plug into your laptop starts malfunctioning.  It just breaks for no reason.  The first time I was kind of rough with it; leaning my laptop on the couch.  This time I was perfect with it and it still broke.  So, whatever.  Guess I need to buy a different brand.  Too bad because I loved the size.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just found out this thing has a 1 year warranty, which Amazon honored without question.  So now I'm perfectly happy to keep ordering a new mouse from them every few months since I love the size so much!  It's a perfect medium size - not a huge desktop, but not a tiny mini laptop one.
 This was a gift for my girlfriend who's mouse crapped out, I was going to give her my five year old Logitech mouse that cost forty dollars when new.  I decided to buy her a new one, mine was kind of ragged just replaced it this Chrismas 2015, she got this mouse earlier than expected and said there was no receiver to plug in, I said take off the cover and look inside, she found and hooked it up and it took a minute to register.  Came with o batteries if anyone cares about that.  She said it has some kind of rubbery gripping (not sure if it doe's) she says I should rate it five stars, it's smaller than a normal mouse which she likes, it tracks really well on all the surfaces she tried, and she likes the two batteries so less changing and the on and off switch on the bottom.  She actually was taking the batteries out of her old mouse to save on their life so this is much easier, don't ask what that deals about, sounds like mucho work to me, but whatever.  So she's extremely happy with it thus far and I have been satisfied with the quality of amazon basics for years for cables and rechargable  batteries, so I figured give this a shot.  The price is right, despite the no batteries and she said it didn't feel junky.
 I've used an Apple Magic Trackpad for a few years now, but it always leaves something to be desired in the world of gaming. To be honest, using the Magic Trackpad sucks for gaming (great for everything else though). I was a bit hesitant to use a wireless mouse because my experiences in the past have been pretty negative in terms of lag. This mouse doesn't do that a bit! I plugged the receiver into my MacBook Pro and started up a few games and found the mouse pretty accurate and consistent. It's a bit on the smaller side, which makes it great for traveling, but if you've got larger hands, you might find it a little annoying. I did notice a bit of lag when it was plugged into my USB hub, but once I switched it to the open USB on my computer, it worked just fine. The receiver is so small that I barely notice it sticking out. Great product for cheap!
 I bought this to replace a Microsoft mini wireless mouse that I have used for many years. That little mouse finally died after tons of abuse. I liked its size and simplicity, so I was looking for something in the same vein. I landed on this one and have been very happy with it.<br/><br/>The size is perfect. It is compact, but not too small. It is a little bigger than a Microsoft or Logitech mini mouse, and I love that. The USB dongle is small and stores inside the mouse for travel - a nice touch.<br/><br/>The build quality is solid. I knocked it off the desk onto our wood floor the other day and it sustained no damage. The top is covered in a soft rubberized coating that feels very nice.<br/><br/>It functions well, and I really like the minimalist design. I am not a gamer. I just want a mouse with 2 button a scroll wheel. This does the trick and looks sharp! It would have been nice to have a white/gray design to better match my iMac, but this still looks good.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this mouse- in fact I would like to get a few more for work. For the price it cannot be beat.
 Solid mouse, and it lives up to exactly what it's supposed to be. I'm just giving some info people might want before they buy.<br/><br/>-Takes AAA not AA batteries. This is clear from the description, but I didn't notice it and I wish I had. Not a big deal though.<br/><br/>-I didn't see the specific DPI listed, but this is a relatively fast mouse for a standard wireless; I'm very pleased that it isn't the super slow ones you tend to get for this price.<br/><br/>-The USB transmitter fits snuggly in the batter compartment and  is completely covered during travel. This is a little different from my last one, and I prefer it. The only downside to it is that I'll have to be removing the batter compartment cover multiple times a day, and it seems a little thin to be going through that much stress. I'll update if it breaks at any point, for all I know it will make it years, but first impression is that it seems under-built.<br/><br/>-Good size. I have larger hands, and this feels comfortable in my palm but it isn't huge. I think most people are going to be comfortable with it's form factor.<br/><br/>-The amazon logo is small and unobtrusive.<br/><br/>-The scroll wheel is smooth and precise feeling.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this mouse. It seems like a great purchase so far.
 I was so sick of the other mouse that came with my computer... It was horrible and slowed down my work dramatically. I was tempted to buy a more expensive, name brand mouse but decided to try this one. I could always send it back if I hated it right? Turns out it is fantastic! It works great and it fits my hand perfectly.<br/><br/>It was super easy to set up - just plug the doohickey into the computer, put the batteries in the mouse and go. Simple! There is no lag time when you push a button or use the scroll wheel. I also really like the fact that the scroll wheel isn't too fast. If you purchase this mouse - I can't imagine that you would regret it. It works perfectly and it's a great price!!
 I ordered this mouse to hopefully replace all my other wireless ones. I have had very bad luck with wireless mice. Right out of the box it felt great under my hand, but the true test was does it work. I opened the back cover and found the tiny wireless receiver and plugged it into my USB port. I put the batteries in and Bam, I was up and running. No pesky software to install, just plug and play. I've been using this mouse for quite sometime now and it has yet to let me down. If I want to travel with my laptop I simply take out the wireless receiver and put it back into the mouse and away I go. Same thing with my laptop, plug and play. This mouse is small enough to take anywhere and will fit into just about any size pocket on a laptop bag. It has a kind of soft rubbery feel on the sides of the scroll button, which make it easy to keep your fingers where they need to be. I've had different ones in the past that over time get slippery and worn, so this was a plus. I would by this mouse again and suggest it to anyone on the go.
 AmazonBasics has done well with this wireless mouse.  Nothing too complicated and easy to use straight out of the box with it's frustration free packaging.  Sensors works pretty fine on most solid surfaces.  One of the capabilities I do enjoy is that I do not need a mouse pad while using this mouse compared to other high quality mouse.  Battery life has been great seeing as I still do not need to replace the battery since I had first purchased the product.  It's very compact and I bring it with me everyday at university.  It's certainly a good mouse and an even better replacement mouse in case you lost or damaged your first one.<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/7/2016 Mouse is still intact, no real signs of wear and tear from daily uses.
 Simple plug in and go. I would call this a mid-sized mouse and is lightweight for travel too. Perfect for my work laptop computer but if I didn't already have one for my desktop, I would have bought a 2nd one. Great price. Came with batteries. I leave the receiver plugged into my laptop and never bother to remove it. UPDATE: Received the mouse in late April and it is now beginning of October. Red light has been flashing for about 4 days indicating low battery. Expect about 5-6 months of life from your batteries (takes 2 AAAs). I use my mouse 5 days a week for an average of 10 hours per day; and I am pretty faithful about turning off each night. UPDATE: It is now February and the red light came on indicating another battery change is required.
 This is the second one I have owned in two weeks. The first one stopped working after about 15 minutes use. However, I have waited at least an hour before I wrote this to make certain that I didn't get another flawed mouse (I will update this review in 6 months, or sooner if it fails before then). Anyway, it worked flawlessly from the moment I turned it on. Don't forget to install the nano dongle first in a USB port. Then, turn it on, and happy mousing! Oh, one other thing: I have a MacBook Pro 15.4 Retina model laptop, manufactured in mid 2012, and running the latest update version of  OS X El Capitan, v. 10.11.5. As I stated earlier, it works flawlessly, so it appears that the mouse is also compatible with Apple Computers as well! I think that AMAZON should put this fact in the web site description of the mouse. It is definitely a good value. And this mouse is way better than the Logitech brands I tried first. Those wouldn't work at all!
 I don't know why Amazon pushes this one. When I ordered this I didn't realize that my wife had bought one before and had trouble with it and the multiple replacements. They all died very fast. The one I just got and it is terrible. The buttons barely work and the cursor is hard to control. I'm returning it and getting a VicTsing. I have one on my other computer and it has been working fine for several months. Much better quality than this thing.
 I used this for a home computer. It was easy to use, found it was hard on batteries, even though I turned it off after each use. My biggest complaint is it only lasted 15 months after purchase. It had a 1 year guarantee  and I did not take the extended one as I should have. This is my biggest complaint. So now I have to purchase another one. Think I will just go to my computer store instead of ordering off Amazon. I would rather pay a little more and have it last. I do like the wireless mouse however.
 I just uncovered a significant issue with this wireless mouse and my Western Digital external USB hard drive (which I also bought from Amazon).  I don't which one is at fault, or both, but will describe the problem and how I resolved it.<br/><br/> A few days after I received the WD drive and backed up my PC (using my old wired mouse), I received my new Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver (Black). It has a small USB receiver, which I plugged into the front USB slot on my PC.<br/><br/>Yesterday, when I went to use my WD drive, I plugged it into the second USB slot on the front of my PC. This slot is immediately adjacent (3/8") to the other slot, that had the wireless receiver plugged in. When I plugged in the WD cable, the mouse/cursor froze. When I unplugged the WD cable, the mouse/cursor was fine.<br/><br/>I just experimented with a wired mouse, plugged into the front USB jack next to the WD USB. No problem...the mouse/cursor is fine! Then I tried plugging the Amazon receiver into another USB jack on top of the computer, about 8" away. It also works fine!<br/><br/>Apparently there is some sort of intererence between the Amazon receiver and the WD USB cable, when they are in close proximity. (I should note that the front two slots are USB-3, with the SS symbol, and the slot on top of the computer is a USB-2).<br/><br/>So be aware: if your mouse/cursor freezes with an external drive plugged in, try moving the small USB receiver to a different USB port, farther away.
 I used this mouse on my desk top... Worked very well and was very ergo, very comfortable... After a couple of years, the wheel loosened and I started getting vertical and horizontal scrolling??? I'd try to scroll down and it would jump to a previous page, very frustrating... Checked the settings and it was the mouse... Just bought another brand and it works well, so it was the mouse causing problems... It was great and comfortable when it was working...
 Can't rate battery life or durability because I just got it. A snap to set up. It took much longer to unplug &amp; unravel the wired mouse than it took to hook this one up. Perfect size, nice appearance, very sensitive to the touch. Recognized immediately on restart. A well behaved rodent so far.<br/> This is an update 2/29/2019. The mouse works fine but eats batteries like crazy. They last about a week. I'm going back to a wired mouse and keeping this for a spare.
 This thing lasted less than a year and has fallen apart on me in ways I didn’t know possible. The USB dongle came detached from itself, leaving the metal input stuck in my USB port which I had to remove with tweezers. Before this, the battery compartment cover broke, keeping the cover from closing completely which would disallow the mouse from working, so I had to duct tap that shut. I will not be purchasing this mouse again.
 Purchased this mouse February 2018 and April 7th, 2019 it stopped working. First I thought it was the batteries, replaced them and the mouse lights up as it was ready to work; BUT it does not connect with my laptop. Tried different brand of batteries and I still have the same issue. Then I thought maybe it's my laptop. Tried my husbands mouse, it connected just fine. Tried a friends mouse and it connected just fine. Unfortunately I cannot return it for a replacement closed on March 1st, 2019. VERY disappointed that Amazon Basics were not made to last long.<br/><br/>Initially I love the mouse. Worked better than other name brand wireless mice. It's light but sturdy. There is a light under the wheel that will light up to notify that batteries are low. Takes 2 AAA batteries. If you buy this mouse, hopefully the life span of the mouse will last longer than a year.
 I didn't use this mouse for a few months after I bought it. When I went to use it, I noticed that there was no housing for the USB jack. It was past the return window, but I emailed Amazon, and they replaced it at no cost to me. They didn't even make me ship the old one back. The new one works great! I am content with the product, but really in awe of Amazon's fantastic customer service on their AmazonBasics products.
 This mouse works very well with my old windows vista laptop, and i was sick of hurting my wrists using the tiny laptop touch pad. Comes with AAA batteries so i didn't have to go purchase some. The cursor does jump when your cursor sensitivity is up very high and you are moving the mouse very slowly, such as to click on a check box, but simply go to your control panel and lower the speed and the cursor does not move nearly as much. This mouse is probably not suitable for high accuracy purposes, such as for computer games and digital drawing due to this. My only real gripe is that there is no auto off function to save the batteries, you have to manually shut it off. The mouse is a good size, not tiny but not full size. Looks very nice, and high quality for a &lt;$15 mouse. The USB receiver can be stored in the mouse so you don't loose it. For the price i paid, this is a great product.
 I have never been a fan of the wireless mouse. They disconnect at random, the batteries run out far too often, and they are oftentimes pretty flimsy. I can't say any of those things about this Amazon mouse. It's pretty much my favorite mouse, wireless or otherwise, and I've even recommended it to a few friends.
 Cheap in price, feels nice and solid (as good as my old MS wireless mouse). Has a sideways click on the scroll button that opens links in a new tab (in Chrome at least). Can't report on battery life at 3 days! Has an off button that hopefully gets some extra battery time when not in use. Hooked up to my W8.1 laptop without any need to change any settings. Mouse accuracy is good, I'm using it to play games as well as normal laptop use. I like the rubberized finish on the top, but I can see it being a bit of a dirt magnet over time. I'll update if any issues and when the batteries run out (hopefully not soon).
 This mouse does what it's intended to do and is about what I expected for the price. It works great as a wireless mouse; I had no trouble installing it and using it. I've read that folks have trouble with the battery life, but I've not had to change batteries since I bought it over a month ago, and I use it almost daily and for hours when I do.<br/><br/>I do, however, have two small qualms, which is why I've rated the mouse 4 stars. First, it is rather small; it is smaller than a standard mouse and therefor takes a little time to get used to. Second, I really do not care for the on/off switch beneath the mouse. It's not hard to use, but it's easy to forget. I've left it on accidentally for hours multiple times - I guess this attests to the battery life, but it is kind of annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad I got the mouse and can recommend it. This bare-bones yet functional mouse is exactly what I was looking for.
 My wife keeps losing the little USB reciever parts for wireless mice.  So yet again time to buy a new mouse.  Previously I've stuck with the Microsoft Mice for the past 10 years but decided to give the Amazon mouse a try as it could be delivered same day.  Arrived - plugged in and detected and worked without any effort.<br/><br/>Looks good quality and works fine with windows 10 machine I have.  So does the job.  Its a shame we can simply get replacement USB for the mice because the old ones I have are perfectly good.
 This is the fourth mouse I bought before settling.<br/><br/>I tried two bluetooth first. They were laggy on my linux laptop.<br/>Third mouse was wired, bought it for the same price as this amazon mouse. It is so badly made and makes insane click sounds. Threw it away after a day<br/><br/>Fourth is this one, with wireless from usb plug. It works great for my linux laptop. I bought it 6 months ago and batteries included are still working (I often forget to power it off). I am a computer engineer and I use this mouse at least 10 hours everyday. This is the first mouse that lasted me as long.<br/><br/>The click sound is not so loud but I would feel bad for other people if I used it in class. This is the only disadvantage (which might be positive for some people).<br/><br/>I can control it up to 5 meters from my pc, which is much more than what I need from a cheap mouse. Using it under a desk is not a problem.<br/><br/>I think I'll buy one or two more just incase I lose it.
 Overall I really like this product, I don't believe any dollar was wasted getting this item but I'm just gonna pick out some key details to highlight.<br/><br/>Build Quality<br/>I love the build of this mouse. The top of the mouse where your hand rests is very smooth, soft and has a rubber like feel to it. It doesn't attract sweat and smudges but that can easily be wiped off. Based on the feel of the material I would recommend using a microfiber cloth, that is what I use and it works great. Gets the smudge and sweat off almost instantly. I think I've seen a review that said this mouse was small but when I compared it to other wireless mouse I found it to be average size. I think it fits perfectly under my hand (I have small hands for a guy by the way). I also like that it has a compartment built in for storing the usb Bluetooth receiver.<br/><br/>Performance<br/>Overall I love the performance of the mouse. It works on most surfaces as long as the surface is not too rough or rugged. Naturally it works best of flat smooth surfaces but I have tested it out on many different surfaces; a table (worked great), my bed (worked decent), my pillow(not the best but works) my laptop sleeve (worked well) and a very old mouse pad which ironically It doesn't work great on but still good. I blame the pad cuz its just that old and worn out. But I believe it works great, very responsive and smooth and I can use it from a pretty good distance if I want to though I don't see why anyone would want to stand too far from their computer while using their mouse.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless mouse. I think it's a good quality mouse that comes at a great price.
 Mouse looks good and works perfectly except the battery 'door' pop off occasionally, fixed with a piece of scotch tape.  The on-off switch is best seen with a magnifier glass but can be easily used if you don't trim your fingernails.  Good buy for the money, it ain't no Ferrari
 I purchased this product in October 2015 for using it while attending university. I had only been using the product for about a month and the USB receiver fell apart one day while unplugging the device(The metal separated from the rest of the plug and got stuck in the laptop I was using. I thought it might have been just defective and so I planned to just purchase a different item when I had time. I contacted Amazon recently to see if that individual piece was available for purchase. They responded that they would be happy to send a replacement for the substandard product. I was thrilled with with the wonderful customer service.<br/><br/>The mouse itself is very convenient for someone who travels or goes to and from school or work. It is a little small in the hand but is accurate in movement and clicking. Scrolling is also accurate and works well. I am excited to use the product again with the fixed USB.
 Keeping in mind that you get what you pay for, it is a good buy and for now, it works fine.  (Will see more relative to Durability later. Based on the Material quality, probably not a long-term work horse.)  I will note that it was a little difficult getting the AAA batteries properly installed (very tight tunnel space). And don't forget (I think typical these days) that the USB signal unit is packed inside the battery casing.
 You certainly can't beat the price and the set-up for the mouse is super simple. Insert batteries, switch on and plug in the USB adapter into the computer. The USB adapter is very small which makes it great for using with a laptop. Even better, the USB adapter can be stored in the battery compartment. I'd imagine that makes it a real winner for frequent travelers. My only real complaint is that the mouse is a little more compact (shorter) than a normal mouse. I have very long fingers so if I'm resting my hand on top of the mouse in the usual position my finger tips hang off the front edge of the mouse.  This doesn't prevent me from clicking it's just different and takes some adjustment to get used to. Overall a great product and for the reason probably the best choice as a mouse for a laptop or someone who is a frequent traveler.
 When using the mouse on my desktop, the pointer jumps randomly over the screen.  This did not happen with my previous mouse, a Logitech.  The action of the buttons is inconsistent as there are times when I must click several times to get an action.  The on/off button is very small and difficult to use as I have big hands and fingers and the switch is too small for me to use easily.  Overall, for me, this is an unsatisfactory  product.
 We had 5-6 mice and initially everything was fine. However, that mouse goes through any batteries within couple of weeks! I assume they do not have the automatic energy save functionality. You will have to manually turn off the mouse.
 ***one blind mouse review***<br/><br/>economically priced mouse that is comfortable for an average hand to large hand. Great and fast response.<br/>Awful battery life.<br/><br/>***two blind mice review***<br/><br/>I had a <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Logitech-V450-Nano-Cordless-Laser-Mouse-for-PC-and-Mac/dp/B00165XQWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logitech V450 Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for PC and Mac</a> that I absolutely loved. But after dropping it for the umpteenth time, it finally dropped dead on me...<br/><br/>When I had to replace it, serendipity happened that this Amazon basics mouse was in the lightning round. I couldn't resist picking it up to save almost $30.00.<br/><br/>It didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>1) comfort:<br/><br/>I am 5-7 and I wear large sized gloves. This mouse felt comfortable in my hand. I had a perfect ergonomic grip on it where it didn't feel like I was "clutching".<br/><br/>It is also an amphibious mouse, making it both usable on both land and water...OK, kidding, it is an ambidextrous mouse which is great for an ambidextrian like me. My clicking fingers rest comfortably on the clickers.<br/><br/>Even using it for house, my hand do not get fatigued like some of the other mice I've used.<br/><br/>Rubbery plastic on top and smooth plastic on the side and light weight. Comfortable all around.<br/><br/>2) response:<br/><br/>The mouse responds well on most of the surfaces that I've used it on. Paper, coated plastic, rubber, sometimes, even over my laptop itself over the keys. its nano receiver is pretty powerful. When there are no obstructions, it worked well within a 6 feet range. Which is great for those presentation times.<br/><br/>3) battery life:<br/><br/>This is where this mouse gets a 4 star instead of 5 star. it is a battery hog when compared to other nano-mice. When I first purchased it, I would leave it on all the time where my average use per day ranged from 4 hours to 12 hours use. I would have to replace the battery about once every 2-3 weeks. I then started to turn it off (whenever I could remember to turn it off) and it would last me a little bit longer, but still, not as long as when compared to Logitech V450N on all the time.<br/><br/>When I had Logitech V450N, I would leave it on ALL the time, and it would be MONTHS before I had to replace the batteries. With the Amazon mouse, the battery life is extremely short...<br/>It is also very annoying having to turn of the mouse on/off just to conserve battery life. Definitely could use an improvement here...<br/><br/>~~~~~~~<br/><br/>overall, I would purchase this mouse again. The price just can't be beat for its overall function and comfort.<br/><br/>As far as installation of the batteries go, I personally don't find them hard to install. However, I find that if I didn't use the battery plastic tab remover when I first installed it, I would have to pry the batteries out with a screw driver or something.<br/><br/>but If I remembered to use the plastic tab and place the batteries over it when I would first install it. Removing it is a cinch.<br/><br/>With Windows 7, simple plug and play. Not sure about other Windows systems.
 The Touch Pad &amp; its Control Buttons are wearing out on my Asus Notebook so I ordered AmazonBasics  Wireless Mouse.<br/>I never really liked the Touch Pad and this Mouse is a Fantastic Replacement for it.  The Mouse requires 2 "AAA" batteries that are included in the box with the Mouse.  The Price was a Bargain and it got here Fast.<br/><br/>Thank You Amazon for Great Products and Excellent Service.
 The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse works great!  I had to replace my other wireless mouse (different brand) and this one works great.  It was easy to set up.  Just open the back pop in the two AAA batteries (included) and then take out the small usb adapter (located inside the battery compartment).  Turn the switch to on.  Plug the usb adapter in your computer and then the computer will take a minute to recognize it and install itself.  You will literally be up and running in just a few minutes.  I used the quick start guide instructions just to make sure I had set it up right (5 picture steps).  Great reasonably priced wireless mouse.  I have used several of the AmazonBasics items (from headphones to batteries) and have been happy with all of them.
 A great, simple mouse. My touchpad on my laptop often acts up, so I needed a mouse. I am on my laptop for almost the entire day, as I am a computational chemistry grad student, and I work often on weekends with it as well. I know some people are super picky about every single little button and curve on the mouse...but really unnecessary in my opinion.<br/><br/>The mouse is sleek, it fits my small palm/long fingers, and the scroll button is great. It doesn't have all the fancy workings of some I've seen, but it was exactly what I needed and works reliably. Also, the USB connector is so small, I am able to leave it in permanently and it doesn't get snagged when I put my laptop away or anything.
 I don't usually do reviews - but I'm using the touchscreen on my desktop for the first time because this mouse failed. It had a VERY short range from the beginning. Now it just freezes up. A little shaking and rattling made it work very briefly, but it has been unreliable. I'm waiting for a new mouse from Amazon, but this time I bought a Logitech. I don't remember why I didn't just buy Logitech when I bought this one.<br/><br/>Save yourself a headache and spend a few extra $$ for a Logitech - I've been using Logitech for a LONG time. I wear them out but never had one fail like this Amazon Basics mouse did. I suppose this is what buying a generic does for you!
 AmazonBasics items have been great for me. They manage to be reasonably priced and work well enough. I bought this wireless mouse to use with Windows laptop a few years ago when my old wireless mouse had finally pooped out on me. I quite like the compact design. I like how the nano usb receiver stores inside the mouse for travel. I do kinda wish it were a tad larger to fit my hand better as it can become a bit uncomfortable after long usage. But I understand way it might be as small as it is (for great ease of transportation). The receiver has be reliable so far as well. I'm not sure what the range is on this device because I only use it pretty close to the receiver. As far a compatibility goes, I've had no issues. I bought it to use with my Acer Aspire V5 running Windows 8.1 (and then later, Windows 10). However, I also have used it with my early 2015 13" Macbook pro, as well as several iMacs and a couple Dell and HP laptops running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.<br/>To conclude, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a economical and effective solution for there wireless mouse needs.
 Normally I love Amazon Basics stuff - and this mouse started out fine (worked like a mouse... ).<br/><br/>But a few days ago (almost a month to the day after purchase) it just stopped working.  If I turned it off and on, reset it, removed/replaced batteries, it would work again for a while, but then same.  Even new batteries didn't help.  Switched back to a trusty Logitech and I'll just stick with those in the future.  Maybe I just got a dud but I can't recommend.
 A very good little wireless mouse - it would've gotten more stars is A - it was a TINGE bigger - it's VERY small - but probably perfect for small computers - and a VERY hard to figure out battery structure - in fact the only kind of battery structure of it's kind I've ever seen - my mice were on the way back to the fadctory but my brother figured out to jimmy the batteries - other than that works mostly fine.<br/>UPDATE - Ha - that was YEARS ago - now it's January 2016 - I had to buy a new wireless mouse and I guess forgot how tricky the battery structure was - and it has yet to change.  In fact - I have tried now for an hour to get this thing to work - but the mouse itself does not tell you which direction the batteries even go in - so prepare to spend some time figuring it out.  If anyone knows - please let me know.  I'm begging.  This is the 3rd pair I've owned and - and yes - it's my fault - but it looks like once again I'll either be returning this or give up trying to get it to work and throw  in the garbage.<br/><br/>Strangely - I love many AMAZON BASICS products but boy, they really cheaped out with this product.  What a shame.
 Basic wireless mouse, good size, lightweight and gets the job done for $10. Works great on a glass table, which i've had issues with other models not being able to do.<br/><br/>What I don't like is mainly about the feel compared to my previous wireless mouse purchases...<br/>1. It doesn't glide as easily, feels like it drags on the desk.<br/>2. Although it's lightweight in total weight specs vs other brands, you can feel the weight under your palm when sliding it around. probably b/c the weight of 2 batteries in the compartment vs. 1 battery in other similar options.<br/>*with that in mind these are things you won't notice or have any issues without having something side by side to compare it with.<br/><br/>Very
 Sorry to report that this mouse, like so many other 1 star rated ones, died less than a month after I received it. No warning just flat out quit. Laser light works and new batteries change, nothing as if the receiver wasn't plugged in. Sending it back and will try another one to see if it was just a lemon. I have a spare mouse not being used from another laptop and the finger pad on my laptop works so I have something to get by with while waiting for a replacement.
 Overall:<br/>This mouse is an old style IR mouse with a nano receiver and a small footprint. Basically it has everything you would need for a good travel mouse. It has an on off switch which is nice for saving battery,  it is light and compact for easy storage and the nano receiver fits snug into the battery compartment. I did a search for mice when my Microsoft travel mouse died and this one seemed to offer the best value and function for the money. Upon testing I agree. Good show Amazon, keep making awesome 'Basics'.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Lightweight<br/>-Compact<br/>-On/Off switch<br/>-Nano receiver<br/>-Storage for receiver<br/>-Amazingly good value<br/>-Nice travel mouse<br/>-Good battery life<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Old style IR mouse<br/>-It says 'Amazon Basics' on the front<br/>-Uses 2 AAA batteries<br/><br/>Most Useful Feature<br/>Definitely the nano receiver storage. The receiver goes into the battery compartment while you are not using it and then quickly comes out when you need it. Nice feature for those of us who don't like the receiver always being in the computer.
 What more could you want? I will comment on it's size too. I started using this after having a full-sized mouse and was a bit annoyed at first because it's so small. (I hope that not "what she said.) After a day or two though, I never gave it a second thought and now find the size convenient because it's easy to pack. I use it daily with my MacBook Pro and it works flawlessly. It has an on/off switch on the bottom which I don't even use. I leave it on 24/7 and am still using the batteries that came with it over 2 months ago. So, to recap: It's cheap. It's well made. It works. It's easy on batteries. In the words of Forrest Gump: "That's all I have to say about that." Lastly, I do not get paid to write reviews, nor do I get discounts. If I wrote it, it's honest and I paid for it, just like you. :)
 I hate to say it, but this thing is basically trash.  The first one I bought didn't work at all on arrival.  I returned it (have to give Amazon credit for excellent customer service there) and received a replacement right away.  The replacement works, but is very erratic, the pointer jumps all over the place.  This morning the pointer disappeared completely and I couldn't get it back.  I replaced the batteries and reconnected, and the pointer came back but still acting the same as far as being erratic..  Ever since I got this I have had to turn it off and back on again to make it stop jumping around, this happens once or twice a day.  So the original price was great, but really not worth the frustration.  I"m going to spend a little more money and get a better mouse now.
 From the packaging to the design and performance this low cost wireless mouse is a winner. Attractive design with a matte  faux suede] finish feels good to the touch. A no brainer to install in just seconds using the included Quick Start Guide and if you want to be led through it in 3 languages step by step, the Instruction Manual is there as well. It took a bit of jiggling around to get the batteries to seat properly because of the odd angle of insertion and the plastic tab seemed to get in the way. The Nano receiver was a snap to remove from its storage pouch and was a perfect fit for my laptops usb receptacle. The on/off switch is positive and easy to access unless you have gloves on. I seems to perform well on flat surfaces and I was surprised to find that I could use it on the upholstered arm of my Lazy Boy recliner. While time will tell the story of its reliability, my first impressions are that you don't need to spend a bundle on a big name wireless mouse to get a quality product. I have no hesitation in recommending the Amazon Basics product!
 I really liked this mouse when I got it. It was compact but not micro as I'm a guy and have a guy sized hand. Some of these mice are so tiny but this isn't the case. It's the right size. The nano-receiver is the same way, small enough to fit into the usb but also big enough to remove from the usb unlike a few nano flash drives I have that require tweezers and 30 secs of cursing to get them out.<br/><br/>The mouse performed flawlessly when I first got it about 1.5 years ago. Slowly over time, I've noticed the battery life has been speeding up to where every few months I've had to change the batteries where as I believe I went 6 solid months of daily use without changing them or even thinking about them.<br/><br/>In the last two weeks however is where the faults have started to show, and please believe me when I say this, trust the other reviews. The nano receiver WILL fail, it's just a matter of when. Mine computer is attached via a bracket to the bottom of my desk slab. The distance between my mouse and the nano receiver is no more than 3 ft at any given time if I'm mousing on the left side of my desk. What has happened is that I pretty much have to keep the mouse directly over the desktop where the nano receiver is plugged in to get it to work. If I now go beyond 2 ft I get sporadic  mouse movement &amp; scrolling. Fresh set of batteries, desk has been cleaned (which is what I initially thought was perhaps a dirty lense or the desk) nothing has worked. I've tried moving the nano receiver to the front usb ports to ease the problems, nope, still there.<br/><br/>While only around $10, it's not a huge loss but having not abused this mouse in any way I'm very disappointed in the build quality and will never be purchasing another amazon basics electronic device again. There are many, many other options out there cheaper and slightly more expensive by $1-2 than this mouse that don't have these repetitive problems over and over again.<br/><br/>What I think Amazon should do is step up and mail every one of us with a defective receiver a new version.
 I bought this to replace an ancient Logitech wireless mouse that had recently started getting a little wonky.  For the price, this Amazon Basics model is pretty good, although it has a few quirks.  First, it took a couple of tries for my machine to auto-detect the USB receiver, but that's no big deal.  The mouse is a little narrower than my old Logitech model, so that might be something to keep in mind.  Also the scroll wheel seems much more sensitive than the one on my old Logitech model.  I found it very easy to accidentally click the scroll wheel, and get some unintended page-scrolling, but maybe in time muscle memory will kick in and that won't be an issue.<br/><br/>Also, I had no issues with the battery compartment.  The batteries go in at an odd angle (like on every wireless mouse I've used), but I had no problems getting the batteries in or out.  Mine also came with 2 AAA AmazonBasics alkaline batteries.
 This 5 star rating is based on only one day's use. What can you say about a mouse--not a lot until they quit working. My previous mouse was the typical Microsoft mouse. I popped off the back to put in new batteries and a very tiny plastic piece that hold a metal plate in the cover broke. The metal plate connects to the battery, so my mouse was now useless. When looking for a new one, I was pleasantly surprised to run across this Amazon Basics mouse for much less than the Microsoft mouse. So far I have been pleased with this item. For one thing, it doesn't have the design flaw of the Microsoft mouse. The batteries seat securely into the base of the mouse and the cover is just protective and does not contain a metal clip necessary for the battery to function. Another plus over the Microsoft mouse is that there is an on/off switch. My old mouse would drain the batteries if you didn't pull the nano receiver from your computer daily and place it in the bottom of the mouse. I was concerned that the constant plugging and unplugging of the old nano receiver into and out of my laptop would eventually lead to a failure of my usb port on my laptop. This did happen with a prior laptop I owned. I got in the habit of leaving the nano receiver plugged into my computer and just replacing the batteries more frequently to adapt to this flaw. Hence the appreciation of the on/off switch on the new mouse! No more hassles with plugging and unplugging the nano receiver to conserve batteries. The mouse has a nice solid feel to it and the scroll wheel and clicking options are accurate, fluid and responsive. I would buy this product again.
 The design of the mouse is really bad.<br/><br/>1. The design of battery compartment is really bad (I think most of the designer won't make this obvious mistake).<br/>In order to know how to put the battery in, I need to read the instruction. This didn't happen for years. We should know how to put battery without any instruction.<br/>After putting the battery in, it's not easy to take them off without a tool like a screwdriver, because it gets stuck... Luckily, we don't need to replace the battery very often.<br/><br/>2. The front outer border of the mouse is too high, so it's really uncomfortable if you put your fingers too forward.<br/>This problem is very obvious, I know it the moment I touch the mouse, so I doubt that if the designer of the mouse has ever tried it. You'd better buy a Logitech mouse and have a comparison. (In my picture, the left one is made by Logitech, and the right one is this product.)
 Well, few things that are wrong with this mouse.<br/><br/>1- Very big one: This mouse does NOT have any friction pads. Meaning, this thing will slide on a slighest tilt of the mouse pad. I sit my laptop in my lap and the mouse next to it. The lap pad has sligh tilt, and this thing doesn't stay on pad. RETURNING due to this issue.<br/><br/>2- The upper part of the mouse, where your palm sits is a bit too curved and high<br/><br/>Other than that, its good
 Ridiculously easy set-up, inside of 5 minutes.  Works best on a slick surface, and any kind.  Pairs to the emitter easily (sic, do it twice to make sure--I'm using mine for a laptop and tower through a  KVM switch--and it works for the second after the pairing of the first computer), but use something like a key to gently depress the pairing button on the bottom of the mouse.  And the off-on switch is easily manipulated by a thumbnail.  Then inserting the two AAAA batteries is simple, if you look at the connector portion found either side of the emitter storage point: The one with two black rails alongside a metal band--running vertically (mouse upside down and open) is the positive end (small nub projecting from the battery body), while the other side is a negative pole that receives the flat portion of the battery body (they are in series); and, make sure that the clear band is under both batteries when doing the installation.  That little piece of clear plastic helps remove and replace dead batteries.
 Nice ergonomic feel, easy to hookup, but that's where it ends.  I installed the nano receiver in a USB port on the front of my PC less than 4 feet away, and the mouse pointer will either not respond or it will 'skip' and 'hop' whenever sliding the mouse on the pad, making usage aggravating, time consuming and frustrating.  Have tried adjusting sensitivity in Win7 multiple times, no change or improvement.  I think this mouse is much better suited for a notebook, as it seems to have very, very poor range.
 I've been using this mouse for over 5 years and it just started having issues as the right-click has started to fail from use. Left-click still works perfectly. I recommend this mouse to others looking for a simple mouse, just make sure to turn it off when you're done otherwise it will drain the battery but I use rechargeable AAA batteries so it doesn't matter. 5/5 for sure.
 Easy to use, feels nice in the hand - but is very light...and turns out isn't very durable. I dropped the mouse from about 3 feet onto our office floor, and the door flew off and a battery flew out. Upon trying to snap the batter back in, come to find out the spring on one end was broken, and the battery just flopped around in there. I was able to use it for a little less than 2 months. Most Amazon Basic items I use are great (I love the cheap keyboard and have used it for years - enough where the CTRL, C and V buttons are worn off), but this mouse was a disappointmenth.
 I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very happy with how well it responds during use. When you first receive the product and take it out of the package you will need to open the battery cover to remove the Nano USB receiver, and insert the batteries. I'm mentioning this because when I first received the item I thought I had lost the USB receiver, it wasn't until I opened the battery cover that I saw it nestled in it's own holder inside of the battery compartment.<br/><br/>Overall I am happy with my purchase, the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver only costs $12.41 and comes with free Prime shipping. Since Amazon stands behind their products if you do get a lemon the return/ exchange process is dead simple, what are you waiting for?
 Knowing that my stupid Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 does not fully compatible with Win7 64-bit (yeah, a Microsoft product doesn't work well with another Microsoft product!!!), I was looking for a basic wireless mouse that would work at least better than the Microsoft's.  In fact it is, the Amazon mouse is great, and cheapest among major brands such as Logitech.  This mouse may not be the most ergonomic, but fits very well like a standard mouse.  Weight is a slight bit heavier than my previous MS mouse, but OK.<br/><br/>Back to my MS mouse, it worked perfect on WinXP, never had an issue with my work laptop....until my company pushed a mandatory Win-7 64-bit upgrade onto my laptop and things changed.  Drivers, etc, were all-correct and latest, but the scroll wheel has a stupid problem.  Win-7 responded to my "scroll downs" just fine, but when I scrolled UP on the scroll wheel, the active window would react as if I accidentally scrolled DOWN.  This happened frequently and randomly so the active window would "jump down" annoyingly.  Think about when I am already at the top of a page but keep scrolling up, the page still jumps down 8-12 lines, then scrolls up, then jumps down again randomly, and repeats...<br/>I searched for most, if not all, possible solutions on this issue, and none of them is a solid fix.  I first blamed it on the mouse itself, but realized it has to do with Win7 because the mouse works perfectly fine on WinXP.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like this little Amazon mouse, and I'm going to return the other MS mouse to Costco! LOL.
 So the first mouse worked fine for about 4 months and then died.  Replaced the battery but still not working. Contacted amazon and they sent a new one.  Now 6 months and all is well. Tracking is fine, no battery issues. Not sure if you are a gamer if this is a good one but for basic work/home computer use it is just as good a many other high priced ones (which we have had)
 For some reason the receiver is slightly larger than the average nano receiver .<br/><br/>It has trouble working on different surfaces this this could be due to the very old laser design.<br/><br/>The design is reminiscent of the first laser mouses that started showing up on the market 10 years ago, if you look at the laser you can even see it flashing.<br/><br/> But the strangest thing about the mouse is it doesn't seem to work on steam. Could I be the only one having this problem, possibly. Trying to play L4D2 or Payday 2 I find the mouse skips and freeze, it  made playing impossible. I don't understand why that would even happen.<br/><br/>The scroll wheel is almost useless, I'm using a 13.3 inch laptop with 1080 resolution and while scrolling up and down it will jump half the page, HALF THE PAGE! Whatever I was reading, whatever I was doing left me far behind thanks to this wheel. Useless Wheel.
 For years I have complacently endured various Microsoft Mouse products. I finally decided to experiment with something new and have been pleasantly surprised with the quality and ease of use this AmazonBasics Mouse has to offer. It has worked flawlessly with both my Mac and Windows based laptops. I like the small form factor and the low price makes it a must have compared to the competition.
 I purchased over a dozen of these mice.  We used them twice a week at school for about an hour.  The batteries are still good, but 1/4 of them have stopped working.  There is still battery life.  The mice and their little fob were clearly marked with numbers so we could make sure they matched.  They have just ceased to function.  I know they are cheap, but I thought we'd get a bit more life out of them than a few months.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2FPYDLTXTZYPS"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1z6MtSKggS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1wZX-MHLcS.png"/> Not sure if I got a bad one or not.  Most of the time it works fine, but the pointer starts shaking all by it's self sometimes. This makes it hard to get the pointer on the object you want to click. I have always had great luck with AmazonBasics products so I am a bit disappointed in this one, I am attaching a video showing the movement of the pointer and the mouse is sitting on a surface without anyone touching it.
 This mouse worked perfectly right out of the box. However, I could immediately tell that it was going to be too small for my hands and make my hands cramp. I have large hands for a cisgender woman. I passed this mouse on to a friend and ordered a Vic Tsing wireless mouse instead. The Vic Tsing fit my hands perfectly andnis comfortable to use for long periods of time.
 I bought this mouse with high hopes, and it worked great for a few weeks, and then the tracking got extremely jerky and impossible. I've tried it with different computers and tried adjusting the tracking settings on my laptop, but it remains jerky in its responses, sometimes zooming across the screen and sometimes not moving at all until about 2 seconds after I move the mouse. I'm extremely disappointed in this product and do not recommend!!
 Ergonomically decent, with a fairly compact size, slim profile and a matte finish that's comfortable to use for hours on end.  Battery life is excellent -- the factory batteries lasted though five weeks of 16-hour-a-day mouse movement and wheel turns before dying.<br/><br/>This mouse's pointer speed is much slower at the same control panel setting than the mouse it replaced.  I reckon that's because the Amazon mouse has a higher tracking resolution, but to me, that's not a good thing -- it effectively makes the pointer as slow as molasses.  I had to set the control panel pointer speed to max to get the cursor to move at the velocity I wanted -- and even then, it wasn't as snappy as my old mouse at a lower setting.  Any setting lower than max, and it took multiple swipes of the Amazon mouse to move the cursor across the screen.  Bah!  Different mouse drivers (like the MS Intellimouse driver) didn't help.<br/><br/>So, I parked the Amazon mouse next to a system that gets limited use, and I'll stick with the old Onn mouse I've been using, with its housefly velocity and very handy side-mounted thumb switch that executes a page Back or Forward command.
 Love these little Amazon mice. I have bought three of these for different reasons and they have all worked with the same quality. Mouse is always picked up immediately by the receiver (no waiting). I normally use basic Logitech mice and this mouse feels very similar although just a slight bit smaller. It's not heavy like some wireless mice I have used, although it doesn't feel light either - I like the feel. I use rechargeable batteries in it and they tend to last for several weeks without needing to be recharged - I turn it on in the morning and then turn it off when the work day is done, so its not going 24/7. I don't think you'll find a better wireless mouse for the price. Note I do not use this mouse for gaming, it is primarily used for business and programming tasks. Note also it has worked well in two Windows laptops as well as with a Mac Mini.
 I just got this mouse as a replacement for a Logitech wireless mouse and it is exactly what I was looking for. The Logitech mouse has a scroll wheel that offers almost no resistance when scrolling. The result is that when you use the wheel to select something, many times it also scrolls in the process and you end up who knows where. The Logitech mouse worked fine for most things, but when I switched to my CAD application, the scroll issue really became a problem. Messing up a drawing because the scroll wheel was too easy to rotate finally got me to try a different mouse, and I'm glad I did.<br/>The Amazon Mouse works on my Windows and Linux boxes. It just works!<br/>I'm going to order a few more on my next Amazon order.
 I've had to return too many of these. Fortunately, they usually give out (three now) in the first 30 days, so returns are easy. The last one I had started acting up in three days. This latest one took about 15 days before it got jumpy. The cursor starts jumping around erratically on the display screen, with no relation to the movement of the device itself.<br/><br/>I have bought five of these over the years. No more. I have a working one that I use only as a spare, because the scroll wheel is unreliable.<br/><br/>I've decided to buy one from another manufacturer.
 I expected this mouse to feel cheap, and it does. That is acceptable.<br/><br/>What is not acceptable is that the wireless connection is so spotty the mouse pointer will sometimes just stick for a second and then jump to a totally different spot.<br/><br/>I am returning this, will order a mouse from a reputable manufacturer.
 Yes, I should have known this would be a piece of crap that wouldn't even turn on. Bought millions of mouses in my time, but this is the first one that is totally dead. Judging by all the trouble other people have had with this mouse (judging by reviews), I'm amazed it get so many stars. Junk.
 This mouse cost around $10 when I bought it, which I honestly thought was a bit much, but after comparing prices to retail stores and buying countless cheap mouses off of eBay that didn't work, I finally made the purchase and I don't regret it.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this mouse DOES work with Windows 8. When browsing for a cheap mouse one of the main problems I had was finding an affordable mouse that works with Windows 8, so if you're in the same situation this mouse is a safe buy.<br/><br/>I've read in previous reviews the mouse has a weird battery system and it does, but your not going to be changing batteries every day or month, at the most once a year if that, so I don't really see that as a negative.<br/><br/>Performance wise, its a mouse. Its Plug-N-Play. It works. If anything the mouse could be a bit lighter, but that's only if I'm nit-picking. This a great product and feels like it will last a good time if properly taken care of.<br/><br/>Overall if you're in the market for a wireless mouse to use on just about any surface I definitely recommend this product.
 This mouse is a good quality for the price. It is exactly what I was looking for - an inexpensive, basic wireless mouse that's not a piece of junk. It does not feel cheap or low quality.<br/><br/>Tracking: It does require a flat surface to track (my old mouse would track over my laptop keyboard, this one can't seem to handle the gaps), but it tracks very well on different surfaces, and is better at tracking overall than my old wireless mouse. On a standard mouse pad it is flawless. Other mice I've had often struggled with smooth, fine motion. This mouse is good enough for gaming, if you are like me and don't spend money on expensive mice.<br/><br/>It takes two AA batteries, which are included. I ordered the purple color and expected it to be a matte plastic, but it has a super cute pearly sheen that I really like.
 I bought this mouse for my mother. She finally got a laptop (she's finally not using their clunky old desktop!) and absolutely hated using the track pad. So bought this Amazon mouse for her in hopes of being able to guilt her into making cookies made for me the next time I visit. The mouse worked fine at the beginning (yet somehow she managed to forget the cookies). It's a pretty small mouse, which is fine because she has small hands. It's not something I'd be able to use though.<br/><br/>The mouse didn't last 6 months before it stopped working. I tried changing the batteries, switching USB ports for the receiver, nothing worked. It's not like she was rough on it. The laptop doesn't leave the end-table by the recliner.
 Simply wonderful mouse.  Especially awesome in light of the price. great reception (never have disconnect or lag issues).  Nub for USB port is very tiny so even if you plug it in near your mouse hand, you'll never be annoyed by hitting it. The clicking sound is reasonably soft and not annoying (important if you are planning on using this in a shared office, quiet work space, etc.)--some mice(??) can have really obnoxious, springy sounds.  Seems reasonably ergonomic--I play a decent amount of video games and do a lot of work on the computer and my hand doesn't have any pain or discomfort.  A few great and unexpected features--1. there is an on/off switch that does not require unplugging the USB connector, which is not the case with all computer mice; 2. there is an indicator light that blinks on the top of the mouse, just below the scroller wheel, when batteries are running low (no surprises during intense gaming!!); 3. The battery door is easy to access and open and has one of those strips to easily pop out batteries; 4. there is a little spot under the battery door to store the USB connector inside the mouse when traveling (which allows it to sit flat with the USB connector inside, where for some mice it juts out and leaves the mouse sitting lopsided); and 5. it came with 2 AAA Amazon Basics batteries--hooray!
 I bought this mouse as a gift for my husband almost 4 years ago, and it is still working perfectly. It's outlasted other mice I bought for myself. It's out lasted (so far) a toddler  playing with it and tossing it against the fireplace.  It feels like quality material and has a nice weight, not too light. I'm honestly shocked it's lasted so well, I've never had a mouse survive this long!
 I've used this mouse for a little under a month, and not full time.  So far, it's been good.  It's a good travel size, and works well.  My one complaint is that this mouse seems to really go through batteries.  After only a few weeks of being powered on, it's already giving me a low battery indication.  (By comparison, the mouse I use all day at work is powered on continuously for well over 6 months before I get a low battery indication.)<br/><br/>If you want a good mouse at a decent price, and expect to use it only occasionally (e.g. for travel), this is a good bet.  If you want to use it for everyday use, I'd find an alternative.
 After having this mouse for about a year and a half, I am finally getting around to writing a review. Here's why. I just dropped it on the concrete floor at work (not for the first time). After adjusting the batter contact a little bit, the mouse works just fine. It's durability has surprised me.<br/><br/>Here are the pluses of this mouse:<br/>1. Durability - noted above. I think I have dropped it at least 3 times.<br/>2. Comfort - I am tall (around 6') and this is not a tiny mouse that makes my hand cramp.<br/>3. Connection - It always seems to connect without effort<br/>4. Works on most surfaces - it doesn't generally get thrown off on black or reflective surfaces as much as other mice.<br/><br/>The mixed<br/>1. Receiver storage - the receiver is stored inside the battery case. While this makes it less likely get lost in my laptop bag, it's not as convenient as a notch to store it on the side or bottom as I have seen on other mice, which means I may lose it because I don't take the time to pop the door off and put it away. And a wireless mouse without a receiver is useless<br/>2. Battery life - it is fair, but if you get cheap batteries, the mouse may not work right.<br/><br/>The bad<br/>I don't really have any.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this mouse.
 You are only given 30 days to send for a replacement from time of delivery.  The first 29 days it worked great, however the light on the bottom of the mouse started flashing at random and I started having problems with the function of the mouse.  Sometimes the pointer would disappear, sometimes it worked fine, other times it was only half-working.  At first I thought it was the batteries and replaced them.  That seemed to do the trick for about 3 or 4 days, but now it will not function at all, no matter what I do.  I am past the 30 day replacement window and I'm now looking to buy another brand.  I really did love this one during it's short life.  : (  No, I would not recommend to a friend.
 After three weeks the pointer started jumping. I don't know if this one is at fault, or all of them are like this. If you turn it on and off it will work for a few minutes, but that working time is getting shorter and shorter. I have hand problems and this mouse has become unusable. I need a very simple mouse as I cannot handle all the buttons. Guess I'll have to try again.
 I had no problems getting this mouse running on my Windows 7 PC, and it's had a solid connection ever since I bought it 6 months ago. What I *have* had a problem with, though, is the wheel. I wouldn't say it's noisy, but there is an audible squeak when scrolling. Worse, I've recently started having issues with the wheel slipping while I scroll through a page, leading to jerky movements. Less important but also worth mentioning is that one of the pads on the bottom is coming off and the glue is exposed, causing drag on my mousepad.<br/><br/>I complained to Amazon and they got back to me within 24 hours, offering me a full refund. They told me not to bother sending the old one back, too. So I'll buy another one and give it one more try, since I like the feel.<br/><br/>UPDATE 6/12/15: Well, the replacement mouse arrived and this one has its own problem. The plastic covering of the left mouse button is slightly raised, which causes the button to meet a bit of resistance when clicked. It gives the sensation of clicking twice, and the first mouse didn't do this at all. I was hoping that it would wear in and the problem would go away, but given my track record with this mouse, somehow I doubt it. I'm dropping my review score from 3 to 2 stars, and losing faith in AmazonBasics.<br/><br/>UPDATE 8/30/15: The problem with the left mouse button went away, thankfully. But for the last few months sometimes it feels like there's a grain of sand in the mouse wheel. It's not always there, and it's a nuisance at best.
 I bought this mouse because I had an Amazon Basics wired mouse that was wonderful. This one, not so much. It drains the batteries quite quickly (I’ve had it a couple of weeks and am already on my second set).  It is also fussy with its responsiveness even after adjusting the mouse settings on my computer. I’ve ended up ordering one from a different brand.
 I've been using this wireless mouse for nearly five months with a MacBook Pro and have not had any problems. The battery life is great. I've only had to change the batteries once, and that was likely because I never turn the mouse off during periods of nonuse. The mouse operates smoothly, and you can adjust the sensitivity through your laptop's settings. I have also had no issue with the range of device. I've tested it as far as five feet before I ran out of counter space to go further.<br/><br/>Kudos are also due for having a properly sized USB receiver. With other devices, I've had to contend with USB receivers that (presumably for aesthetic reasons) have a a wider base and block the other USB ports. This is not the case with this mouse's receiver.<br/><br/>Recommended.
 I would consider this an all-around OK mouse. It is not extremely precise, but unless you're really OCD you won't notice it. However, if you're doing a lot of graphic design work or clicking cells in Excel all day it will probably become a nuisance. This is due to the fact that the pointer jumps around a very small amount whenever you try to select something precise.<br/><br/>The actual housing quality is fine and the mouse is fairly comfortable (I have larger than average hands). All in all it's an OK mouse, but the pointer issue mentioned above would prevent me from buying another.
 While my first experience buying this mouse was not too bad, I eventually had to replace it as it stopped working consistently (even with new batteries).<br/><br/>I bought its replacement on Oct/29. It lasted about a month and a half before it stopped being reliable and not it does not work, even though the lights are on and I have tried using it with several different batteries.<br/><br/>Amazon will not support it, so be careful about buying this product. It might be cheap, but you are still wasting your money.
 I finally got sick of replacing my logitech VX Nanos for the same repeated issue (the left button stops working well) and figured this would be a tolerable replacement... turns out i like it better. I've had it only two months and would definitely buy it again. It still has the rubberized top surface which got removed a generation or two ago on the VX Nano which is a big plus. It may not have all of the bells and whistles that the VX Nano had, like the fast scroll and the forward backwards buttons, but it turns out i'd rather have a mouse that works. Even if the reliability is only on par (the jury is still out) I can buy 3 or 4 of these for the same price.<br/><br/>When i got this one, I also got a couple of the other similar looking cheaper mice and this was my preferred of the bunch, mostly for the rubberized coating and the fact that one of the had to be clicked to 'wake from sleep' (Tecknet)
 Had for 2 weeks, works excellent. a COUPLE dollars more than some others out there, but uses batteries stingily, clicks clean and sharp, track ball is excellent with a push selector if you use it, and the laser doesn't care what your mousepad happens to be.  Works fine on the leg of my jeans!  Worth every cent and is Prime, so all is good. Thanks Amazon.
 This is an excellent addition to my son's school Chromebook - he (and many of the other students) have found the trackpad to be less than responsive, and a general pain to use.  This durable, inexpensive mouse has made his computer use significantly less frustrating, and it's small enough to carry around with ease.  It's already sustained a couple of falls without incident, but even if it breaks, it's less than $15.  The only downside is a very audible "click" when using the buttons, which might prove irritating to other students, but the school Chromebook trackpad buttons aren't silent, either.  Overall, a choice we'd make again in a heartbeat
 I usually go to Amazon.com first, for user reviews and price. Looking to replace a mouse this one seemed more than adequate, at a decent price, with positive reviews. First set of batteries (supplied with mouse, lasted less than a week. Ok, so maybe they weren't as fresh as they could be, not a deal breaker. Replaced with name-brand batteries. Again, lasted less than a week. Sheesh, so maybe I need to remember to turn off the mouse when not in use (never was an issue with previously owned, other brands of cordless however). So I got into the habit of turning it off each day to conserve battery life. This mouse is a battery usage hog!!! I absolutely hate this. It will be replaced asap.
 Awesome quality for such a great price!  Works just like a full sized mouse; it's just smaller.  It takes AA batteries, and it doesn't drain the batteries much at all.  I am constantly forgetting to turn it off, but it still lasts for days and days when using it regularly.  I love the little receiver, too.  The last time I bought a wireless mouse was when the receivers were as inconvenient and bulky as the mouse.  This is the perfect size for a laptop (I hate the finger pads on the laptop), and it's portable on a second's notice.  No regrets w/ this purchase!
 I'm a Prime member and order a lot of my stuff from Amazon. A mouse I've had has worked well for several years - until it stopped doing so. I ordered this basic Amazon mouse, with which I play a fair amount of solitaire. I'm 79 and not a pro in these electronic things but this mouse has a bright red light and I don't think my earlier mouse did. This has created two problems. If the mouse leaves the surface, the cursor  wobbles a lot. Most importantly, it runs through batteries much faster than my previous wireless mouse. I know I should turn off the mouse when I'm through for the day, but I didn't have to do that before, and my memory isn't what it used to be. Suggestions welcome.
 These work GREAT with my Toshiba Computers.  My wife and I both have then and use them daily on our computers.  Each takes 2 AAA batteries and has a place to store the Nano Receiver internally if you need to travel. Great Buy too.  Also has an on/off switch to help conserve battery life.<br/><br/>Changed from 5 to 3 Stars after 3 months of use.  Mouse is hanging up - Cursor freezes and does not move for awhile 0 then moves if it feels like it.  After checking the owner's manual (Online) one recommendation was to try another USB Port.  I did and this seems to work. I am not sure why it took 3 months to start freezing (yes, I replaced the batteries (2x)).  I am not happy that it stopped working suddenly even if it seems to work now.<br/><br/>BTW - this has happened on both of my computers at the same time, not just one.
 I am very pleased with the 'mouse'.  I ordered the one that doesn't plug in, my son sent  me the one that does plug in.<br/>I think I prefer the one that plugs in...........it always works and I don't have to remember to turn it off when I leave my<br/>computer...it automatically turns off when I turn off the machine.  And, so far, this one has lasted over a year and is<br/>still fine.
 I bought 3 of these. One for myself and one each for my two older kids. They're easy to set up and connect to the computer, then they work perfectly until the battery starts to die. When the mouse starts glitching, you know it is time to replace the batteries. I did not turn the mouse off between uses, and the batteries lasted about a month. Would be nice to have a little longer battery life, but otherwise no complaints!
 Mouse worked great for two years. I like the ergonomics. Good functionality. Sufficient battery life (several months, depending on how often you turn it off).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it has stopped working. Computer still recognizes a USB has been plugged in. Changed batteries to no effect. Lazer light is on. Tried pushing Connect button to no effect.<br/><br/>At $10, it may be worth it for two years. If it had lasted another year I'd give it 4 stars. And if it had lasted longer than that, 5 stars for sure (with price considered).
 Does everything any other expensive brand wireless mouse does! I've been using this mouse for already two years and I have absolutely no problems. The covering doesn't scratch off like how the other wireless mouses I owned did. Everything is smooth and simple. The on and off button is on the bottom. If there was any complaint, it would be that if I were to travel with this mouse and pack it somewhere, I'd have to be careful with where I place the USB transmitter. Other mouses have a small storage place under the mouse to keep or some are magnetic so it sticks under the mouse. But its not much of a deal breaker for me. Definitely a great mouse for even a greater price!
 I've had this mouse for almost 7 months now and it has worked great. It has withstand being dropped multiple times (I'm very clumsy), being stomped on and chewed on by my 1 year old and still have had no problems with it. I love that you can store the receiver back inside the mouse when not in use and that it has an on/off feature to prolong your battery life. The cursor runs smoothly and doesn't glitch.
 My job requires that spend a good amount of time researching online.  I liked the convenience of a wireless mouse.  I thought for 10 dollars I would try out Amazon's offering.  Worked great out of the box, stopped working yesterday morning (March 27th, 2019).  5 months of a working mouse is well, disappointing to say the very least.
 Do Not Buy!  This is a very small mouse to start with.  It works when you first use it, then it starts shooting all over the place, almost like your computer is possessed.  I changed the batteries 3 times and my husband changed the batteries 4 times.  Not only does it just go where ever it wants, but it also freezes up.  By the time you have gone through the battery thing, it's too late to return it.
 The amazon wireless mouse is a sleek and modern mice. The scroll wheel is a smooth scroll with very subtle bumps. Connectivity was no problem and the mouse itself has no software required to run, so it's a plug and play. I tested it on both IOS and Windows; no problems with the connection. I really love the ergonomics of the mouse. I can rest my hands very naturally on the mouse. I would classify this as a "small" mouse for those concerned.<br/>My only complaint would have to be the bottom surface of the mouse. It's not as smooth when gliding across a surface; even on a mouse pad. I noticed that there is a substantial drag when moving.<br/>Overall, very great mouse for the price. Great value!
 This is a great mouse. I purchased this in July of last year and I am still using the same batteries that I originally put in there.  It is lightweight and it works with both Mac and PC (just plug in and use - my favorite way of using technology).<br/><br/>It is a very simple mouse - no pomp and circumstance.  It does not light up, sparkle or shoot fireworks - it just works and that is all I want it to do.  The only thing is that you have to put a mouse pad under it because on some surfaces it gets a little diva and refuses to work.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who just want something that works - pure and simple.
 UPDATE - Mouse is quite dead. So if you like renting your equipment every few months, by all means try this piece of junk.<br/><br/>SO far, so good. It's easy to use, size is just right. (I was a little concerned because many people commented that it was too small. I'm a female, but with rather large hands, and I think it works great.)  Love the purple color.<br/><br/>It connected instantly to my old Mac, never drops the connection.
 Had this mouse for a couple years now and I use eneloops in them.. and while the mouse functions exactly as it should, the battery drain is just terrible where I've had to replace them every couple weeks depending on how much I use them.  I use this for my work laptop so it gets used very frequently.  That said, I used to have an old discontinued logitech micro mouse before this and that used to last me a 2-3 months before needing to change batteries.  If you're using this casually at home, I'm sure it'll be more than fine.
 My wife bought one these a few years back and just I bought one for my laptop, and I couldn't be happier.  It is solidly built and simply works.  I have a wireless mouse at work that periodically disconnects from the computer and will take 15-20 seconds to reconnect which can be quite annoying depending on when the signal is dropped.  My Amazon mouse however has never dropped its connection with the computer: it just works.<br/><br/>Setup is simple: plug the USB receiver into a USB port and turn on the mouse.  It has great ergonomics whether you have big hands or small.  I usually like a bigger mouse and find this one to be really comfortable to use while my wife prefers a smaller mouse, and also finds it quite comfortable as well.  The small size of the USB receiver is another advantage as well.  Not only does the thing fit in the battery compartment for storage, but it is so small that you can leave it plugged into the computer without worrying about banging on things or getting accidentally knocked off, no matter how tightly fitting your laptop's is.  At twelve bucks, it's hard to find anything cheaper, let alone somthing that works this well.
 pros: good construction generally, subtle presence on the desk as it should since it's a simple input device. May be good for small hands.<br/><br/>cons: No good for big hands. I find it very uncomfortable to work with after a 4 day trial.  My fingers either have to be draped over the buttons casusing me to loose mouse clicks since I often hit the top frame or desk instead of depressing the buttons.  If I roll my hand back, it wants to skip away from me.  There are no comfortable positions.  I measured the length of a LogitchM310 Mouse, Dell Mouse and The Amazon mouse.  The Amazon mouse is 1/2" shorter and harder to grip without contouring.  I will return it for another Logitech or brand which fits my hand.
 I use with rechargeable batteries, that last about two weeks between charges with Japanese made batteries. The chinese batteries last maybe three days. If I don't remember to turn it off at night, it will be dead by morning! It is cheap and works.The middle wheel works fine for scrolling. Chinese made, has a starter set of cheap chinese batteries, and the dongle is shipped INSIDE the mouse. Instructions are shitty, but unneeded.
 I felt the need to come on here and write a review, since I didn't before.  This mouse has been excellent, never had problems with signal, and though it's a little smaller than normal mice, it's not super tiny and I don't really notice.  I use it almost extensively with my laptop, at home and at work, and I use it almost every single day.  That being said, I haven't changed the batteries since I got it (which was early April of last year... over a year ago) and just today it finally started giving me a signal for low batteries.  That's pretty darn good (two AmazonBasics AAA batteries that I THINK came with it, but I can't remember).  I'd definitely recommend this mouse.<br/><br/>In comparison, I bought a Logitech Unifying Receiver mouse for my desktop recently because I have a Unifying Receiver keyboard, and I haven't been too happy with its performance, both in how it feels and the fact that it does lose signal sometimes.  This is vastly superior (the only possible downfall being the slightly smaller size, though you might even prefer it).
 Installation was as easy as inserting the transmitter in an available USB slot, turning on the mouse and pushing the connect button. Done. Really, no more difficult than that. Has a soft touch feel. Left and right click 'buttons' are actually integreated into the cover and are or course on the left and right side of the wheel as shown. They have both a positive click feel to them as well as a definitive click sound when pressed. The soft touch wheel rotates easily but with a slightly damped feel to it which in no way affects performance, just the feel as it turns. It slides easily on my desktop, is precise, doesn't drop out, and might just be the best under $12 mouse ever made, (or at least that I've ever owned). Highly recommended.
 I love this little thing! I bought it to carry around with me on campus (to the library, class, my dorm) and it has been holding up well. It fits perfectly in my hand and does everything it's supposed to do. The matte coating on the top is a nice finish, too. The USB plug fits into a space between the batteries in the mouse, so I feel I'll never lose it. It's my first portable wireless mouse and I have nothing bad to say about it!
 I read the reviews on this mouse &amp; that is why I bought it for my Macbook Pro 2014/2015.  This little mouse is so cute &amp; it worked instantly, in fact I'm using it right now on the Mac.  I have tiny hands &amp; wanted a tiny cordless mouse &amp; this tiny mouse is very comfortable for my tiny hands.  I use my left hand with it with no problems.  The included AAA batteries that came with it was not too hard for me to figure out how to insert them into the mouse.  Make sure to turn the switch to the on position on the bottom of the mouse.  The red light on the bottom of the mouse lets me know that it's on.  Simple.  The center role not loud at all, the right &amp; left click, very muted clicking sound.  All in all, a very quiet little mouse.  I think Amazonbasics did it right again.  The pricing on this is very reasonable, the quality of the mouse very well built with smooth operation. Just be careful when opening the battery compartment in the back.  The lid is a little thin.  Just use your bit of a fingernail to press it down lightly &amp; pull out to open it to insert the batteries.  I would recommend this mouse for those of you who want something small to pack or with small hands.  This little mouse is quite the gem:O)
 Highly recommend for those of you who are annoyed by a touchpad for a mouse.  Easy to install!<br/>Before you boot your laptop or tablet, put the nano receiver in the usb port add batteries to your mouse<br/>they are included and then turn on the mouse which is located on the bottom next to the battery compartment.<br/>No software to install.  Start your pc and it works!
 This mouse is a basic mouse just like they say. The resolution seems to be a bit low so if you are using it to paint or draw it may not be the mouse for you. If you are using it for general web browsing or office work then it should be ok. The way you load the batteries is not good they are inserted on an angle and it is difficult to see if you are inserting them correctly. I had serious concerns that I would break something internally when inserting the batteries. This is a normal or 90% size desktop mouse not a mini mouse and not a large mouse. It should work for most  people's hands for desktop use. In addition to resolution being low this mouse has small glitches when you are working in detail that makes it difficult to be accurate. My previous mouse was 600dpi with a higher dpi button I believe this one is less than 600dpi and at that res it is not accurate for image processing... .
 NICE LITTLE MOUSE, EASIER TO HANDLE AND MOVE AROUND THAN FULL SIZE MOUSE.  LIKE THE RED/BLACK COMBO AS WELL.<br/>I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT AMAZON DIDN'T INCLUDE THE 2 AA SIZE BATTERIES WITH IT TO GET YOU STARTED TO USE THE MOUSE, AT LEAST IT CAME WITH THE USB GIZMO.  A LITTLE CHEAP ON AMAZON'S PART.  I JUST GOT A FULL SIZE DELL MOUSE FOR THE SAME PRICE AS THIS ONE AND IT CAME WITH A AA BATTERY.
 I like the style, and it works.  The rubberized texture on the top is a nice touch.  But mice like this are completely commodity.  It would have to be really special to rate more than "okay" and this mouse is not that special.<br/><br/>- The tracking sometimes skips.  There's plenty of texture on my old desk to detect motion accurately, and my Logitech and Microsoft mice never skipped.  It does not slip often but often enough to be noticed.<br/><br/>- It is a bit lightweight.  If they had even put in a 10 cent slug of lead to add some bulk I'd be happier.  It is just not comfortable to mouse around with something so light, the small muscles in the hand and arm need feedback.<br/><br/>For the price and convenience its good enough.
 Actually I was planning to buy the Logitech's Anywhere MX. But in the last minute I changed my mind because it was a little too expensive. Now I am very happy to have this mouse as an alternative, and this mouse is more than just an alternative. It's small enough to be a quite a good fit to my small hand, and works smoothly and correctly. The touch of the surface is also satisfactory. I just cannot believe that it's possible to have this mouse of this quality at this price.<br/><br/>One sad thing comparing to the anywhere mx is that this mouse does not have any back button.
 For $10 this is a pretty difficult mouse to beat. I got it to replace a Logitech wireless mouse that must've been defective as it tracked crookedly.<br/><br/>The size is a little smaller than your typical full-size mouse which took me by surprise since that's not obvious from the photos. Installation was easy on Windows 10 and the movement is smooth and accurate. There is nothing fancy here - three button functionality one of which is a wheel. It doesn't appear to have an auto-off feature but battery life seems fine so far.
 My item arrived today with my "guaranteed 2-day shipping" No problems with shipping. Item was packaged nicely in an "Amazon basics" box. Inside was instructions, the mouse itself and 2 amazon brand batteries.  Comes with everything needed for use right out of the box! So installation/setup is very simple. Open the battery door, take out the USB dongle and plug into your computer. Then pop in the batteries and you're good to go!<br/><br/>Enjoy :)
 This mouse is great but is lacking in a few ways that makes me give it a 3 star review. I've had this a little over a year an the scroll wheel is starting to slip, which is a huge nuisance at times. I have to apply extra pressure to make it scroll properly, and I don't know how much longer it will hold up. If it gets worse I will definitely have to replace it, and I expect a mouse to function properly for at least 2 or 3 years.<br/><br/>The other downside to this mouse is that it doesn't have an auto off, so if I leave it on by accident, which I've done plenty of times, the battery will die a lot faster than usual. All in all though this mouse feels sturdy and feels good in the hand.
 Variable quality.  This is the second one ot this item I have purchased.  The first one is still working well after more than a year.  This one has had issues with it's wheel and often it cannot be clicked or sticks when clicked.  I would return it for a refund but the return shipping is nearly as much as the cost of the product.  Amazon used to be a reliable seller, but this product is hardly worth purchasing, unless you want to play the return game!
 This is an inexpensive little mouse but it works just fine.  I replaced a Microsoft mouse that I had for 10 years that just finally gave up.  This one is a little smaller and probably good for traveling though I use it at my desk.  I think it is comfortable.  The roller wheel operated smoothly with little detents as you roll it.  It even has the side-click on the roller to shift the mouse into scroll mode.  This mouse uses AAA batteries unlike my other mice that use AA.  It's not really a problem, just different.
 I had the exact same one for at least a year or more(don't remember when I bought it), and it was fine, so I figured I would order another one when the first one died.  Well, I should have listened to the reviews.  It only worked a couple of weeks and then died.  Now I am back to my old plug-in one.  At least it works.
 Pros:<br/>I don't think you can find a better wireless mouse for only $10.  Build quality is solid and I like that it's on the smaller side without being too small.  The usb component fits in a compartment for portability which is nice.  Battery life is decent and it has an on/off switch.  Did I mention it's the cost of like 4 cups of coffee?<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>It could be more accurate.  It's good enough for office work, but for gaming or graphics I would spring for a better mouse.  Occasionally it'll cause my cursor to skip around more than it should.  It also seems to require a mousepad for any kind of accuracy, whereas my other optical mice do not.  It requires the USB dongle / is not bluetooth.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  If you need a solid portable mouse for office-type work on a budget, this one fits the bill perfectly.
 Update 20180428: It almost never reconnects to the Chromebook any more. I keep putting new batteries in it but that didn't seem to be the problem. I have much better luck with another cheap mouse I bought 4 years. That one comes up easily every time. Not happy with the Amazon mouse. Probably returning it.<br/><br/>Good, simple mouse. Exactly what you would expect. Works on a Chromebook. It connected to mine immediately without any problems.
 Had high hopes for this cordless mouse because most of Amazon “choice” products are both good products and excellent values. This mouse would be an exception. I may have a faulty one but the computer reports it is installed but it locks up and/or starts moving erratically with no particular pattern or program. Ironically I had bought a less expensive mouse for my laptop from Amazon and it works flawlessly. I thought that buying the Amazon choice product would be an even better experience but it has not worked out that way on this occasion.
 The mouse works as you would expect a mouse to work.  I haven't used it enough to run the batteries down, so I don't know about the battery life.  I don't game so I can't say anything about that.  It's small enough to stuff in your computer bag and take with you, but I leave mine on the desk.  Again, It's a $10 mouse.  It doesn't have any bells and whistles but it works just fine.
 I decided to try this mouse because it was inexpensive, and because I'd had generally good experiences with other AmazonBasics gear before.  At first it seemed like a decent piece of equipment - maybe not quite as smooth or comfortable as MS or Logitech mice I've used, but reasonably solid and better than other off-brand mice.  I liked the compact size, although the nano receiver was bulkier than ones for other wireless mice and didn't seem to fit as snugly into USB ports.  The mouse worked OK while it lasted, but it went bad in a little under two months.  One day it just stopped working ... at first I thought it was the batteries, so I changed them but that didn't help.  I tried a different USB port on the laptop and it started working again, but then started going bad there as well after a few more days - the computer would randomly just lose the connection with it.  I could unplug and re-plug the receive and it would work again for a while, but it would eventually lose the connection again.  I tried it on another laptop and it wouldn't respond at all.  For a couple more bucks, I'm going back to name brand mice.
 i bought this mostly out of curiosity, thinking that maybe it would last longer than the cheap USB ones i normally buy every 6-8 months or so..............................................<br/><br/>two months later and i'm back to the USB ones i normally buy. the batteries in this seem to die every week and even when they aren't dying, the mouse tends to jerk and lag which makes using it for anything that involves the vaguest semblance of precision impossible. i love it when i'm trying to pause a movie and instead the mouse jerks halfway across the screen to close the entire window out--i love it even more when it happens on a daily basis! experiment completed, i'm definitely sticking with the wires
 Pros:<br/><br/>I love the design of this mouse.  I've been using it at work for over a year and a half and it's still working fine.  It's very comfortable and responsive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The battery life is abysmal.  Using it at work, I am lucky to get through two weeks of daily before the battery light begins flashing to let me know the battery is running low.  If your usage is minimal and you turn it off after each day, you might get a month of use out of it before needing to change the batteries.  I'd recommend using rechargeable batteries to keep your costs down.
 I returned another cordless mouse that quit working after a day and looked at this one.  I purchased it and have used it everyday for several hours each day going through old family photos to send a DVD to family members after cropping and restoring the imperfections that occur in old photos 703 so far to go through.  I will purchase this again if the one I own breaks and I would recommend this to others. I replaced a corded mouse that I tripped over and dropped to the floor daily with this one so, I would say I'm not as gentle as I should be.  This one is easy to use and came with batteries, a plus when purchasing an item.  Just pop the batteries in and turn it on.
 Would be absolutely perfect if it wasn't so small. I love the build, tracking, and operation of it...but I'm an adult! The size is better for little people or kids. This is not a small matter. On my old wired Microsoft mouse (please note: I'm cool, I have a Mac) the size allows me rest my entire hand on the body. This mouse requires the use my hand muscles the entire time I'm using it. No, I'm not a wimp. It's akin to crouching at your desk all day instead of sitting. Not fun.
 I'm sorry - but I purchased 2 of these and both died within a short period of time. It seems the receiver stops receiving while the unit itself keeps trying to connect. I'm not exactly pleased that Amazon won't replace this unit after less than two months of use (56 days). In any case, I've been very impressed with most of Amazon Basics products - cables, ipad stand, computer case, etc etc, But, this item will not be on my repeat order list.
 The nano reciever plugs into any computer with a USB port and works wonders. So much easier than having to connect to Bluetooth. I’ve used this with my personal laptop and with a school issued chrome book and it’s been perfect. Portable and functional. I only have durability a 4 star because obviously it’s a piece of technology and should be treated as such. You can toss it into your computer case and it’ll be fine, but you should be hold some precaution in not being too rough with it. I put batteries in when it came to me in late December, and now I’m nearing the end of February and it has had no issues. All in all, a perfectly working item that I would certainly buy again.
 Battery Issue:  The batteries depend on a flimsy cover to stay connected (the cover physically mashes and the battery with the positive terminal into the connectors)  The problem is that the battery doesn't stay connected  --it will disconnect with a jar to the mouse.  Not good.  Poor design.
 I use with an Apple Mac book pro and this mouse is inconsistent  When it works it works fine but it seems to lose the signal and flutter and jump around...reconnect and will work for a while longer but getting to be too much to put up with  Sent one back and replacement is a little better but what do you expect for $10
 My granddad was having issues with the trackpad as he transitioned from a desktop to a laptop computer, so I found the simplest mouse I could for him. This works great, fits his hand and in the bag, and doesn't have any "gimmicks" to confuse him. We're working on getting the left vs. right click down (he was coming over from a mac), but the scroll button has been great. The USB is also low-profile so it can stay in his laptop the entire time, and this tracks smoothly so he can follow it.<br/><br/>The other thing I like about this is the battery life. I put some extra batteries in his bag just in case, but he's been plugging away with this for a few months now, and let me know that he hasn't had to change them out so far.
 This mouse was purchased as a replacement to an older cordless mouse.  I guess to anyone who has been keeping up with the industry, this mouse is a standard run of the mill OK mouse.  To me, it was a little more than that.  My old mouse had a USB adaptor that I would plug into the computer then run the wire to the front of the computer where the receiver was located.  The old mouse would then work if I were within approximately four feet of it.  The new mouse has a small USB receiver that I plug into the computer (it extends approximately 3/8 inch with no other wires or attachments).  The new mouse works all the way across my living room (22 feet), I have not tried further distances than that.<br/><br/>Setup was as easy as installing the supplied batteries into the mouse, turning the mouse on, inserting the USB receiver into the computer, then turning the computer on.  Everything worked from there.
 I've had this mouse for about 8 months.  It worked OK every once in awhile it would cut out and I would have to disconnect the receiver and plug it back in.  My main complaint with this mouse is the battery life.  I don't like having to change them monthly even when I shut the mouse off at night.  My previous experiences with mouse battery life was with using the microsoft mouse.  The mouse I used at work had a battery that lasted two years and my other one at the house went a little over a year.  I downgraded it to a spare mouse if needed and bought another microsoft mouse.
 I was a big fan for the first month or so.<br/><br/>Now it randomly stops working (it is not the batteries or the USB port). I have to switch it on and off again to get it working, then it's usually not working again within the next minute or so. I'm using it on a laptop and the built-in touchpad has no such issue.<br/><br/>I am not giving it one star only because of how well it worked when it did work, and the fact there are so many people who don't seem to be having the same problem.
 I bought this mouse in August.  It was very easy to set up and was happy at first. Until just the other day the mouse started getting giggling on the screen and it became difficult to use.  Then the mouse stopped moving. I replaced the batteries with brand new ones and tried reconnecting .  It just stopped working after a few months.  Amazon was kind enough to provide me a refund.
 Nine months and still going strong.  I have experimented with four competitors, all more costly, and with special "bells and whistles" but have found this to be my favorite.  With my small hands, this is just the ideal size and shape.  I do miss "forward/backward" buttons, found on my back-ups, but the tactile feel, quick response, and simple functionality of the unit override such losses.  Make no mistake, this is no "gaming" mouse, and DPI is not adjustable.  But if you want a device which simply works well, this is the one I recommend.
 I have been trying to give this mouse a chance.  I have changed the batteries several times.  Changing the batteries is difficult to say the least!  Very poor design.  The batter door has also broken.  I am not impressed........choose a different one.  Amazon, you can have it.  If this is your choice, better choose again.
 I truly love this mouse!  This is my second Amazon wireless mouse: the first one was perfect, but my house cleaner misplaced the chip!  Woe was me!  I ordered this one, put the chip in and am going strong.  I enjoy this product for the freedom it gives me in my work, the ease of use and the engineering of size and aesthetics.  How Amazon does such good work for such a low price is amazing.
 I have a medium sized hand for a man.  It fits me perfectly; comfortable for long term use.  Points well, appropriate speed, simple set up:  Plug in the transmitter (mine is plugged into a hub with 5 other devices), put in 2 AAA batteries (supplied), turn it on.  Done; I'm writing this stupid review.
 My old wired style mouse finally failed after being knocked off my desk by my overly curious cat one too many times, so I got a wireless that I can stash up high and out of harms way.  I haven't had any problems with it, I just unplugged the broken one, rebooted my computer (Windows 7) and it was working.  No drivers to install, nothing.  I turn it off when I'm not using it, and just set it up out of harm's way.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet (I've had it for about 6 weeks now) so I can't comment on how long they last.  The price was right and it works great!<br/><br/>****UPDATE****7/2/2016 Just changed the batteries for first time, have dropped it and caused the batteries to fly out at least 10 times and it still works like a champ.  I can use it from across the room if I want.  Great purchase.
 Receiver functions well, but the mouse itself feels a bit unwieldy and uncomfortable to me. Part of the problem is not specific to this device: Batteries tend to make wireless mice heavier than their wired counterparts, and that marginal increase in weight can make a real difference if you're using the mouse intensively for many hours in a row. On this particular device, I also found the buttons to be a little too "mushy": I prefer a nice, crisp click and some resistance so I can relax my hand without worrying about accidentally depressing a button. Overall, though, the quality of the product is fine, particularly given the price. I don't use this mouse every day, but it's the one I carry in my laptop bag for use when I'm traveling. (Unfortunately, my main laptop right now is a big Lenovo Y510p, which has the absolute worst trackpad in laptop history, so I'm pretty much forced to use a mouse whenever I want to get real work done.)
 I was told this mouse would work with Windows 10.  It arrived yesterday. I put in the inclosed batteries, plugged in the little transceiver or whatever it is called, turned it 'on', and pressed the 'connect' button though nothing in reading material mentions it, maybe I didnt hold 'connect' long enough, but it did not operate at all, so I'm back to the wired mouse, which I hate. SO very disappointed
 I haven't use this mouse much, just one day so far. It's going to be used with a laptop at home but because it was delivered to my office, I connected it to my work computer and used it for entire day doing computer aided drafting and modeling. It was very extensive use requiring comfortable mouse and high precision work with vector graphics. I didn't see this mouse to be worst or better than other mice that I have used in the past of such brands like Dell, Microsoft and Logitech. Because I do enormous amount of clicking and scrolling, I'm very picky about the quality and feel of the mouse. I can't predict how long this mouse will last but I liked it a lot.
 Using this mouse right now; initially planned to give it as a replacement for a damaged mouse to my son. Wow. This mouse is smooth on my desk - without a mouse pad. It is more responsive than some of my Logitech mice, which I have several around the house. This is surprising due to the low cost, but Amazon Basics products are usually well made. Some reviewers were not happy with the wheel, but I've tested it for a few days and found no issues with it. All in all a great purchase and highly recommended to new buyers. One note: this is not a large mouse...it's not a small portable one, either. The size is slightly smaller than my Logitech mice, but the buttons sit a bit higher, which suits my hand better. I mention this in case they prefer full size mice, otherwise, enjoy.
 Great mouse!  Was skeptical at first being an Amazon product.  I've been buying premium "Logitech" and/or "Microsoft" mouse, keyboards, etc for almost 15 years.<br/><br/>Caveat (Reliability?):  Only been using the mouse for ~ 3 months.  So far no issues.  I will try an updated this review if any issues come up.<br/><br/>I will say my experience with expensive Logitech products has been great in terms of reliability.  I'm currently typing this review on a Logitech wireless keyboard that has been in service since 2001.  Yes 2001!  And still works great!  So, if this mouse breaks after a year, then I personally would pay more for reliability.  Only time will tell.
 I've tried a number of cheapo wireless mouse for my traveling work notebook and this mouse can't be beat for the price.  My bag tends to get tossed around a lot, so I really didn't want to spend much on a mouse that would potentially get busted or mistakenly left at a hotel.  The tracking is very smooth, unlike others in this price range.  If you are looking for a small, portable wireless mouse for business travel and do not want to spend a lot of money, this is great product.
 I like a full-sized mouse, or even better, a trackball... but there isn't a whole lot of sense to buying a small, lightweight laptop and then hauling a full-sized, heavy mouse along with me.<br/><br/>The Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse lives up to its description: it is a mouse, it is wireless, it comes from Amazon, and it's pretty basic.  It's also small without being silly about it, lightweight, and works well. For the price, it's the absolutely perfect for schlepping to the coffee shop.<br/><br/>Recommended.
 The price caught me off guard but all the previously-posted positive reviews affected my decision to purchase this Amazon product versus a legacy "brand" name product. I had trouble with the first mouse I purchased in that it was defective (no response to any applied actions to the mouse to get it functional). I had NO problems returning it through Amazon and had another mouse sent to me within 48 hours. Once the batteries were inserted it connected to my computer instantly. This mouse works well and, in my case, better than any other mouse I have previously used. Amazon rarely, if ever, produces poor products and I hope this never changes. This mouse was the right purchase for me and I'm pleased with how Amazon handled the entire transaction.
 First of I ordered a red one and got a purple one, secondly the nano chip or USB connection isn't durable lasted less than 3 days but that was my brother's fault for leave it plugged into the laptop and moving it around a lot. I think that the 99 cent USB chips are more durable than this don't recommend it at all
 When my laptop right click button stopped working for no apparent reason, I was so irritated to have to buy a mouse. The whole point of a laptop is not having any external items that need to be plugged in! I was not about to replace the whole thing, so I got this guy after reading the reviews. It's exactly what I expected and I haven't had any issues (been using it approx. a year now). The receiver doesn't stick out too far, so I don't hit it against things when I'm moving around, and I like that I can turn off the mouse from the bottom if I don't need to use the right click button and just use what the laptop came with. I've used this with both a windows and mac laptop without any issues.
 I have used this mouse for a couple of months now and it is great. Comfortable to use and I like the fact that I can turn off the battery when I'm not using it.  One thing you might notice wen you purchase it. The "usb" plug that syncs it to your computer is in the battery compartment for shipping. I looked through the packaging for it when the product arrived and couldn't find it until I opened the battery compartment.
 I love this mouse. I purchased this for my laptop at home. I do a lot of work from home. The battery life holds pretty well. The color is beautiful and the quality is great! I wish it were slightly quieter but it’s not bad like some I have had in the past. Amazon did a good job with this mouse.
 The mouse itself works fine with Chromebook but the tangs on the bottom cover covering the batteries and the nano receiver broke after a couple months use taking the cover off  in order to get to the nano receiver. (The receiver is stored in the bottom of the mouse between the batteries.) Without the cover in place the batteries can fall out fairly easily. Probably should leave the nano receiver in the PC's port to prevent the problem caused by taking the cover off and then back on. Other than this, works fine.
 Best mouse ever, and so inexpensive!!!  I replaced my wireless mouse (only 2 years old and from a big name brand) with this Amazon branded wireless mouse.  It was super easy and intuitive to set-up that I didn't require any instructions.  Just plug in the usb chip, insert the batteries (supplied), and voila!  Instant perfection!!! I own a Mac Book Pro and the Amazon wireless mouse is much better than anything I've ever used before.  Thanks Amazon!!!
 This mouse was perfect so basic wireless mouse function needs. I like that it has the softer top instead of just being hard plastic. It came with two AAA batteries from Amazon, which was nice to not have to dig around for some. I like the storage 'compartment' inside of the mouse for the wireless USB piece that goes into your computer. It did come with a weird clear plastic tab inside that I tried to pull out (almost like a clear plastic piece you pull out of some toys or electronics to 'activate' them), but it wouldn't budge and I didn't want to break the mouse. It still works just fine regardless!
 I wanted a wireless mouse for my school computer, and Amazon Basics makes things affordable for the cash-strapped. The mouse is very responsive, and the battery lasts a long time. I think months went by before I finally had to change out the batteries that came with the mouse. The top has a nice velvety feel to it, which creates awkward moments because I've had multiple people come up just to feel it. I'm not joking. Other than that, the one thing I don't like about it is that it clicks rather loudly but not loud enough to be too annoying. Definitely a great buy.
 simple, small, and it works!<br/><br/>I travel for work and i need a mouse that can work on MAC, PC, or UNIX. I didn't need fancy looks or a ton of buttons. This one I plug in and it just works. no driver install needed. it is fairly light so it does not weigh down my tech bag at a client site.<br/><br/>I will recommend this for anyone needing a small light weight easy to use mouse.
 I was expecting the batteries to last longer. My fault maybe as the mouse is left on for long periods of time without benefit of turning off.  The feel and fit of the mouse is a 5 star rating (I have fairly small hands - if you have large hands this may be too small for you) but because longevity of battery usage brought it to a 4.
 This mouse seems to work just as well as the logitech ones that I usually buy. The scroll wheel is a little bit touchier than my previous ones but I quickly got use to it. This mouse is precise and has no lag. The scroll wheel opens another window just fine when it is clicked on. It is the same size in my hand as the logitech and is comfortable. I'm pretty happy with this purchase.
 I've been having erratic performance with some of my Bluetooth keyboards, I guess because of interference or something. I had purchased a Logitech keyboard with a dongle (called here a nano-tranceiver) and noticed a lot more connection stability and smoothness of operation.<br/><br/>Although I love my Apple trackpad, it will drop out or act strangely from time to time. I want to say I'm relieved to have this as a back-up. The aspect which is very cool is the click of the scroller wheel which activates mouse scrolling. The action is very smooth and I can set it to auto-scroll at various speeds for reading articles (sort of like a tele-prompter).<br/><br/>As the dongle has a storage compartment, it makes this a great transportable device and the USB "dongle" means that Bluetooth setup issues are eliminated. If it picked up the paper and took out the trash, I'd give it 5 stars.
 The amazon basics mouse is a good, well sized mouse with a nice feel to it and all in all great workings. I've been using for the last two months or so, and I haven't had anything to complain about in relation to the way the mouse functions in and of itself. The left and right clicks have no issues as far as I can tell, and the scroll wheel feels good and also clicks, which is really great.<br/><br/>There is one issue, and that's in the receiver. The receiver is quite (physically) weak, in that it will break with some pressure in the wrong areas. I carry my computer in a tight-fitted, semi-hard-shell case, so when its in there, if the receiver is also in a usb jack, it wears down and has now become VERY unstable in properly connecting to the computer. I have to bend it down to get it to connect right, and even then it will disconnect on occasion.<br/><br/>So, the bottom line: Its a really great mouse; it feels nice, and it functions really well. However, the receiver is not made to withstand any type of wear or bending... so if you'll be using your computer in a way that creates such a situation, you may want to get something else. On the flipside, if you're not using your computer in that way, then this should be the perfect mouse for you.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.
 I bought this at the same time I bought <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-Wired-Keyboard-Black/dp/B005EOWBHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard (Black)</a>. The keyboard, so far, seems to impress me more than this mouse for a couple of reasons:<br/> - The keyboard has a pretty good design. No bulkiness. This mouse does not really match the simplicity of the keyboard design.<br/> - The mouse is a little bit too small for a comfortable grip. I felt something is a bit off compared to using other mice.<br/> - Now, this is the reason I gave this mouse a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5. The lid for the batteries on the back nearly breaks the first time I tried to close it. The material used to make the mouse does not seem to be that durable. The lid is now not flat and makes my experience with the mouse quite unimpressive. Every time I move the mouse around, I feel that the lid sticks out a bit and prevents smooth motion of the mouse.<br/><br/>Now, the positive side. The compactness if great. The tiny USB is well-designed to fit right in between the two batteries. I actually consider this a very clever design to reduce the space occupation. Overall, this mouse is good for its offered price. However, if you are willing to afford more, I am pretty sure there is a better mouse with smoother motion and more comfortable grip out there.
 This mouse worked just fine for a year. As soon as out of warrantee, it started to have problems. It lets me turn it on, works for 3 seconds and turns off. Tried new batteries, rebooted, etc. It's ok if you get a good deal on price, but I'll try another one and see off it can last longer.
 I've had this mouse for a month. The stock batteries died very quickly so I wrote down the replacement date on my topless volunteer firemen calendar: February 9, 2015. It is currently thirteen (13) days later and my replacements are dead.<br/><br/>I guess you have to switch this mouse OFF every time you walk away from it. Otherwise it just keeps mousin'. First time I've had this problem but also the last 'cause every other modern mouse on the market hibernates to conserve battery power. Ultimately my fault for not delving into the fine print.<br/><br/>Also? The left click button is SLIGHTly jankified... just a tiny, teeny-weeny bit imperfect, but enough to be atrociously annoying.<br/><br/>Highly not recommended. I'd send it back but it's not worth the hassle. I'll just give Amazon more of my money for a different mouse. That'll teach them.
 I am very happy with the style, material and quality of the mouse! I'd definitely buy another one.<br/><br/>If you need/want your mouse to be silent, this isn't the right one for you.  The clicks and scrolling are a little bit loud.  I use this for working at home, but if I used it in an office, it would probably drive my coworkers a little nuts.
 I am going on four months with this product. It is very heavily used and it is still going strong. I have opened the battery compartment multiple times and it has not broken on my like in some of the reviews I read before purchasing. One note; if your hands are a bit on the longer/larger side this mouse may be a bit too small for you. Also, if you use lotion on your hands, you will begin to notice where the finger tips naturally rest on the mouse. I'm right handed so the index finger position is well defined on the material of the mouse.
 I believe this mouse to be of higher quality than a mouse that is more costly.The packaging is easy to open. The mouse is plug and play without waiting to my Apple to Windows 7 waiting for a  driver. The mouse is half inch smaller than my more expensive HP mouse but fits nicely in my hand. I bought the same size, more costly major brand,  refurbished mouse and the AmazonBasic's mouse deal.
 Its a very adorable mouse, however, after using it only twice - it looks worn out - I was expecting it to look good and new for at least 2 months as I am quite a neat freak. Disappointed.
 This mouse is comfortable to use.  The instructions seem to be in Chinese so I had to go by the diagram to figure out how to put in the batteries and where the nano receiver was located.  Turns out it's stored inside the mouse where the batteries are located and not in an outside slot like my previous mouse.
 I've been through 3 Logitech wireless "value" mice , two m315 and a m350. Both started acting up and the middle click stopped working right within a month. They would get stuck and scroll on web pages when I didn't want them to. I tried installing the bloated Logitech software and it did not help. I was debating switching back to Microsoft since I like their wired mice but I finally I bought this AmazonBasics mouse because of the price and I was pleasantly surprised. It has only been a week and the tracking is very accurate and the scroll wheel is perfect. It doesn't have any fancy back/forward functionality but it just works. Very happy.
 This wireless mouse is perfect for me.  The price is great, and the mouse feels very substantial.  The nano-receiver is great, I can leave it in my computer or store it under the battery cover.  The mouse clicks and scroll wheel are very distinct, which I really like.  The material the mouse is made of feels great on the hand and is very comfortable to use for an extended period of time.  I have had this for a few months now, and use it at least a few times a week and have not had to change the batteries, although I am usually pretty careful to turn the mouse off.
 I bought this as a cheap option for basic computer use. It lasted for 13 months and now something has gone wrong to where it will connect to the computer and the sensor on the bottom lights up, but the computer will not respond to clicking. I tried it in several USB ports, but with no luck. It seems like it has something to do with the mouse driver, but you can't do much with that because it's a cheap mouse.<br/><br/>In the end, for the price it was a great option, but I wish that it would have either lasted longer than a year or that the warranty was longer than one year. I would recommend it only if you are willing to potentially have to replace it before too long - other reviews that I read have also said that the mouse lasted about the same amount of time.
 What I need is a reliable mouse. I need wireless because I do graphic arts and I don't need a lot of cords. Enter the Amazon basic wireless. I use Windows 10 so installation could not have been easier. Based on use, this little mouse performs perfectly. Well done Amazon and keep the basic stuff coming!
 I loved this product, but I'm now experiencing difficulties with it! My mouse displays a red 'on' signal, has brand-new batteries, and yet for some unknown reason its signals aren't being picked up by my laptop. Neither clicks, zooms, nor physical motion is registering on the cursor. It happens randomly and intermittently, and so-far the only hotfix I've been able to reach is that changing the USB port seems to re-connect the device. I'd really appreciate some help on this issue!
 (See update, down below)<br/><br/>So far, so good.  I got tired of repeatedly buying other brand names just to have them fail after a year... thought I would give this one a try.  I've had it a couple of months.  Let's see what happens after a year or so.<br/><br/>Update: 7/5/2017<br/>Well, I'm updating my review because the receiver has begun to work intermittently. It may be a connection issue, I can sometines jiggle it a bit and get it to work. When I try another usb port, it works better but is still problematic. It's my 3rd wireless mouse (all different brands) that has gone bad over the last 3-4 years.  Perhaps these things just aren't robust enough to plugged in and out a lot. I may try a true Bluetooth mouse next...or go back to a good old wire.
 Pointer will occasionally, for no reason, start jittering and moving on screen, even if mouse is not being touched.  Doesn't matter if the mouse is being used on a mousepad, tabletop, blank piece of paper, anything - the pointer starts oscillating slightly and moving, generally slowly down and to the right.  Makes it very difficult to hit radio buttons and would make it impossible to game effectively.  Not a useless mouse but it's close to it, and I will be replacing it as soon as I can get another and relegating this one to emergencies, only.<br/><br/>First Amazon Basic product I've tried that I feel I cannot recommend.
 At first I really liked it. I liked that it fit well in the hand and the grip. However, we have only had it a few months and I have noticed that it cuts out and stops working. You have to turn it on and off again for it to work. I did change the batteries, so I will see if that makes a difference.<br/><br/>Update as of 10/26/16- I was answering a question another person had and figured I would update. I did change the batteries and it has cut out once since changing the batteries. So I am actually changing my rating to a two to a three, I might give it a four if the mouse continues to work.
 This mouse seems to work pretty good 98% of the time.  Occasionally, it does this strange, quirky wiggle on the screen when I try to click something.  I've never seen a mouse do that before.  I'm guessing it's some sort of interference or something, I don't know.  I'd have liked it to be just a tad bigger for my hands, but even that isn't too big a deal and might even be helpful when traveling.  The storage area for the dongle is helpful, too.  The point is that it is wireless and it works pretty good, almost all the time.  The anomaly I mentioned earlier is rare and only lasts a few seconds.
 After 15 months, left click button stopped functioning and I junked it.  During this time, to make it work at all, I repeatedly had to reboot this mouse by removing the battery and reinstalling it.  (Batteries I used were fresh and fine, as confirmed by battery tester.)  I'm making an emergency run to a Staples for a Microsoft or Logitech mouse, per the instructions of my computer tech.  Willing to pay the whopping fifteen bucks.  You get what you pay for.
 When I received this mouse it worked good but as time passed I noticed it went through batteries quickly but that wasn't a big deal to me.<br/>Fast forward 7 months and this mouse stopped working completely.<br/>I get that a computer mouse is inexpensive but all the ones I've had in the past have had a much longer life than this one did.
 I liked this mouse. Simple, does what it needs to, but died after 15 months. I checked the USB, batteries, tried to reset it, update software on two computers, but the mouse will no longer connect, although the red light is still working. Disappointed it did not last longer.
 I am always a little hesitant buying mice that are really cheap.  I have had some bad experiences in the past where it was basically wasting money. Well the time came and I needed a nice simple mouse , nothing for gaming just something that worked.  Did a search on Amazon and saw that they offered an "Amazon Basics" wireless mouse.  I figured okay, let me give it a chance.  I always have good experience with Amazon Basics items before; so let me tell you this mouse doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>For only about $12 dollars you get a nice, functioning, aesthetically pleasing mouse; that is good for travel, home use and probably even some light gaming.  It works on many surfaces and is working with my Mac perfectly (yes I prefer using PC mic on Macs).<br/><br/>I was going to buy another one but saw they are out of stock , will pick up a few more next time they are in stock.
 I have gone through a lot of wireless mouses over the past few years and they always seem to have problems after a few months. I usually stick with buying either Logitech or Microsoft and the problems I came across were either they were not connecting or response time was delayed and I would have to move the mouse rapidly to try and get it working again. Even after changing the batteries the issues were not resolved. I have not had this problem at all with this mouse and it was cheaper then the ones I usually buy. I have dropped it and used it almost every day and its still works as well as the first day I got it.
 Mouse works fine.  Seems well constructed.  It took some getting used to as there is an edge that wraps around the front of the mouse so that you have to bring your fingertips completely up on top of the buttons to click them.  This is the only mouse I have experienced like this.  I have large hands and normally rest the tips of my fingers off the end of the mouse buttons.
 To be honest, I really wanted to like this mouse. I bought it with the intention of having an Amazon Basics set, complete with the keyboard, mouse and monitor stand. The keyboard was okay and served its purpose, and the monitor stand I love, but this mouse just didn't cut it for me. Playing games like World of Warcraft, the mouse just wouldn't track enough to keep up with the pacing of that game, and that game really isn't that movement intensive with a mouse. I wouldn't trust it for playing games like League of Legends at all.<br/><br/>In the same token, I still cannot recommend this for a business setting or casual use. The mouse still does not track well and is very prone to fingerprints which just makes it look unsettling. I think that if the mouse came corded, it may solve some of the issues. Overall I really would have liked to see a corded version with a silk finish. I think for the price it may give you a couple months of nice functionality, but I cannot justify giving it anymore than three stars.
 Good basic reliable wireless mouse. I previously have used Logitech mice and they work for a year or so but eventually start acting up. What typically goes for me is the mouse click either doesn't work or i get two clicks. This from a much more expensive Logitech mouse. This Amazon basic mouse has been rock solid.<br/><br/>I do have two complaints with the Amazon basic mouse.<br/>1. Mouse is smaller than I prefer. Why they make it smaller is beyond me. At least they should make two sizes: small and normal.<br/>2. The battery doesn't last a long as the Logitech mice.  I don't turn the mouse off at night time. Too much of a hassle.
 Worked just fine for about three and a half months, but then it started getting spotty. Sometimes it just wouldn't turn on. I changed the batteries a couple of times, turned it on and off, on and off. Pushed the "connect" button endlessly. It just wouldn't turn on. Then on another day it would turn on. I'm getting a different brand now. This one is too unreliable.
 I give it 3 stars because it's easy to use and install, and connects really well, plus has a pretty good battery life.  Unfortunately I've had to practically duct tape the thing closed.  The battery cover DOES.NOT.STAY.ON,  The batteries pop the cover off all the time and they will not stay in.  I've had it about a year or so I think, and I just threw the dang thing in the trash.  I used to have to tape it shut, but not even that is working anymore and the batteries won't even connect.  So I would definitely advise against this if you want any kind of longevity.
 I have been using this mouse since January of 2017 everyday for work. I has held up extremely well and I think I have only changed the batteries twice in that time (it is July 2018 as I write this). Very comfortable with nice clicks and ease of use. For the price this cant be beat and if/when it does wear out, I will be ordering another of the same.
 The AmazonBasics wireless mouse is outstanding.  I bought it for use at work as I need to disconnect my laptop to take it to conference rooms to display (endless) PowerPoints.  The mouse feels great, even to my larger hands.  I like the semi-rubberized exterior and the click wheel I find really preferable to the clickless wheel on my more expensive Microsoft wireless mouse.  In general I've been really impressed with the quality of AmazonBasics items and the wireless mouse continues Amazon's high standards. Well worth the approximate $12 cost.  Thanks Amazon!
 This little guy is great!  Works perfectly..Matter of fact I am using it right now.  What I liked best are two things:  1.  It was easy, (easy) to install, even for someone like me with 4 thumbs, and 2.  I works so smoothly and is so convenient.  What I liked the least:  WHY DIDNT I BUY THIS 3 YEARS AGO.????  No more wires to tangle up...I am left handed, everyone else in the world is right handed....so its really great for this computer.  Get one, you will like it.....
 Normally I'm happy with Amazon's own product line. This time however, I'm not. I've only had this mouse since last October so only 4 months and already there is a problem. The main problem is its design. The batteries do not lie flat inside the mouse. They lay at an angle. It works fine for the first few months but then the contacts that the battery touches to give it power loses tension since it's at an angle and the battery pops away from the contacts. I try to shove it back in and it pops right back out.<br/><br/>This problem renders it useless since it requires batteries to use it. Oh and it uses 2 batteries unlike many others for a similar price who use only one. Also, there is no auto-shut off. I thought that wouldn't be a big deal but it turned into one. I realized that I forget rather often.<br/><br/>There is one further annoyance that I didn't like, but was willing to live with and apparently it's a new design that others use too so I don't guess it will change. Used to a wireless mouse's receiver is stored inside the battery case. For this reason each and every time you ever have to put the receiver away in your life you have to open the battery case. This weakens the clip that keeps the battery case closed. I mean, I understand the reason for the design (if it had an outer storage area, dust will get into it) but it doesn't make it any less annoying. Surely someone can cup up with a slide shutter to close that gap on the outside.<br/><br/>Whatever, I am now in the market for a new one. This time around I know now what to look for that I do not want. Good luck if you choose to use it. I don't recommend it.
 I don't like how light-weight it is, I don't like that it uses two AAA batteries, instead of two AA batteries, but the thing that really bothers me, is that it loses connection very easily. It's only 2 feet from the desktop, where it's receiver is plugged in. It shouldn't be losing connection. But it works well enough...just...irritating, and not what I'd buy next time.
 08/03/18  OK.  I took a chance and ordered another mouse with the hopes that this would be better quality.  I was wrong.  So I ordered one more on July 16.  Today is 08/03/18.  It started working intermittently last night and, I thought the battery needed replacing - wrong.  Now it works for a few moments and just shuts off.  Same as the last several times.  Don't waste your money on this product.  Buy something else.<br/><br/>I bought a Logitech CEm525 wireless mouse a few years ago and it is still working.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Earlier review<br/><br/>From the second set that I bought to replace the first set, one has already failed.  So, I only got a little over 3 months of use out of it.<br/><br/>It is great for the short period it works.  I won't buy it again though.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Earlier review<br/><br/>Reliable up to about a year.  The two that I bought earlier died after a little under a year.  The second set is still working fine after several months.
 Even though I'm a Mac guy, I finally needed to break down and buy a super-duper fast "gamer" PC to handle some intense animation software.  Not surprisingly, the gamer computer came with a gamer mouse filled with buttons and controls.  It was the most complex mouse I'd ever seen and it was very difficult to hang onto.<br/><br/>So I took a risk on this extremely plane-Jane mouse from Amazon.  It arrived, I plugged in the little USB receiver (it comes INSIDE the mouse; you have to pull it out of the battery bay) and WALLAH!  It's everything I need: just a plain mouse that plain works -- not a one-handed Mission Control console!
 I make a living on my computer. On top of that I have an online business outside of my day job. I am on my computer at least 10 hours a day. I had a logitech laser wireless mouse for the past couple of years. This mouse has slowly degraded in response time and it jumps when being used. I purchase this mouse because it had the amazon name on it - which I trust - but mainly because of the price. Received the mouse this evening, unplugged the usb connector or my logitech and plugged in the one for the amazon mouse. Added the included batteries and was able to immediately use this mouse. The problems I was experiencing with my previous mouse are gone. The amazon mouse actually feels better in my hand. The feel of the mouse on the top is much better than the sleek design of the logitech mouse. I highly recommend this mouse.
 Since the price of this mouse is so inexpensive, I had to give it a try when my other wireless mouse started acting wacky, The positives of this mouse are that it installs automatically and works. - two key things.<br/>What I don't like about this mouse are two things.<br/>1. It's a bit smaller than my previous mouse - Anywhere MX - and doesn't feel as comfortable in my hand. Obviously, if you have a smaller hand, then this mouse might be perfect for you.<br/>2. The on/off switch is tiny and not that easy to use. Again, comparing it to the Anywhere MX, the MX has a big switch which is easy to use with your thumb.<br/>For day to day use, I prefer a larger mouse and may invest in the MX in the future.
 Feel in my hand's a little weird, but workable.  Battery door flies off if dropped a moderate distance.  Range is good, feel of clicks/wheel is good.  Power switch on underside needs pointier fingernails than mine, but I can get it to work with the pad of my finger.  Saved me a buck over the competitive product. What's not to like?
 I bought this mouse just to see if it would work OK. I was expecting a cheap low quality product. Was I surprised when I opened the package and found a high quality well built mouse. It is very solid and has a good feel. The buttons are smooth and work with out a clicking noise. The scroll wheel is very responsive. This mouse has all the features I need. Set up was a snap with no issues. It works on any surface and I have used it from 20 feet away. Better than advertised and at a great price. I would highly recommend this mouse to the casual user. I don't do business applications at home but I use a computer all day at work and I plan on getting another one of these for use there. The programs I use are mostly point and click with scrolling. No more fighting the cable.
 Feels nice and works as expected but maybe I got a defective one. When I am resting my hand on the mouse between using it, it sends the cursor moving about erratically on the screen and I have to give the mouse a quick swipe movement to stop it..which only lasts a few moments until it starts again. More trouble than it was worth to return it. I just went back to using the one (Microsoft brand) I was replacing with this one as it had a different, but less annoying issue. I'll keep the AmazonBasics one as an emergency backup I guess.
 I purchased this mouse back in August, it works very well. I waited to post my review until after I needed to change the batteries, which I did this week. I am interested in how long the duracells I have now put in will last. The off-brand batteries that came with the mouse lasted 4 months of constant use, I never turned the mouse off. I think that is a very reasonable amount of time.<br/>The only problems that I had with the mouse I was able to resolve the day it arrived. The first was to move the receiver to a front facing usb port on my desktop. The second was to depress and hold the connect button under the mouse. Once I had done these things the intermittent lag and loss of signal issues were resolved.<br/>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent wireless mouse at a good price!<br/>Cheers!
 Ordered this as I was tired of the cheapo mouse I had bought that had a wire.  This mouse is perfect.  Connects no problem, always ready to go.  I rarely turn it off, and have had it for about a month with no battery issues yet.  Better than I could say for some wireless mouses I have had in the past.  Fits my hand nicely.  Great product for the price.
 I've had this mouse for about a year now, and I absolutely love it! It's stood the test of time for me quite well. It functions just as well now as it did when i first bought it, and i cant say that about any mouse I've owned in the past. I've dropped it a few times, stuffed it in my backpack (which takes a beating) and even spilled water on it. It's still pristine!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-durable<br/>-optical sensor functions great<br/>-at least a 15 foot range with obstacles<br/>-buttons still working great<br/>-power saving is a life saver (I've forgotten to turn it off a couple of times, realized it a day later)<br/>-USB storage is handy<br/>-small in size<br/>-Cheap price for what you get<br/><br/>Cons (that don't bother me at all):<br/>-mouse buttons aren't quiet<br/>-dpi is fairly low<br/><br/>Final notes. I haven't changed the batteries out since i received it and I'm sure I'll be using this for a long time still.
 I like the look and feel of this mouse...it's sleek, a great size, and I like the matte black. It was also the right price point. However, I am disappointed that it broke after 5 months of use (don't worry, I'm not an idiot...I tried a few rounds of batteries and made sure it wasn't my USB port). Note that it doesn't travel, it stays on my desk, and I turn it off every night to save battery when I leave work. While I would typically attribute it to the price, the last Logitech mouse I had that was almost the exact same (including the same price), lasted me 3 years. I do not recommend.
 This mouse works well and reliably under Windows 7 and 8. In my experience, however, tracking is somewhat jumpy in Mac OS X and there is some hesitation before the cursor moves. In Linux, tracking is as smooth and reliable as with Windows, but on my system at least the wireless dongle prevents the keyboard arrow keys from moving among selections in the boot manager on a dual-boot system. This means that if you don't remove the dongle when rebooting you can only boot into the default OS. Needing to remove the dongle is ridiculous. I can use a different make of wireless mouse and dongle without this problem. The keyboard is a wired USB keyboard. Be warned that if you use this mouse with Linux, at least for Linux Mint 15 and an HP Touchsmart All-in-One PC, you may only be able to use boot manager properly if you remove the wireless dongle for this AmazonBasics mouse before booting.
 I've tried every kind of mouse you can buy: LogiTech, SlimLine, Wedge, etc. and so on. I liked most of them, but except for the MS Wedge, none of them proved durable. I'm constantly knocking these wireless mice off my desk onto the floor, and very few of them have survived my clumsiness. I got tired of spending big bucks on them, only to have to buy another one after the first mishap. So, I decided to try Amazon's inexpensive model. I really like the way it fits my hand (I usually buy notebook models, because the regular sized ones are too big), the buttons and wheel are super responsive, and I've knocked this one off my desk at least a half dozen times with no repercussions. I won't be spending big bucks anymore. Wish I'd tried this one out long ago.
 I just love this mouse brand. I'd been using it for about 5 years...the longest any mouse has ever lasted for me &amp; I've dropped it on the concrete patio numerous times. It finally bit the dust a few days ago...the right clicker quit working. So I just got this new one to replace it. Looks like they've updated it a little. It's seems even better made than before.
 Comfortable mouse, lightweight, very easy to set up and use. My computer found the drivers immediately and I was able to use this mouse less than a minute after plugging in the USB.<br/><br/>It comes with 2 AAA batteries, which was convenient.<br/><br/>My only grievance with this mouse is that I think it clicks loudly. I've been using the mouse on my laptop for years, so maybe I'm not used to the noise difference between that and the new mouse, but I still think it's noisier than other mice.<br/><br/>That said, for the price, it's totally worth it. Will likely order another for a co-worker in the next month or so.
 I bought this mouse August 22nd, and now it is November 13th and the mouse has quit working.  It might be batteries, but the last mouse worked for 12 months on 1 AA battery. This mouse doesn't even go 3 months on 2 AAA battries.<br/><br/>Also, the battery case is awkward, the battery case door keeps popping off - doesn't sit well.  All in all a bad purchase.
 They work well but the back comes off and batteries go flying every time I drop one.  I know, then dont drop it, but I have an arm chair mouse pad and sometime when the chair is move the mouse falls off.  It also goes through a lot of batteries so you have to remember to turn it off when not in use or you go through 2 AAA's a week.
 First and foremost, the price point is unbeatable. I bought this wireless mouse for about ten bucks. Most of the negative reviews that I read about this mouse mentioned an extremely poor battery life. I am a student and I spend hours upon hours a day on my computer. I received this mouse on 1-29-2018 and today, 12-01-2018, is when I had to change the battery for the first time. Unless you play an unhealthy amount of computer games, the battery life on this device is far from inconvenient.
 I’m the kind of person who uses their mouse a lot, and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. This mouse was simple, after all, the word “basic” is in its name, and it worked flawlessly with my HP Envy laptop. I felt that it fit well in my medium-sized hand, and the clicking sound (though I’ve never been bothered by the click of a mouse) was not loud to the point where I really noticed it.<br/><br/>I would, however, not buy this mouse again. After continual use, the softer, rubbery, non-slip coating on the top of the mouse started to fade and crumble, making the mouse look rather shabby, almost like something with peeling paint that you find hard to ignore. I had some of that coating coming off the mouse and onto my hand, so I bought a different one as this was annoying me and just didn’t feel as comfortable in my hand anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, it’s a good mouse for the price. I just warn people of the “peeling” incident I experienced with it.
 I just threw away my second of these mouses (mice?).  The first one just stopped communicating with the dongle.  I called Amazon and they just replaced it without question, making me think that both customer service was great, but perhaps I wasn't the first one to call with the same issue.  Now the second one is unable to connect with the dongle and I am done trying to make it work.  Changed batteries, cleaned the optical lens, switched USB ports and even tried it on another laptop, all to no avail.  While it was working it was great, I loved the size, perfect for travel and the price was right...but alas I got what I paid for.  Going to look for another value priced mouse, but from a name brand manufacturer.
 I've had the mouse for about (2) years. Only used it a few times. It has never worked quite right. I thought it was the old computer I first used it on but it is constantly dropping the connection. If the computer (desktop, laptop, doesn't matter) goes into low power mode in ANY fashion whatsoever, the mouse disconnects. I have to re-seat the USB receiver, then turn the mouse off/on and wait for up to a whole minute (yes, that's a long time, you try waiting a minute for your mouse to start working again) for the mouse to start working again. This is the way its always been with this thing. I'm now trying to use it as my primary mouse after getting a new computer. The mouse is still disconnecting. Its not the computer or USB port on any one of (3) or more computers.
 I ordered this with my new laptop because I usually don't like the mouse pad.  It is a wonderful mouse and unbelievably inexpensive.  Surprise, I do like the mouse pad on my new laptop, so I'm now using it on my desktop.  Had I known how good it is I would have ordered two of them.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I liked this mouse so much I ordered another.  I have two desktop computers on my desk--both using these wireless mouses. They work perfectly.  With two monitors &amp; two keyboards, space is tight.  Not having the extra wires helps.  Each mouse is set to its own nano receiver, so no signals get mixed up.
 UPDATE - I have purchased 3 of these.  The first two have both failed after less than a year of moderate use, both by the same mechanism: the scroll wheel stops working.  It is a slow, insidious process whereby the scroll wheel becomes less responsive, then finally stops working.  My initial review was 5 stars, but I have lowered it to 2 stars for unacceptable lack of durability under normal use and 2 different units failing the same way.<br/>-----------------------------------<br/>Worked instantly with both my Windows 8.1 laptop and my Mac Mini OS X Yosemite Mac Mini, and on my HP Chromebook - the dongle and mouse were truly plug and play on all 3 devices with no software required and perfect responsiveness and connectivity.
 Week later update. Works ok. It is slow response, not very sensitive. I believe you would be more content with a Logitech or Microsoft or Dell brand most. This mouse "hangs up" if you will. Meaning not smooth or keeping up as most mouse devices you have likely used in the past. I suppose one could say: you get what you pay for. In this case, I did not pay much, nor is it worth much.
 It's fine for normal use, but expect to pay for a better mouse if you play any games.  The response time is noticeably slower than my other mice have been.  If you're a normal user that is simply browsing windows and surfing the web, it's a fine alternative.
 This mouse is low priced and works good. It's not full sized but not as small as a travel mouse. However, after a couple of months of normal use, it's starting to act erratically:<br/>The scroll wheel has gotten weird and sometimes causes the the page to go in the opposite direction that you want.<br/>The cursor will move around mysteriously if the mouse isn't perfectly flat on the mousepad.<br/>The left-click button works intermittently now that the mouse has some wear and tear on it.<br/><br/>I'll keep it as a spare, but it got so annoying that I spent a little more and got another Logitech mouse that will probably last forever unless I physically break it somehow.
 I didn't think I'd like this mouse, but wanted a cheap wireless replacement for my wired mouse. This is my first wireless mouse and it's been pretty solid. Use the computer daily and haven't had to replace the batteries yet. It is a bit smaller than I would like, and I think for serious gaming the DPI isn't that strong, but for casual/normal use, it's been great. I wish it had side buttons though.
 I thought "How bad can a mouse be?".  Well, it's bad.  On my desktops and my laptops, the mouse is recognized in only half of the USB ports.  The other ports don't even recognize that a mouse dongle is plugged in.  When it is recognized, the mouse is jittery and jerky on the same surfaces that my Logitech mouse is smooth on.  At times, the cursor will just jitter and start moving without the mouse being touched.  This is the worst piece of hardware that I've ever encountered.
 I bought two of these things.  They arrived the same day.  One seems fine.  No problem.  The second is no good.  The batteries would fit into the mouse.  Of course I knew how to fit in the batteries because I just did it on the first.  But the second was defective.
 It was interesting to see an Amazon mouse in the Amazon store, and the price is competitively low. So I thought, there is nothing to lose, and I bought it. When I got the mouse today, I was pleasantly surprised! The look and feel is solid, the grip is of good material, the mouse looks and feels great, everything's perfect. I have always been a Microsoft mouse user because Microsoft mouse's seem to maintain a good level of quality. But when I compared the Amazon mouse to the Microsoft mouse, I have to admit that the Microsoft mouse, though much more expensive, feels like average quality. One important point - the middle button click is smooth on the Amazon mouse. I will never waste money buying Logitech mouse's again because their middle click is unusably hard.
 It worked right out of the box and has kept working.  All you ask  of most any product.<br/><br/>Had trouble with it.  Changed the batteries. but it still did not work.  Put in a second set of batteries. It works, so the first set must have had one bad battery.
 I purchased the Amazon Basics wireless mouse to replace a Bluetooth mouse. The BT mouse worked OK but its performance was unpredictable and sporadic -- perhaps because there was another BT mouse operating in the same room and only feet away. In any event, the Amazon wireless mouse being WiFi and not BT avoids any potential "mousey" interaction. Moreover, the Amazon WiFi receiver was completely plug-and-play -- unplugged the BT dongle and plugged in the WiFi receiver, put batteries (which come in the package) in the mouse, turned it ON and it worked right away -- no fooling around with pairing or "discovery." Plus the mouse itself is one of the smoothest I've ever used. An exceptional buy for only $11.50.
 I have this mouse at home, works great. I bought one for work, where my keyboard tray has a very slight incline, and it slowly slides down it all the time! There is no traction on the bottom of it at all. (I've not had this problem with any other mouse on this keyboard tray.)
 My wireless mouse died and was I 'pressure area' challenged! First I found the wired amazon mouse and almost got that one, but kept looking, and lo behold Amazon comes thru again, a wireless mouse that looks good,the description sounds good AND the price was REALLY GOOD! Now that I have it I had to get on and write a review asap! The mouse is everything I need when on my computer! It handles really well, the response is really good and it feels really good in my hand! It's also very nice looking, sleek and a "suede" top! Sure I could have purchased a mouse with color and design, but that's not what I was looking for, Amazon comes thru again!!  THANKS AMAZON!!!
 I bought this mouse for my dad for Christmas.  It worked slower than his old mouse.  One of the things he uses the computer for is to play games and it was difficult for him to do so because the mouse didn't always respond to 'drag and drop' in his games.  He switched to his old mouse and everything worked fine.  They thought his game wasn't working right due to Windows 10 upgrade but when he switched his mouse, it worked again.  I bought this particular mouse because it is AmazonBasics and I am usually very satisfied with that brand, but not this time.
 Became intermittent after 4 weeks.  Fresh batteries helped for awhile but now it no longer works at all.  The red light comes on but no pointer movement.  Tried it on two laptops, dead.  Of course it's outside the return window now.
 I have had a lot of mice in my day but this one takes you back to the days of flashing red lights out of the bottom and only usable on a mouse pad.  It is last decades technology.<br/><br/>Do not buy this:<br/>Very poor tracking quality<br/>Does not work on all surfaces ( need a mouse pad ) Sooo 2000's
 This is a useful mouse, especially for the price. I find it functional and easy to use. Has a nice little outer rubber like grip/surface. Only issue was mounting the batteries, the slot to insert the batteries was poorly designed and it brings a little plastic tab to help pull out batteries when you need to replace them. I accidentally cut the plastic with a scissors because I thought it was part of the packaging for some reason, realized after that the instructions said it was to help with pulling out batteries. I think they could have been designed with out the annoying plastic tab.
 Just what I needed for my laptop. I'm a senior and have slightly arthritic fingers so using the touch pad to navigate is sometimes a bit difficult but this relieves me from that problem. The size is just right, it's not as big as a regular mouse yet not as small as those tiny mice designed just for laptops. I don't find any problems with it being over or under responsive and the scroll wheel moves with tiny clicks but they are completely silent. I like the on/off button, I've been using this for about 2 months now and, thankfully, haven't needed to replace the batteries yet. I say thankfully because the one flaw I find in this is the battery compartment - you need to get the batteries at just the right, exact angle to insert them. Other than that it's good working, nice sized mouse.
 I bought this wireless mouse less than two years ago. There is a cover underneath for the batteries that kept falling off so I eventually put some electrical tape over it to keep in place.  The USB that connects to my usb drive was not a solid connection. It felt loose and I often had to pull it out and put back in to get the wireless mouse to track.  The mouse eventually stopped tracking all together even after I replaced w/batteries. I am using a Chromebook so perhaps it is just not compatible Chromebooks, however many other reviewers indicated it worked with their Chromebook.  I am switching to a plan and simple wired mouse, seems like less hassle.
 Mouse works well but fits awkwardly in my hand due to its size. It is definately smaller than I expected. My fingers extend beyond the end of the mouse when using and the shape only marginally conforms to my hand.<br/>Not a bad mouse and a great price. I recommend but caution that it may not be as larger as you like.
 Have been using this mouse for about 3 weeks. It's working so far, but have gone through 2 sets of batteries already; and it takes 2 AAA.  Cannot recommend this device based on battery usage.  Whatever savings might have gotten from initial purchase price would be eaten up by battery costs.
 Excellent quality inexpensive mouse.  We've had great luck with this an other Amazon Essentials.  Plug and play with our Windows 8.1 laptop.  Easier to use than the touch pad if you have a big document to edit.  Radio receiver stores in the base (easily accessible) and there's an easy to toggle on/off switch which preserves battery life.  I carry it in my briefcase with the laptop.  It's slightly smaller than other mice we've had, but ergonomically pleasing with good click, roll and slide action.  Laser permits its use on varied surfaces.  My kids have even used it on carpet.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it at a higher price, so it's a great value.
 Just got it, worked great on win 7/win 8  and now, win 10 laptop. Made sure to carry it my bag, loose, to simulate abuse, works great. I'm currently using it on three (3) separate computers through out the day. I take it to work in my bag and then take it back home when i'm done. So good in fact, I'm buying another. I will update if it fails or has issues. I do hardware/software trouble shooting for a major electronics company so i will be hard pressed, to get the mouse not to work. Matter of fact, i had to system restore my win 7 pc, to upgrade to 10 and the mouse worked with me throughout the entire process. If you can't get it to work, it's probably you.
 Worked well for 6 months with my daughter's <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/ASUS-T100-2-in-1-10-1-Inch-Laptop-Intel-Atom-2-GB-64GB-SSD-Gray/dp/B00TCBVHSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ASUS T100 2 in 1 10.1 Inch Laptop (Intel Atom, 2 GB, 64GB SSD, Gray)</a>. Then, windows 10 started throwing a message, USB Device Not Recognized. I tried reinstalling drivers, and even tried swapping this mouse to another computer. Then the errors started on the other computer. I've not had any issues with other Amazon Basics products, so I am a little disappointed here.
 I just installed this not 10 minutes ago and so far I like it. It tracks well and seems to have a solid connection. I was not prepared for how petite this is. It is just a notch bigger than those tiny notebook mice, and is completely enveloped by my hand. I find that annoying right now but I assume it will improve over time. The big plus here is that I have plugged the receiver into a Sun Ray 2FS thin client and it worked with no fiddling nor configuration. If it will work on this, it will work anywhere; this is probably compatible with anything you choose to throw at it. For those reviewers who mention the confusion around battery orientation, I completely agree. It was not at all clear how the batteries were to be inserted.
 This thing has unbelievable battery life.  Shaped to be perfect for male or smaller female hands. Update: bought July 29th and its already quit working.  My Microsoft one lasted years.  Guess I should have stuck with them.  Really disappointed since this is the second item that has broken in last 3 months.
 This is a travel mouse and a little smaller than a standard desktop mouse.  The scroll wheels is smooth, the buttons have a positive click, and it has a good amount a weight to it for its size.  I use this at work where my laptop is my main machine.  I have the wireless USB receiver plugged into my laptop's docking station about 2 feet away and it works great.  I use Windows 8.1 and it discovered the device and installed the drivers immediately and was ready to go.  I imagine installation would be just as easy for systems going back to XP, Vista, or 7.  I may adjust the pointer speed in the Control Panel, but that's easily corrected and a personal preference, not an issue with the mouse.
 Worked fine for about a year. Now the mouse will loose signal all the time. Sometimes it will reconnect after a few seconds, sometimes the reciever needs to be unplugged and plugged in again. This happens so often that the mouse is very frustrating to use. I've confirmed that it happens on multiple computers, on Linux and Windows. I also changed out the batteries and that didn't solve the problem.
 I bought three mouses after giving up on Apple's white mouse because the batteries do not last more than a couple of days, or weeks.<br/><br/>This mouse is annoying because the cursor unexpectedly blows up to 10 times it's normal size. While playing games - it blows up images and I have to start over. This cursor jiggles and wiggles around on the screen, willy nilly and disappears, takes forever to find it. If does not easily glide over the surface either.
 I have an older macbook pro that the trackpad is going out on - again.  The last time I took it in they said it was because the battery swells and needs to be replaced. And you have to pay for it. When I researched it, I discovered this was a problem that Apple knows about but doesn't seem to care to fix.  When it started happening again, I said screw it, I'll just buy a mouse.  Significantly cheaper! (The wheel is kinda loud compared to other ones I've used.  It doesn't bother me, but it might bother other people.)
 I've paid much more for other brands and when it came time to replace yet another worn out MS wireless mouse, I decided to give the Amazon Basics a try. I loaned it out to one of the other household lappys after a few weeks of use and wouldn't you know - it didn't get returned. I had to buy another. My only worry was running two of these without having one take over the other due to conflict. Not a problem - just received mouse #2 and had both computers up and running. I put the new mouse next to the old receiver after setting it up and there was no activity. Love the feel, the size and responsiveness. So far the battery life seems fine on mouse #1 - I have yet to change the batteries and it stays on most of the time - I'm SOLD!!
 I bought this for my laptop at work to replace my old one and I have nothing bad to say about it. It fits in my hand easily and even with it saying “amazon basics” on it, it looks sleek. I have NO problem advertising amazon because I genuinely love their products. The thing I love most about this mouse, though, and the main reason I bought it, is the roller thingy on top. A LOT of them have these little ridges on them, which some of you may like, but I cannot stand how it feels on my finger after about 30 min! This one is SMOOTH! Thank God! Love it!
 The only thing I dislike about this mouse is that it isn't full length (it's more like a travel mouse).  Going by the picture, I expected a bigger mouse.  Other than that, seems to work fine.<br/><br/>Includes batteries (AAA), and has storage for  the wireless nanoconnector.<br/><br/>It would be perfect if it just was a little longer, but that's my personal preference.<br/><br/>A carry case would be great, but again, I can't really complain for the price.
 I have been impressed with my AmazonBasic purchases before this but unfortunately I just cannot recommend this mouse. I don't know if we got a defective one or not but it is very "jumpy." We've had it for over six months now and I probably should have returned it. The mouse can be sitting there with no one touching it and it looks like the cursor is bouncing on the screen. I can't handle it any longer. I'll stick with the tried and true Logitech for now.
 This is the BEST mouse I've ever used.  Realizing it is a basic mouse without all the bells and whistles of some "name" brand ones, it works better than any I've ever used.<br/><br/>I have been a Logitech mouse fan for years, but the newer ones seem to has adjustability problems, trouble picking up on some surfaces without a mouse pad, and jitter when moving around on some surfaces.  No problems at all with this mouse.<br/><br/>I do miss being able to move horizontally on a page by moving the wheel righ and left.  Small price to pay for a perfect mouse.  Ordered a 2nd one for another pc.
 Basic wireless mouse that works quite well. I used this to replace a Logitech mouse with a scroll wheel that had given up the ghost, and it works just as well but costs less. Please note that the plastic tab in the battery compartment goes under the batteries (to make them easier to remove) and that the batteries install at a slant to make room for the light/sensor.
 It worked okay with moderate use for about 4 years, and then it just stooped working. The mouse appeared to be on but it just wouldn't connect to the laptop. Tried everything from changing batteries, changing ports, and pressing the connect button many times. Just stopped working.
 I have bought (and returned) several wireless mice for a Chromebook laptop.  They were advertised as being compatible...they weren't.  I decided to try this AmazonBasics and it worked easily, perfectly, and didn't have to go through all kinds of shenanigans to make it work.
 I have been so impressed with Amazon as a thriving and well-run business that when I needed an new mouse and found that they had one with their name on it, I was going to buy it.  The Amazon brand is that trustworthy to me.  When I got the mouse, it was easy to setup and use.  IT even came with its own batteries for heaven's sake.  I have had mouses that came from Microsoft and cost 3 or 4 times what Amazon charged me for this mouse.  I cannot tell any difference.  It is quite simply a solid product at a very fair price.  If you need a mouse, get this one.  You won't be disappointed.
 I currently work as a data analyst at an alternative school.  Most of my days are spent in front of a computer, so to me a well made mouse is everything.  This is my second time purchasing this mouse, and I love it.  Because I work behind a computer all day smooth navigation is a must, and this mouse does the job.  The battery is excellent, sometimes I will forget to turn it off for hours and yet I'm still using the same battery I received with it.  I will say the mouse is not silent but I hardly even notice the clicking when I'm using it.  I love the fact the usb connection is so small it can be stored inside the mouse.  This is helpful for me because I suck at keeping pieces of an item together.  The only thing that I was disappointed in, is that the mouse doesn't come in various colors or patterns.
 It stopped working after about 13 months. Eat battery fast. Just couldn’t connect to my laptop properly. It’s a ergonomic mouse. It worked very well when it was working. Just like others reviews, it is not durable. I am going back to Logitech mouses which have higher prices but can work much longer.
 Works fine, but it gobble batteries like a fiend. It's really frustrating when I'm working out of the house and I have to revert back to using a trackpad because my gluttonous mouse has devoured its batteries yet again. And I always turn it off when It's not in use, too. Why does a simple mouse consume so much wattage? Cheap, inefficient components, perhaps? It's also a tad too small if you have an average sized hand.<br/><br/>This thing will easily double in price after a month when you factor in the batteries you'll have to buy. Consider getting rechargeable AAAs if you insist on buying it.
 At first I was hesitant.  But knowing Amazon's reputation I gave it a chance.  This is the second mouse I've purchased from Amazon.  I have 2 computers and needed a replacement mouse.  I normally buy Logitech, but this is a great option.  The nano sits inside for storage so it's not lost.  Of course I forgot that once and looked everywhere for that little thing.  It is very comfortable in the hand.  I definitely recommend.
 I have always opted for Amazon Basics brand when it is an option and this is the first time I have been disappointed. It struggles to connect and frequently drops signal. Now, after one month - it has quit working all together. I would not buy again.
 After using this mouse for over 4 years, I can say that I love it. It feels great. The free Harbor Freight batteries last a long time in this mouse. I like it more than a wired Roccat Tyon that I purchased last year. The only thing that concerns me about this Amazon Basics mouse is that its wireless, and I'm worried that the I will have to change batteries in the middle of a trade. I'm going shelf my Roccat Tyon for a wired version of this mouse.
 This wireless mouse is perfect for anyone looking for an affordable yet effective wireless mouse.<br/>I use it on a 2013 Macbook Pro Retina and it is flawless; no lag or weird tracking characteristics. It is also easy to setup. I plugged in the receiver and turned on the mouse and that was it; working beautifully.<br/>I have had this mouse for about 7 months and there have been no issues what-so-ever. The batteries have also lasted this long and I have no inclination for them to die soon (I do shut it off when I am not using the computer). It is somewhat of a 'soft-click' mouse as it has a nice click to it instead of a plastic like cheap sounding click.<br/>Overall, this is a very good mouse for the money and I have had not a single problem with it.
 I don't say "I love it" with things like this because it's a mouse after all. What I will say is it works well with Windows 8.1. Initial set up / add device, or whatever you call it when you first plug it in, went well and it works as a mouse should. Nothing really else to say about it, it's a mouse. The price at the time was as cheap or cheaper than any other like it and that's the main reason I bought this one. I'm happy that I did and would recommend this to anyone that might ask. So, it deserves the 5 star rating, but it's still just a wireless mouse. Nothing to get too excited about. ;)
 I've had one for about six months now and bought a second more recently. Both have been working very well. In this day and age, I consider it a triumph when, in exchange for my hard-earned money, I actually get something in return that works. Well, this does so far. And the price is right!<br/><br/>The gravy is that the mouse has good feel and response, and the internal storage for the USB receiver is convenient when you pack your computer and mouse up to go somewhere.<br/><br/>I recommend this mouse as a very good value.
 Such a pretty mouse. I bought this to replace my Amazon Basics black mouse when that one had it's 'feet' worn off. I was so happy when it got here!<br/>I had to plug in this particular mouse's tiny USB whatever; the one for the black mouse didn't communicate. Not a problem.<br/>However, while the black one was silent, the blue mouse has a ratcheting clicking scroll-wheel sound. Uncool.<br/>---<br/>Great mouse, annoying noise unless you're not OCD.
 I was really happy when this mouse arrived in its small box. I didn't realize before that the USB receiver is actually able to be stored within the battery compartment, which is going to make it incredibly easy to keep track of the small piece while traveling with my laptop.<br/><br/>I've only been using it for the last week, but the batteries have remained strong in my frequent use over that time. As long as it is always switched to "off" when you are not using it it should last fine. If it does start eating through batteries at an alarming rate, I'll definitely make a note of it.<br/><br/>It's small and forms to my hand nicely. The plastic is easy to grip and hasn't pained my hand yet, which is great when I use it mostly for gaming. I would definitely recommend it.
 Well I have only had it a week but so far so good. It matches the new butterfly decal I purchased for my new 11.6 ACER. I love the size of this mouse, it’s perfect for my hand and it’s not as big as a mouse would be for a full size computer
 I've been using this close to a year. Still functions perfectly. There are no adhesive sliders on the bottom with is a good thing imo because those usually come off or gunk up with dust and crumbs.<br/><br/>The only downside I would say is that the dual AAA batteries gets drained faster than I expected. They last about 7 weeks of heavy use, switched off at night. I'll accept this though over a Logitech mouse because they always start to double click on a single cick ime.
 This is a great value mouse, it even came with batteries! I have yet to be disappointed by AmazonBasics products. This mouse is everything I expected and 1/3 the price of the Logitech I was replacing. It moves quickly, fits my hand perfectly and synced up to my PC laptop and Chromebook easily. FYI ---  did not read the description enough to realize it took 3 AAA instead of 1 AA battery (not really an issue, just threw me slightly off guard when opening the box).<br/><br/>I didn't realize just how bad my old mouse was until this guy arrived (old one was over four years old). Highly recommend this product, especially given the price!
 A super affordable option to replace my Mac mouse that went missing during my move. Actually that loss ended up being a blessing in disguise, because this one works about a thousand times better than my OG Mac mouse! I don't care about the aesthetic - it's comfortable to use and works quickly and accurately. And you can't beat the pricing on AmazonBasics!
 I have to unplug my external hard drive to use this as it will not connect via my usb hub  This is a pain as I like to have the external hard drive connected for hourly back-ups.  Additionally it is erratic in that sometimes it works and mostly it does not.  I would return it but it is not worth the cost to do so.  I will buy another logiitech mouse - the one that just died would connect via the USP hub.
 I've bought a number of amazon Basic products and have been happy with them, but not so this mouse. It is solidly constructed with a good hand feel. But, the action on the screen was always choppy, as if the connection to the laptop was poor. Finally, after 3 months, it was just unusable. Replaced it with a Logitech M310 which cost me $16 at the local big blue box electronics store. The Logitech is much, much better.
 Probably the best inexpensive mouse you can get out there. I use it to play league all the time which probably explains why I need to replace my batteries at least once a month.<br/><br/>2/27/18<br/>I had this mouse for about two years now and it is due for replacement. The mouse receiver is very inconsistent now which requires a lot of wiggling to hopefully get the mouse to work. I guess the usb receiver isn't up to the task of being plug and unplug over the years.
 Just got the mouse, but so far it seems just fine:  nice size (too small for desktop mouse but fine for laptop / portable use), looks nice, easy to set up (no software required); comfortable, tracking speed and accuracy work fine for me.
 I've had this mouse and have been constantly using it for around 8-9 months and it hasn't once let me down... except in one part that's entirely my fault.<br/><br/>When you first get this mouse it should come with fully charged batteries. I'm not sure if there was any instructions BUT if you're new to wireless mouses than make sure you don't rip out that weird plastic strip that's in with the batteries. It's not to activate the mouse, it's actually there to help you pull batteries out! At first, I thought this thing was ridiculous but I realized how helpful and clever it was! Luckily it was super strong because I wasn't able to actually rip it out even while trying too!<br/><br/>I only have one gripe about the mouse and that is about the batteries. Triple A batteries die on me constantly and I had to keep on going out of my way to buy some more until, eventually, I just went on to buy some rechargeable ones off Amazon and now life is sweet again,
 Very easy to set up and it works great.  Packaging is minimal as well.  Simply open the battery cover, take out the USB receiver, put in 2 AAA batteries (battery + / - placement is in the little booklet, not printed on the mouse) and the mouse is ready.  Plug the receiver into your computer and it takes a moment to install, but then it works without any other hassle.  There is a plastic tab inside the battery compartment, I almost pulled it out before I read the directions, you are supposed to put the batteries over that to make it easier to remove the batteries later.  Simple, just what I needed.  Thanks Amazon.
 Plugged it into my brand new DELL, and it didn't work. Not sure if it's a driver issue or a hardware issue, but my Logitech spare works fine, and in 2016 I think a mouse should just work, no questions asked. Eventually got it to work and calmed down about the whole experience. Now the design bothers me; the zoom function on the scroll wheel is too sensitive, so if you scroll even a bit too hard it will depress the button that engages the zoom, and you get disoriented for a few seconds. Wish I'd paid up for another Logitech.
 If, like me, you just need a simple wireless mouse, that works consistently, tracks well, and is good with batteries, this is the mouse for you.  There's no ergonomic comfort grip or extra gaming buttons, but let's be real, you're just doing TPS reports, so you don't need those things.
 Works great on just about any surface, I use it by having it next to me right on the couch while the computer sits on the table. The receiver that plugs into the computer is extremely tiny and can actually be stored inside the mouse! It connects easily to the receiver with a push of a button and doesn't need to re-paired constantly. My only complaint is that the mouse has an on/off switch to save battery (2 AAA type) but I always forget to use it, it would've been nice to have some sort of auto-off function that recognizes when the computer is off. It's a minor complaint and it's the only thing keep this mouse from being perfect, especially for the price. The scroll-wheel works smoothly and has gentle, tactile clicks when you use it. I didn't need to install any drivers and do anything extra to my computer to get this to work.
 I feel compelled to write this review because I use this mouse every day and absolutely love it. I don't know what I would do without it! It's smooth, reliable, compact, fits my hand well, and all in all is an incredible value for the price. If you are looking for a wireless mouse, you really shouldn't look any further.<br/><br/>I had an older mouse that I used for my previous Macbook and it was AWFUL. I also ordered it through Amazon - it didn't stand the test of time because I tried to use it on my new Macbook and it did not work at all. The connection was shoddy and it would constantly cut out. This AmazonBasics mouse is a Godsend!
 For the price, this mouse is fine for general use. However, it will not suffice in situations that require high levels of sensitivity. The cursor jittered constantly on my screen...nothing that would matter whilst browsing the web, but intolerable for graphics work or gaming. On the plus side, I love its small form factor and how it fit in my hand. Buttons and wheel were responsive. I ended up buying the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Logitech-Wireless-Performance-Mouse-MX/dp/B002HWRJBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX</a>, which is in a completely different class, but this Amazon mouse will definitely fulfil travel duties.
 Fabulous. This is TINY though, definitely not for large hands or long fingers. I have fairly small woman hands and it fits fine.<br/>It comes with battery included (which is a plus). Driver downloads very quick and easy... USB plug is tiny and never in the way, and switches on and off easily.<br/><br/>Definitely pay attention to reviews and DO NOT REMOVE CLEAR PLASTIC TAB inside. :) It really helps replacing battery etc. Thank you to all the reviews who said not to pull this out... I remembered just in time.
 It works as it should.  I just got it and haven't really used it long enough, but so far, it works instantly with both Dell laptop and Chromebook.  I actually like the size, perfect for my little hands and for my little girl, too.  Have no issues whatsoever with the Nano receiver placement, as it's so easy to open the battery cover, replacing battery looks fairly easy to me, as well.  Maybe it has something to do with having tiny fingers??  But for this price, I'll buy it over and over again.  Hoping it will last us long time.
 The left-click mouse button died on my laptop and after replacing that component it still didn't work so I opted to get a wireless mouse. I often use my laptop in unconventional places so I like the freedom of not having the mouse connected to the laptop with a cord. This mouse was super easy to setup and connect with my Dell Inspiron N1550 running Windows 7. It's been working flawlessly so far. I love AmazonBasics products. Good quality and good value.
 This was actually delivered on the 4th of July - very impressive service, if you ask me . I am quite happy with it so far, especially for the price. A huge improvement over the cheapo one I picked up at RadioShack as a quick replacement when my old wireless mouse finally gave out. I don't mind the off/on switch, nor the fact that you have to open the battery door to put the nano receiver in. It works very well so far, I'll see how it holds up but I don't expect any problems. I don't usually review stuff but I was really impressed by the speed of the delivery and it wasn't from Amazon directly
 This mouse is amazing. Works great, feels great and I haven't had to change out the batteries yet which would indicate to me that the circuitry in its design is very energy efficient. I highly recommend this... as long as it actually makes it to your residence. Amazon managed to mess that up 4 times... not sure how that happened but I'm pretty sure at one point UPS had a hand in it too. Off topic but full disclosure. I also had to return one because it came out of the box melted. I'm not going to knock this down a star for that cluster because I'm rating the one that I finally got that works and that I have. Just inspect the mouse throughout and if it smells like burnt plastic, return it.
 I own two of these AmazonBasics Wireless Mice.  Both of them exhibit the same behavior on my Lenovo X1.  Approximately a quarter of the time they work well, with quick on-screen response and normal behavior.  Most of the time, however, the on-screen response is slow, jumpy, and lags my movements.  It's very frustrating.  It seems to be somewhat related to proximity to the receiver, but it occurs six inches away as well as six feet away.  It does not seem to be related to battery power.  Fresh, new AAA batteries do not fix this behavior.  I have ditched these wireless mice and use the wired versions of the AmazonBasics mice instead.  Despite (because of?) the wire, I'm much happier with the performance of the wired mice.
 Works great with my iMac.  Plugged in the receiver gizmo and started using it.  So very happy to replace my stupid Magic Mouse.  I'd always heard Amazon Basics stuff is good.  So far I have a tripod, camera bag, and now a mouse.  Two thumbs up.<br/><br/>Added later:  It does work well with my iMac, but you have to click much more forcefully than with the Apple mouse.  I was hoping this would loosen up after I've used it for a while, but it hasn't.  You really have to push down hard and it makes kind of a loud click.  It's really starting to drive me crazy.  I may replace this after all.
 Works great for me!  I travel with it in my laptop bag - it's held up to literally being tossed in the bag with all the other things I lug around with me.  I like how the USB packs in the mouse itself, so it doesn't get lost in said bag.
 Love this. Easy too use, if you get use to it. The little wheel in the middle of this mouse is go in the opposite way compared to a normal mouse. When you scroll down it goes up, and opposite. I got use to it though, the battery life is ok. That is probably the annoying thing about this mouse, battery life lasts 3-5 months depend on how often you use it. when you ordered it, there will be a pair of battery come along so you could use it right away. Would  recommend to buy though.
 It's LOUD and most things need a LOUD *double click* to open. It's inexpensive and other mice haven't worked well, if at all, so this I a buy I can live with, but I wish the clicks were silent!  I'm going deaf, but these are still LOUD!!
 I really have not had a bad experience with AmazonBasics products and this wireless mouse with receiver doesn't disappoint. I was looking for a wireless mouse with a receiver because my Bluetooth mouse was very unstable. I didn't want to spend a lot and could only find ones around $15 but then I saw this AmazonBasics one for $10. I've been using for over a week now and the movement is great and does everything a mouse should do!
 I bought this to replace a $5 HP wireless mouse from Fry's that lasted for about 5 years. Since I'd previously had good luck with an inexpensive mouse, I figured it made sense to go that route again. However, it doesn't seem like the Amazon Basics version has nearly the same longevity. I bought this one less than 3 months ago - it was totally fine until today. Seems like I should probably just go back to HP.
 Received the item on 9-6, just 2 weeks, the mouse was not responsive. After the new battery, it worked fine for about 20 days, happened again. So, changed the battery again. Last week, completely not responsive, even I put in a new battery. The red light is steadily on, but not controlling the curser. Only for 3 months, with very little usage, the mouse is completely not working. Disappointed!!!
 Wish I hadn't waited so long to order this. This wireless mouse makes it so much easier to use the laptop. Plug and play. Easy. Don't forget to turn it off when done. Even though this has happened the batteries are still working.
 the only reason that I'm giving this mouse a five star rating is because the CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWESOME!. My mouse keep turning itself off because the battery is a bit lose or something and it keep interrupting my play. The removing of the battery is a bit difficult for me. BUT when it work, it works pretty well, small and convenient.  I have bought many Amazon basics stuff because it's cheap and it's reliable. This is the first product that I have a problem with but they solved my problem instantly so I can't bring myself to give them a lower rating just because they may have a few defective products.
 This mouse is a little clunky to use, but I guess I got what I paid for.  It is certainly a breeze to install but after using for just a few hours, the clicking  function became awkward and slow. I purchased this because I hate my new laptop's touchpad and I wanted something that was easier to use. Frankly, this mouse is more difficult time-consuming (for me) than the touchpad.  I know I am talking about nanoseconds here, but that was kind of the point of me purchasing the mouse.  I guess I will open up my wallet and purchase a more expensive mouse.
 Sometimes the mouse worked fine, other times the pointer was jumpy when there was tracking, or not moving despite moving the mouse around. Also, sometimes the left and right button did not get reflected despite having clicked on them, unless I lifted up the mouse. Such issues happened all too often, making the user experience really poor.<br/><br/>Way too sensitive to the surface it rests on? Maybe but the other wireless mouse I bought this to replace it did not have such an issue.<br/><br/>Anyway, I didn't expect to ever rate an AmazonBasics product with a single star when all my past experiences with the brand had been good (I used to rate it among all the top brands). Bought the mouse because of raving ratings and reviews; expected a lot but gotta say how disappointed I was.
 A little on the small side so not for big man hands. I have owned many wireless mice but this one goes through batteries way to fast! They don't even last a month. Battery compartment cover is also very flimsy and the latch breaks easily.
 Nice mouse. Feels great in the hand, and everything mechanical feels solid and pleasantly clicky. Unfortunately, the mouse that I received didn't track well at all and sometimes didn't even function. I have a 2014 MacBook Pro and wanted to use an inexpensive mouse when I travel. Hopefully, my replacement arrives in time before I leave for my trip. Other than that, it feels like a great mouse! Love the texture and the overall feel of it.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Got a swift replacement from Amazon in case it was a defective item, but unfortunately, it's so choppy and the input cuts in and out that the mouse is useless with OSX. It's a shame because this mouse is a great value for the money.
 The mouse works great but the problem is in the USB plug that comes with it. After a while the silver casing comes off while inside the computer and gets stuck in the USB port. I have had to use a needle nose plyer to pull it out. This has happened on two of them. They need to fix that problem. That's probably my biggest gripe about the product. Other then that it works awesome.
 I bought this mouse for my dad but I must say this little mouse is very well constructed and it operates perfectly! It feels well built, even more so than my logitech wireless mouse which i paid $25 dollars for at the local wally world. The usb storage slot within the battery compartment is PURE GENIUS because it makes traveking around with this mouse so much simpler. I would highly recommend buying this mouse for anyone, who like me, is on a tight budget but don't want a wired mouse. You won't be disappointed!
 Worked well in the beginning. As time went on it started to act up.Things like skipping and having trouble moving the curser around. The it started to not do anything. I did all the usual changing things around but nothing reall got the mouse moving again. just decided to toss the thing in the garbage and buy one at Staples.
 I like the shape for my small hand.  I have a laptop and my mouse quit working, and I cannot use the thing that is built in, so I was lost when my mouse stopped working. Believe me the new one could not get here fast enough (glad I was a prime member)
 I did a lot of searching for a good wireless mouse and this is the best one I can find.<br/><br/>I'm an architect and am generally picky about most things, but particularly picky about the middle button on my mice. For some reason a lot of the wireless have mice with "long throw" clicks. Or if you're a designer at Logitech a mouse with a middle button that changes the scroll feel. Utterly useless... The main issue, even when you reprogram the button within the Logitech software the button is still mush. Meaning that it takes a lot of pressure to push down the mouse wheel, which has a very long travel distance. Things like AutoCAD, Revit, and Bluebeam all require constant use of the middle mouse button for panning. A short throw, really tactile middle button is essential. Short of a wired mouse, which for some reason generally has a nice middle click, this one is the best of the wireless bunch.<br/><br/>The only downer is that it's somewhat small for those of us with big hands, but most mice are. It's approximately the same size as a generic Dell mouse. That said, for those of us that need it to work for travel, drawing, and general use it's about as close to ideal (and a wired mouse) as it gets.
 I really like this mouse.  I have a number of Logitech units and they are certainly functional, but this "lowly" Amazon unit is my favorite.<br/>Why?<br/>1)  Small enough for travel, but large enough to not feel awkward in the hand.<br/>2)  Simple.  I like the 2 buttons and a scroll wheel design...that is all I need.<br/>3)  The scroll wheel has the perfect resistance for me.  Not too quick, not too stiff.<br/>4)  Good tracking and movement both what you see on the screen and how it glides across the table.  Minimal fuss with settings for a good response.<br/>5)  Good, simple on/off switch that does not easily get knocked from one setting to another.<br/><br/>I agree with some on this forum who have noted the battery angle is odd, but no big issue for me there.  You deal with it once or twice a year maybe and its not that different from what one finds in kids toys and such.  I expect to buy a few more of these.
 When my mouse bit the dust a few weeks ago, I decided to give this one a go. I've ordered quite a few AmazonBasics products now, and all of them have been fantastic. This mouse is no exception, it's a nice size, very responsive, and priced just right.<br/><br/>Update: I've been using this mouse for several months now and it's still holding up really well. The battery life is long, the size is just right, and the design is comfortable to hold.
 Bought August 2016 $10.99.  It is Nov 20, 2018 and my mouse died so it lasted just over 2 years.  MEH...<br/>What do I do?  Tell Amazon my Amazon mouse died after 2 years or just buy another one.  I have 2 logitech mice that have lasted longer but they were more expensive.  Oh well...I will buy another Logitech mouse and forego the pain in the rear of trying to get a replacement for this one.
 Works exactly as expected - light, reliable, and surprisingly comfortable for as small as it is. And it actually works better than a wired mouse as far as pointer accuracy goes on rough, uneven, or glossy surfaces, which is a HUGE plus in a mobile mouse. I guess if I had to complain about something, I wish it used a single AA battery (like most comparable Logitechs) instead of two AAAs, but that's obviously not a huge deal.
 Just the right size for small-handed people who hate the mini-mouse style. Very sensitive- can be used on a leg or a pillow with no need for a hard/flat surface and works from several feet away. The USB part is so small, you don't really need to remove it to take your laptop with you, but if you need to, there is a tiny compartment in the bottom of the mouse to hold the USB chip. There is an LED indicator just behind the scroll wheel that will light up red to alert you of a low battery so you don't suddenly lose mouse function in the middle of something. Most of the mouse has a softish feel to it that I find quite pleasant and comfortable. Keep in mind that it requires AAA batteries, so you'll need to keep some around. But, it can actually run constantly for several months on a single set if two (and two AAAs are included in the package). Fast shipping, too, though I've found all "Fullfilment by Amazon" product tend to ship in 3 or 4 days instead of the week estimated for standard shipping. Excellent product, would buy again.
 Great ...a real value. And customer service was great.  I  called customer service with a problem, the product was missing a part Or so i thought. . Amazon immediately sent me a new order..MY mistake..the part was in the battery compartment ..my mistake. I offered to send it back. Amazon told me to keep it...and i donated to a local charity. They were thrilled!  thank you amazon.
 I've generally had good luck purchasing Amazon branded products over the years. In this case, I bought two of the mice expecting the usual quality. Both functioned well, but when my wife's mouse died yesterday I realized neither one lasted a year. (BTW- it was the dongle that failed-not the mouse in both cases).
 Can not beat this mouse for the Price.  This mouse has been used at work at a job where someone uses it 24hrs 7 days a week and it has held up great.  Low battery consumption and is a great size, not too big and not too small.  Tracks well on a regular wood desk, I highly recommend it for the price.
 Mouse was fine at first, with a good price and good functionality. It makes a decent, cheap wireless mouse for a laptop.<br/><br/>My scroll wheel is now faulty. Unless I apply additional pressure, it rolls without clicking or actually scrolling on the computer. It feels like the wheel axle is slipping, as if there isn't enough friction to spin other parts that have the sensor. The "click" of the wheel also doesn't engage unless I press harder, which sometimes activates the middle-click. Ultimately, it lasted about a year before this problem came up, and a little longer before it became bad enough that it needed to be replaced.
 Works great. I had a wireless mouse before and hardly ever used it because I had to click a button to wake it up.<br/>This mouse works just as if it was wired to the computer, no lag, no click, just turn it on and go. Battery life seems good as I have been using it for a few months now and still have the same battery’s that it came with. I do turn it off when I am done using it so I'm sure that helps the battery life. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a good mouse.
 I have been using this mouse for a week now and it works perfectly.  I have it set up 10ft away from the micro usb and have no issues.  It is about 2/3rds the size of my Microsoft mouse but fits well in my larger hand.  Scroll wheel and buttons work well.  The top has a soft rubber feel and looks feels very solid.
 Update on April, 2018:<br/>This mouse is giving good service. Had to replace the batteries several times  and that's all it needed. Very good product from Amazon basics.<br/>Has been using it for class and library. The upper surface is not glossy and that is a good side of it. Not so large or tiny. Recommended.<br/><br/>June 15, 2015<br/><br/>Now it's been several months since I have been using this and I think this product is awesome. Not to pricy and the gripping of the mouse is cool. it does not feel oily and you will be happy to use it. Clinking and maneuvering is super easy.
 I will never waste my money on high-end name brands. I love this mouse! It takes very little movement to make a full sweep across my monitor screen. My last (high-end named mouse) took three strokes or more to make a full screen sweep. Forget Microsoft or Logitech! I have had too many failures and they are not inexpensive either! This one here is 1/3 the cost of my last one that I bought at Costco. I'll be kind and not mention the name brand. Don't hesitate to buy this one!
 Update to my precious review. After 2 days, the mouse stopped working. It lags and jumps all over the screen even after trying it with two different mousepads and even no mousepad at all. I put fresh batteries in, and the distance from the mouse to my laptop is leas than 2 feet, so something is wrong. I have to return this unfortunately.
 This has been a great value for the money.  I used a Microsoft Arch (first gen) for years, and when it finally died I tried a few cheap alternatives.  They lasted only a few months each and then tried this model.  It is comfortable, responsive, and has been solid and dependable; especially for the price point.  I bought a second one so I can use it at work and home.  This has won my confidence in the AmazonBasics line and I will try more of their products in the future (in fact, my wife recently ordered an AmazonBasics HDMI cable based on our experience with this mouse).
 I have only had this mouse for about a month and the USB port already became detached and got stuck in the USB hub on my laptop. I am not rough with my products by any means, in fact I only use the mouse while I am at work. Although it is still functional (I haven't attempted to remove the plug from the laptop hub completely yet) I am disappointed this happened so quickly. The mouse itself worked well, but maybe this particular unit wasn't inspected for quality as well as some of the others.
 I've had this mouse for about a month now. In that time frame, I've only had two problems with it: the size, and (wireless range).<br/><br/>I'm sure (some) people could infer that this is the size of a laptop mouse, but the product description also lists it as a desktop mouse. This was a bit of a problem for me, but I eventually got used to it.<br/><br/>The range on this thing is horrid. I actually had to use the USB ports on the front of my computer because using the ones on the back makes the mouse inoperable.<br/><br/>All in all, this is worth the money - you should realize that you get what you pay for.
 Really good mouse. I had wanted one that is bluetooth, the the adapter for this is so small that it's okay. I had a moment of panic where I thought that I had lost it when I opened the packaging, but it is located in the back of the mouse in the battery area. This mouse is comfortable to hold and easy to use. I usually don't have a problem with a laptop finger pad, but this is easier to do my homework with, especially when working in Excel. Good price and quality, nothing fancy but works well.
 Amazon has done it again. They have sourced the most upstanding Chinese factory to ship them a quality product for cheap, and even put the Amazon brand on display (and on the line). I was skeptical of this mouse -- an inexpensive wireless mouse with a nano-USB receiver, and good reviews. It sounds too good to be true. Well, it's not. This mouse is everything that I could have hoped for. It is comfortable, well packaged, has a physical on/off switch, and the top plastic is even 'soft to the touch'.<br/><br/>Good job Amazon. High risk, high reward. Keep the 'Shenzhen' specials coming.
 Love this mouse, just bought my second one for a friend. The best part is the fob is stored inside the battery compartment, so you never lose it and it travels easily! Also the batteries have a tab underneath so they pull out easily to change them (even though I haven’t had to change the batteries yet - super long life!)
 Bought it almost 1 year ago.  Worked flawlessly for MacBook Pro Retina for almost 1 year.  No issues.  Then more recently, started to lose pairing.  It's like the USB port died on the Mac.  Would unplug dongle and plug it back in and then move from port to port.  On screen it would move then jitter and then stop moving.<br/><br/>More recently, it just fails completely and no amount of unplugging recovers it.  Chatted with Amazon and gave me a full refund.  Going to try something that lasts longer.  Stuff is way too disposable now days.
 For my previous wireless mouse i lost the USB receiver. It was from Logitech and Logitech is charging the price of the whole mouse for the adaptor...i gave up that and bought this one...it's a nice wireless mouse with the house for receiver so that you cannot lose it. I have used it for few days and happy with it's functioning. For this price - it's doing what it was expected out of it.<br/>Updating the review after just 90 days of usage. Yes the batteries are over - is it consuming the batteries so fast? My logitech mouse has better performance in terms of battery consumption.
 II have small hands, so the smaller mouse is ideal for me.<br/><br/>I use a full size keyboard with my MacBook pro and plug the nano receiver into the keyboard's usb port.  I have no problems with connectivity or responsiveness<br/><br/>The mouse tracks smoothly on bare surfaces - I run mine directly on a wooden desk with no trouble.<br/><br/>Great purchase even 17 months later.
 You can't beat the price/performance on this wireless mouse.  It's very responsive connects right out of the box as plug and play - no drivers needed.  As noted by some other reviewers, the only real downside for this mouse is the soft-rubber exterior.  It tends to grab any oil on your hand and keep it, which can be annoying.  The battery life could also be better, but considering it's a smaller mouse (and that I use it 8-hours/day for work), I can't really complain.  If you plan to use it for heavy use (full-day work, etc) then I would recommend purchasing a charger and re-chargeable AAA batteries or you will blow a lot in battery cost.  Overall, a fantastic value.  I expect nothing less from the Amazon Basics line - they just perform.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
 This little mouse is nothing fancy, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do. I bought it to go with my Aspire E 15 laptop, and I'm very pleased with it. The Nano Receiver is small enough to leave in the USB port, which is one less thing to disconnect when I put by laptop back in its bag. Setup was a no-brainer - just plug in the receiver, switch the mouse to "on" and within minutes, it's connected and working with my computer. Very happy that I bought this little "plain Jane" mouse - it does the job, and I haven't wasted extra money on fancier, more expensive ones.
 Got this mouse for the home computer which doesn't get a lot of use.  However, it feels sort of cheap to me after using my Apple mouse all day at work.  It is not as responsive as I would like but my husband says it is fine.
 Great little mouse. Built well and connects every time. Install of drivers was seamless as well. The matte finish feels good. I also like that it has an On-Off switch to save battery. Only gripe is that the `click` is demonstrably louder than a `silent` mouse which has more of a dull thud. Not worth docking a star for that when it works as expected and not advertised as a silent mouse.
 The mouse feels very sturdy. The tracking is accurate. The buttons aren't noisy but to have a substantial "click". Scroll wheel/button functions great.<br/><br/>If you are not in need of a more robust mouse for gaming or design then this is the way to go.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the battery compartment but it isn't an issue. Just make sure the piece of plastic is underneath the batteries. It isn't difficult to do.<br/>The received is stored in the battery compartment. Again... Not a big deal. The cover isn't difficult to remove and it makes sure the receiver stays in place during transport.<br/><br/>Just remember... At the end of the day you are paying just over $10 for this mouse (at the time of this review) Don't expect it to be any more than it is. This is a 5 Star review on a $10 mouse. I'm not comparing it to anything else.
 Uhh.. should have spent the extra money for a laser mouse. Decent wireless opticals are hard to find, and a functioning laser mouse is about 3X as expensive. This mouse might work as a near portable solution for a tablet or laptop user that hates using a touchpad, but it is laggy, has low dpi response, is too small for someone with larger hands, and just feels cheap. I don't play games, but my kids complained about it being too imprecise to play Mine Craft.
 Worked great for about 2 months.  Randomly stopped connecting.  Mouse turns on, computer recognizes the little usb reciever but the mouse never connects no matter what troubleshooting you go through.<br/><br/>You get what you pay for and like most Amazon Basic products they are cheap and fail often.  Big regret not buying a Logitech mouse.
 This is exactly what is advertised: a basic mouse. It works to do mousy things, but if you can, I strongly recommend going for something with a little more oomph.<br/><br/>It's smaller than the average mouse, and burns through batteries like nobody's business - mine literally needs replacement batteries every week.
 I bought this little mouse to use with my newly purchased laptop as a suggestion from Amazon's "frequently purchased with" selection, as I wanted to use a mouse rather than the laptop touchpad. I am not used to the touchpad and for me the mouse is preferable. I love it! It works perfectly and on nearly any surface including the unused flat space on the laptop itself. I love it's compact size and as I have small hands anyway, it fits me like a dream. My only comment is don't forget to turn it off! I have left it on a couple times, but despite that am still using the first set of batteries and it's just a matter of me getting used to my first wireless mouse. This mouse is perfect and for a very reasonable price!
 Exactly what I wanted, I tend to lose these alot so the price is just right.  I use this for my laptop so easy to set up and get going--literally plug and play with no issues at all.  Item came exactly as described.
 I really like this mouse. Honestly, I was concerned; I had had two previous mice that I had purchased (One from Dell when I purchased my laptop--it didn't work right with the laptop. I had trouble getting them to connect. The second one that I had purchased through Amazon through partner. I didn't realize until it was too late but I had bought it from a Chinese company and it took awhile to get here. It didn't connect to the laptop either). After reading the reviews on this AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver, I decided to purchase it. It has worked perfectly from the start. I am glad that I purchased it and would buy it again if I need another mouse.
 Am using it now.<br/>Good, solid product.<br/>Happy camper!<br/>I recommend it.<br/><br/>edited:  10 months later . . . nope, I don't recommend it.  Why?  Because the batteries are a pain in the *ss!  So I ditched this mouse and got me the old-time wired mouse!  So long batteries and batteries and batteries! I downrated it to a two-star from a five-star.
 I bought two (2), one for work and the other for home use.  I have used them both on a daily basis for two years now.  I have had no issues with either of them and they are working as good as the day I received them.  My work mouse obviously gets the most use and I usually turn it off every night before leaving.  I have only changed those batteries twice since the original batteries were installed in August of 2016.  I usually do not turn off the one at home and have changed them 3 times.  I definitely recommend buying this product.  Good quality and great price.
 I agree with the many reviewers that this is an easy to use and install wireless mouse.<br/>It takes only two AAA Batteries. The receiver is packaged inside the mouse (where incidentally, you can store it for travel), just between the two batteries. Connection is quick, and does not require any special installation disks.  It works on my desktop, laptop, and Dell Venue Windows tablet.<br/>It has excellent, no-frills, ergonomics; which means that you will like how it feels.  Its comfortable to use.
 The location of the "thing" that is needed to be plugged into the USB port was quite unusual and I almost missed it.  The directions on its location was not clear enough. It said it was between the batteries.  HA! Nothing between those batteries wrapped in plastic.  The "thing" was located in the battery compartment of the mouse, between where the batteries were to go.  A black item nestled in a black compartment.
 Buying expensive mouse is wasting money.<br/>It is normal mouse without any issues. Also, battery life is long than my expectation. I'v never turned off it. You can use it around 5 months without battery change.
 This is and update on this product.  Buyer beware you have been warned.  Had this mouse 3 months and it just stopped working tonight.  Very disappointed since I was worried about it lasting a long time. Since I work from home I will buying another brand but definitely not this one. Extremely disappointed in this Amazon product made in China.
 It just arrived via UPS this PM. The only problem is that to put the batteries in correctly I had to hold a magnifying glass over the battery hole under a real bright light (with my glasses on) to find the right polarity. I never did figure out if where the plastic went in the battery compartment . I got the batteries in and it works.  This replaces the one that I bought a year ago at the local big box office supply for twice as much money. They offered 21 different colored ones of the same thing at the same price. I hope this one lasts as long or longer . It feels more solid than the old one.
 Extremely helpful and battery efficient wireless mouse I ever bought. It is very durable, and a very nice look to it. It half plastic and half very, thin sturdy, rubbery cover. It feels very good on the hand, and it is not slippery incase you sweat in palms after a long continuous use.
 I never had a laptop before and it became very frustrating the more I used the touchpad on the computer.  Too many unintended false-taps and double taps and sliding fingers made me long for the old-fashioned, reliable mouse.  This battery-powered mouse was the answer to my problems.  I  grew up on computers with mouses (mice?), and can deal with them better than a touchpad.  Just remove the USB sensor from the bottom of the mouse, plug it in the computer, turn on the mouse, and away you go!  You have complete control of the courser from this mouse with any flat surface  to use it on.
 The mouse, itself, operates well.  However, the two batteries that were included lasted only about one month.  My husband's mouse batteries lasted almost three years.  Obviously the manufacturer of this mouse felt that cheap or outdated batteries were adequate for those who purchased their product.  My thought is what other parts of this product are made poorly?  I feel that Amazon should stand behind the product that bears it's name and ship two more batteries to me that will be new enough to last a reasonable period of time.Sub par
 Price is great, feels great, and works great!  The top rubberized pad is comfy and won't get slippery is hands sweat.  The buttons and scroll wheel work flawlessly and the storage space for the USB connector makes sure you don't lose it.  It also works on wood, leather, glass, paper (magazine, newspaper, notebooks, etc.), plastic, cardboard, skin (if you wear shorts), clothes, pretty much any surface you can find.  It's a little smaller than a standard mouse, so don't expect ultra compact, but it's easy to store and take any where.
 I didn't quite expect much for such a cheap mouse. I mainly needed it as a portable wireless mouse to take to events or use at work with my laptops. However, the AmazonBasics mouse is durable, fairly well-calibrated, and works great right out of the box.<br/><br/>It's not terribly flashy or customization, since it's only the two main mouse buttons, a scroll wheel and the scroll click. That said, that completely met my expectation of a cheap "basic" item.<br/><br/>I've had the mouse for over 6 months now, and I pretty much always leave it on at work (I always forget to turn the darn thing off). Despite that, it's still working on the same set of batteries it came with.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed it enough that I've purchased a second one for traveling purposes and I would not hesitate to buy it again.
 This AmazonBasics mouse compares favorably with the Logitech M305 wireless mouse. They are similar in shape, although the Amazon mouse is  bit larger. (A good thing from my POV.) The Nano receiver is also a bit larger, but seems to engage firmly in the USB port . The Amazon mouse uses two AAA batteries, and the Logitech one AA.<br/><br/>The Amazon mouse tracks well, scrolls smoothly and quietly (you can feel the scroll steps), and the mouse buttons function as they should.<br/><br/>I'm using this mouse on a couple of rescued IBM Thinkpads (R51) with Linux (PCLinuxOS) and a dual boot with Windows XP SP3. The mouse is detected without issues.<br/><br/>Very nice mouse for the money.
 The mouse is a good size, and it fits my hand nicely. Smooth and I love that it has storage for the usb receiver. My only problem might be that my mouse freaks out sometimes, doesn't notice when I move my mouse, and staggers across the screen. HOWEVER, I think that is just my computer being slow.<br/><br/>I got this for a great price (other mouses like best buy ones are around $19), and it does exactly what I need it to do. Get this if you just need a mouse and don't want to pay $19
 wanted: basic wireless mouse<br/>received: basic wireless mouse<br/><br/>it is what it claims to be, and does the job very well. not a gaming mouse, not trying to pretend i'm programming the matrix. just checking email and buying yet more things i never knew i needed on amazon.<br/><br/>i enjoy the left button, has a very satisfying click. the right button doesn't quite have the same acoustic qualities - some abstract sense of 'clickiness' is lacking - but that could be because it's not used as much. obviously i'm not a very busy man if i can opine on how 'clicky' a mouse button should be. perhaps i should leave my basement apartment and actually socialize with real people. sigh.<br/><br/>amazon basics mouse: recommended.
 I bought this last summer (2014) and was mostly pleased with it, especially for the price. It was my first AmazonBasics purchase, and I was curious as to whether Amazon could produce a product that outperformed other products on the site for a lower price.<br/><br/>The Good: The scrolling and cursor movement are good. The USB connector fits snugly into the computer without jutting out too much (though it makes it tougher to take out)<br/>The Bad: The mouse is a bit too lightweight for its own good. In the interests of ergonomics it is a little lighter on the left side, which led to some shakiness during use. The USB receiver stopped working within a year, becoming really sensitive to movement and erratic. I don't know if it was struck by something (from always being attached to the computer and placed in my backpack) or died on its own, but I looked to upgrade to a different one when I was done.
 Good for back up mouse.  I don't feel it is on the level of a Logitech m305/m325 wireless mouse.  But certainly is adequate while I wait for my new Logitech to arrive.  I find the cursor movements to be abrupt and not as smooth as the Logitech I had been using.
 Had for a few months now. I ADORE this kouse because of its weight. I always hated how light my logitech mouse was, and this one is much more weighted.<br/>Same size as a normal mouse, and there are never a connectivity issue.<br/>It is slightly bigger than the logitech one, though.
 This mouse only works intermittently and erratically. And your mouse pad better be perfect. I've only had it for about a month and it's already showing signs of getting worse. Yes, I replaced the battery and it still is erratic.
 We somehow lost our wireless mouse we used for our laptop and needed a new one. I figured I'd give the "AmazonBasics" product a try and we love it! It works flawlessly, is shaped for a comfortable grip, and has a clean all-black look. The wireless USB receiver is also a little bit smaller than the previous mouse we had, which is nice - it sticks out from the laptop less. Not to mention the price was more affordable for the type of product. If you are looking for a wireless mouse you can't go wrong with this one!
 This mouse slides very smoothly and works well.  I have gone through 2 Logitech wireless mouse in the last year - those were a little over $20.  This one is working like a charm.  It is a little smaller than the Logitech mouse, which takes a little getting used to and might be more noticed by someone with larger hands, but overall, it is a great mouse and I am glad I made the purchase!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this!
 To me I would call this a Mighty Mouse. Soft grip to the touch, smooth wheel, and even the wireless doggle was included. At first I was about to take it back, thinking they didn't include the doggle. But it was just in ninja mode, hiding between the battery slot. I must have needed more coffee to see it.<br/><br/>But if your an Amazon fan, you'll love this mouse. The cute Amazon logo makes me smile, and it feels great in the hand.<br/><br/>They even included the batteries! Such a thoughtful mouse! Maybe he is related to Mickey...
 The Amazon Wireless Mouse worked great for about two weeks.  The mouse fell off my table and continued to work, however there was a significant lag when moving it left.  I feel my 3 star rating is a fair assessment as it could be a lot sturdier.  Granted a mouse isn't meant to fall off a table, but it does still work.  I ended up replacing the mouse with a wired one, but this one still works and I'm sure I will use it again if the need arises.  Overall, I would say buy this mouse if you are looking for something cost effective.  It works great, but could be a lot sturdier for those accidents that tend to happen.
 Pros: Great mouse, small, easy to carry, good feel, battery life everything.<br/><br/>Cons: Unfortunately my nano receiver malfunctioned. I would have to unplug it then plug it back in again every five minutes. This is the second time I've bought this mouse and both times my nano receiver didn't work well with my USB ports (I have a brand new Dell computer).<br/><br/>In the end, Amazon refunded me and I didn't have to even send it back. While I wish the product worked better, I appreciate it while it did work and the excellent customer service by Amazon. May work better for you!
 I like the size since I have small hands, and it's worked reliably for over a year until a month ago. I've tried putting 3 different sets of batteries in it and the light will blink for a few seconds then it's gone.<br/><br/>Great responsiveness, and I like how it has a switch to turn it on and off to save batteries. I'm pretty sad that it died after a year and half. I did use it as my main mouse at work, and that's 8 hours a day.<br/><br/>EDIT: It's not actually dead yet. I waited a day, put in batteries again and it worked. It was weird, it's the same batteries, but today it worked.
 First, this wasn't supposed to be on my doorstep until tomorrow, it arrived today (Cheers!). Second, the packaging wasn't insane, the mouse was unwrapped and in my hand within a split second. I secured the batteries, removed the nano sensor (which is found discretely in the battery area), placed the sensor in one of my USB drives on my macbook and BAM...no instructions needed, mouse was already working.  Lastly, the mouse fits into my medium sized female hands like a dream, even better than the one that I tried at the apple store to match my laptop. I'm about to telecommute 1-2 days a week, so this arrived just in time and feels very comfortable especially compared to my at-work desktop set up.  Amazon, you guys rock!
 I use this for a CCTV DVR so I like how it has an on/off switch to save batter life. Overall the mouse works great. I wish the switch was a little bigger and i'm not sure how long the switch will last but for the price, this mouse is great.
 Thus far, it seems to wok fairly well. However, I took away one star because the small movements don't seem to register quite as well as the wired mouse it replaced on rough surfaces.<br/><br/>Update: I've had this mouse now for about a year. The change of battery is about every month. I don't like having to change the battery so often. Trying to move the mouse with a fine position doesn't work very well. Sometimes, the mouse just doesn't move the cursor on a rough surface, or even a slightly uneven surface. I will look for something better.
 Has an odd tendency to move the pointer around erratically if I don't move the mouse every so often. Even right this second as I'm typing this review, both hands on the keyboard, with the mouse and mousepad on a level surface, the mouse pointer is doing a herky-jerky little dance off to the side of the window. Kind of annoying, but at least it stops once I jiggle the mouse. Also the scroll wheel doesn't support side scrolling with horizontal presses.
 This inexpensive mouse works wonderfully, and I love the fact that it has a power switch on it to keep the battery from being drained when not in use.  I can leave the receiver in the USB slot and power up when I need the mouse.  Unless you're some kind of hardcore gaming fiend or have to program a lot of macros into a mouse for some reason, this is a really good wireless mouse for everyday use.  I don't have anything negative to say about it at all.
 Pro's compared to other similarly priced mice on Amazon:<br/>Just plugged in the dongle and mouse worked immediately.<br/>There IS an on/off switch.<br/>Right/left clicking sound is relatively low<br/>Scrolling sound is virtually silent<br/>I haven't experienced a lag after the mouse is inactive (some other mice have an annoying lag to get the mouse started)<br/>Batteries included!<br/>Easily store dongle inside mouse.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>Dongle is slightly on the bigger side (by like a millimeter) compared to other wireless mice I've had.<br/>Inserting/removing batteries is slightly awkward, but not a big deal.<br/><br/>Note: The plastic thing inside the battery case is supposed to help remove the batteries. I didn't realize that and accidentally cut it out. Still works perfect without it.
 I have really come to appreciate AmazonBasics gear. Not cheap, but as good as any name brand and a little less expensive. I have gone with their iPhone charge cables, external DVD drive, and the wireless mouse.<br/>This wireless mouse is very well made, comfortable in the hand and a pleasure to use. The scroll wheel is very smooth and quiet. It is as good as any Logitech or Microsoft mouse, but less expensive.<br/>And, of course, Amazon is there to back up their branded products, so there is just no risk at all.<br/>I am very glad they have made AmazonBasics, and look forward to expansion of their product line.
 This mouse is a great value for the price.  It works well and is comfortable to use.  It is compact enough for travel, but big enough so that it doesn't cause hand soreness like some of the tiny mice do.
 Might be the worst wireless mouse i've owned.<br/><br/>-Heavier than just about any other wireless mouse i've purchased<br/><br/>- It eats batteries. It uses two AAAs and has significantly less battery life than my previous mouse which used a single AA<br/><br/>- It stutters. I don't know if it's just very sensitive to electronics around it but i use it at work so there are other electronics on my desk and is unavoidable. Regardless it will occasionally stutter wildly. The stuttering lasts for minutes at a time and is incredible frustrating.
 reading text books and using a laptop key pad was getting a tad frustrating so i bought this. Inexpensive came WITH the batteries. Kind of challenging to get the back piece on after putting batteries in but has been working like a CHARM and has been so nice not to have to use the key pad on the lap top. I have also dropped it many times and it is still intact and the back didnt even come off
 I instantly fell in love with this mouse; it connects imeadatelly, very smooth connection, not buggy at all, very compact and comfortable fit perfectly inside your hands (it is on the smaller size so that might vary pending your hand size).  I also love the idea of storing the adaptater inside of the battery compartment. Also it comes with a piece of plastic inside the battery compartment keep that in you need it to remove the batteries.
 This product is okay, I have used it for a few months now and decided to get a new mouse due to the fact that it used up a lot of my batteries. It was good for the first few months, but after a while, the mouse started to malfunction (It would stop working at random times, even if I've changed the batteries). It's also hard to take out the batteries from the mouse. Compared to the mouse I have right now which is a Logitech Wireless one, this one needs two AA batteries, while the Logitech only needs one (And it's better), the price difference is only like $5 more.
 They are priced fairly and work well.  As well as the Microsoft version as near as I can tell.<br/>There is nothing not to like.  They work as a mouse should work.  Small and compact.<br/>Great for a laptop mouse.
 After 6 months of use this mouse is working fine. The provided batteries gave out on short notice. When the batteries start to give out the cursor starts getting jumpy and often has extended lags. Be sure to put fresh Duracells when replacing the AAAs.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After a years and a half the left button is getting so I have to press on it harder and harder. I'm now looking for a replacement. Thinking about getting another one of these taking under consideration that the button was defective from new.
 excellent range for this mouse<br/><br/>this is great when you hook up your laptop/pc  to a big screen tv for an event or you tube video<br/><br/>now you can toggle between your browser bookmarks, stop, replay, view multiple browsers, control volume, look at pics, place an amazon order, read e mail, ( probably order takeout food ), cut and paste, and pause a streaming show without ever leaving the couch!
 Wow.  This is probably the best wireless mouse I've ever had.  I was NOT expecting such high quality for $10.  Very sturdy, very comfortable for the hand (though my hands are quite small, so that may be a thing for other people) and very simple installation.  I love it and would recommend this to anyone who wants to spend as little money as possible while still getting a high quality wireless mouse.
 Delighted with this product!  My batteries last a long while and I leave it on as I can't be bothered to turn off and on all the time.  I bought two so I'd have a back up as the price was so good.  My friend swiped my backup when she saw how good mine was working!  That was the only problem I had!<br/>I'm loving all the AmazonBasics products!  Bring on more!
 There's not too much to review on here. It's reliable, small and portable, and pretty solid and good looking!<br/><br/>Does it have side to side clicking on the wheel? No.<br/><br/>Does it have a place to hold the mini USB wireless adapter? Yes, underneath the battery lid on the underside of the mouse. Pop off that lid, and place the mini USB thing in it for storage.<br/><br/>Find this review helpful? Click the "I find this helpful" button!
 Which can be hard to do on a laptop.<br/>Experimenting and found the squiggle and freeze up of my computer (MAC sierra OS) was when I put my hand near the receiver in the USB.<br/>It works well when you do that, but why settle people? My my old Rapoo was fantastic, never an issue like this. I'll try a different mouse through AMZN and let you know how that works out.
 Perfect!  I read reviews that this mouse was a little smaller than a full sized mouse.  Personally, this is what I was looking for.  Works seamlessly with my Mac.  I didn't go wrong with this purchase!  No fuss, easy, and the batteries have been great so far (everyday use for 2-3 hours for the last 2 wks.)
 Decent wireless mouse if I use my mouse pad BUT I was disappointed because it has trouble on some surfaces. My old mouse worked on anything you put it on but this one does not work on my couch for instance. Maybe it's defective, maybe it's supposed to work on all surfaces but I just got the one that's a bit tweaked. I can't pretend to know much about mouse technology but I vaguely remember a microsoft mouse that I bought once that touted this ability to work on all (or most) surfaces.
 Not a terrible mouse, it works alright; but it feel cheap, its got some latency when you first turn it on. Doesn't feel like it would survive daily use. I ended up ponying up for a nicer logitech in the end.
 I bought three of these for the fantastic price.  On the first one, the left mouse button broke after using for about 2 months.  I'm not a gamer, I was (then) a surgery resident, so you know I wasn't using that left button an awful lot.  I decided not to pursue it, just opened up a box, it went fine.  Unfortunately I gave that and the leftover to my young nephew who promptly lost the receiver.  Anyway, it didn't break again, hence the 3 stars.  Disappointing about the left button on the first one.  Priced to sell so I can ignore one that broke, I think.
 I have been a loyal user of the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 and purchased several. They eventually wear out, the finish rubs off, the rubber on the scroll comes off, and at $69 I expected more. Well this Amazon mouse far at $12 fax exceeds the Microsoft Mouse by miles, its so comfortable, the left/right click feature are somehow so much better than any other mouse I have used. And the scroll wheel click is so perfect, on other 'mice' I never used the scroll wheel click, esp the Microsoft mouse it wasn't an easy and natural click.<br/><br/>I also love the finish, it feels great and looks great. I will never spend $70 for a mouse again!
 I'm only rating this 3/5 stars because of the innovative little carry pouch inside the mouse for USB. Otherwise it's a very hollow feeling mouse. It does it's job and it's functional, but I also had the scroll button glitch sometimes into auto scroll mode.<br/><br/>You can buy a Logitech mouse for $20 and it has a much better feel than this mouse.
 I bought this as a replacement to my Logitech that I lost while traveling.  The price was good and the reviews were great.  Has not worked out well for me at all.  If I leave my laptop for any length of time and it hibernates,  when I come back I have to reconnect the dongle.  I've tried just using the reconnect button on the bottom of the mouse itself, but that doesn't work.  I either have eject and reinstall the dongle, turn off and on the mouse itself or reboot the laptop for the mouse to work.  It's just annoying....... with so many good reviews, this might be a fluke.  Would love to return it for replacement, but I don't have packaging at this point.  Disappointing as I usually like Amazon labeled products.
 Large and comfortable to hold, this mouse is attractive and seems to be as durable as the Logitech mouse I planned to replace. I had hoped the scroll wheel would spin freely like it does on my Logitech M325 but unfortunately for me, it "ticks" as you turn it like an older Microsoft mouse I had, so you can feel the little "ticks" as you scroll and also hear a soft noise. Some people might like that, but not me. Overall, the mouse is a great value - I just don't care for the "ticking" scroll wheel.
 Great little mouse, it is not the size of a standard Mouse so if you want a standard-sized mouse this is not it. It's great for my laptop and moves easily across the screen no jerking or twitching.
 I connected this mouse to the most basic streaming laptop on the market. So I realize that my laptop isnt the greatest, but when I connected this mouse to it my laptop ran super slow... Im not sure exactly why but when I plugged a different mouse into it my laptop works great. So I have to blame it on the mouse... It's a decent mouse if you are trying to save a few bucks but really you may as well just throw in a couple extra dollars to get a better model
 I purchased (2) of Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse's. The first one stopped working after a month and the second has been working for two months. So many of the large retailers start their own products lines, but they seem to always use the worst manufactures they can find? I really wish Amazon would make sure their own product lines are being manufactured by quality companies and not just the cheapest they can find.
 It's small enough to be held easily.  Seems to be well made.<br/><br/>Update: returned it because the battery didn't fit into it correctly and the cursor jumped around the screen when trying to  use it.
 This mouse has intermittent problems such as frozen cursor syndrome and spastic cursor movement. Changed the batteries to no avail. It is practically new so it isn't dirty. Cannot recommend.
 It's an OK mouse, but its definitely generic.<br/><br/>Really though, everything is fine except the one thing I haven't seen anyone write home about (or maybe they have and its buried in the hundreds of reviews)<br/><br/>The tracking is somewhat terrible.  It reminds me of a dirty ball mouse from the 90's.  I mean, it is reliable, you don't notice any issues until you really start to do work with it.  Fine detail movements?  forget about it.  Using the mouse on weird surfaces like a couch? forget about it.<br/><br/>Not bad for the price, I suppose, but you can buy Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000's for the same price and they are 10x better mice.
 I received my item and did not yet need it for a few more weeks. When I did open the box and set it up - it didn't work. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions in the user manual. However, the mouse still won't connect. I also tried it on multiple computers and with fresh batteries. Unfortunately for me, I am unable to return this now $10 paper weight.
 First one I bought worked fine.  It still works. Then I bought two more.  Second worked for a month, then started getting picky about what surface I used, and then the pointer started moving in jerky motions.  I tried third one, and out of box barely  moved, usually frozen pointer..  I tried different batteries, on/off, reinstalling driver, etc. Obviously others had good experience, but not me.
 Mouse has worked fine since it arrived a few months ago, but its about to be retired because it will not hold one of the batteries in its seated position.  The AAA battery slot in the one I have is misshapen and does not accept the battery in a nice, clicked position, so the electrical contact breaks and the mouse quits working while I am using it.  This seems to be a manufacturing flaw, but I like it enough to ask Amazon for a replacement.  If it can't be replaced, I'm going back to Logitech.
 Works great for the price.  Just wanted to cut down some wires on an infrequently used computer.  Came with batteries, and the receiver is hidden inside the mouse which I think is great so you can keep them together when it's not in use.  Easy on-off button - like I said infrequently used in my case, so I turn it off when I'm not using.  Plugged it in and it worked, no drivers or any other setup.
 my old mouse bit the dust !!...sadness, weeping !! but i ordered this replacement and am very happy....it took a couple of days<br/>to get use to the difference in weight !!....love Amazon basic products....great products for little $$$/s !!!
 Well, actually, it works sporadically, which is just as bad as not working. Sometimes removing and replacing the batteries will get it to start working again, but typically it stops again within 3-4 minutes. Very frustrating!
 Standard, basic wireless mouse. These mice are a smaller, travel size. Perfect for smaller kid hands. Bought 2 of these to go with laptops for my kids for Christmas.<br/><br/>Update 8-7-2017 -- After just over a year, the mouse I purchased most recently out of 3 has died. It has just stopped functioning. Of course it's just after the warranty expired. The mouse turns on just fine, but nothing happens. I'm thinking the receiver is shot. Lowered my rating to reflect this.
 I've been using this mouse for about a month now and it works best if the nano receiver is placed in a front USB port instead of one on the back of my desktop computer.  It seems to operate smoothly most of the time, however, sometimes it staggers and stops/starts when playing mahjong.  But for surfing the internet and regular use it works great.  It's a nice looking little mouse and it sure beats having a long cord draped all over the place and getting tangled up under my feet.  It works just as good if not better than my old wireless mouse and I'm not too concerned about it not being super smooth with mahjong - I waste too much time playing it anyway.
 Update: With extended use, I found this mouse to be a little slow when it comes to games or cutting and pasting. To be fair, I move pretty quickly and I was used to a faster mouse. This is my standby/travel mouse now.<br/><br/>I ordered two of these several months ago. I use one of them constantly, and it's still good as new. I do replace the battery fairly often, but I rarely turn it off. A no-nonsense product for a reasonable price.
 I needed a new mouse for my laptop. This mouse is a little smaller than most, but for a laptop it is the right size. The instructions with it were clear and I found the USB plug easily and plugged it in. The included batteries immediately let me put it in service. While I can use the laptop's touch pad successfully, this mouse makes things easier for me. I expect to leave the USB plug for this mouse on the laptop all of the time as it only sticks out a 1/2 inch or so.
 Great mouse!  Works perfectly with my Windows 10 PC.  It's a little bit smaller than the average mouse, so it takes some getting used to, but otherwise it does the job.  The range on the wireless receiver could be better.  The PC is under the desk, about 3-4 feet from the mouse, and sometimes the pointer is jerky or doesn't respond right away.  I ended up moving the BT receiver closer with a USB extender and it works much better.
 I have gotten so sick of wires everywhere that I decide to get rid of one and get a wireless mouse when my old one died.  The reviews were all over the place, but I'm not a big gamer, etc., so I decided to give this mouse a try as a couple of reviews said the lag on it was minimal.  However, I found it to be horrible with my computer and terribly frustrating even when just doing minor web surfing.  I finally gave it to my daughter to use with her old laptop and I bought a wired mouse.  Ah, relief.
 This has lasted two years in daily use for @6 hrs a day. Small, but feels good in my size 12 hand. Total no-brain setup. Doesn't use up any more of my crowded bluetooth bandwidth or conflict with other devices. Impossible to insert batteries wrong way. Battery compartment cover broke loose, but easily fixed with scotch tape.
 We love this mouse.  It is affordable (hurray Amazon basics!), fits the hand extremely well, is cordless, and talks to our PC via a miniscule usb receiver so it is incredibly easy to get it up and running.  The cursor tracks perfectly on the screen and the mouse works on any surface (desk, mouse pad, whatever) perfectly.  While we use it for our desktop, it would be equally perfect for a laptop.  You will not be disappointed.
 came as a recommended product for a chrome book I purchased.  WRONG! This mouse will not work with a chrome book without a USB/C adapter which was not part of the recommended products Amazon brought up. I didn't return the mouse because it is not worth the money and effort to do so.
 I bought this for my Chromebook (Acer C720P).  It works great (in ChromeOS and Crouton jessie/debian chroot), fits comfortably in my AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop case, and feels comfortable in my hand.  The price is also good.  I considered buying a bluetooth mouse so I wouldn't have the nano receiver, but couldn't find a bluetooth mouse I liked.  Given that I don't use a mouse often, I was willing to compromise and use the Nano Receiver.  This AmazonBasics mouse is excellent value and suits my needs well when the trackpad on the Chromebook isn't the best fit for some applications.
 I asked the IT guys at work what brand wireless mouse would be best for my Toshiba laptop.  They recommend the Amazon brand.  They were right.  I'very been using it for a month now.  It works great!
 I like the Amazon basics wireless mouse.  It does the job.  The only issue I had is that there was an issue with the mouse I received.  The cover on the bottom of the mouse that accesses the batteries and nano receiver does not sit flush.  One of the corners sits up a bit so it "scrapes" as I move the mouse. I wanted to return it but is more effort than it is worth for a $10 mouse.
 Stopped working after half a year.  I believe the nano receiver has broken.  Won't work in multiple computers
 Good basic wireless mouse from AmazonBasics.<br/><br/>Minus one start for the very awkward battery compartment. It's tricky to get the batteries in AND in the correct plus/minus directions. Not sure if this is an Amazon design flaw or typical for a basic mouse.
 Honestly, I like amazon products and this item is no exception to that. The only thing I dislike about this is that it kills the battery. It uses two AAA batteries and sucks them dry fairly quickly. The only reason why I bought TWO of these was because my logictech died after 5 faithful years. I would use one AA battery in the logitech and it would last minimum 10 months if not longer. This amazon mouse is smooth and precise (when i use photoshop for example) but battery life sucks.
 Works just as well as my Logitech wireless mouse, but costs a quarter as much.  The size and material feel great in the hand, and the laser works well (it doesn't skip around). I've used it now for a few weeks and haven't had any battery issues.  The usb insert is a little larger than my Logitech, but is still less than half an inch so it doesn't interfere with anything.  When the time comes for another mouse I'll definitely be getting another one of these.
 Have to make serious effort to keep everything out of the way between the mouse and the receiver, otherwise it does not function. It is much touchier in this respect than other wireless mice I've used. Distance is also a challenge for it. Any farther than 10 feet and it has trouble.
 I was super excited to finally get a wireless mouse to use with my laptop. Everything was great until it stopped working. It would work for some time, then it seemed like it would stop syncing. I thought it was the batteries, so I replaced them but it was still unresponsive. I tried connecting the Nano Receiver to different USB ports, and still nothing. I even tried disconnecting and reconnecting on my laptop wireless setting. The mouse no longer works and I haven't even had it for that long.
 My only problem with this mouse is that the center scroll wheel depresses/clicks way too easily.  I previously had a Dell wired mouse. I am used to scrolling web pages, email, documents, etc via the center scroll wheel. But with this mouse, I often end up depressing/clicking the wheel when I am just trying to scroll with it, causing me much frustration. I have been trying to adjust by using lighter touch, but it is still a big problem for me. I don't know if my old mouse took more pressure than most to depress this, or this one takes less pressure, but they are definitely quite different.
 A lot has been written about this mouse--so I won't add a lot but simply say that this is a great value for a wireless mouse.  I had another brand of wireless mouse that I had used--it died and I decided to try this one.  BTW, I use it on/with my laptop--I have never been a big fan of the touch pads on laptops. It is not too big and has worked very well in the month that I have been using it.  Its longevity is yet to be seen but its cost is quite reasonable compared to some other wireless mice I have seen.
 I followed instructions to the letter. Once the batteries were inserted, the back cover would not close and stay on.  Took the mouse to Best Buy Geek Squad and three people tried to close it and all failed.  The Geek Squad declared it a worthless item and suggested I return it to Amazon.  I opted to throw it away
 I thought the mouse was going to be a great buy, however it was broken just 40 days later (after light use) and now I'm past the 30 day return. Despite trying to get it to connect to my computer, it doesn't recognize it. Don't bother getting it!
 using it right now.  Has a great range.  We use it with the laptop plugged with a HDMI cable to our tv and sit on the couch or even as far as the kitchen using this mouse with the laptop to stream tv.  Works great.  Batteries seem to last, but we turn off inbetween use.
 I purchased the Amazon basics mouse for my wife about six months ago.  The mouse is working well for her and is a good quality product.  The Amazon basics mouse I ordered recently for myself is a totally different model than what my wife received.  It is a different design with lower quality.  The mouse I ordered broke within days.
 Lasted from October 4, 2017 - January 5, 2019. Done 2 Battery changes during its lifetime. Abruptly stopped working. No bottom sensor lights or top led visible. the Nano receiver was recognized in the computer still. Tried a fresh set of batteries, and a set of batteries from my wifes mouse. still nothing. it was great while it lasted.
 What makes apple products so desirable? Perhaps their sleek modern design that captivates our attention or their subtle attention to functionality and reliability. If that's the case then this mouse hits the spot.<br/>After looking to purchase an Apple Magic Mouse for my MacBook Pro and refusing to pay such a great price for a device I would only be using when editing photographs in Lightroom ⎯ the trackpad is utterly useless when trying to adjust sliders ⎯ I found this little gem and after only one day of solid I have to say it's best $11 you will spend for your laptop.<br/>Amazon is kind enough to include a set of AAA batteries that makes this mouse extremely easy to set up. Just plug in the received onto a USB port, flip the ON switch on the mouse and you're on your way.<br/>I would definitely recommend this mouse it's small, sleek, stylish, and extremely easy to set up. It may not have the extra two or three buttons but for a laptop this is really your best option.
 I've bought at least three of these, maybe four.  They work great but after time they seem to stop working.  No mouse pointer is seen.  The ones that stop working have been used with my laptop so maybe wear and tear?
 I looked specifically for a mouse you can turn off and on, which this is.  That's good.  What's bad is that it is not highly responsive to clicks!  My mouse "finger" became sore to point I discontinued the use of this mouse.
 I think I've bought three of these now, as I have a habit of losing them at customer sites.  My third one started to malfunction after a couple of months.  The scroll wheel between the two buttons started to misbehave and not scroll the screen properly.  As I would scroll the wheel the screen would start in the right direction and then jitter back and forth.  It was like the screen was snapping backwards and not smoothly scrolling in the direction I intended.  I plugged in other mice, and they all scrolled fine.<br/>The mouse was under the one year AmazonBasics warranty, and Amazon is sending out a new replacement, no questions asked, and no need to return the defective mouse.  Can't ask for better customer service than that, though I'm surprised they didn't seem to care what the issue was to perhaps improve the product.  So I'll leave the review here for them to scrape it.
 I really like this mouse. It is just the right size. Some are too big, and I hate the small ones. I like the on/off switch on it to help save battery life. It is very responsive and the small USB plug is out of the way. A great mouse for the proce.
 This mouse was cheap in cost but didn't feel like it. The tracking is accurate and the mouse clicks are spot on. The wireless connection picks up easily every time. Like pretty much every mouse nowadays, the settings are customizable but the defaults (speed of the click wheel etc) are perfect. I'm happy with the purchase but sad that mice no longer have tails thanks to the wireless feature. Perhaps it's time to rename them. Rocks? Click wheel thingies?
 EDIT: Only FIVE months after my purchase, both wireless mouse purchased have broken and are non-functional. The first one broke about a month or so ago and I thought it was a fluke, although I was disappointed. Now the second one is broken and my recommendation is to stay far, far away from this product.
 The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver works as expected and was a very good price.  The reason it only received 4 stars is because the battery cover door has really weak (almost non-existent) clips and I'm anticipating after a few battery changes the cover will no longer hold in place.  Picture that one TV remote that every household seems to have with the taped door.  I won't tape the mouse if this happens because I think that would make it miserable to use.
 Worked for 2.5 years without any problem. The main inconvenience with this particular mouse is the batteries size and their placement. It's AAA and how they placed could be tricky to get in. Also to turn it on and off kinda uncomfortable too - it ruined my manicure couple of times.
 Love it. Its just a simple wireless mouse. This mouse was a replacement for a 10 yr old microsoft wireless mouse that still works pretty well. I like that it is simple with no frills. It seems well constructed and seems like I can expect to have it for 10 yrs as well. This is the 2nd amazonbasics product that I've bought and I really enjoy them so far. I also like how the receiver stores inside the mouse battery hatch, so there is no way for it to fall out or get lost.
 Still one of my most favored mice. It tracks well on any surface like your own pants, bedsheets, etc, unlike other cheap mice. Its small size and on-center sensor allows easy use on laptop surfaces. The only issue is that the scroll wheel gets sloppy after months of use so I've been buying it over and over again. At least it's cheap!
 This is a wireless mouse. My computer is on the right side of my desk. The mouse works fine on the right side but if I move to the center of my desk the signal is week and inconsistent.
 Basic mouse that does what its supposed to do. I bought it for work because the ones they provide just don't cut it. If someone steals mine its only like 12$ or something like that so no big deal Ill just buy another one.<br/><br/>Ive had this for over a month and it's still on its first set of batteries. If you remember to turn off the mouse when you leave work it will last even longer (i'm 50/50 on remembering to do this).<br/><br/>Overall a good basic mouse and I would buy again for browsing/non-precision work purposes
 This is a very nice mouse at good value. The scrolling and clicking actions are quieter and smoother than several Logitech mouses I already own. The battery is definitely lasting longer than Logitech's since I've got mine over 4 months ago and it's still going strong. The mouse feels comfortable on my hand, and it is about the same size as Logitech M305 (which broke on me). I've just ordered another one since I like it so much, and I'm tired of replacing batteries on my Logitech M510.
 I like the fact that it's cheap and it's simple, and it works. It is a bit smaller than most mice and I have average sized hands, so someone with big hands would probably find it uncomfortable. The range on the receiver is a bit more limited than I expected. I had to hang the receiver from a short length of cable so I could position it in direct line of sight with the mouse and not be blocked by the case of the computer. But it worked great once I made that change.
 Great mouse. I love amazon basics brand because I know that I can always count on the products. The best thing about this mouse is that it has a storage compartment in the mouse for the receiver which is always a must for me in computer mouses. The battery life for this mouse is average, definitely not great battery life for a mouse but I have also seen a lot worse.
 Way better than Logitech M187. The Logitech M187 drains batteries quickly, feels cheap and the left click eventually stops working. This Amazon mouse, on the other hand, doesn't drain batteries quickly, doesn't feel cheap, and when dropped, it still works fine.
 Not sure what more to say. It works - is functional immediately after turning on. Reasonably price. Doesn't feel cheap. Haven't had to change battery as I don't use it 24x7, but don't seem to have any traumatic battery issue.
 This mouse actually works better than my apple mouse.  But, IT's NOT BLUETOOTH (just so you know).  So you  have to use the dongle, and take up a USB port.  Still, once it is in, the performance is flawless and there is absolutely no configuration with a MacBook Pro.  It's a little big for travel (about standard size).
 I am retiring this mouse after several trouble-free years of all-day use.<br/><br/>The reason? I have used it so much that the scrolling wheel has become polished and has thus become a bit slippery. Can't fault the mouse for that. A good run with no complaints. For ten bucks. Can't ask for more.
 I bought the mouse for an iMac.  I loved it for the first few months.  The feel was good, the size was good, the battery life was ok.  I was so satisified that I bought a second one for use in my laptop.  Then I noticed that it was starting to get 'jumpy'.  So much so that it is basically unusable.  So, I swapped out the mouse from the desktop, with the one I was using for my laptop.  Three weeks later, it's even more jumpy, and thus unusable.  Now I have two useless mice.  I'm going back to logitech.  Saving $10 on a product that typically lasts for a few years, doesn't work when you have to re-buy it every three months.
 It just arrived. I got a replacement to my Logitech wireless mouse which was great but only lasted about 2 years before the sensor went to crap. The design flaw on this mouse (AmazonBasics) is that the +/- signs for the battery are pretty hard to find. You have to shift a light and look above the battery icon -- all of which are texture based and difficult to see. This took about 5-10 minutes which is a long time for such a simple action. Not sure yet about performance as I've just received it...
 I got this mouse it does not work right out of the package.  The batteries are dead.  The metal contact for the batteries one bent one is missing.  It is not worth the time it would take me to box it up and return it.  Do not buy cheap electronics items.
 Purchased this Amazon mouse in January. It stopped working just after the return date. Amazon policy states that it may be eligible for a return after the return date but offers no tab to see if it can be returned or to return it because it has a "latent defect."<br/>Try another mouse.
 This Mouse is one of the best wireless mice I have ever used. I have one matter that needs to be fixed - When trying to remove the two AAA batteries one finds it difficult to do so unless the clear plastic helper strip is in place but even then it is hard to remove.<br/>Other than this, the mouse really is superior to any mouse I have used and I have been using them for nearly 20+ years now. The price is excellent and I am ordering two more in a few days, one extra for another of my machines and one for my wife. I think they will be as pleased as I am.<br/>Jay
 My old mouse was over ten years old and was showing it's age so I thought I would try this replacement.  It works very well.  The response is dead accurate and the wheel is virtually silent.  I doesn't really bother me, and this just could be me used to my old worn mouse, but the buttons do click substantially when you press them.  I wouldn't say the click is too loud or anything, it's just apparent.  Again, I'm probably just so used to my ten plus year old mouse's buttons being so worn that they barely click.  That is probably why it wasn't working very well any more.
 My laptop didn't recognize this mouse, and I couldn't use it.  I have an older laptop, and, even though it's running Windows 10, the operating system didn't "see" the mouse, no matter which USB port I used for the controller.  Very frustrating.
 What a great purchase considering I made my decision without even touching the product! I've come to really gravitate towards AmazonBasics products for my electronic purchases (I own a HDMI cord too). This is a great value mouse that I bought for work since my employer only provided a wired mouse for me. Now I'll never go back to that type for sure! Got this item in 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and only took me ~30 seconds to "install".<br/><br/>Few things:<br/><br/>Connection: I've been using this daily for a good 3 months now and don't have any connection problems.I never really remove the USB Nano Receiver from my computer, but you could if you wanted to use this mouse on multiple computers. The USB adapter actually can be stored inside the mouse so you don't lose it. Whoever thought of that is a keeper!<br/><br/>Batteries: I sometimes forget to turn the mouse off at night, but for the most part, this is NOT a battery drainer for me. I've only had to change them once from the batteries that originally came with the device.<br/><br/>Grip: This is a plastic product with no rubber support. That being said, I find that my hand doesn't get tired or ache with prolonged use.<br/><br/>Roller: The actual scroll 'button' (the part you use with your pointer finger) of the mouse has seen some wear and tear over the past few months. In fact, when I bought it, it was originally black, but not its somewhat greyish. Other that looking a little weird, it doesn't impact the function of the device. I'm not picky, but this could be important for others<br/><br/>Highly recommend this for your work, home, travel devices for sure. Another satisfied Amazon Basics purchase!<br/><br/>P.S. The packaging was simple to open and completely recyclable (which was an added benefit).
 I have purchased two of these for use with a Dell Inspiron laptop running W 10. Both worked OK for a few weeks, then began to intermittently quit for no reason. Tried all the tricks, turning of and on, remove and reinsert the usb receiver, replace batteries. Sometimes one of these reactivates the mouse, sometimes nothing will. I am junking them and trying a Microsoft mouse.
 I really wanted to like this mouse, and for about 6 months I did. It worked exactly as advertised. Then little things started happening. The battery life is mediocre (I have had to replace the batteries 4 times in a year). I often get double clicks for no reason. But most annoying is the scroll wheel. All of the grip on it has worn off and it is nearly impossible to scroll anymore. A little texture on the wheel and this probably becomes a 4-star review, but losing one of the most important functionalities really knocks it down (which is funny to say, because I remember the days before scroll wheels). Anyways, as a basic mouse, it is fine until it isnt.
 This thing is extremely disappointing.  I needed a mouse that would work about 7 feet away from my computer.  This mouse starts loosing connection at about 3-4 ft. Very unreliable and I will need to buy another mouse.
 This is the best $12 wireless mouse I've ever used. Setup couldn't be easier- it was basically plug and play. The mouse feels good, like it should be more expensive. The only odd thing is with the batteries- they go in at an angle, and I feel like I'm not sure they clicked fully into place. Also, there is an odd piece of clear plastic inside the battery compartment that I wasn't sure what to do with at first, but the manual says it's there to help remove the batteries when they need to be replaced, so be sure to put the batteries in on top of the plastic strip. So other than that bit of oddness, this mouse is perfect for my purposes.
 Right mouse button double clicks when you single click.  I also don't like that it takes 2 - AAA batteries.  I bought extended warranty that I will never use because mouse is not worth the trouble.  This mouse acts erratically more than a 5 feet away.  Expected better from something with Amazon name on it.
 Bought this because a mouse is better for some tasks than a touchpad, especially when the click button on said touchpad is broken.  Battery life is great; it's still on the original batteries even though I forget to shut it off half the time.  Would be a bit better if the USB plug stored without having to open the battery compartment.<br/><br/>Update: Seven months later, countless times I've forgotten to shut it off, and still running the original batteries.<br/><br/>Update 2:  Almost three years and it's still working great.  The batteries seem to last forever; I think I've only changed them twice.
 This mouse is quite small, too small for my hands.And, each time I click, I hear a distinct loud click sound. This might not bother some people, but if you are clicking a lot, it can get to be annoying. It will be a good backup mouse if I need one, but I won't be using it on a daily basis. My hand would start to cramp up. I don't know why it got so many good reviews. I will have to see how well it does on batteries.<br/><br/>The USB receiver is nice and tiny. I can see this being a good mouse for a laptop where you don't want it to be too large.
 This is a good mouse, especially for the price. It is on the small side. Not microscopic, but smaller than some of my other wireless mice I have owned. The size is a plus for travel, but a bit tough for long sessions. The USB nub is just a bit larger than those found on competitors' mice, but the nub does fit inside the mouse for storage. I turn the mouse off when I am traveling with it, I think the on/off switch is too small. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, and would buy again.
 The mouse does not read very well on anything other than completely smooth and uniform toned surfaces.  Most other optical mouses I have had will read pretty well on just about anything but this one will jump around if there is any discoloration or unevenness on the surface.  Even the surface of my desk which seems pretty smooth will not work well so I need to lay down blank white computer paper.  If you are just using it for normal purposes it is probably not a big deal but this mouse is not good for any sort of gaming.  Also after only a couple months of use the left click button has degraded.  It now takes a lot of force to click it which makes it difficult to do repetitive clicking.  Again this may be due to wear from gaming so it may not be an issue if you aren't playing games.  Take note though that I don't even play games very often so this clicker seemed to degrade after only a couple days of FPS playing.  Also I find the mouse a little too small to be comfortable.  I can only really hold it with my fingers as it is too small to rest my palm on.  This might be nice if you want a small mouse but for me I would prefer something larger that fits in my hand even though I carry it around in my bag and use it with a laptop.
 Good mouse.  Worked on my ASUS Chromebook with no issues, no adjustments on setting, (just plug and play) and allows my trackpad to still work simultaneously.<br/><br/>Uses one battery, no idea on battery life.<br/><br/>The clicks are loud,  This is particularly annoying when I use it in the university or public libraries. I certainly wish it was quieter clicking,, or silent clicking buttonless, like an Apple Bluetooth white mouse. I'd pay more, in the long run, for a quieter mouse.
 Well, it's affordable and it works. Took about 10 minutes to get the batteries in, cause the plastic strip that is supposed to help remove old batteries was all twisted inside. Had to use needle nose pliers to fish it out. Battery door is extremely flimsy. I dropped the mouse off my couch onto carpet and the door flew off. Power switch on the bottom is very flimsy as well.The mouse probably won't last long enough to replace the batteries,  but I didn't expect much for the price.
 I have this mouse and one from Logitech and both are wireless. The Amazon mouse does not have a "sleep" feature so, if you're trying to squeeze out the most amperage from the batteries, you will have to be bothered to flip the switch under the mouse. The mouse isn't as accurate as I'd like, but it's not terrible. The scrolling button is just fine, however<br/><br/>But, of course, for the price point, these "cons" aren't bad.
 This mouse is unreliable; it has poor tracking, with the cursor appearing all over the screen instead of where I want it. It may respond to a click, or require several clicks, or not respond at all.  I'm buying something other than an Amazon brand next time
 I bought this to use with the computer in our living room that's hooked up to the tv. The distance from the table the mouse sits on to the computer and wireless receiver is approximately 15 feet. At that range the mouse isn't as responsive as the logitech unit it replaced. If it's moved 4 or 5 feet closer to the computer then it works fine. I do appreciate the off switch on the bottom, as well as the quietness of the scroll function. All-in-all, a good product, albeit with limited range. I must say, also, that the shipping was incredibly fast for this mouse...2 days from order to our mailbox.
 This mouse works well for me - better than the fancy shapes with lots of buttons, and doesn't have the cheap feel of some other brands. Perhaps if you're a gamer this isn't for you, but otherwise I highly recommend this mouse.
 Our mice get so abused in my house!!  I have purchased three of these in 4 years.  Two were for myself and one for the kids fairly recently.  So in 4 years I have used the hell out of these things.  I work at home so there's 40+ per week and my normal recreational usage.  I love it and will keep buying as long as they are available.
 Fast, simple transaction. This little mouse worked fab from the minute I inserted the fob in my laptop. Price cannot be beat. I've told friends about it. Buy one for home, one for work.
 this little mouse is amazing. i had a logitec usb mouse that had all the range of 3 feet and i needed something with better range because i have my laptop hooked up to my tv. this cheap usb mouse has a really long range - it allows me to use the mouse from across the room on my couch, it's small but not too small, and it comes with an off/on button at the bottom, which is great for saving battery life.
 Ideal little travel mouse, good for small hands. Takes a standard battery, the USB connector is small and doesn't get in the way, and it's quite economical so you're not heartbroken if you lose it.<br/> If you have very large hands, you might find this one a little too small.
 I needed an inexpensive mouse for a laptop that isn't used a lot.  I am pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.  It works as well as any of my more expensive mice.  I especially like the material that covers the top of the unit.  It is a non-slip plastic which feels good in the hand.
 Item works fine for first few months then it starts to get sticky and stop and go stop and go<br/>replaced the batteries and same issue<br/>tried in different computers and same issue<br/>I would not buy this item as it is buggy
 Mouse is fine, but it was delivered "with batteries" that were DEAD.  And of course they re a smaller size than<br/>what I had on hand- had to run to the store to get batteries.  A pain in the ass when you expect something to be ready<br/>out of the box-  Shipping seemed to be slow too, not sure why.
 This mouse works great! I've never used an amazon electronic product before so I was honestly kind of hesitant to buy this. But it works just like any other mouse and was a great price so I'm a happy customer.  Like other reviewers posted, the pointer speed was crazy fast, but I just adjusted the settings on my computer and it's fine now.  I'm using this mouse on a PC at work so the size is on the smaller side, but for $11 it's sufficient.
 Amazon basics products do not seize to impress.<br/>The quality isn't expected to be top notch, but it's pretty much mid notch rebranded items.<br/><br/>I haven't had an Amazon basic item that I haven't been impressed with.<br/><br/>I'm not raving. It's not the best, but they are very affordable solutions to top competitors.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'll come across hit and misses, but so far Amazon all around has been great.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Bucky Wilson<br/>Www.facebook.com\bucky5676
 It quit working after three days. Changed batteries twice and still no go. I guess when you buy cheap, you get cheap. Of course I would love to buy an expensive one but being on disability, can't.
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents, and they are very pleased with it.  They have had absolutely no issues with it.  It has been used with a netbook running Windows 7 and a new laptop running Windows 10.  In both cases, it has been "plug and play".  It appears to have good battery life as well.  I put in Duracell batteries, and have not had to replace them yet.  It doesn't have a ton of fancy, customizable buttons, but that is the only "concession" made for the price (and the simplicity is preferable for my parents anyway).  It looks and feels very well made.  Very impressed with Amazon for creating a high quality product for a good price :)
 Disappointed with this mouse especially with so many high ratings. I purchased it in May and so far it has gone through one set of batteries and now it has completely stopped working. I have contacted Amazon about the warranty for it so hopefully I will not have wasted my money on a mouse that only worked for such a short time. Maybe it was defective to begin with since it was not handled roughly and wasn't dropped or had anything spilled on it. This is just my experience with it so far.
 HOLY CRAP!!! this really amazed me! I was expecting some average two-bit mouse that lags and doesn't always pick up movement. But it's actually a very reliable mouse. It picks up every moevement unless its a probelm with your laptop, has a very good range, comes with its own batteries, and even has a place to store the USB plugin inside the mouse when you need to take it out of your computer/laptop. Sure it may not look spectacularly awesome, but I really recommend this amazingly affordable mouse!
 I bought my first one and it lasted for a few months and then stopped connecting and working. I thought it was just a defect and thought I would order another one since it's at a good price. The second one I bought stopped working within 2 weeks.
 Overall this is a fantastic mouse, but the only issue I've found with it is the battery cover on the bottom came loose and now won't stay in place. I've never dropped it, you can't tell it's been used. But just with usage (6 months) it's already come loose, and I'm currently using tape to hold it in place.
 First one broke just at the one month mark, it no long moved the mouse on the screen, re plugging it didn't work. The second one that Amazon gave is working okay, but it had 1 or 2 moments where it couldn't move the mouse either.
 Arrived on time and in good condition. This is a basic mouse that is comfortable, small and compact.  Works well for my purposes. I can't tell how it is with games because I use it mainly for business.
 Read instructions, replaced batteries, tried making sure it was near the USB connection.  cannot control the action of this mouse.  just got a logitech at Walmart; new wireless keyboard and new wireless mouse for $20.00 and they are working great.
 Great mouse - great price.  I bought 2 of them to replace a more expensive brand mouse for my laptops. They perform at least the same maybe better. They have a low profile dongle and leave it in when I bag and travel with it.  I have had the dongle which was too loose and lost got lost.
 I've been using the mouse regularly for the last 9 months, and the batteries finally died today. That's with turning the power off between uses, which is on the longer end of wireless mice I have used.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Plug and play - it has worked on all computers I've used (Windows, Mac, and Linux)<br/>- Smooth scrolling<br/>- 9 month battery life with regular use<br/>- Small mouse and receiver - it makes it easier to travel with<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- The click is loud, definitely louder than the Logitech M305 I previously used<br/>- Often jumps around on reflective surfaces
 It's a shame to know that I spent over $20 on a cheap mouse from Walmart that broke after 3 months. And that just moments after taking this mouse out of the box you knew Amazon took there time to insure this product was of genuine quality. I am star struck over and over again with the quality and reliability that the Amazon Basics sell. Great job. Great job. Great job!
 I have really tiny hands and short fingers, yet this mouse still feels far too small! Before this, I used a mouse with nearly the same measurements, yet this one feels dramatically shorter and more compact in my hand. The buttons are okay, but the clicking noise is louder than I expected.<br/><br/>It works as it's supposed to, but it's not the greatest choice. It's good to keep around as a spare and would make a good mouse for travel, but probably isn't ideal for heavy, everyday use. Due to its awkward size, I can't imagine it would be good for your wrist.
 Previously I'd purchased the AmazonBasics wired mouse and wanted to clear up some cord clutter.  This wireless option is a joy.  Feels more responsive than the wired model and the transmitter has good range.  I've run the mouse over a variety of surfaces and it's recognized them all.  Highly recommended!<br/><br/>I'm using it on a Mac laptop, left and right click work perfectly.
 Just arrived today. Been messing around with it for the last 20 minutes or so. Plugged the NANO receiver into the USB port and turned on the mouse...instant connection. No lag of any kind. I'm on an Acer notebook, so it's nothing fancy. It clicks and scrolls perfectly. Some have complained of its small size. If you're a serious gamer, I can see that. I use this notebook every now and then, so for casual use (browsing the internet, writing reports, scrolling through pictures), it's perfect.
 Works great, but I do have one big gripe that always happens to me. Whenever you slightly drop the mouse the back comes off and the batteries come out. I wish the back was made a bit sturdier and not as thin so that it would stay in place.
 I've tried several wireless mice and usually had to return them for one reason or another. I finally decided to try again; saw the ratings on this one, took the chance and ordered this one. It's been dropped on the floor a couple of times, sending chills down my spine. Takes a 'licken but keeps on tickin!" Very smooth operation. I'm delighted.
 I liked this remote until it stopped working! I purchased it a little over a year ago (Sep 2016) so maybe that's the life expectancy of this mouse. If so, I won't purchase this brand again! I do like that it doesn't go to "sleep," requiring you to click it to wake it up before you click to use it. But I think it should've lasted longer than 1 year.
 This was shipped to me without the USB connector piece and so it's useless.  What a hassle too to return it, a low cost item like this.  Don't order it!
 Junk. First, I could not see any markings for the batteries, but it was easy enough to figure out. Second, once they were in it was impossible to get the cover to snap back on the mouse. It is cheaply made and not worth the hassle. I am returning it.<br/>I've used Logitech cordless mice for years and never had any problems with battery covers or USB connections. When you can't even get the battery cover to stay on you know it is garbage.
 Great mouse with a really nice feel. Does not feel like cheap plastic. One of the better laptop mice I've used.<br/><br/>4 stars instead of 5 because the range leaves something to be desired. Even 5 or 6 feet away it starts to stutter. If you're buying this as a cheap mouse to throw in a laptop bag then go for it. If you are going to use it during presentations when standing away from your laptop look elsewhere.
 Yay, little mouse! I love you. And you know what I love best about you? Your receiver has a storage spot INSIDE YOUR BELLY! Sweet! I am so happy to have a scroll wheel that works. I love your grippy texture. And I love your size. Your responsiveness is also superb, and I can turn you off so my kids can't mess with you. Your price can't be beat, either! Who knew a mouse could make me so happy? Love you, my sweet mousey, mouse. I hope you will stay by my side for years to come.
 It's a wireless mouse. There's not much to say about it other than it works, well, like a mouse should. I won't bore anyone with the specifications because if you're looking to get this, odds are you are not a gamer and just looking for something simple and inexpensive. Well, this is that. A nice, easy mouse that's inexpensive, comfortable in the hand and works well.
 This mouse has a case of the "wiggles". The cursor movement frequently is off from my movement, making it hard to select things. The casing design feels slightly cheap too. I'm going to order the better one from the big name brand, and toss this one.
 Learned a lesson on Amazonbasics - quality is suspect.  The mouse I purchased doesn't sit on the desk level so it creates an annoying teetering.  Spend the extra $10 for an established name.
 I ordered this as a back up to a slimmer wireless mouse. I took it along with me when we spent a month or so away from home simply as a back up. It turned out that my husband had missed including one with his laptop so my back up was put to immediate use and functioned as described. No complaints at all.
 I purchased this mouse for my daughter, who uses it on both a Chromebook and a notebook running Linux (Fedora, in our case). She was very pleased with it, and the mouse worked perfectly on both machines with no issues whatsoever. So far, it has performed well on all of the surfaces she's used it on: tables (wood, granite, aluminum), the sofa cushion, a magazine, a wide book, and the floor (wood again, as well as ceramic tile). It is light and comfortable to hold, both for her 10-year-old hand and my 40-year old one. I liked the mouse enough to buy a second one for my own use.
 I have purchased many of these both for myself and family members and also to use at work.  You cannot beat the price.  I've yet to have any issues and have had a few for several years.
 it's a small mouse. It's working great now. I've had it for over a month maybe two...At first it was a bit awkward. I'm rather use to a large gamer's mouse ...I prefer this!
 This is my 2nd one in 3 years, the first survived lots of drops. Works well and from a distance, I'm a teacher and I can use it from almost anywhere in my classroom.
 I bought it for the color, which I love.  The mouse works well.  The batteries that came with it lasted for months.  Considering that I never remember to e mouse off, that’s pretty good.  I do use a mousepad with it &amp; think it needs one.
 This inexpensive AmazonBasics wireless replacement mouse for Logitech works perfectly.  However, it's made in China.  Also, original AmazonBasics batteries lasted from 12/1 until I replaced them with rechargeables today 2/9.  Not acceptable.
 This is a really great mouse. I bought one for my laptop, and liked it so much I bought another for the desktop. My laptop runs Windows 7, my desktop is a Mac, so it works perfectly with either operating system. I've had the one for my laptop for over a year, and have yet to replace the batteries in it. I've changed them once on the desktop in six weeks, and that's only because I used a pair of used batteries in it (from the old mouse) initially. (I was replacing the batteries in it every three weeks, and they had about a week to go when I moved the batteries to the new mouse.)
 It's nice-looking, well-made and there is a place to store the transmitter inside for transport.  Great.  BUT ... the front edge of the mouse is too high and my fingers kept hitting it.  I gave it away.  This is to me a design defect when compared with the Logitech and Microsoft mice I've had.  But it might not bother some. (Also, I'd prefer that the body where the thumb rests be rubberized, not hard plastic, but that would not have reduced my rating.)
 My desk is wood a a bit bumpy, and probably is a challenging surface for a mouse to work on.  But my old mouse worked fine on this surface and this one really doesn't work very good.  I'm using a notebook as a mouse pad for now, but will probably buy a better mouse shortly.  Probably should have spent the extra money for a quality product.
 Revised rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.  2nd one where wheel stops working correctly.  Each one worked for about 18 months or so with moderate to light use.  Don't think I'm going back for a 3rd.
 As you can see in the post.... the supplied batteries exploded and ruined the mouse and leaked onto my laptop (set it on top)... and ruined the back of the screen.  Do not buy this dangerous item!!!!
 Perfect. Loaded instantly. Looks good. Works perfectly. Nano Receiver stores conveniently inside the battery compartment for safe keeping. I can only give 4 Stars because this is only a mouse, after all, not a Jet Airliner. 4 Stars is my highest rating for a mouse.
 This is an excellent wireless mouse for a very affordable price.<br/>I discovered, however, that the nano receiver does not act universally with my wireless keyboard so I need to use two.<br/>It is no biggie!<br/>I have never purchased any Amazon Basics item that wasn't quality in workmanship and features.
 Great mouse for the price.  immediately sync'd to laptop adapter. I'm sure batteries have long life if you remember to turn off mouse when not in use.  Would be nice if it turned itself off if motionless for extended period to save battery.
 The feet/sliders on the bottom are slightly uneven, so the mouse wobbles like a chair with one leg too short when I click the left mouse button.  For such a simple thing, this shortcoming is enough to make me wish I had spent $1 more and gotten a different product. Everything else works, but then, that's what I would expect.<br/><br/>Not recommended.  I would not buy this product again.
 It does not work. The mouse is uncontrollable on the screen. I have replaced with a new battery three times. I need a replacement or credit.
 Beware....the laser underneath does NOT work on granite or I'm guessing anything else with a glassy reflective surface.  It may not be a big deal to some but wish I knew this before I bought it. I had a Logitech before this (lost the mouse on the road) and it was fine on my kitchen granite top counter.  This Amazon one NEEDS a piece of paper or something underneath it making it annoying.  I will return it and pay $3 more for one with a tracker that works on a granite countertop. Sorry Amazon...
 Great  mouse at a great price.  Some complain about range....well, if you use it like most people (and I) do, you don't need range as you use it right beside your computer/laptop.  Simple, easy to use, easy to install (plug and go) and a real time/aggravation saver (I purchased an HP Envy laptop with Windows 8 and the darn track pad is a real pain...I had to shut it off).  Thanks Amazon for another excellent and affordable product for a typical (non-gamer) who uses a mouse to surf the net, work on spreadsheets and other mundane tasks.
 This is the second of this exact mouse I have purchased. These save a ton of time if you spend much time on a laptop! It is also very convenient to throw in a pocket or bag to easily take along with your computer. I have have had the first mouse for over a year now and still haven’t changed the batteries.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3FASPF73BHZUG"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91xkGWtPx1S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZjA2Oxr8S.png"/> The pads on the bottom on the mouse aren't raised high enough so the plastic surface ends up rubbing against my mouse pad. Not sure if a defective unit or just present on all AmazonBasic wireless mouses (my AmazonBasic wired mouse doesn't have this problem). Going to have to return unfortunately. Not recommended unless you have a high tolerance for scratchy noises.<br/><br/>Added a video, but I'm not sure if my smartphone properly captures the high frequency from the scratchiness.
 AmazonBasics comes through in the clutch once again.  I was in the middle of a very important project and my cat knocked my mouse off of my desk--obliterating it.  A replacement mouse was $80 (that is not a typo) and I figured I'd try Amazon for an alternative.  The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse worked flawlessly with my iMac straight out of the box.  No set up, no software.  I used Prime same day shipping and I was straight back to work.  Love it.
 So far this seems to work just fine, as described... I like the fact there was no downloading and waiting for computers to recognize mouse, only thing is, with mine I had to make sure batteries were installed correctly because there is something awkward with that plastic retainer inside... stated to put batteries on top of it... but because the way its positioned in there, it made it hard for batteries to make contact... but I still recommend this.
 I bought a second one of these 'cause they are handy to have around.<br/>Works perfectly in Magiea Linux. I would guess that it works in all distros.<br/>It works great on Windows too, after it installs the software.<br/>Why does it take Windows 5 minutes to "install the software"?<br/>It's a friggin' mouse! Not a modem!
 Sometimes at work I have to use a lap top, which doesn't have a mouse.  So I bought this inexpensive mouse just for myself. No seriously, the others can buy their own mouse. It  makes this part of my job a lot easier, twice as easy. It works well, it's durable and the batteries that came with it are still working fine. It's cool!
 Bought this to replace the previous model which was starting to have issues after tons of use and getting dropped/knocked to the floor too many times to count. Works well for me.
 I love this mouse for my laptop! Most I have found for my laptop feel too small in my hand, this one is perfect size for me. It also was easy to set up with no issues! The biggest thing I love about it, is that you can store the usb part in the battery area when not in use. That is HUGE to me!
 The problem is in the USB, it is not sturdy. It came out from its metal shell, so the mouse is not recognized anymore.<br/>So the mouse is not a long lasting one
 I admit I was leery about this product. An Amazon branded mouse? Hmm... But... This mouse is awesome. I'm a very lazy person and had a wireless mouse in bed to do things on my computer as I lay down. My old mouse was unresponsive until I found a sweet spot, and even then was slightly laggy. I saw this cheap mouse as an add-on to an unrelated purchase, and I figured what the heck? It came in Amazon's frustration free packaging, with fully charged batteries and the dinky USB receiver. The nano receiver would be quite easy to lose if you are traveling, but I shan't be. After the drivers for the receiver were installed, I shoved the batteries in and flicked in the on switch. The mouse worked immediately. No time to find the receiver at all. The ultimate test was to be a big fat lazy S.O.B. and flick through Netflix in bed. Again the mouse performed amazingly. No lag, sharp response, and no hunting for a sweet spot. I'd recommend this mouse to anyone.
 no fancy bells or whistles. just a basic mouse. it tracks well and manuevers well.  no complaints.<br/><br/>it is comfortable in the hand, buttons click easily.  it has a slight weight to it, so it feels well made and durable.<br/><br/>the nano receiver stores in the battery compartment.  thats nice when storing the mouse for longer periods of time. no losing the reciever in a drawer or something.  the storage slot is at a bit of an angle so it can take some wiggling to get it in right.  not a big deal considering the price of this mouse.<br/><br/>i am very happy with it, especially the price!
 It's not the best mouse in the world and certainly not as fine tuned as other mice are in terms of using on not-so-flat surfaces. Still,so far it is holding up and I have already dropped it a few times. Unlike another mouse I had, it didn't start getting the least bit wonky on me. This is good as a backup mouse for when you get a crappy mouse or if your mouse you've had since forever in a day suddenly flat-lined one day. Unless you arelucky enough to have a desk area, I would not recommend this mouse.
 I have a laptop with A touchpad that is very sensitive and a husband with big fingers. He was so frustrated trying to use the touchpad and touch screen and begged for a mouse. I didn't want to pay much for one and found this one. It's price is no indication of its performance. It's very easy to set up and use and comes with everything you need. Go ahead and hit buy now, you won't regret it.
 I bought this and was pretty disappointed in the quality of the product.  I love amazon but this is not one of their stellar products.  This broke within the first week of me using it.  The bottom piece would not stay latched and I had to tape it to keep it closed.  The tape then stopped me from being able to glide this mouse across my desk.  I threw it out a bought a slightly more expensive one that has worked fine every since.
 This mouse is a champ.  I was looking for a cheap mouse to use at work, and it works perfectly for that. It connects to my laptop easily (I usually just keep the small USB connector in my computer).  If I do take the USB connector out, there is a spot in the mouse to store it so it doesn't get lost.  I usually try to turn the mouse off when I leave work, but I have forgotten a couple of nights, and even over a weekend and it is still going strong.  I have had this mouse for a month now, and the batteries have not run out.  I was pleasantly surprised!
 I purchased this mouse to use with an old laptop computer I restored back to use. The laptop was the first one that I purchased ten years ago. It came with Windows Vista and finally died. After repairing it in October and replacing the original hard drive with an SSD, I installed Linux Mint. It runs fine now and the mouse works as expected.
 When offered a choice, I frequently buy AmazonBasics.  I have found these products to be universally high quality without indulging in unnecessary frills.  This mouse fits neatly into the category.  I have had it for a couple of months now.  I travel with it and use it in a wide variety of environments.  It works on all kinds of surfaces, stands up to the hard knocks of travel and reliably gets the job done.  Great product.
 I got this mouse for my grandma's computer and ibhave yet to replace the battery in it!!  The price can't be beat for this mose and I am in awe at how long it lasts with one original battery!!  Mouse works great, has an on and off button on it that you can use to keep it turned off when traveling, but when computer is in sleep mode it turns off the milo use anyways so you don't have to worry about it being on all the time.
 I've only had this mouse for a day, but I love it! Easy to set up. Literally, it takes less than a minute. It's smaller than a normal mouse, but I actually prefer that. Moves very smoothly across my mousepad. If I had to say anything negative about this mouse, it would be that the clicking is louder than my wire mouse. Other than that, it's a great wireless mouse for the price!
 I wish I could find where I put this mouse because I absolutely loved it! I lost the battery backing and I don’t think it connected to my laptop after a while.
 I loved the first Amazon basic mouse that I had, and it lasted for years. But when I got its replacement sadly it only made it four months before the receiver stopped working. The USB insertion is detected by my computer, but somehow the receptor us unable to detect the mouse input. It's disappointing to have to order another mouse so soon after this one.
 I just received this in the mail, and spent an entire hour trying to get it to work. I finally gave up and called Amazon, to get a refund. This is nothing more than a cheap piece of junk.
 Connects easily and works great. This is the second one I've purchased (lost the usb connector to the first one, then later found it on a shelf...) The only con to this mouse are that the back comes off/falls off easily (a design issue, but a very minor one considering price and how well it works).
 Stopped working after a few weeks honestly. I know I could have returned it and asked for a new one but I just tossed it as I haven't had any luck with cordless mice on my macbook. Instead, I opted for a USB mouse (link: http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-Button-Wired-Mouse-Black/dp/B005EJH6RW?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_16) instead and have had ZERO problems.
 Haven't had any problems with product; just a little small for my hand. Only complaint.<br/><br/>Well, I now have a complaint. This thing runs through batteries like ex-lax through a goose. I've already had to replace them 4 times.<br/>It has a turn off switch but it's really hard to remember to use it.
 I originally gave this mouse three stars. It turns out the problem I was having was not the result of the mouse, it was the result of a bad installation of the Operating System on my machine. Once I did a complete fresh install the problem went away. I have now owned this mouse for a little over a year and I have absolutely no complaints. It has finally died but that's the life span I seem to have with mice, no matter what the price is, or which name brand I use. They get a lot of use, dropped and knocked around. I've had mice that cost a lot more than this did and didn't last as long. If you're looking for an inexpensive mouse that works and works well, you will not go wrong with sticking with this one. I will be ordering another one to replace the one that just died.<br/><br/>The only real issue I have with this mouse is that it is causing feedback in the speakers to my laptop. Every time I move the mouse I get a hum from the speakers. I will be replacing it ASAP.
 I bought this item in good faith, thinking it was a good value. It has poor build quality, and terrible performance. I actually thought there was something wrong with the first one I got. I returned it for a second item, which performed worst than the first. I do not recommend this to my worst enemy!
 The design of this mouse is very nice. It is easy to maneuver and the cursor indicator lights up when the mouse is on which is very good for 1st install and battery saving. It comes with two AAA batteries already included which I thought was plus because normally you have to buy your own. The only con is that Amazon sent this mouse without the USB so I have the inconvenience of having to send it back.
 Great inexpensive mouse (though it doesn't seem to have an auto-off feature, which it really needs); but, the little dongle that sits in the USB port of my inexpensive HP 15 Laptop (AMD A8, Win10) causes the USB ports on that side of the laptop to shut down. Not hard to get them back, but too hard. So I use a wired mouse now, when I use a moue at all.
 This mouse is just right. I don't find it too small for the palm of my hand (5'5" asian with regular size hands) and it is very responsive to my mouse movements. There are no perceptible delays and the click functions all work without unnecessary force or re-clicking of buttons.  I especially like the on/off switch on the bottom which allows me to save battery life when I know I won't be using it. In fact, I just ordered a 2nd one so that I can keep one in my office and at the home office.
 Received a defective mouse. The left mouse button did not working properly. I posted a question about problems with this mouse and I got one customer response that their mouse worked fine and one person who had many problems and had to return their mouse. The style and feel of the mouse is excellent, but that doesn't mean much if it doesn't work right. I am returning mine and will purchase another brand. Typically AmazonBasics products are great, but this one seems to have some glitches.
 I'm very picky when it comes to mice, and I seem to be having some terrible luck finding one that matches what I want. This one didn't fit at all.<br/><br/>1) It's very small. If you have long fingers or big hands, your hands will start to hurt after moderate use.<br/>2) Tracking is extremely inaccurate, jumpy, and stuttery. You'll notice the cursor freezing and teleporting all over every few minutes. People say it's interference, but I've tried a ton of different configurations, and nothing helped.<br/>3) Batteries die within 2-3 months, so get used to buying AAA batteries.
 This mouse is very well made. It has a matte surface for buttons and top that naturally gives that grip, without sticky feeling, to make precision possible. It is responsive and everything seems to be nicely spaced and placed.<br/><br/>My only issue is a small one. The on/off switch looks like a calling card for: I was made in China.<br/><br/>I feel bad taking a whole star because really it should be 4 1/2.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product to anybody looking for a high quality mouse for laptops.
 Only lasted 8 months.  Not a fancy mouse but did what I needed it to do.  Compact size is great for my standing desk since I don't have a lot of space.  I have a bigger Logitech that is 4 years old that still works.  Will have to go back to that.
 I use this with an IBM laptop with windows 10, works great and is easy to travel with. It comes with a compartment for the usb adaptor built in so you don’t have to keep them away from each other. The battery compartment is fairly easy to get to and it lasts a while.
 I use a laptop for programming and I'm not a fan of touchpads so I bought this mouse. The mouse works great. The only problem that some of you may face is that it runs kinda small. Besides that this is a great affordable mouse that lasts.
 I ordered this because the wheel on my other mouse stopped working after a couple of years. This wheel never worked correctly and now it's almost stopped scrolling entirely. Just spend a few more bucks to get something that work.
 This mouse is awesome to use! I recently got this mouse to replace a wireless mouse which stopped working. Amazon Basics did a great job with their wireless mouse. I use this mouse mostly with a stainless stee mouse pad, however, I have also used the mouse with other surfaces such as magazines, and even flat table surfaces and it works well! I especially like the size, ergonomics in the palm of the hand, and speed of the mouse cursor.
 A BIG fan of AmazonBasics. Though a bit more expensive than a few of the other, fancier appearing units - I trust I will not have to return the Amazon Basic products. Amazon screened out the junk for you. "Buy Cheap, Buy Twice!" Highly recommend. Even my 10 year old son searches for and chooses AmazonBasics products !<br/><br/>Albert<br/>(...)<br/>"prescription pain relief, without the doctor visit"
 I bought this mouse to use in my college classroom so that we could control PowerPoint presentations from the podium across the room or other locations away from the computer. It works every time, no glitches. At the end of class, I unplug it and take it with me. Super easy.
 AmazonBasics wireless mouse works perfectly. Tracks perfectly on our laptop. I like the on /off feature, you just have to get<br/>used to turning it off. The "on" light is on the bottom of the mouse like a lot of mouses so you don't have a reminder that it is still on when you are done with computing. Once you get used to it it's routine to turn it off. Also it is nice to have a shorter USB receiver.<br/>It doesn't get hung up on everything like our longer receiver did as you move around. Good buy. I recommend it
 Turns on occasionally but will not connect to my computer and work after about 6 months. I got a Jelly Comb around the same time and it is still working.
 Was great while it lasted. Mouse or receiver stopped working after only 3 months (took me a while to get around to writing this review). Initially the mouse functioned great and was the perfect size for me (big hands). Nothing fancy, just a simple and "Basic" mouse which was great for me. I enjoyed the height of the mouse which kept my wrist straighter than with other mice (or is it mouses? mouse?).
 I've been using this for almost a month now. I used it to replace my wired mouse at work, so I am using it everyday for at least 5-8 hours. I try to remember to turn it off before I leave at night, but I've forgotten more than a handful of times, and yet, I'm still using the same batteries it came with.<br/><br/>It's very responsive and it's about the perfect size for my hand- a little smaller than the Dell wired mouse that came with my work computer, but a little bigger than my other wireless mouse I use for my laptop. My office desk has that really shiny fake wood laminate on it, which as caused problems for some of my optical mouses in the past, but this one never misses a beat.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say the perks of this mouse are:<br/>-The price! Like all AmazonBasics products, it's inexpensive.<br/>-Seems to use power very efficiently<br/>-Reliability: never hesitates or loses track on the screen
 My first one stopped working after about 12 hours of use. It seems the wireless receiver (from Home Mouse) crossed signals w a different wireless receiver (Work Mouse) and then stopped working. I asked for a replacement and got it. I now only keep one wireless receiver plugged in at a time. No problems since.
 Hubby loves his new mouse  ...  he's been using corded mouse since he started using a computer  ..  wire is a nuisance  ...  now he can keep other things on his desk!!  Great buy  ..  small price!!  AAA+++
 Great value,  good mouse, easy connect to Windows and MAC.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/>Connected quickly and with no issues.<br/>Buttons and scroll wheel have a nice tactical feel.  Buttons provide good click feel without a loud click sound.<br/>Size is good - compact for portability, large enough for comfort.<br/><br/>Improvement suggested:<br/>Plastic on the sides is too smooth and feels "greasy" even when new and used with very clean hands.  Suggest more texture on plastic to make this a better user experience.<br/><br/>Overall I prefer the Logitech M305, but this is an excellent value and it works better than expected for a basic device.
 Short lived.  Works great when it works.  My first one died after about a year, and was replaced under warranty.  The replacement had problems after a little over a month, and was not replaced when it failed.  I found an equal or better quality mouse for a lower price on Amazon, the TeckNet 2.4G Nano Wireless Mouse.  I can't really recommend the AmazonBasics Wireless mouse based on my experience with it.
 I wanted a wireless mouse for my laptop because I really hate the new mouse pads that Dell and Lenovo are using. I bought this and it arrived in two days.  I opened the mouse, took out the USB key, put in the batteries and it begain working immediatly. I didn't even have to press the connect button.  It feels good, works on nearly any surface and does not lose connection. I like it so well I bought a second for my work laptop which is on a docking station and previously had a wired mouse. Good unit at a good price. I recommend it.
 The mouse operates well, but the battery life is horrible.  It requires two AAA (triple A) batteries and this gives the mouse about a two-week operating life.  I would recommend purchasing another mouse.
 Perfect, synced right up with no issues and I can leave the receiver in my Toughbook and close the port cover when I need to take laptop. Works perfectly and for the price you can not beat it.
 It's Smaller than what I expect and vulnerable to a MouseJack keystroke injection attack.<br/><br/>Update: after 18 month and right after using it on both my laptop and Android box the USB wireless start getting bad connectivity to the devices. Having me plug and unplug it several times to get it to work.<br/>Also the right click button is faulty.
 I bought one of these before and it did great but they have changed the quality and the second one I bought died after three days! DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!
 super annoying experience. The little USB chip that you have to plug in, annoying. The one off switch rather than auto on and off, annoying. The little plastic sheet like acetate that pulls out the batteries and gets in the way of the hard to remove usb chip, annoying. When you decide to go wireless it's to avoid the hassles, not to recreate them in a new format.
 I love the AmazonBasics brand for all the - well - basic items they put out. This mouse is a prime example. Easy to set up, comfortable and easy to use. I've purchased two already, and I'm very happy with them. My only gripe is that the battery life isn't quite what I'd like - I find I'm replacing the batteries every month or two, but I do use the mouse heavily and I don't turn it off at night. But overall, I'm happy with it.
 I've purchased TWO of these mouses from Amazon and both times they have stopped working after a few months. Both times I have tried multiple methods to get the mouse working again. I've changed the batteries, tested multiple sets of batteries, removed and reinserted the receiver, turned the mouse off/on several times and it will not work. I've also troubleshooted on my computer and explored my mouse driver / settings.<br/><br/>This has left me in situations without a mouse where I desperately needed one for the work I was doing.<br/><br/>I would NOT buy and spend a few dollars on a different, more reliable mouse.
 Works as it should but battery placement is difficult to deal with , it takes 2 AAA batteries that are on a 45 degree angle that install in opposing directions with a piece of plastic that is supposed to aid in battery removal , I almost tore it out thinking it was to be removed to allow the batteries to work and the on off switch can only be turn on or off with a finger nail, ( very tiny) and hard to see, a good value and it works well.
 I bought this mouse to use with my surveillance System DVR.  The wireless dongle allowed me to eliminate the corded mouse and to relocate the DVR to a more discrete location.  The mouse is well constructed and performs exactly as expected.  No drivers were needed to make the mouse functional, and batteries were included.
 Came on time, included a pair of Amazon batteries.<br/><br/>It's been a year and it's still like new. Feels nice in the hand (i'm a graphic designer and I depend on this feature a lot) and if you turn it off when you're not using it, your batteries will last forever.
 Bought a couple for a friend who wanted something on the cheap.  Had two of these break down after about a month or two... spend a couple extra bucks to get a more reliable brand. The logitect I'm using now is over 5 years old and still running like a champ.
 I bought this mouse in June, 2016.  It kept shutting itself off, even while in use.  I returned it shortly after the 30 day return period expired - too late for a refund, so another was shipped.  The replacement was defective out of the box.  Like the original, it kept shutting off even when in use.  I returned it and have asked for e refund.  No response to my request.  Yes, the product is inexpensive - but it is not worth any price!  Just a hassle.  Have now replaced it with a Logitech, which is working great. I am out the purchase price for the original Amazon mouse.
 I've used this for 4 months now. It works well for everyday use, but over time it has given me hand pain. I'm certain this is because the mouse is too small, your hand has nothing to rest on. In fact, I find that when I'm using the mouse, the only part of my hand touching it is my fingertips because if you fully rest the hand on the mouse, your fingers will extend past the buttons. So you have to use it in this uncomfortable position. Another thing is that I believe the accuracy or DPI is low. When I am editing images and need to move the cursor on the screen just 1 pixel, it usually skips and moves 2 or 3 pixels at a time. It gets frustrating when you need to edit images. I am going to change to an ergonomic mouse. Yeah, they're usually big and ugly, but at least I won't get carpel tunnel.
 Needed a basic mouse, and this fits the bill. I don’t use it daily, but it’s nice to pull out and use when I’m going to be on laptop a lot that day.
 This is a great mouse.  Just had the batteries die on me today for the first time, so they lasted for a couple months but they were the cheapo batteries that it came with.  I used to have pain in my wrist from the way I used the corded mouse but now i have the freedom to use it in different positions and my pain has gone away.  Great product for the price.
 I just received my mouse, plugged it in, and it works like a hose! The perfect size and feel, even for my large hands. And under twelve bucks? There must've been a mistake! (I ordered a second one immediately for my laptop:-) Assuming it holds up, and I'm not worried about it based on the reviews, chances are I won't need another mouse for a long time. I might add that it works flawlessly with Linux Mint 17.1.  I love the very small "nano" USB interface. Thanks, Amazon!
 This mouse died a few weeks after I got it. Changed the batteries multiple times.  Extremely frustrating. Total waste of money. I rather spend more on a quality mouse.
 So the first one I got stopped working properly after about a month.  It seemed that the laser was having trouble syncing and I would get sporadic movements and could not get a smooth transition.  Since it was past the month I couldn't return it, but contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one and I'm sending the defective one back.  Overall very pleased with it, although I'd recommended making sure you also have a good mousepad.
 I love it!! I'm a college student, so it's super easy for me to just stick it in my backpack or purse when I need it with my laptop and keep goin! It feels really comfortable to use too, the clicks are very satisfying. The mouse lasted me for a year, I developed a bad habit of leaving the usb part in my computer, so it bent after a while and stopped working...I've learned my lesson and i'm definitely buying another one!
 It's super laggy and jumpy.  It makes using it absolutely miserable.  It will randomly just drop connection and I'll lose whatever I'm trying to drag.  It also seems to be a bit smaller than other options on the market.
 This is the first wireless mouse I've tried, and it may be the last. In less than two weeks it started to randomly turn off. I have to use the switch on the bottom to turn it off and on again for it to work every time. It's pretty much turned into a useless paperweight. I guess I'll go back to a wired mouse.
 I am a fan of AmazonBasics stuff - Including this mouse, I have a micro usb cable, a battery pack, a travel case and earphones. If there is a product I like, I check there is an AmazonBasic's equivalent and so far, they have been better quality than ones I used to have. One rub against this (although its not enough to lower my rating), is that I wish it had a rechargeable option.
 The size of the mouse is fine, but I hated the resistance to click the mouse. It takes a startling amount of pressure to click the mouse, and if you are clicking around a lot (spreadsheet or whatever) it gets uncomfortable. I ended up purchasing a Microsoft mouse and was much happier.
 We received our Roku 3 about 2 weeks ago and couldn't be happier.  Although I'm not at all familiar with previous versions, the Roku 3 is super fast and really easy to navigate.  It is especially nice to be able to watch Netflix on our old tv, without having to upgrade to a smart, wi-fi capable tv.  Set-up was extremely easy and took about 5 minutes - and I'm not tech savvy at all (more like tech stupid).  Make sure sure you order the HDMI cable for installation and you'll quickly be watching your favorite movies.  A great purchase for us!
 There is nothing spectacular about this mouse, except that it does what a mouse should do, and that's all that I really want a mouse to do. The wheel functions very well, it tracks over any surface I've used it on so far. and the batteries don't seem to run out of juice at an extraordinary rate. I don't know why I suffered through a crummy touch pad for so long without this little friend.
 I was turned on to Amazon basics recently and haven't looked back.  Its the first place I go to for peripherals or miscellaneous electronic items.  Things like lightning cables, USB cables, chargers, etc.  Needed a mouse for work and figured I'd look to see if there was a Amazon basics one.  Lo and behold its one of the better selling ones on the site.<br/><br/>Connected right away.  Love the click.  Smooth.  Comfortable.  Sleek looking.  Can't ask for anything more at its price point.
 I was looking for a simple wireless mouse to use at work since I hate using the trackpad. I came across this product after searching for a bit and decided to try it out, since I had used AmazonBasics products in the past.<br/><br/>The things I like about this product are the look and feel of the mouse. It glides really well on a desk without a mousepad and the top of the mouse is really smooth to the touch. I also like that I can store the wireless receiver inside the mouse instead of having to carry it around with me.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great product. I've used many Logitech and Microsoft mouses in the past, and this one is on par with their products but for only a fraction of the cost.
 Worked well over ~3 years. Responsive. Worked well under Linux and Windows. Biggest complaint is the scroll wheel. Eventually it lost its tension and didn't really work. A bit smaller than a normal mouse, but overall reliable and fine.
 Looking for a wireless mouse due to my almost seething hatred of all things cords, I settled with the AmazonBasics wireless mouse for two reasons: 1) It was a lot cheaper than the other's I looked at (Logitech, Microsoft) and 2) I'm a Amazon fanboy - They have super low prices, free two day shipping and great customer service, this is my way of thanking them by buying their own products.<br/><br/>And what a great mouse this is! I was afraid it would be uncomfortable to use, but the exact opposite! It's got a really nice smooth feel to it and definitely is comfortable to use for hours at a time (if you're always online like myself :D). Thank you Amazon, for continuing to earn my loyalty and trust with your services. Perfect price for a perfect mouse!
 You get what you pay for.<br/><br/>It worked well, until it didn't. The receiver didn't connect well with USB ports, so I had to constantly nudge it, and it got to the point where it had to be held in place in order to work at all. That took less than a month to occur. I ended up replacing it with a brand name wireless mouse (the same I use for my desktop, actually), and have had no problems with that one.
 This is a sturdy, compact and durable mouse. It does everything I need it to do at an affordable price. It's a good value and I would purchase it again.
 You can never go wrong with Amazon Basics.  I use Amazon basics on a lot of things that I buy for myself or my kids.  Mouse is nice, but I will do an update after I've used it for a while.  My scrolling button on my old mouse wasn't working as well, so I upgraded to this one.
 This is a great mouse. It's small, and it feels very good. Only thing that would make it a five-star is if it were sort of like the Apple Mouse where are you could do finger touch controls on the top of the mouse but other than that it's a great mouse.
 I've been using this mouse for about 4 months and have been very pleased. However, I've recently started experiencing some problems with it. The USB receiver keeps disconnecting no matter which USB port I have it in. I have to push it very firmly back into place and sometime wiggle it around for a minute in order to get it to work again. Mostly this happens when I accidentally bump it, even very lightly, or if I move my laptop around on my desk. Luckily, it's a rare occurrence as I am at a desk all day, but I imagine it would be quite irritating otherwise. Overall, it's a decent product for the price.
 I love this mouse and the packaging is very nice and compact. The only issue I encountered was missing Nano receiver as I first thought. After searching for the part everywhere, thinking that it just slipped away, I realized that Nano receive is inside the battery compartment. It is easy to miss and the only way I figured out was through the instructions booklet that stated this fact. If you are like me and think your package is missing the Nano receiver, check the battery compartment where it is stuck right in the middle.
 This is my second mouse.  It uses a wireless usb thingy (really small) to connect, and I thought i'd get a bluetooth one so I wouldn't need the dongle.  I went back to this one, and bought a second one for another computer because of the ease.  It just works.  Connects, no lag.  And super cheap.  The bluetooth mice I tried would have to reconnect at times, lag out, and seemed to use battery faster.
 Very nice. For me, the perfect size. It's small but not tiny. Nice ergonomic design... plug and play kind of deal... the only gripe I had with it was the fact that the original batteries it comes with (amazon basics batteries) died in about a week.<br/><br/>Also, be sure to turn it off when not in use. I'm pretty sure leaving it on for the weekend might have had something to do with the batteries going dead so fast, but hey... what are you gonna do right?<br/><br/>Amazon, how about a automatic turn off after X hours function?
 Absolutely perfect! I have a small Insignia netbook computer that only has one slot for a USB... I use that for the charger, and really needed a wireless mouse to work wit this unit.  This mouse is PERFECT for my needs!
 Too small and flat, I found I had to bend my hand in an uncomfortable position to use this.  I like my logitech wireless better as it is more oh a round bump, not flat and wide like this one, giving it a better feeling in my hand during use.
 the mouse seems to work properly, but i would not buy the same item again,, it does not fit my hand properly, yyou have to get your finger way to the end of the movable "clicker"  sectionother wise the switch action is very KLUNKY<br/><br/>I would return it but not sure any of the others are any better,, this being an "Amazon" product, you know that one of the other mfr's white labels it for amazon, The picture is identical to others,,
 The design couldn't be simpler: unpack it, insert the batteries, and plug the USB receiver into your computer (in my case, an iMac). The mouse worked immediately, without even needing to press the small "connect" button on the bottom. That said, the left and right buttons have very different tactile feedback, and unfortunately in this case the left button (which I use 95% of the time) is mushy. The right button has a nice clear "click" feeling, but it's hard to tell when I've clicked the left button.<br/>I'm hoping it will loosen up (in a good way) and I'll start to get more tactile feedback on the left button, but for now I'm not thrilled. My aging Logitech notebook mouse has better feedback.
 I purchased two of these, one for a PC and one for a Mac. The mouse I used with the PC suddenly stopped working after a few weeks. The mouse I bought for my MacBook worked well for about 5 months and then became "flaky," working one minute and not working the next. I replaced the batteries (of course), which made no difference to the problem. I gave up, threw them both out, and bought a cheap wired mouse.
 This mouse is too small.  It should say "travel size" in the description.<br/><br/>I bought this mouse partially based on a previous reviewer saying it was comfortable for the reviewer's "medium-to-large size hands".  I do not have large hands and this mouse is uncomfortably small.  Very disappointing.<br/><br/>I give it 4 stars as I see nothing wrong with the mouse other than it's size.  Funny that the size is not in the description since small size was obviously a design goal.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you work at your computer for more than an hour per day, don't buy this small mouse.  You want and need a full-size mouse.  If you are for a small mouse for a small child, then you may want to buy this mouse.
 This mouse causes the cursor to jump all over the page when it feels like it. It's just sitting there on a stable surface, and decides to roam around on your computer screen, even opening pages up sometimes. It's very hard to control when you use it in situations like doing a jigsaw puzzle online where you need to use it regularly. It's VERY FRUSTRATING.  I've only had it a month or two, and should have returned it as soon as I had tried it, but I thought it might improve, and my other mouse was broke.
 I've owned two of these.  One had receiver problems within a year.  So, I ordered another.  And within a year, the scroll wheel started to stick.<br/><br/>The price is okay.  I guess if you spend $10 for a mouse for a year it's not the end of the world.  But I'm tired of the problems.  Going with a better mouse next time.
 I've used many... By Logitech, Microsoft, OEMs... After using this, I'd be hard pressed to pay more. It works great, feels good. Installed the batteries, plugged the receiver into a Win 7 machine, turned the mouse on, waited a minute for Win 7 to self-install the drivers and was off and running. As close to true "plug and play" as you can get. One caveat: It's a little on the smaller side... Smaller than a standard MS mouse... Folks with larger hands or wanting a substantial surface to grasp might not be pleased as I was.
 This cooler works great I don't know why the negatives reviews maybe most of them people don't know how to really use the device, the design is great you have about 3 fan speed and you don't even use because with the first is more than enough quality it's great very good performance I'm very happy with the purchase I didn't upload pictures because there's a lot already.
 So tired of being connected via a USB cable so I bought this for my work computer.  This wireless works great, will probably by another one for my home computer.  Had to pay extra $10 for the color, I don't get that, but I could have just went with black and saved some pennies.Oh well, it's pretty!
 So I bought this when the receiver<br/>for my Logitech broke.<br/>The Azn Basics is not as responsive<br/>as the Ltech, it also take longer to<br/>respond when booting up.<br/>For very basic needs its okay.
 This is my go to mouse for everyday use, not just at home either. The dongle that plugs into your computer is small enough that you can leave it plugged into your notebook and still shove the computer in a laptop bag, case or backpack and bring the mouse with you. I use it with a Macbook Pro in both Windows 7 and Mac OS 10.9 with zero compatibility issues. I turn it off every day after about 8-9 hours of use and the batteries easily last a couple months. All around a good buy.
 It's a mouse. Works like most, Tracks and scrolls fine. Has an off-on switch on the base, which is nice. Comes with AAA batteries and connects right up to a Mac. About the same size as the Logitech I just had to throw in the trash that only lasted 9 months. Hope this Amazon wireless mouse lasts longer.
 If had several of these for work and home. They work well enough when they work, but several have died on my in less than a year. Amazon has been good about honoring the warranty, but don;t expect this to last long.
 Mouse works fine, however, batteries were a bugger getting in. And now, six months after buying this mouse, the "long life" batteries need replacing for a second time (and I'm not one to leave the mouse switched on all the time).<br/>I think if someone tried to design a difficult in and out for battery installation, they'd win first prize with this one.
 I was looking for a mouse to use with my MacBook Air, but I didn't want to pay $70 for a MagicMouse, so I decided to try out this Amazon Basics mouse, as I've been happy with many Amazon Basics products in the past. It's the perfect size for my small hands, it connects immediately and never loses connection, and it tracks beautifully. I'm very happy I decided to go with this mouse. Other reviews have complained about the batteries being inserted weird - they do go in at an angle, but as long as you follow the printed instructions, it really isn't that difficult. Highly recommended!
 I love this mouse.  It is simple enough to use for my 89 year old husband.  I also like the fact that there is no more cords to deal with.  The mouse fits nicely in the hand as well as fits nicely in my pocket when I am moving the laptop from one place to another.  I would buy this mouse again when needed.
 This is a really good mouse. As other reviews have said, putting in the batteries is a little weird as it isn't easily marked, but I figured it out and it works great. Hopefully it will last longer than Logitech mice. After going through three Logitech mice in a very short period of time, I decided to make the switch to a different manufacturer. If this mouse is still working in six months, I'll be very happy.
 amazon does it again this is a sick mouse, to all the people who wonder if it works with a tablet, YES IT DOES AND VERY WELL, HERE IS THE THING WHEN YOU USE THE BLUETOOTH MOUSE IT MESS UP THE SIGNAL ON TO MANY BLUETOOTHS DEVICES, SO HAVING A NANO WIRELESS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO WITH A TABLET, MY TABLET IS A TAGITAL 10.1 FROM AMAZON GET IT WITH THIS MOUSE AND THE K480 KEYBOARD AND YOU HAVE A TABLET COMPUTER THIS IS SICK IM SO HAPPY WITH AMAZO THX YOU GUYS LOVE YOU TOOK CARE OF BIG G
 It was impossible to figure out how to get the batteries in - until we watched a YouTube video posted by a 13-year-old.  Now it works fine - but it is way too small for a normal-sized adult hand.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you are getting it for a child.
 I bought this mouse back in September to replace a Microsoft mouse that I had for a year, loved it, but gave it to my brother so I needed to purchase another. I thought this would be the answer and it came with the batteries, which in my mind, eliminated the competition. However, now the nano receiver is stuck in my computer and I will not be able to remove it without using pliers. I am quite disappointed in this mouse. I'll have to buy another but I think I'll just go back to Microsoft.
 Worst USB wireless mouse I have ever purchase. Buyer beware. You get what you pay for. That is all I am saying. This is truly a POS. It does not connect half the time, unless you unplug, then re-plug the USB, which renders it's use completely nonsensical. I would also check compatibility, because technically this item was not compatible with my computer. It will work, but most of the functions will render finicky, causing you to desire to throw it down, and destroy the item before you even return this. Not a good buy.
 Very simple and does the job. I didn't give it five stars because it's on the small side. This would be perfect for children!
 This mouse worked well. It is bigger than it looks and makes my hand tired.
 This is the fourth mouse like this we've bought.  The first one is still in use at the desktop.  The second one is use with another laptop.  The third one, meant for this laptop, got misplaced in a move and only recently turned up.  In the meantime I bought the fourth one to use.  All, including the oldest one with several years use and one battery change, are functioning well.
 Great mouse, does the job, and even comes with batteries!<br/><br/>The surface is not too smooth so your fingers don’t slip off the mouse and misclick.<br/><br/>It’s not TOO small, so it doesn’t hurt my hand at all.
 This is great wireless mouse. The mouse is basic, just your two button mouse with a scroll wheel. We've had this mouse for one month and use it daily. Very easy to setup. We plugged in the USB receiver and within a minute it was up and running. The mouse feels great. The size and shape are good. The mouse is very responsive and always does what we want it to do. If you need a wireless mouse and don't need all of the extra buttons and features, this mouse is a great choice. I'd buy it again.
 I love this mouse. It's small but isn't uncomfortable to use. Lightweight and compact, and the battery life is good. I like that the wireless connector is stored in the battery compartment, I doubt I will ever lose it because of this feature. It connects very well, no problems in skipping or anything. It's nice and sensitive. I wish the clicking was a tad less loud, but it is still much quieter than most brands. The feel of this mouse is fantastic, the material they used is great. The scroll is very quiet also. Overall an awesome product, I highly recommend it.
 It washes my clothes, does my dishes, tutors me in math, and goes out and turns on my car for me on cold mornings, and tells me I'm not fat and I deserve a pint of cookies and cream.  Oh wait, it's not 2076 yet? Oops.  Mouse, delete the post.
 The mouse was fine while it lasted, but it stopped working only a couple months past the warranty expiration. To be fair, it was decently priced, easy to use, and it worked well within the warranty timeframe, so it deserves some stars. However, I purchased a newer better-rated replacement for the same price. I would not repurchase this mouse nor recommend it to others.
 I had a wireless mouse on a PC a while back and it had a bulky receiver with a long wire connecting to the computer.  This is almost as good as an Apple device with the little receiver that plugs into an open USB slot.
 I wouldn't buy this item again as it is too unreliable. The cursor jumps all over the place. First I tried inserting the USB antenna in a port on the back of my desktop computer. Then, thinking that I was getting interference, I tried a USB port on the front. Still the same. Now, I have the antenna on a USB extension cable and it sits on the desk-top, less than a foot from the mouse and the cursor still periodically jumps all over the place. Thank goodness I didn't throw away my old, wired mouse.
 I've used this mouse for over 2 years and don't have any problems with it. They don't need a mouse pad, but maybe because my desk at work is good enough. Also I like that it gives a blinking light when battery is low so I can replace it before they die completely. Working without a mouse in my field of work is a nightmare, so that's an important feature for me. 2 AAA batteries last me 3 to 4 months.
 Perfect size, not too fast, not too slow.  Just right.<br/><br/>Update: After about 18 months, the mouse died. I went from 5 stars to 4 stars. I still recommend this mouse. I replace it with a Logitech which I don't like as much (same size and probably the manufacture of the AmazonBasics model). Will likely order another AmazonBasics as a back-up. I do expect 2 years from a mouse but you can't beat Amazon's price!
 pretty cool. Works well as a mouse. I'd give it a 5 except the battery cover fell off several times until I made a point of jamming it in extra tight. Never had that issue with a mouse. But once I did that, this is a sporty mouse, solidly built, and was plug-and-play with a Chromebook.
 work great on my Mac for about a drop in the bucket as far as cost. Using it right now.
 My wife has been using this and claims that it is just a little too easy to click. In other words when she is just holding it to move the mouse around, she accidentally clicks the buttons. Other than that it has no connection issues and is not a battery eater as my wife never switches it off and has not replaced the original batteries yet after a couple of months.
 About 6 months after I ordered the mouse, it stopped working consistently.  I changed the batteries.  It would work for a bit, then stop.  I'd remove the USB device and plug it back in, the mouse would work for a while, then stop.  I'd take out the batteries and put them back in... the mouse would work for a while, then stop.  I've had enough.  It's still under the Amazon 1 year warranty so I am returning it.
 Absolute worst mouse I have ever used.  Constantly disconnects, and does not function smoothly when it does work.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Logitech.....lesson learned, never again.
 I bought this back in December, and here it is 5 months later, and I finally had the batteries conk out on me.<br/><br/>This is a good little mouse. It was super easy to get it paired to my computer. The buttons and the scroll wheel all function smoothly, and I've not had one issue with it since the day it arrived. Really happy with the price and performance.
 Functional, performs well, soft-touch coating on the top and sides. Reliable connectivity. Inexpensive.  If I could find a criticism, i'd wish it took one battery, instead of two. However, the two (2) AAA's were included, which is nice.  I'd buy this again.
 Fantastic mouse.  Solid structure, and comfortable texture.  Kinda small, probably wouldn't be as comfortable for someone with very large hands.  I was able to plug and play with it, not difficult set up or connections.
 Favourite mouse for on the go<br/>I was looking for a small basic mouse to use with my mac air 13, and had the chance to use targus and microsoft. and since i am very specific when it comes to my tech, i didn't like the feel of both, noisy clicks and bulky mouses. also the uncomfortable plastic.<br/>i took a chance with this one, and i got to say loved it since i used it for the first time. it is small in size but very comfortable. with great texture feel and smooth use.<br/><br/>I recommend it for anyone looking for small basic mouse that offers the best bang for the buck.
 Pros<br/>- Plug &amp; use right away<br/>- Feels smooth, click buttons and mouse wheel don't feel cheap<br/>- Has a sleep mode to save power, but you don't even notice it was asleep when you start using it again<br/>- Comes with 2 batteries (may not be easy to find when you get your package, but they're there)<br/>- Doesn't drain battery power<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- The mouse is small, sometimes I have to take breaks because my hand gets a bit sore<br/><br/>Other than the size of the mouse, I can't really complain. It's simple, durable, and very easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't have big hands or doesn't use their computer very frequently.<br/><br/>My Rating - 7.9/10
 I was searching high and low for an inexpensive mouse.  The mouse pad on my laptop stopped working so I had to get something.  I was using an old school corded mouse which became annoying pretty quickly, but it wasn't annoying enough for me to want to spend 20 bucks for a wireless mouse.  Then ta-da!  Behold I found amazon basics.  This mouse works GREAT and the price is just as GREAT!
 This item works great. It's got a soft surface on top that is nice and is a good size. I use it directly on my desk and have had no issues with it. I like it very much. I especially like that inside the battery compartment is a place to hold the usb connector when it is not plugged into the computer.
 FAST,,I HAVE BEEN USING THE WIRELESS WHITE APPLE MOUSE. FREQUENTLY LOOSING CONNECTIONS...LOOSING MY MIND TO<br/>FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY COMPUTER.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE.
 I bought a wireless mouse at the store last week, it was a very basic mouse and ended up being around $30. I went to Amazon and saw they have their own house, so naturally I returned the one I just bought and purchased this one. The picture doesn't do the mouse justice. Personally, I think the picture makes it looks cheap. It actually has a grip feeling to it on the top of the mouse. It's heavy enough where you know it's not going to break instantly and still light weight. Very glad I decided to get this one.
 The mouse can be put on the sofa next to you and it will still be able to connect to computer and move cursor about.<br/><br/>What I like most about this mouse is when I dropped the mouse the battery cover came off, &amp; disappeared into the black hole under the sofa never to be seen again, &amp; it still works even with a bared battery compartment.
 It works well but the cover for the battery compartment won't stay on.  We have two of these and both have the same problem.  It doesn't interfer with the operation of the mouse, but it is a shame that this defect ruins the look and feel of the product.<br/><br/>Surely, Amazon, you could make this work properly!
 It is very unresponsive. I constantly have to bang it against a surface to get it to work. It does not work on many surfaces including an actual mouse pad. You’d think if it had amazon printed on it it would be a quality product but it is not. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
 Not bad, not perfect but good.  Unlike some other mice this one is comfortable. No pain in the wrist after using it for several hours doing CAD work. Battery life looks good, its has been left on over night and they still work. The USB dongle works well with Win10, plug it in and it's good to go. I would buy another.
 Very comfy and great operation. The USB micro thing stores in Mouse when not in use . VERY nice idea. Plus on/off switch and easy battery install.  Would by again.
 On my Windows 10 laptop, this wireless mouse will cause my keyboard to become unresponsive about once every three hours.  I have narrowed this down by:<br/>1. updating all drivers on my laptop.  Still experience the same issue.<br/>2. Disabling any Anti-Virus plugins that could interfere with the keyboard.  Still same issue<br/>3. Changing various settings in Ease of Use for the keyboard. Still same issue.<br/>4. Uninstalling all Anti-virus - same issue.<br/><br/>Finally, just remove the dongle and the problem does not come back.  I cannot find a place for any updated driver for Windows 10 specifically, and the only way to get the keyboard to function again, one must reboot the machine.
 This mouse works well, and is comfortable for use. I only have one problem, which is the mouse lacks fine control. It works well if I'm moving across the screen or playing games, but if I need to move the cursor only a few pixels over, I struggle doing so with this mouse.
 Very pleased with this mouse.  I had been using a full sized Logitech wireless mouse, but the receiver stuck out so far from the slot (using on a laptop) that I had to get a better one with a micro receiver.<br/><br/>This one fits the bill great.  The receiver isn't in the way.  Range is good and the mouse is comfortable in your hand, regardless of hand size.<br/><br/>I haven't had it long enough to need a battery change, but I do know it's better than the Logitech it replaced.
 I bought this mouse and it just sat in my desk unused for over a year.  I've now been using it for around 2 weeks and the USB dongle has already broken.  The USB housing has come unglued from the circuit board underneath it and I cannot connect the mouse to the computer now.  I've read other reviews where the mouse just stopped working and I wonder if this is the same problem just without it coming completely unglued.  2 weeks of life for $10 is not a great value.
 It worked great and I loved it for about a month.  However, I dropped it (from about 2.5 feet off the ground onto a carpeted floor) and the battery lid broke and it is unusable.  Obviously super cheap plastic and not durable. Disappointed with this product and wouldn't recommend!
 Works really well. My only complaints are that if I tilt it a little bit the cursor will jump around all over the place and the fact that I can't ever remember where the little jack is when I haven't used it for a while (this is my fault, and it's really a good idea to store it in the mouse battery compartment!).
 I bought this because i was looking for a generally use wireless mouse, and i got exactly what i wanted and more. I was skeptic that the quality would be great but was happily surprised. It feels great in your hand, I can mouse and scroll through effortlessly. I was going to save it until I go to school, but it's so great I started using it right away, in fact i'm using it right now.<br/><br/>For those who say the batteries are hard to get in, I disagree. I had no problems setting it up.
 Within days of getting the item I noticed a problem. As the mouse sat perfectly still on the table I noticed the cursor<br/>meandering across the screen. Staggering around in small random circles and moving about despite there being no moving of the actual mouse. I have since replaced this item.
 I am loving the use of my amazonBasics wireless mouse, I love the fact that for the price i paid it comes with the wirless reciever nano but as well came with the two triple aaa batteries it needed, so for the price I wasnt expected free batteries. Also it works as well as the logictech wireless mouse it more expensive competitor cousin, has great sensitivity and works just as well as its more expensive counter parts, I recommend it to anyone looking for replacement mouse.
 This mouse is great. It's a good size, comfortable, sleek, totally easy to use, and it comes with batteries that are incredible. When I bought it I didn't even realize that the batteries came with it, and 6 months later I'm using the same ones. I've used the mouse probably a total of 35 hours, and I've accidentally left it turned on over night for 40+ hours and the batteries are still going. I would definitely reccomend.
 Great mouse! Have had it for a while now, and it's held up to my kids "drop tests" too.  It's the perfect size for the whole fam, as i work from home frequently.
 This is my favorite mouse. The battery's last a long time. It has an on off switch which helps. It also has a compartment in the mouse to store the wireless adapter. I bought a wireless mouse at a different  store but it wouldn't work right. The Amazon mouse works great for a great price.<br/>Thank you , Amazon<br/>Sincerely<br/>William V. Chase
 I have a mac and the magic mouse scrolling feature just drove me crazy, everytime I used excel the sheet would scroll up and down, left and right everytime I moved my finger! But I love this mouse, it is simple just like a mouse should be. Thanks amazon :)
 It is pretty much perfect. I plugged it in, everything started working. It is a very good size, and works on pretty much every single surface. (Including my leg itself, chair cushion etc) When I turn it on, it connect to my laptop in less then a second. It immediately is detected and starts working. Also the receiver is very tiny. In my Sony Flip 15A the receiver is completely hidden. The mouse pointer goes where I expect it to, it is a hiccup free process that feels very natural.<br/><br/>My only compliant is the battery compartment, there is a plastic wrapper that I can't figure out if I am suppose to remove, and it does not tell me which side is the + - for the batteries. That led to a 2 minute delay. *Gasp*
 No problems. Works great and my batteries last after the original "brand X" batteries got weak after a few days. No problems, even when I forget and leave it powered up over night.
 Very good mouse. I bought this to use with my Windows laptop and mainly my Mac computer for right clicking ability in Windows mode. The feel of the mouse is very nice. The buttons and the scroll wheel all feel very sturdy. It seems to be well built and I expect it to last for a long time. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone needing a new mouse.
 Great mouse. Just the basics thanks. None of those stupid side buttons that screw everything up when you accidentally touch them.
 On Friday February 17th at 9:00 am my Amazon Basic Mouse died.  I would have to turn it on and off every minute to keep it running.  Obviously no good.  But I was covered by the 1 year warranty.  I contacted Amazon and they did a swap.<br/><br/>It is now Saturday 1:00 pm and the replacement mouse has been delivered.<br/><br/>Amazon is killing other retailers for good reason.
 I've gone through 3 of these, they work great until it dies (sometimes immediately and other times a couple months after purchased). Maybe I've just got a couple of lemons but I'm really regretting giving my brother my "old" mouse that is still working 3 years later. To their credit the one that came DOA they sent me a replacement.
 I;be owned this 3 months.  Works great!  The ergonomic shape prevents hand and wrist fatigue and pain.  The battery lasted about three  months.  I left it on all the time instead of turning it off when not in use.  The on/off button is very small and hard-to-find initially but I still like it.  I recommend this unit for anyone  with hand/ wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome, pain, or fatigue. Note:  I use this mouse with an ergonomic mouse pad.
 The first mouse I received worked well for about 9 months and then just suddenly stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they sent out a replacement immediately. I have been using this one now for 2.5 years on a daily basis and haven't had a single problem. I have a couple sets of rechargeable AAA batteries that I alternate and they usually last about a month before needing swapped and I leave the mouse on 24/7.
 Perfect size, I actually like how small and lightweight the mouse is. Removing batteries is sometimes difficult process. Also, they tend to die really fast which makes the process constant hassle.
 It connected first try, been working for a couple of weeks, I keep forgetting to turn it off at night and I'm still on the first set of duracell batteries.
 Okay so this is a good mouse... at first. I bought one and it worked for about 8 months I think? Then the spring on one of the battery slots got all bent out of shape and I had to continually take out and put back the battery cover to fix it, sometimes for only minutes at a time.<br/>When I called Amazon about this, they readily sent me a new one free of charge, so they get an extra star for that.<br/>But that wasn't all that long ago, and now the nano receiver is bent and refuses to connect to my computer. I'm always careful to carry and store my laptop with the receiver side up just to avoid this sort of problem, and yet here we are.<br/>Over all? It's a cheap, easy solution, but probably only good for an "In-the-meantime" mouse while you find something better.
 It’s a little small for a normal sized hand but overall it’s perfect if you need a mouse for your laptop, although it is probably not the best choice for all day every day use.
 Light, sturdy, and never loses signal. Works great with my Macbook Air. No trouble after two years, even with the plastic battery cover. Highly recommend! I would recommend that the red light be changed to something less oppressive; I have to be careful when I turn it over to shut it off to avoid the laser beam.
 The mouse works well, feels just the right size, has a place to store the dongle, and AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE is amazing. I had an issue, contacted them to inquire if I could pay to fix it because (like I said, it’s a good mouse), and they sent me the solution the same day. I’m very pleased and will be making a point to check for an Amazon Basics versión of everything before I buy now! Thanks, Amazon.
 Works great, and for a good price.  The batteries burn a bit quick, but it's not too shabby and the performance of the mouse more than compensates for this.  The panel enclosing the battery compartment opens a tad too easily for my liking, and it has come off a few times while in transit in a computer bag, but I'm gentle with it so don't have too many problems.
 This is the perfect little mouse for traveling.<br/>Small, wireless, and compact; Plus it's very energy efficient so I don't have to change the batteries as often as I do with other wireless mice!
 Overall disappointed with this mouse. It works OK, but occasionally senses button presses while scrolling. Unlike a Microsoft mouse, you have to remove the battery cover to store the USB dongle. And - worst of all - battery life is very poor. I'm going back to a Microsoft mouse.
 I have lost so many of these that I was getting tire of Myself.  Then I found this little thing--- very inexpensive and served the purpose.  It is large but I can keep up with it.  I have a laptop which it is attached to  AND  a regular computer to work on simultaneously.  The regular computer has its own (smaller) browser.  I am still impressed and have not dropped it like the others. I destroyed the others because they kept falling.  The plug in one and this one has with stood my test of endurance. Cheap and works well... buy it!
 Thought it was a battery issue, but doesn't seem related. Seems to just lose connection entirely. turning off/on and unplugging/plugging the nano-usb adapter sometimes works.
 These wireless mice work great, as expected.  Have purchased several without any failures. Do not see need to spend any more on a mouse. Good price and comes right to my door with my prime membership.  Can't be beat.
 The price is great.  That is the only good thing about this mouse.  I used this mouse for my laptop and had to have it plugged in within 6 inches from the computer to even use it.  It skipped and lagged so much I stopped using it .  I would not buy this again.
 I lost my Dell wireless mouse USB transmitter so I got this one for an inexpensive replacement to use w/ my Dell laptop. You get what you pay for. The mouse cursor moves irksomely jumpy on the screen. I've tried to tweak the mouse settings several times but it just feels weird. I lacks that smooth "oneness". I do not recommend it.
 We prefer a mouse over laptop clickboard. This mouse is great for our needs. Click wheel performs nicely. Buttons feel good.
 this is not as precise as my Logitech, you  have to press hard to click in and move mouse more to get though. will use until I can replace my old one.
 No problems connecting ever. Size is perfect for putting in my bag and bringing it along as a mobile mouse. I wouldn't want to use it everyday at a desk because I am more used to a larger mouse.
 I bought this mouse on June 11th, 2015. I've used this mouse  until last week and it had been working brilliantly.<br/><br/>However, as of late it has stopped working. The device still turns on but for some reason, no computer I use this with can seem to recognize it anymore. There is no way of checking whether the mouse can even connect and there is no explanation as to why the bluetooth receiver no longer is recognized by any number of computers.<br/><br/>I was very pleased with how it was working, but am disappointed that I will have to buy a new one.
 I wasn't sure what kind of mouse to get for my basic little laptop so I decided to get this inexpensive basic little mouse. It's perfect. I have fairly large hands for a woman, and the mouse fits in my hand just fine. It performs smoothly, has an on/off/connect switch, and the little receiver can be stored inside the mouse when not in use. It does have an audible sound when clicking, but that doesn't bother me.
 Didn't last long...about 4 months to the day. It was acting weird when I first got it; patchy connection and that should have been a hint that "Houston, we have a problem", and I should have returned it then...it was cheaply priced but most are these days. I have a Logitech wireless mouse that I've had for years and it's still going strong. I bought this for my laptop at work but oh well, just bought another Logitech to replace this one.
 I love this mouse! For the price its way better then expected. I use it with my laptop and even though im not on it everyday i have no complaints. I have a large hand and still feels good!
 It does exactly what it's meant to do. Installation of drivers only took 2 minutes on my Acer Aspire S7, but the mouse was working as soon as I had the nano plug in and had turned it on. The surface has a nice soft feel to it and the click wheel is solid and responsive. The packaging is as easy to open as Amazon claims. I'll pay for the shipping just for no clamshells  casing alone! The mouse does work with USB 3.0 ports.<br/><br/>It does make the click noise, so I wouldn't purchase this particular mouse if you are looking for something quieter. I only just got it, so I can't review for longevity yet, but right now I am satisfied with my purchase.
 I originally gave this mouse two stars, however after owning it for a few more months I brought my review down to 1 star.<br/><br/>The battery cover falls off almost constantly and now I'm having issues with it clicking. It's only about 4-5 months old now and almost never used and it's complete junk. :(
 Fun color to match my desk, instant setup, and great price. No complaints at all, this mouse is great for working on my laptop from anywhere.
 I was looking for wireless mouse to use with my laptop after I lost my plug in receiver for my old mouse. I found this one and I was worried about how cheap the price was. I am glad I went with the Amazon mouse and saved some money. The mouse works great, doesn't feel cheap in my hand and is responsive. Most of the time I have the laptop in my lap and am using the mouse on the armrest of my couch (microfiber) and the mouse works great on it with no mouse pad. If you are looking for a basic mouse that works great, you won't go wrong getting this one.
 This mouse works perfectly. I can use it on any surface: my dining room table, my glass top coffee table, a cloth placemat, the arm of my couch, and it works equally well. It worked very well on my MacBook Air (2012), which had an overly sensitive trackpad. I haven't tried it yet on my new MacBook Air (2014), but I am confident it would work well on that machine, too, based on my experience so far. And for the price, you can't beat it!
 After owning this mouse for over a year, I’m posting the following review because of issues I’m having with the scroll wheel. It’s become unusable in that my computer is not recognizing when the mouse is scrolling down. It’s only recognizing it when I scroll up. The mouse works perfectly outside of this issue and it did take some time to experience this problem, but it’s a problem nonetheless.
 To start out with, this mouse does not shut off automatically. You have to manually shut of the mouse Using the switch on the bottom each time. This shocked me because most mouses that I have owned shut off when not in use by themselves. After I while I did get use to this so it stopped being that much of a problem. After a few months of light use 3-4 times a week for maybe 45 minutes the mouse quit working. My uncle being an electrician said the mouses circuits got fried. I expected much better quality from an Amazon brand product.
 I've been using this as an auxiliary mouse to my corded razor mouse for convenience.<br/><br/>I will keep trying to see if I can improve the performance somehow but, it constantly lags while moving the pointer, fails to register button clicks.<br/><br/>If I can figure out a software or other issue that eliminates these issues, I'll change my review. Until then, I can't recommend this wireless mouse.
 I've been disappointed to see how poor the range is on this mouse. The size is absolutely perfect for my hands -- somewhere between a mobile mouse and a full-size mouse -- but it just can't keep a solid signal! I am using the mouse approximately 2 feet from its receiver (on top of a desk with my computer tower on the floor next to the desk), and it jumps erratically and stops picking up a signal very frequently. I intend to keep the mouse since it had such a low price, but I can only use it as a backup.
 I bought this in mid-January, so it has been less than 2 months of purchase. However, it does not work half of the time when I try to use it. The receiver is not getting recognized correctly. I have 3 places where I can plug USB in, and I have to switch around several times to get the mouse to work (my laptop doesn't have a problem). Even if it does work, it stops working after a few minutes. Do not recommend.
 Worked pretty well.  Stopped working after about 3 years.  Computer detects the receiver being plugged in but no movement of the cursor.  Tried on multiple computers.  Not bad for the cost I suppose but I would have liked a little more life out of it.
 A good wireless mouse for those wanting a cheap but decent experience. In no way does this mouse compete with higher end wireless mice, but if you're looking for a cheap mouse that works, this is it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+Good build quality for a mouse of this price.<br/>+Textured finish on the top<br/>+Quite comfortable (varies by person)<br/>+Has a nice weight<br/>+Very nice click for left and right mouse buttons<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Tracking can be a bit jittery at times<br/>-Textured finish seems to attract oils from hand<br/>-Cursor may "jump". This seems to happen when the wireless signal is bad<br/><br/>Although there are other mice out there, for a temporary or backup mouse this works great! If you need one for a laptop, and/or don't care for any extra bells and whistles and just want to browse the internet or simply type but need something to click around with, this is a good option. It's cheap, works, and isn't bound by cords.
 For the price, it will do the job, but there are better options for just a few more $$.  I wouldn't buy it again.<br/><br/>I got it to replace my old MS wireless mouse, it was a 5 button mouse, this one is not(my fault for not carefully reading the description), but the feel of the mouse is cheap.<br/><br/>I will buy another MS mouse soon and keep this one as an emergency spare.
 Works great.  I have a nice Bluetooth mouse, but the built-in Bluetooth adapter in my laptop has failed, which prompted me to purchase this mouse.  It's been working great so far.<br/><br/>The USB receiver (not Bluetooth) for this mouse is very small, and hardly noticeable when plugged in.<br/><br/>The mouse is very lightweight and works great on all surfaces, including my clear glass-top coffee table.  Used on a Dell Inspiron Windows 8 laptop.
 There is not a users manual with the product. In the product description it states to refer to the "user manual" ... There isn't one....UGH!!
 This little mouse is awesome and I recommend it to anyone. Going to buy another one for my girlfriend because her new store bought one is a piece of junk. All of the Amazon products that I have purchased have all worked flawlessly.
 Basic mouse, ok but would not order this again as there are better mice out there :)  Biggest dislike that Amazon can improve upon is to make the sides of the mouse where your fingers rest, a rubbery material (like my microsoft mouse) instead of the slippery plastic which is just not comfortable in the hand.<br/><br/>personal preference note - its a tad on the smaller side, may be better for kids or people with smaller hands.
 Excellent basic wireless mouse at a very reasonable price.  I purchased two of these to use as backups for my primary mice (mouses?)  When I received them, I opened both up, installed the batteries, and connected each of them to my computer to check their operation.  While not as high a resolution mouse as the one I normally use, they do work quite satisfactorily.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good, basic wireless mouse, I can recommend these highly.
 These are really handy, no wires,  work well  when you want to take you laptop to bed or manipulate it while watching t.v.  or at some of those more intricate details.  However, you do have to remember to turn them on and off, feed them batteries and remember where you left them.  Just neat little critters to have around.
 Installed in Windows 7 but was not recognized at first. a reboot was necessary to get the proper drivers working. This was different than my experience with other mice so I was initially concerned but this mouse is performing well and is a bargain. I would buy again if needed
 It works well. Comfortable. Responsive. Why did I give it a 1 star review? Because the receiver is so cheaply made that it broke off in my USB port. Now, that USB port in my laptop is damaged.
 I sure wish I had read the reviews before buying this mouse.  I eats batteries like crazy.  I bought it in late November and here it is two month later and I am on the third set of batteries.  I do not recommend this.
 Pros: Glides easily. Clicks aren't too loud and are responsive, as is movement. Has good weight, not to light and not too hefty. Quality materials, "sueded" button plastic feels nice. Great price.<br/><br/>Cons: Tiny and tall, uncomfortable to use. Very difficult to read the polarity labels molded into the battery compartment. On/off switch feels cheap. Mouse wheel is "scratchy".
 This came up when I searched bluetooth mouse, but it isn't bluetooth and for some reason it never dawned on me that a bluetooth mouse wouldn't come with a USB receiver. I don't really care, it's still a good little mouse.<br/><br/>P.S. don't try to rip the plastic battery thing out, it's there to make battery removal easier. Overall this mouse made me feel like the idiot I am, on two separate occasions, so for that I give it -1 star.
 Died within 3 weeks while I was travelling and I was left mouseless. I'm a huge believer in AmazonBasics products (I have the keyboard, etc) but this was a fail.<br/><br/>My Logitech mouse lasted almost 2 years. What a disappointment.
 As others have mentioned, this is a good quality mouse for the money. But, it really is small. So small its uncomfortable to use for long periods of time and I will have to buy another one to replace it. If you have small hands this could be a great choice for you.
 It works! Saved a lot of  money in following Amazon recommendation. For most people do believe this is all one needs.
 Quite often it's frustrating to use. Most of the time it works fine but I would say about 10% of the time it gets very laggy and very frustrating to use. If I were to use it once in a while it would probably be fine but since I bought it for work it was more than I could take.
 I use a variety of mice all day between different workstations at work and at home. I didn't know it was possible to actively dislike (and avoid) a mouse until this one. It is highly uncomfortable. The mouse drags on all surfaces, doesn't fit the hand well at all (arch is too low, fingers have no grooves), and clicking is incredibly stiff. Also, didn't think it would bother me, but the dongle is huge compared to Logitech.
 I bought this mouse as a replacement for another one, and I am quite happy with ihow well it is working. By the way, I also like that it's colored to red.
 Works great!  It has a good feel and is quite accurate.  I have had several wireless mice and this is one of the nicest.  I actually wish it were just a little heavier, but that's just me.  Slightly darker color than in the picture (with 400 watts of light shining above me).
 I bought this mouse in March 2016. It was great. Usable on almost any surface and doesn't eat through batteries. However, at the official 6 month mark it began to stop working randomly. Changed the batteries and it started working again for maybe an hour then died again. Tried changing the batteries again and it worked for about another hour. I had my last USB mouse for 3 years and it was cheaper than this one! I expected better than 6 months of use.
 Small button for on/off.<br/>Useless button for Connect.<br/>Bad ergonomic shape.<br/>Weird scratch with the table.
 I was initially happy with the device. It was affordable, pretty, and worked quite well -- for a while. It failed after Amazon's return window closed but I'll attempt to return it anyway. I decided to purchase the much more expensive Logitech MX Master 2S mouse and so far it is terrific.
 It came in the mail when they said it would. I opened it. I took the nano receiver out, and put it in the computer. I put the batteries in. I turned it on, and worked spectacularly. For the price, you cant beat this one. Outer coating on the mouse's surface makes it smooth, and soft to the touch. Right, left, and scroll-wheel clicks. Also has a grooved scroll wheel, a feature you wouldn't expect from a mouse this cheap. This is exactly what it looks like in the picture, nothing more, nothing less. This is a no frills mouse that is simple and practical and gets the job done like an expensive mouse would. Buy this now before you think about getting anything more expensive!!!
 I went looking for a new brand of mouse because I have been truly unhappy with another major brand I had been using. They were warrantied for three years and didn't come close to it. LOGIcally speaking, the TECnical workings did not work as promised. SO, we parted ways. I found this mouse at Amazon. I have been happy with other AmazonBasics items and I ordered it. It has worked perfectly since its arrival. I AM HAPPY with it. Got it in two days thanks to Amazon Prime.
 Smells like plastic...only reason I docked a star. However, it is an amazing mouse for the cost. My puppy somehow got my Microsoft mouse and chewed it up (in about 10 seconds), but she won't touch this one! Cheap for the excellent quality of the product.
 Have had this mouse for about 6 months.  It's worked fine, however, the rear cover over the batteries has come off several times.  Always could replace it easily.  This last time, the clips that hold it in place, are not working so the cover won't stay on without tape over the back of the mouse.  In addition, the batteries have to be replaced pretty often.
 This is a very nice, basic mouse. I like the fact that the USB transmitter fits within the mouse battery compartment and it is a small adapter. This makes for a compact, easy to carry mouse for traveling. I really like this configuration and own a couple more like it.
 Very nice little mousie.  Plugged it in and it worked right away.  Plug n play the way it should work, with little effort on our part. I especially like that the USB receiver, a small part which could be easily lost, has its own place to be carried in the mouse body.  Someone was thinking when they created that!
 I was thrilled to find a wireless mouse so expensively. It was purchased for use with my netbook and worked immediately upon inserting the batteries which are included. My only issue is the cheapness of the design. The clip holding the battery cover broke as soon as it was opened to insert the batteries. The mouse still works well but if lifted off the desk surface the cover falls off.
 I bought a microsoft mouse for the same price and it died quickly. This mouse works perfectly. The battery lid comes off a little easy, but the batteries stay put so its not a real problem. Highly recommend.
 This mouse was purchased for my home office and it has held up well.  If you remember to turn it off, the batteries last a long time. Responsive. A good size for big hands (I'm 6' tall and it fits my fingers comfortably).
 Works great!  I normally use a trackball mouse on my desktop PC.  I bought this mouse for several friends who want to use my computer when they come over and they cannot seem to get the hang of a trackball.<br/><br/>I leave the USB dongle plugged in and just switch on the wireless mouse when someone wants to use it.  It is ready to use right away. I turn it off when they're finished to save batteries.  Very easy to use and the price was quite reasonable.
 This is an excellent mouse at a low price in fun colors.  What's not to like?  Bought a backup in the fun purple color in case they stop making them.  Worth every penny.
 I've been using this mouse for many months now and the only complaint I have is that the range could be a bit better. I have to have the adapter on the front of the PC, as close as possible to the mouse and its "line of sight." Other than that issues, the mouse works great. The build quality seems great, and you can't beat the price.
 Maybe it was just a fluke, but for me this mouse had a hard time dragging with the left button.  It wasn't smooth, but rather jumpy, stopping and skipping.  I changed the surface under the mouse several times.
 For a number of years I have used, and loved, my Logitech wireless mouse. Lately, however I became tired of the large protruding receiver. I noticed that Logitech now makes a nano receiver  model, which minimizes this problem. But it cost more than I was prepared to spend. I was pleasantly surprised to find this reasonably priced AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver. I have a medium sized man's  hand and find this mouse fits it perfectly. It installed without difficulty and operates smoothly and accurately. You really can't beat it at any price. Good job Amazon!
 This mouse is great value for the money and has a very comfortable grip. Just remember to shut it off when not in use or you will go through a ton of batteries. It connected very quickly to my laptop.
 I did my research on this. I was willing to pay a little more but did not need to. This is exactly as stated. It works well. Feels comfortable in my hand. Very light and convenient to carry along. There are no delays. It is very accurate. I have had it for about a month. I always forget to turn it off and have not had to replace the batteries yet. I dropped it once and the batteries came out. It was very easy to slip them back in and went right back to work using it. If needed, I would purchase this again! Thank you Amazon!
 One of the worst mice I've had. Just really uncomfortable in the hand. Logitech is far better.
 I have always been reluctant to get a wireless mouse because the ones I have used in my office never seem to work well. When my mouse on my home desktop went my daughter convinced me to try a wireless mouse. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and the reviews were pretty good on the AmazonBasics mouse so I took a chance. I have to say it was a chance well worth it. The mouse works as well as any wired mouse that I have had.
 I normally find Amazon-brand products reliable, but this particular mouse goes through batteries every couple of weeks...no exaggeration.  I don't know if I got a lemon, but all my other wireless mice only need battery replacement every 4 or 5 months. Consequently, I can't recommend this mouse.
 Greatest mouse I've ever used! I bought this for work since the crappy ones they provide are terrible. It took all of 2 minutes to put this baby together and get to using it. I didn't have to download anything and it came with batteries. I highly recommend this mouse to anyone.
 I'm having a really bad user experience with this mouse. The skid  pads came loose and they gummed up under mouse creating a mess on the bottom of the mouse that always seems to be seeping out from under the remaining pads until they fall off. Otherwise, works as expected
 the size is nicely fits in my hand and little bigger than the mouse that i used previously. I was worried about the connection since lots of review of this product has lots of issues on the connection but I feel very comfortable and it has pretty good connection.
 I bought it a months ago and i think I made a best choice by choosing this mouse. It goods and it's really a wireless. I use it for writing essay and journal on my laptop. I also use it for class presentation by having mouse on the podium and one click to change a slide. I don't have to go back to main desk from the podium and my speech get interruption. So basically, it's a perfect mouse!
 For this review I am going to be comparing it to another wireless mouse, the Logitech M205.<br/><br/>I purchased this wireless mouse as an upgrade from old wired ball mouse. I don't like corded mice it feels restricted every time I have to wrangle the cord, because of my ever changing setup at my desk. For a while had used my laptop wireless mouse (Logitech M205) before purchasing this mouse. Let me tell you there is a clear difference in the feel of the mice. My Logitech M205 had a almost cheap plastic feel and was also extremely light and almost hollow. The AmazonBasics wireless mouse clearly has more weight and substance to it, but not overly so that if feels like your using a brick for a mouse. Also the top of the mouse has a rubberized coating that gives it a real silky feel, that I really like. I pretty certain this will wear down overtime which is a shame, but given average use it should be years.  Now the design of the mouse is simple, but its not really ergonomically designed. At first I didn't like how it felt, it just didn't quite feel right in the hand. But give a little time, it doesn't bother me now as when I first sat down to used it, so for some there might be that "getting used to it" phase. Now the USB transceiver is infant a mini transceiver. Distance wise isn't its strong suite. I was able to get use the mouse from half a room away (about 10ft). It quickly loses its reception after 5ft. (Mind you the signal had to travel through my metal framed desk and to back of my computer, So depending on your setup it may vary. It could reach farther if I had used a forward facing USB slot) The connect button that syncs up the mouse with the transceiver is quite large with big imprinted letter saying "CONNECT". Most mouses I have seen have pin sized hole that you have to rummage through your desk to find a small paperclip or something to push the button. I was kind of worried that I might accidentally push it, but so far no problems. The battery compartment on the bottom is a little unusual, and honestly I'm not a big fan of. The AmazonBasics mouse uses two AAA batteries, while my Logitech mouse only takes one AA. While the battery compartment does have a stow away slot for the transceiver like most wireless mice. The batteries themselves go in a at a 45 degree angle rather than lay flat like others, Also you have to shove them pretty far into the mouse so when I comes time to change out my batteries I had a quite a bit of trouble taking them out without a flat screwdriver. Which makes the the next problem worse, battery life. While it does have a ON/OFF switch (a most but not all mice have this feature) so when the mouse is stowed away it doesn't drain the battery, for my use as a desktop mouse I just leave it on. While the "sleep mode" isn't as deep a sleep as other mice it doesn't prolong battery life that much longer. I wager 1 month of average use. The lite sleep mode is has is actually a good thing, I can just set down use it and it catches up instantly. Some mice I have tried before I practically have to shake the thing like I'm trying to wake someone up out of bed.<br/><br/>+ Silky rubber feel<br/>+ mini transceiver<br/>+ sturdy yet not super heavy.<br/>+ ON/OFF switch (a most in my book)<br/><br/>+- range is fine unless you like controlling your computer from another room.<br/>+- lite sleep mode, great for instant use, bad for battery life.<br/>+- simple but not ergonomically designed<br/><br/>- battery compartment hassle<br/>- battery life about 1 month
 This mouse has terribly muddy/imprecise pointing. When I point it at something, it suddenly jumps to another part of the screen. It takes several attempts to click on a link. I had a much better Microsoft mouse prior to this one and I think I'll be going back there again.
 I got this mouse about a month and a half ago-- and it worked great for about a month. Now it randomly disconnects, despite the light being on. My only recourse is to restart both the mouse and my computer at the same time, which really only works about 30% of the time. I tried replacing the batteries blowing dust out of the receiver, and letting the thing sit unconnected just in case there was some weird technical voodoo happening that I didn't understand-- no go. If you get one that works, awesome, but mine died well before its time.
 I wouldnt consider myself a gamer, but I enjoy playing computer games (LoL, Runescape, R6 Siege) and this mouse works perfectly. Whether its on my desktop or laptop this mouse gets the job done. I've never turned it off and I've had to replace the battery 2 times over the 5 months that I've owned it. A+
 This mouse is great for travel. Though I prefer a full-sized mouse for primary use, this one fits in my bag nicely. Some other things I love about it is that the USB receiver stores inside the battery compartment and the mouse features an ON/OFF switch so that the batteries wont die! LOVE IT!
 Works perfectly. The mouse is small in size so if you have large hands it may not be comfortable for you. I use it occasionally with a laptop so I can not complain. If you tend to use it for several hour a day, you may want to try out various devices at a brick and mortar store to find out what feels best to you. But if you are looking for a good, wireless mouse for occasional use. This is a good buy.
 shoots through a cinderblock wall or a couple torsos, but not an I-beam. works on any flat or convex surface, in any orientation, even black ballistic nylon, glass, saran wrap, or a reflective mylar emergency blanket. very accurate and high rate of positioning. easy to press trigger. ambidextrous. small, but doesn't feel like a toy. you can stand on it. 91 grams fully loaded. perfect simple design.<br/><br/>sure, you can save five bucks on an even cheaper mouse, but would you trust your life to it?
 Compact and works well. The USB adapter fits inside the mouse when not in use. Take the mouse and adapter with you to use on another pc. Just plug the adapter in and turn the mouse on, and good to go.
 Didn't work right out of the box.  Even after pushing the connect button, turning it on and off, restarting computer, etc., it didn't work.
 It got so my batteries wouldn't even last a week.  Something is wrong with their quality-control department. File under: junk from China.  Buy at your own risk.
 This is my perfect mouse for work and home. I've been using a MagicMouse + trackpad of my MacBook Pro pretty heavily for awhile, and with enough constant clicking the trackpad can wear on me and the MagicMouse's sharp edges is remarkably uncomfortable for an Apple product. Hence, I ditched it for this little affordable guy, who slips easily into my bag and feels perfect in my hand. Click is a tad loud but not overly obnoxious. Nice, simple, responsive, and comfy.
 This is my second mouse that has gone bad, first one went bad after 6 months and the second one after 3 months. I keep putting new battery and reset it but wont connect and I decided to buy another mouse.
 great mouse, I bought this one for work because I have to go from one location to another and all they will provide is a wired mouse.  It works great.  I usually forget to turn it off when I go home, but the battery still lasts a long time.
 I've had 2 break.
 Never ordered an "Amazon" product again.  The mouse tracking is complete crap, using it on the same surface my HP wired mouse works great on.  This experience will cause me to seriously question the reviews here on Amazon.  This is just absolutely worthless garbage.  And for ten bucks, it's not worth the trouble to return it.  Amazon SHOULD NOT sell their own brand.  This is the way you destroy a customers trust.
 Solid design, great feel, simple and straightforward - you need this for a great mouse. However...the optical tracking is very poor. You notice this when moving slowly across the screen. The cursor jumps around as mentioned in several other reviews. I think the majority of people wouldn't bat an eye for this considering the price. However it's pretty significant and for me, quite unbearable. Returned.
 Good basic mouse but range isnt that good. When the receiver is right next to the mouse it works as good as any expensive mouse. On my Chromebook though, there are no USB ports on the right hand side. With the receiver on the left and the mouse on the right, it becomes very jerky and sometimes unresponsive.  My old Logitech laser mouse never had this issue. Can't complain for the price though.
 It's just not well made.  If you don't mind buying a new one every few months, by all means, but I think it's worth buying something quality to avoid having to replace it.  What a hassle.  Either the USB bit stops working or the button gets perma sensitive.
 It took about 6 months of near-daily use for the included Amazon-brand batteries to finally run out of juice. The mouse is smooth, the buttons and scroll wheel are high-quality and everything works as expected. My only gripe is the batteries are a little hard to take out, but since you'll probably be doing that only twice a year, it's a flaw worth overlooking.
 The scroll wheel somehow became partially disconnected from the sensor after only a few weeks, so I have to get exactly the right pressure and position to scroll. I scroll a lot while using AutoCAD, so I had to replace it.
 Either the mouse stopped receiving transmissions from the toggle thingy or the toggle stopped sending them.  Worked fine for a couple of years, but I'd rather have one that lasts.
 I have three wireless mice.  The AmazonBasics model is the most satisfactory, beating out the name-brand model that cost me three times as much.  Unlike the other two mice, the cursor of the AmazonBasics does not jump around.  It stays positioned on the screen where I place it.<br/><br/>I will probably order a second one for my MS Surface.
 I use this mouse for both work and home use.  It works flawlessly on every surface I've used it on so far.  It is the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  I think it has great sensitivity and highly recommend to buy it - especially considering the price of it compared to other wireless mice.  This should be a win-win for you, and if not, it isn't much of a loss.
 I need precision for my uses and this was too wobbly and jerky for my purposes.  I'm sure it's otherwise adequate for most ordinary uses.  Seemed well built.  I gave it to a friend.
 Nice simple mouse. I would have given this 5 stars if the on/off switch was closer to my thumb when trying to use it.<br/>Not sure if people reading this would understand what I am trying to do here...but all I am saying is that, I would like to pick this put with my right had and turn off the switch using my thumb (instead of using left finger for the switch). Small inconvenience, but for people like me who move around a lot, it could have been better.
 Mouse works.  Drains battery like crazy compared to some of the other Logitech mice.  The four little piece of stickies at the four corners that is supposed to help the mouse glide comes off after a few months of use.  Would not recommend it.
 This worked for awhile.  i use this with my laptop so I'm constantly plugging and unplugging the receiver into the usb port.  The battery cover is flimsy and broke so it doesn't stay on.  also, the buttons are super sensitive and I get this strange scrolling from using the mouse.  I"m not a noob but this mouse is definitely not suited to everyday use.
 I’ve been through 2 of these in 2 months. The first time I just thought it was a fluke, but the second one’s usb piece broke off inside my computer! Went back to Logitech. I had a Logitech for 3 years, the only reason I’m not using it today is because it was lost over the summer.
 works great with my newly upgraded win 10 machine.  2 of my older mice were acting weird with win 10.  Happy this mouse works great and no problems.  It is a smaller desktop size, which I like fine.  It also could be a laptop mouse, just small enough, with an on off switch.<br/>For the price, I will be looking at more Amazon Basics items.  The two things I have bought have been great.
 I am very pleased with this product. This product is well made, performs as described, easy to use and compares favorably or even better than the more expensive brands. Fits what I need to use it for. I am very happy that Amazon has good alternatives for items that are used by people who are cost conscious. The mouse is very responsive, has good battery life and its design is very ergonomically friendly.
 Its a no frills wireless mouse. It does the job. Its hard to complain about the product at its price point. Its been a few months and I'm still on the battery that came with it. Granted, I use it as my portable mouse and not my primary mouse. My only real complaint is that the compartment lid on it doesn't sit flush. I find it easier to move the mouse around with the lid off.<br/><br/>For the price, I would recommend it. If you want something nicer with better build quality though, you'll probably want something a little bit more expensive. As a second mouse though, can't beat it.
 It is much easier for me to use than just trying with my fingers as I have arthritis in my hands and the wireless. Mouse helps me navigate through the different apps that I want to use.
 Cheap but once it stops working, crummy -- I've had it for eight months, worked fine for most of that time, and I guess that's as long as it should last.  In the past few weeks some connection has stopped functioning, perhaps because it's just not durable to minor jostling -- for a while I could turn it off and then back on to get a few more minutes on it, but this has turned into a horrible mouse experience (though at least it's wireless).  I got what I paid for -- don't expect durability or no frustration out of this though.
 This mouse is fantastic.<br/>The quality is right up there with Logitech equipment at a fraction of the cost. I use this for meetings when I'm using my laptop and don't have a lot of work surface space.<br/>If you have big hands, this might be a little of a challenge for  you to use because it is a little smaller profile than your standard desktop mouse. At that being said, it is still great for portability!
 Clean and quiet.  If you loose it or break it it is no big deal because the price point is so low.  I beat mine up and drop it all the time and it still works.  Most of the sales team Inwork with use their mood pads.  Not me. It is much easier and quicker to just pull out the mouse and click away.
 Mouse works fine, but unlike most other wireless mouse's I've used, this one does not seem to have any kind of power save mode, so unless you make a habit of turning it off on the bottom of the mouse ever time your done using it, expect to run through the batteries every couple months or so, where other mice I've used can go for like a year without running down the batteries while leaving it on.
 I like this so much better than my previous wireless mouse that recently started flaking out on me. This one seems to be solidly made and well constructed. It came with two AAA batteries so I didn't have to search the drawers of my house to find a pair. Also the USB attachment was hidden inside of the batter compartment, making it easy to keep and transport the USB from laptop to laptop (of course I own multiple laptops. So I'm very happy. I'll probably order a second one for my home laptop.
 I am using it now.  Much more reliable, so far, then the one from Microsoft which a gave up on.  Nano receiver stores inside mouse but I think you will only you that ability if you travel with it a lot.  I doubt I ever will use the built-in storage.  Mouse is a little small, not for bigger hands.  Batteries fit in diagonally.
 This worked perfectly on my laptop. I love the color. It is not the same blue pictured, but I still like the color. It worked as soon as I put the batteries in and setup directions were very easy to follow.
 Receivers are tiny little things. They get lost easily. Most responsible brands make it possible for you to buy a new receiver and pair it with the old mouse. Not Amazon basics. Lost the tiny receiver? you gotta chuck the whole thing in e-waste. Recommend getting a logitec mouse which allows you to replace receivers easily
 I think its great, has good range, batteries last forever in it.  I use it near daily and have had zero problems with it.  Its sturdy enough to travel all over with me and is happy living in my backpack when not in use.  I initially worried that it might be too small to be comfortable on my hand but that has never been an issue.
 I love my new mouse and it's a joyto use it, it's so smooth and doesn't freeze up on me, good investment!
 When my Apple magic mouse disappeared during a recent move, I needed something that worked, but didn't cost as much as a new apple mouse.  I thought, for sure, as soon as I bought a new one that the old one would appear.  It hasn't, but I think I like this mouse better.  It's responsive, isn't a battery hog and fits my hand nicely.  The $10 price tag?  Even better.
 I heard some bad stuff about but only because some people miss treat it and deliver it in harsh ways. But all and all it is a pretty good mouse?!
 I only have ports in the back of my computer.  The mouse doesn't communicate cleanly with the sensor unless I hold the mouse to my left side, closest to the port.  I'll probably have to buy another mouse, I'm not particularly happy with this one.
 By far my favorite normal use wireless mouse (not comparing to gaming or high-productivity mice). I've bought three so far and they've all worked fine. Great mouse if you're needing portability, have smaller hands, or just need a mouse in general.<br/><br/>NOTE: I'm a smaller person, so the size of this mouse isn't a problem. Amazing fit for my hand size, and super useful for portability. YMMV (Your mileage my vary)
 Since I have a laptop, a wired mouse just doesn't work. This mouse has been working for a long time, and shows no signs of wearing out. It works great. I have traveled with it at least a dozen times, and when I start up my laptop, it works right away. Batteries also seem to last a long time. I don't change them but every few months, and it's used a lot. Between my husband and me, it must get used twelve or fifteen hours a day, almost every day. I think it's going to outlast my computer.
 I bought this to replace a Logitech Anywhere mouse that died after only 18 months. I like it so much that I'm ordering another to replace the a different Anywhere (which was a replacement for one that also died after 18 months).  This is 25% of the price of the Logitech and, so far, has been more responsive and predictable.  I've gotten a few Amazon Basics items and, as far as I can tell, they are excellent quality at a fraction of the cost of the name brand items.
 Kind of surprised after reading so many good reviews, but this mouse is junk. Scroll function doesn't work half the time, the cursor randomly travels across the screen, cursor also jumps and shakes. This is unacceptable, even for a budget item, it went in to the trash.
 The mouse that came with my computer sucked so I thought I'd try Amazon's little basic battery mouse. What a JOY it is - works better than the other one did brand new. I've tossed the HP corded mouse and absolutely love my little wireless one! Thank you AmazonBasics!!
 For the price, this mouse works wonderful. It fits my hand perfectly. I have never gone wrong with any Amazon Basics products. It's kind of weird though that I can't get the battery cover back on properly so I just put some tape to hold it and it's fine..
 I needed a wireless mouse for use on a small Chromebook for which the keypad was tricky (and frustrating) to use ... and which I could easily carry in a travel bag.  I had my doubts since this mouse was so low priced compared to others I have used on other computers, but added to my order to get free shipping.  After several months use, I now rate this as one of my best buys ... it works great (better than one that cost 4 times as much).
 I haven't even had this 5 months and it no longer keeps one of the batteries in place so it doesn't work. I keep having to take the battery out and put it back in and then it falls out after about 5 seconds of use. I use it maybe every other day lightly and do not abuse it. You get what you pay for.
 This is an excellent wireless mouse--small and light enough to fit comfortably into a purse with your laptop but big enough to fill the space beneath your hand.  There's a slot for the USB receiver/nub in the mouse itself, if you'd rather not leave it connected to your laptop.  Very convenient.  Good battery life.
 This is probably the best wireless mouse I have used for a laptop. It's sleek, comfortable, responsive, and very affordable. This mouse is somewhat small, and my hands are relatively large. But nonetheless, it fits well in my hand. The battery life is very well (two AAA), just be sure to turn off the mouse when not in use, especially if you put it in a backpack or going to bed. I find that wired mice are difficult to work with, especially with laptops since the wire gets in the way. And other wireless mice that i use tend to not be as responsive as this one. The receiver is also small and isn't noticed when plugged in. I recommend this for anyone who wants an affordable mouse for a laptop.
 Good price I bought 2 and 1 has stopped working after 11 or 12 weeks, the mouse moves in jagged moves and is very slow .  I tried to replace one but the amazon policy was for returning it within 30 days, that time has run out and now I have to go through the warranty procedure to get it fixed for a $10.00 item.  I probably will just throw it away and not buy another one.  A sucker is born everyday bad for me, and very bad for Amazon's good name.
 It's a beautiful little gem that navigates me on my Chromebook flawlessly. It was well worth the money.
 Very good quality. It lasts almost 4 years until I need to purchase the second one. This is the second one I ordered.
 After a month, the scroll wheel isn't working properly.  Will now have to spend money on a pricier product and I don't want it to be Logitech b/c their remote sensor has big flaws.
 I love the AmazonBasics concept. Can you imagine that I live in China, these products are manufactured here, got back to US and I ordered them paying for everything from the product, to the shipping and handling AND the import taxes and it's still less expensive and more reliable that what I'll be finding here on a market or even online. Furthermore... Amazon : I TRUST !<br/>The finish is great. On my new Sierra 2011 MBP, it worked immediately. Fast and very usable.
 worked well, until it didn't...around the 6 month mark unable to get adherence to table easily....may be the batterys installed, but shouldn't get out this quickly...disappointed and annoyed..
 I typically don't review items. If an item is bearable well then no need to make a fuss about it. But this mouse was too much.<br/><br/>Bad Tracking. If you slow down your mouse jumps around. In addition the mouse isn't "balanced" right, almost like wobbling table, this mouse wobbles from side to side.<br/><br/>Just get a Logitech you'll wont regret it.<br/><br/>Sorry Amazon but this mouse just doesn't do it.
 Contrary to the product description and image, this is not a full-sized mouse. This is a hair under 4 inches long. It's not what I wanted nor ordered. The quality is also inferior to my Logitech mouse.
 I was tired of spending large amounts of money on "upscale" mouses that still failed in a short time. I decided to try an inexpensive mouse. I love it. I only need the basics of click and scroll. It works fine. If you push down on the scroll wheel until you hear a click, the mouse will toggle between a nice scrolling option where you just move the mouse up or down and the page will start scrolling without you having to move the mouse wheel.
 I don't love this mouse, but it was a good price. I can't figure out if I can reprogram the middle scroll button. I like them to go 'back' when web browsing and pushing it to the left. but it does some weird scroll or magnification thing and I keep forgetting that it does that and I keep trying to use it to go 'back'.
 Great affordable wireless mouse!  Purchased this mouse to take to work, since I often have to present away from my desk and don't like dragging a wired mouse along.  It fits nicely in my hand, works well (for the time I've had it, which has been a few months), and the battery has lasted as long as I keep turning it off when not in use.  Would definitely recommend!
 Great mouse. I got this mouse to replace a worn out wire mouse. It works great, was easy to install and use. The USB part was easy to find and instal. No software was required. I am using it with rechargeable batteries. I do turn it off when it's not in use. The price is a great value for the quality of product. It is SO much better to not have all the wires!
 Do you want to use your mouse more 6 inches from your computer? If you answered yes, skip this mouse!
 I have been using a wireless mouse that is several years old and is starting to give me problems. I ordered this, plugged it in and I was online with the mouse. True plug and play. The old mouse had a little box with a cable that plugged into the desktop. It is nice that this unit just has the micro adapter. No cables.
 Works well with our Chromebook! I like the compacted packaging with the batteries and usb chip in the same place. Easy to store, too.
 I have had a few wireless mouses and this one by far is the best. It is simple to use and is the perfect size for me. The price is great and it also comes with batteries which is awesome. It is very smooth and easy to clean. If you are looking for a affordable and nice looking mouse I would recommend it.
 nice, cheap wireless mouse.  the click wheel isn't very smooth and scrolls slowly, but hey, i think i paid under 10 bucks, so yeah.
 I like the size and the receiver, but action is choppy. It hesitates and/or jumps around, making it difficult to use. If I hit the reset button, it clears up, but I'm finding that  I have to hit Reset at least twice per day. I'm going to continue to use it for a while longer so I can feel like I got my money's worth, but I can promise I will be replacing it with another brand soon.
 This mouse is glitchy, and lags a LOT. Also, it actually requires a lot of force from your thumb to click. This doesn't sound like a big deaI but when you design on your computer all day my right hand started hurting from all the pressure of my finger. And bc of this it was hard to click quickly and maneuver. AND WHO USES AAA batteries??? A mouse should use 1 AA not 2 AAA. When the batteries die, I don't carry AAA at my house.
 Ordered this mouse to replace a more expensive Logitech wireless mouse that had stopped working. After about two weeks of use, I prefer this item by far to any I have previously used. It is larger than most of the tiny wireless mice sold today, and its construction makes it feel more sturdy and comfortable in the users hand. It works great with my computer and I have had no issues with it so far. I am most impressed with its superior build quality compared to many more expensive similar products
 This item shipped quickly and I had it within two days. It was extremely easy to set up and start using. It is slightly smaller than the mouse I use day to day at work, but was the perfect size for me for travel, without being too small to work with comfortably.  The mouse came in great condition and tracks really well, with and without a mouse pad, and I am very happy with my purchase. Considering that its cost was so inexpensive, I feel like it is a great value.
 For the price, you cannot beat this! It works great and has great battery life (which it does include to start with). Also, I took a chance because it isn't clear in the description, this DOES work with Mac, at least mine. Only weird thing is the scroll wheel goes the opposite way of most, but you get used to this (assuming it's not just my device that is fluked). Great buy well worth the money.
 It was working fine until it didn't.  I had it for just under 2 months and it completely stopped working despite doing all of the troubleshooting step.  The one I have from Logitech for my other computer has lasted years.
 I didn't expect there to be a difference between this new one and the 2 year old one that just died.  A mouse is a mouse, I thought.  Anyway, this one is way more responsive than my previous one.  Happy with the difference.
 My partner's son throws it off the desk when he's at the office and it's still in once piece and functioning. Fits in my small hand nicely.
 Not a lot to comment on. I replaced the wireless mouse I had used for years with this one, and it easily installed and has been working very well for a few months now. It took a little time to get used to the lighter weight.
 Very nice size.  Didn't work reliably over 5 feet away, so used a USB extension cord on the Nano receiver to bring it closer to the mouse.  Now it works, but I have an extra USB cable that I was trying to avoid.
 Nice little inexpensive wireless mouse.<br/> I bought it for work and it ran for almost two months on the original batteries.<br/> It's been dropped probably twice (onto carpet) and has been fine.<br/> For the price this is a great value.
 The item arrived in good time and properly packaged.<br/>Installation was as described and required no time at all. The mouse performs just fine. I just wish it had come with some sort of a users' manual - by chance I discovered the screen could be locked in and moved in all four directions. All-in-all, a good product.
 Stable connection. Smooth scorlling for office work. Good reaction time as a casual gaming mouse (For example, FIFA PC). Battery consuming is accpetable (Energizer, Duracell are used). In overall a good mouse and worths the price. Amazon does a good job on these kinds of small gadgets.
 It's a fine product for Windows based computers. One thing that irritates me is that the on-off switch is upside down. Clearly Apple did not design this mouse because an Apple designer would have known that a light switch is the intuitive model to follow - up for on, down for off - this is the way they work all over the world. I travel often and have to remind myself every time I put it in or take it out of my backpack that it is upside down. Weird. I miss you Steve.
 The only thing that bothers me is batteries that came with it. I only used the mouse for 1 month then the batteries died. Although I do use my mouse more than my calculators, I expected the batteries last longer. I am not sure if it's the problem of the batteries the provided me or this thing just requires changing batteries that often (yeah, once a month is pretty frequent for me, I'd rather switch back to wired mouse if that's what I have to do with a wireless mouse). Besides that, this is a basic mouse working perfectly for me
 Using this mouse now.  It does the job- battery operated, so I am trying to remind myself to shut it off each time I use it.  Overall, its a fine little mouse that gets the job done.
 ...I really didn't! Unlike most of the wireless mouses on the market, you can places the USB in to the mouse whihc makes this a quite travel mouse for students, like really great. It connects with everything I've placed it in. Because I'm cheap and I refuse to buy the batteries, I have a habit of turning off the mouse when I'm not using it. I've had it for a couple months and the batteries are still going strong! Yay! I would buy this again, hopefully the price will be a bit cheaper.
 Used it almost daily. It broke after about 6 months of use. It was after the return window. The battery won't stay in place so it doesn't power on anymore. If you have it as a travel or back up mouse it might be ok, but not durable enough to last. Not worth the money imo.
 This Mouse keeps disconnecting from PC. Suddenly It stops working and you have to unplug trasnceiver, turn off and turn on the mouse several times for the mouse to reconnect. I used to have a Microsoft wireless mouse, I bought it for replacing Microsoft because I lost transceiver, however the experience has been very bad.<br/><br/>This is the first Amazon product I have Issues, I have tried with another PCs and even MAC, but the problem persist.<br/><br/>I would like to return the product, even I think it's too late for it.
 I purchased this mouse a few months ago and I really loved it. It's cheaper and much better than the more expensive microsoft mouses. I gave it a 4 start because for some reason the bluetooth part is no longer working. It just stopped working and now I have to get a new one unfortunatly. I expected it to last longer than just a few months.
 it's a wireless mouse, comes with a little dongle and a battery. wife uses it at school on her teacher laptop when at her desk and she's very satisfied with it, and it's a nice shiny purple. highly recommended.
 Works great, even for gaming-- doesn't have the fancy gaming mouse buttons, for a quick game in between at work, this works well even with the Battlefield games
 So far, this new mouse has been getting raving reviews from family members who have used it. Purchased this for my wife who wanted something for her laptop instead of that silly eraser head mouse control buried in the keyboard. This mouse worked well from the first time we plugged it in. It may be inexpensive, but it doesn't feel cheap!
 The mouse functions fine, however, the USB receiver broke and does not work unless you apply pressure into the socket. Was hoping to get a replacement USB receiver, but Amazon customer service said it was past the warranty period (1 Month). You are better off probably going with another brand that offers a longer warranty period.
 Mouse does not move smoothly on the screen.  It hesitates then jumps to a new spot.  It seems to be losing connectivity every several seconds, then regaining it, then losing it, constantly.  Cheap but unusable without going nuts.
 Cute little thing that works flawlessly with any Windows laptops or desktops, Linux and Raspberry Pi I stations have installed it in. Size is just right for my hand and fits nicely in a corner of the laptop bag. I am considering buying another one to replace my corded desktop mouse.
 Very pleased with this mouse for the amount of money it was. It fits easily in my hand (I have small hands, so this is a problem I've encountered with some mice), it has pretty good battery life, and it doesn't get hair or dust stuck inside of the optical area like some optical mice I've had in the past. Obviously this is a basic mouse that doesn't have any extra bells or whistles, but it's suited my purposes very well.
 I'm 27 years old so you would think I would know how to use a computer, but the touchpad on my recently purchased laptop is so difficult to use that I just can't be without this mouse. I do kind of wish it had an "auto-off" feature, but once I got in the habit of turning off the mouse whenever I shut down my computer, it was never a problem. Have had it for several months with daily use and the original batteries are still good.
 A coworker I bought this for is happy with this mouse. However, when I used it, it seemed a bit small for comfort. It makes a good travel mouse but I'm unsure its comfortable enough to be used daily if you've got a desk job.
 It works fine. It feels is a little large for my hand.  My old one was a logitech built for laptops and this one is slightly larger.  It is a personal preference due to my arthritis.  The price was right and I can adapt.
 It works just fine, was delivered in 1-2 days from order, and is priced very competitively.  The one thing users must keep in mind is to turn the mouse off via a small switch on the bottom to keep from running down the two AAA batteries that power the device.  It's a great size and fully functional, perfect for any laptop or a desktop computer.
 As the other low star reviews have mentioned, this product is defective and will burn through batteries in less than a week.  In the past month, I have gone through 4 sets of batteries with the first model and another set with the replacement model.  Do not purchase it!
 Worked fine for the first 3 1/2 months, now won't work at all. My MAC gives me the message that the "device is malfunctioning".  Don't waste your time buying this one, get a higher priced device that works.
 Cheap - easy to use - comes with batteries! This is a GREAT buy, especially if you only need a basic mouse. There's no installing...you just plug in the USB port, turn on the mouse, and get to work. It's as easy as that.<br/><br/>I've used several wireless mice, and this is by far the easiest to use, most ergonomic, and cheapest. I would highly recommend.
 I bought this Amazon mouse after having 3 Logitech mice with buttons that died too quickly. I don't yet know yet how long these buttons will last, but occasionally the Amazon mouse's laser starts to wander--my cursor will wobble and wander across the screen until I jiggle the mouse. No other mouse has done this on my mousing surface
 I am very happy with this little mouse.  I misplaced a similar one and just wanted something to toss in the bag with my small notebook.  This fits the bills.  Well made, good battery life so far, reliable, tracks well.  No complaints.
 Works wonderfully and better than the Microsoft Wireless Mouse that it is replacing. I am using it for my Network Video Recorder and there was absolutely no setup. Mouse is weighted nicely and the top black portion of it is nice and grippy.
 I have been using Anker wireless mouse for years before I need to get a replacement. I have seen a lot on the website, but decided to give 'Amazon Basics' a try. I have big hands and though this one is a tiny bit shorter, I was able to use it just fine. The only thing is that the USB is placed inside the battery case (where you put the batteries) and the batteries comes with it. I recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless mouse on a budget.<br/><br/>***Notice: There are wireless mouses (like Anker) that uses AA battery(-ies), this one uses 2 AAA batteries.
 Fantastic mouse for a low price. Fits my smaller hands well and has a soft matte finish on top that feels great. I use it for basic laptop work -- internet, word documents, excel. My laptop still works great but the mouse pad has slowly become less sensitive over the years. The amazon mouse was a great replacement to keep my laptop functioning for a bit longer.
 Works fine for me.  I hate the built in mouse function on a laptop &amp; use this instead. Love it!!
 Feels a little cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. Battery hold up good. Mouse works great. Came as described.
 Bought this for my daughter entering college.  She has used it for about a year with no issues.
 I just received the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse and installed it without a problem.  It has been working flawlessly thus far.  It is on a par with another wireless Microsoft mouse my wife uses.  This is about the fifth mouse I've used in the past several years and it is by far the best of both wired and wireless.  I especially appreciated the fact that the vendor included the batteries.  What an excellent concept!  I will add to this post if conditions change.
 Mouse is jumpy and can't do anything precise with it, especially when too far from receiver. Do not recommend.<br/><br/>to clarify: I only keep my mouse 1.5 feet away from receiver.
 I'm always losing the small USB port for the mouse. This is a relatively inexpensive replacement.
 Great quality.  I've had it almost a year and use it every day!!  Still going strong.  Kid strong.  It's used everyday in our homeschool by an 8 year old and has been manhandled and dropped many times.  Thanks, Amazon for a great product for an even better price.
 I bought this for use at my job in a hospital, and it has held up well to six months of near-daily use.  Fits well in the hand (I wear a size medium glove).  It tracks on just about any surface (unlike some other mice I have used), and two rechargeable AA batteries last me around two months.  There is a place in the battery compartment to store the tiny receiver when the mouse is not in use.
 I bought this wireless mouse to test the quality of Amazon Basics.<br/>First of all i liked it's package. No plastic or lamination used. 100% recyclable cardboard.<br/>In the package you find 2 AAA size batteries to use in mouse. This batteries are also from Amazon Basic and has good quality.<br/><br/>The mouse itself is made from very good plastic mat and gloss. It fits palm of your hand. Feels good when touching.<br/>I took unbox video which you can view here and here are few images which i took of the product.<br/><br/>Overall experienc is very good. I did not expected such quality.<br/>https://youtu.be/F2HRKO3mjXw
 Good Quality, works good as well. What needs work is the excessive use of the batteries by the appliance. If you are not use to turning off your mouse between uses you better start if you buy this one.
 Nice basic mouse. Fits the hand well. Priced very nicely.<br/>After using for awhile I find that it goes through Amazon Basic batteries very quickly. Still works well just having to put batteries in a lot. Could be the batteries I suppose. They are not very old and have not been recharged but a few times. Yes, they were freshly charged.
 Would 100% buy again soooo worth it. I lost my magic mouse and this is just as great if not better.
 Really the worst mouse I have ever used. After 2 weeks of use, I went back to using my worn out failing broken mouse. Here's why, The clicking feels really dampened, the mouse size is awkward and cramps up my hand, the movement is not smooth at all, If I am using it for Photoshop, it gets all jittery. I do not recommend this mouse as an everyday mouse.
 It is a good basic mouse, but with some issues. First, it eats the batteries too fast. I have rechargeable batteries, so it is not a problem for me, but for other people it can be a problem. Second, it is not really suitable for gaming, so you cannot expect decent performance while playing games. However, as a basic mouse it is comfortable, easy to install and cheap.
 Win 8.1 Pro.  "The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it"  About 50% of the time the mouse works.  When it does, it's great.  I thought the dongle was bad, Amazon replaced it, but the new one does the same thing. The PDF manual doesn't list Win8.1 support. There is no separate driver for this device that I could find (presumably because Windows should have it).  If I restart the computer, sometimes it will recognize the dongle properly.  Sometimes it malfunctions.  I cannot just restart multiple times whenever I want to use the mouse. I didn't see this problem in other reviews, but it happened with two sets of hardware for me, so I think it's a chronic problem.
 I have gone through three of these mice now in less than a year, and they have all failed in the same way. At some point, the laser either freezes or turns off and the mouse stops working. Switching it off and on again restores function for maybe a few minutes, until it faults off again. I've tried, for instance, replacing the batteries, reinstalling the mouse driver on my computer, troubleshooting my USB hardware.<br/><br/>When my second one died, Amazon kindly sent me a free replacement. However, after the replacement also failed in the same way, I invested in an only slightly more expensive model from a well-regarded brand.
 I was looking for a mouse for my laptop so I could navigate well while in my lectures, this is exactly what I needed. The size of the mouse makes it small enough to not be an issue to transport, but it's big enough that it's not a hassle to use. The moment I got it I was able to use it without the usual feeling that comes with changing equipment. It's called the Amazon Basics mouse for a reason though because it is the most basic wireless mouse you can get. It doesn't have any side buttons of advances sliding or anything, it just works. it may have been because I had very limited experience with wireless mice, but I was pleased to see that the usb receiver fit right between the batteries inside the mouse. Whenever I've seen previous mice they've either needed a large receiver that has to be synced or the usb receiver slides into the bottom, creating an uneven bottom. I would and have recommended this to friends.
 Fits perfectly in my smaller hand. The first one I tried was a little jumpy but the replacement works better, if not perfectly smooth. Good for the price.
 I hate working on laptop touchpads when I have to actually work. I bought this to use on vacation and still keep up with work. It worked great and connected within seconds. It is smaller than a standard mouse, but great for limited use for me.
 I am addicted to this brand for their price, but they keep dieing on me. 3 out of 5 died, and most of them withing 3 months after purchase. Replacing is easy though, and shipping is paid by Amazon.<br/><br/> Good for the price of 13$ on Aug 2015. Of course, I am sure it is not the battery, and not the computer,  nor simple things alike. Yes, restarted and troubleshooted.
 This mouse is easy to use and I love that the battery compartment also holds the nano receiver when you aren't using it! This mouse comes with batteries as well, which is great!
 My fault entirely - I didn't read the description well enough to realize it would take a USB port on my computer.  That defeated the purpose because I was trying to free up a port.  I thought it would work like my magic mouse and just KNOW what to do!  :)
 This was SO easy to install it was ridiculous! Great right out of the box! The best buy for the price ever! I will keep you updated because I have only had it for a couple of weeks but so far it has performed better out of the box than many more expensive wired and wireless mice than I have used over 15+ years! Will keep you posted but so far Amazon Basic rules!
 Worked fine out of the box.  Stopped working after about 2 1/2 months of use.  I would not recommend.
 I have an iMac running OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), and the mouse works perfectly.  I use software that requires the middle mouse button to work efficiently (Blender), and this mouse does the trick.  I've been through the usual collection of microsoft and logitech mice, and this one is far cheaper and every bit as good. 5 stars for the combination of price and functionality.
 Great little mouse for my work laptop. The whole thing has a slightly rubbery texture, which I like and makes it easy and comfortable to grip.  No frills, but exactly what I needed.
 I bought this for my school computer and I have to be changing the batteries constantly. It also lags sometimes, it's really annoying.
 A basic mouse that works great. Had for threee years now and have no complaints. Just replaced my batteries for the second time about a month ago
 This mouse was $11 when I purchased it. This mouse completely surpassed my expectations and is simply the best wireless mouse I have ever bought. I have owned a lot of Logitech wireless mice and this one is probably my favorite. The Logitech mice I drop $40-$90 on and I expect them to work like they do, simply because of the rep Logitech has, but this mouse is UNBELIEVABLE. Plug and play NO DRIVERS. I can take it anywhere and it.. Just.. Works.<br/><br/>One con? My left click was rigid, twice as hard to press as the right, possibly just something misaligned, because I just gave it a medium jolt to the side and I haven't had issues since. I would suspect mine to be the only one in a while since there are no other reviews with this problem.<br/><br/>If you are still considering buying this mouse.. Just buy it.. I'll pay you back if you don't like it..
 It's okay if you want a cheaper mouse. I don't find it that responsive. Also, the batteries are 2 AAA (instead of one AA like the others that I have) which is a pain. The batteries are also a little bit of a challenge to change (little plastic floppy thing inside is supposed to help you remove them, but it's still difficult sometimes).
 Easy to set up.  Step 1:  open the hatch on the underside, take out the micro-usb connector.  Step 2: place the micro-usb into an available port on your computer. Step 3: snap in the batteries; as shown in the photo.  Step 4:  turn the mouse switch ON, then push CONNECT.  Your mouse is ready to roll.
 Purchased in March 2016 to keep in my work travel bag.  Have not had any issues when needed to use laptop extensively during long meetings.  Would not use as an everyday mouse for work or home as there are more economical choices out there, such as the Logitech M320.
 Amazon is such an amazing company as far as quality and this mouse is no different.  I purchased the "best" logitech mouse and it was completely horrible , the lag time to move the cursor was enraging me!  I just received this Amazon branded one and it works flawlessly and feels very comfortable.  Cannot ask more in a mouse and the price is unbeatable.  I'd happily purchase anything Amazon brand and I'd be the first to purchase an Amazon Vehicle!
 This is an awesome little wireless mouse.  Very portable and easy to use on different machines.  This works very well on my MacBook Pro as well even though the description says it only supports Windows PC.  I bought this for my work laptop and am extremely satisfied.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  2/7/2012<br/><br/>This is the best little travel mouse I have ever owned.  Trust me it works great!  I use it everyday and often forget to turn it off since it does not have an auto-off option and it just keeps going and going.  I am very happy with this purchase.
 I bought this product a few years ago because I often get frustrated with laptop touchpads. The mouse still works fine, though I tend to use a wired mouse that came with my newest computer these days. The price is hard to beat. It gets the job done! There is a small amount of latency, which is understandable for wireless control, but if you are a competitive gamer in a fast-paced RTS or FPS game, you will likely need to look elsewhere.
 I like this mouse much better than the Logitech M305 wireless mouse.  It's a nicer shape, made of grippier rubberized material, and it's cheaper.  Also, the Logitech's mouse wheel is really hard to press (2/3 of the time, when I try to press that button, I end up spinning the wheel).<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is the Amazon logo.  It screams, "hey everyone, I'm too cheap to buy a name brand!"
 Works great, small, and i'll be buying more of amazon basics - can't beat the price and for great quality
 This mouse worked great at first, but it stopped working after about 6 months.  I've tried replacing the batteries, switching USB ports, turning the mouse/computer off and on again, and pushing the connect button.  The mouse appears to be turning on (I can see the red light on the bottom), but it no longer controls the pointer on my computer.  I'm pretty disappointed, and will be switching back to Logitech.
 Many of the other mouses sold have an annoying habit of shutting down if not used within ten minutes or so - this mouse does not and I am really enjoying not having to work around that "feature." This mouse works very well and had a very good price, I'm happy.
 It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I love how my Amazon products come with batteries, too. Thank you!
 I love the grippy feel of the mouse. The battery compartment is easy to access. There's a thin, flexible piece of clear plastic that gets positioned under the batteries for easy removal when it's time to change the batteries.  Small, easy to pocket.  Works great!!!!
 this mouse was a great price and super convenient. For the first two weeks i had no issues and everything went smoothly. The mouse has completely stopped working and, in the brief moment it works after switching USB ports, lags incredibly for 10 seconds and stops entirely. Paying a little extra for a reliable mouse is a way better move than having to buy a new one of these every two weeks
 I received this on May 10, 2017.  It is now August 17, 2017 and this mouse no longer works!!!  I'm very disappointed with this product and needless to say, won't advise anyone to order one of these.  Worse thing I've ever bought from Amazon!!!
 I'm sure it will work great, but the description should have said batteries not included and i would have ordered them.I'm sitting in a hotel with a gift shop that only sells AA batteries and I need AAA so the cost of having this overnighted was a waste!
 My job requires me to be at the computer, I use a desk top, many hours a day.  I just love this Mouse.  The one I had prior to this one was much bigger which I thought would be the best for keeping a relaxes posture with your hand.  Not so for me.  This small Amazon Mouse just feels effortless and comfortable.
 Feels very cheaply made and does not work all the time. I will be replacing it vary soon.
 Surprisingly pleased with this wireless mouse.  Works great and have not had any complaints.  I'm kind of clumsy so it has been dropped several times, kicked a few, etc, and is still holding up well.  The batteries that were included from Amazon have actually lasted longer than I expected they would as well.  Would buy again if needed, but its still working great.
 Very nice mouse, smooth rolling.  I like the storage inside the mouse for the little usb.  Would definitely buy again if I needed another one.
 I love this mouse!  It reminds me of the Dell corded mouse I got with my last desktop PC.  I really like how the scroll button works.  When you roll the wheel, it is not a fluid movement but a movement that kind of clicks down the page in sections.  I like that.  Also, it is very comfortable in your hand and the USB adaptor is very inconspicuous.  It is very well designed.  Well done Amazon!!!<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this to a friend!
 I was surprised at the range on this.  I use it with a raspberry Pi, and control it from my couch to the TV.  I have had this about two months now, and haven't had to change the battery yet.  The receiver is nice and small as well, which is much better than the Microsoft mice I have previously used.
 I needed a mouse that had a smaller USB connection piece that I could just leave plugged into my laptop regardless of where I was going (even without the mouse). This is it and the product works great.<br/><br/>I never have issues connecting with the mouse and laptop.<br/><br/>The one downside is the fact that it uses AAA batteries. This is a personal preference as I would want to have AA if I could choose.
 if you just consider the price. it's okay. but the problem is it does not have precise locator, I mean you can't focus easily on very small buttons which I was able to do with my asus mouse that come with their laptops. Maybe this is because dpi. make better purchase if you can. it also has plain packaging with nothing special. very simple. at all it is okay
 Good basic mouse, but burns through batteries. First I thought it was just the generic set that came with it that was the issue, but it burnt through some name brand batteries in no time too. Another mouse bought at the same time, with more features, is still on the first set of batteries. This mouse will end up getting replaced in the future.
 This mouse works very nicely.  I would have preferred one that automatically slept when not in use, but this fit my budget.  There's so much going on I never remember to actually turn the button to the off  position (which is underneath the mouse), but the batteries still tend to last several months.  All-in-all, I'm very happy with it.
 This is a good, no frills wireless mouse at a decent price. I have small hands, so this is more comfortable for me to use than larger ergonomic mice. The receiver seems to have a good range. I've used it up to 2.5 feet away with no signal problems.
 In fact, I think this is probably the best wireless mouse out there.<br/><br/>I've tried the Logitech thing, and that wasn't pleasant at all. This one is far more reliable, and tough!  My wife drops hers all of the time, and it always survives, and keeps on working. I like it so much I purchased 3 additional ones for laptops.<br/><br/>Only downside is no side buttons for forward/backward browsing. But I can overlook that due to how great these are.
 Very sensitive but a great mouse once I became accustomed to it. Easy to use, turn on and off, and set up. You just plug the wireless part into your USB and it sets up automatically. You can easily switch the mouse off when not in use to conserve battery life. It has a good feel to it and is weighted well. I bought a mousepad to go with it, but that wasn’t really necessary as the laser style mouse works fine on a smooth surface, unlike the classic rollerball mice.
 Bought two, ut one has stopped working regularly.  Seems the on/off switch is loose and causes mouse to stop functioning until I fuss with it.  So, the other ones ok, but does nto get as much use as this one.  Otherwise, a good item for the price.
 Incredibly easy to install and operate.  Can't really speak to battery life, as I am still on the original batteries.
 I tried to use this for my work laptops but it wouldn't connect and I tried two different laptops. The USB piece also broke after trying it on the 2nd laptop
 I LOVE this purchase. I am very happy with it.<br/><br/>I was looking for a mouse to go with my laptop. I attend a lot of lectures, and want to work while someone is talking. Working on excel sheets gets too burdensome on a traditional track pad. This solved my problem.<br/><br/>It is very portable and works great. It takes up no space in my backpack, yet feels like a very comfortable mouse in my hand.<br/><br/>I recommend this to any student/employee who needs to work a mouse, and the track-pad is just too burdensome to click, drag, and paste.<br/><br/>Great purchase. Not a lemon. Considering buying this for my desktop as well...
 Did NOT work with my macbook pro with operating system OS X (which Amazon says is compatible with this mouse). Computer first recognized it as a keyboard, which obviously it is not. Then it would not recognize the mouse at all. Had to return. Cost me a lot of time, energy, and productivity. Caution if you have a mac.
 This is the best mouse to buy if you're looking for a simple mouse without all those extra buttons and features. Had it for almost 3 years now and still works like new.
 I'm using this with my Macbook Pro for school. I had to install Parallels to run Windows on my Mac for a program at school, and some of the Windows features only work with mouse. This was a great solution. Is portable, easy to use, works, has little storage space for the usb thing on the underside.
 This is a great little mouse for the price. It fits nicely in my hand and all I had to do to set it up was plug in the USB receiver. I give it 4 stars because I wish the mouse would automatically turn off after being idle or have a more conveniently located on/off switch to conserve battery. That, or I would like to see it be rechargeable but otherwise pretty good.
 So far it is working well. I am relieved I do not have to put up with cords. Also I love the fact that you can store the Nano Receiver inside the wireless mouse when not using or for the sake of traveling. What a great idea. I did not see any others that had this feature. Also works great on desk, bed, sofa or books so it makes for easy use in any setting.
 I love this mouse! This is my first wireless mouse, and it was everything I was hoping it to be. It is smaller, about the size of a palm, which is nice. The shape is thoughtfully ergonomic, which makes for comfortable computer working; seriously my favorite mouse I have ever used. The click feels like a solid click; not too sensitive, leading to accidental clicks. The price point was the determining factor for the purchase, but I am completely satisfied with the quality.
 Biggest waste of time, first time buying some type of Amazon Basics Product. The Nano Receiver that they claim was placed in between the batteries was missing! I dont know what type of quality check they do there at Amazon but I would have been better off buying from a private buyer. Since i need wireless mouse to do my work I will be buying one from Walmart. Waste of TIME!
 Got this for my security camera system as it it mounted on the wall and did not want another dangling wire!  Works great and satisfied with quality and price!
 Battery hog, even when you turn the switch off when not using.  Constantly looses signal to the the USB connector.  Worst mouse I have ever owned and unfortunately I bought two.
 Reliable mouse that I've used for a few years now. It doesn't drain the two triple-A batteries fast at all and I've only had to swap them out 2 times. Feels solid and is the wireless USB works well. No noticeable delay or lag when using the mouse. Great as a laptop mouse but overall could be used for anything. Definitely would recommend for the price.
 Simple and great for the price!  There's not much to it and that's actually a good thing- works like a charm and it's truly plug and play.  I love it when things are so intuitive that I really don't have to overthink installation of yet another gadget.  Thanks for making this simple and very effective, Amazon!
 This mouse stopped working. I'd reseat the batteries and it would go out soon after. Apparently the holder is poorly designed
 It worked well while it lasted. Suddenly, one day the mouse didn't work anymore. It does turn the red lights on, and when I plug the miniUSB to the PC, it makes the typical sounds for a connected usb device, but the mouse just doesn't work. I don't know what happened. Besides that, as other person stated in the reviews, the miniUSB adapter is bad quality made. When I tried to pull it out, the metallic part of it get stucked in the USB connector.<br/><br/>I recommend you to go for another brand if you want a reliable mouse. You can go either Microsoft or Logitech (not the M510).
 have used it for some time with no problems at all.  Seems to be an excellent product at a very reasonable price.
 Plug and play!  Good storage for the usb part that plugs into the cpu inside the mouse.  The usb part is really small so you dont even know its there.  I have not had much experience with the battery time, but the mouse is perfectly not too small and not too big for travel or easy storage.
 Bought this to go along with a laptop I purchased elsewhere (not from Amazon, it came from a big store that starts with a W and ends with a T). So far this mouse works great for the money and I have had no issues whatsoever from it.<br/><br/>There is a little receiver card or whatever that plugs into the computer's usb port and automatically recognizes the mouse, so there is no need to search for drivers or do any of the sometimes annoying computer related intellectual heavy-lifting that one might associate with a product of this nature.<br/><br/>For being a basic, utilitarian mouse that gets the job done this thing is great. 100% satisfied and would recommend to strangers on the internet.
 Doesn't work on both USB connections.  I think that is a problem with my computer<br/>  Not a fault of the product.
 This connects super quickly to the computer and starts working immediately after connecting.  It scrolls and moves really smoothly and feels great in the hand with a grippy matte top.  I've had a number of wireless mouses including logitech and this is just as good if not better.  I've been using for about 3 months every day most of the day and the batteries haven't run out yet.  For the price, I don't think you can beat it.
 I don't know what to do with the plastics in the back!! It should come off easily, but I pulled so hard yet it still couldn't come off. Is it suppose to stay there(but this doesn't make sense?).<br/>Other than that, the mouse looks good and it's functioning. It's a little bit uncomfortable holding it at first, but got used to it. The speed is good and it's smooth across the screen.
 The power rating for this mouse is 50mA, if you were shopping based on power usage.<br/><br/>This is an OK mouse. The mouse is very comfortable with the soft-touch at the top and the contoured sides. The scroll wheel is silent when moving slowly. The mouse works as soon as I plugged in the USB receiver and turn on the mouse; didn't even need to hit the connect button.<br/><br/>But, there are some downside. It is too small; need different sizes. There is no way to tell what the DPI is. The low battery indicator stop flashing after moving the mouse or clicking one of the button. This mouse could have used an AA battery to boost its life (3+ months with AAA). The plastic strip that is use to pull out the batteries could be a little higher.because it feels like the battery, next to the end of the strip, was stuck. The scroll wheel became louder after a while of usage.
 Great little mouse that works really well with a basic felt mouse pad. It looks and works quite well being black and cordless. I have been using mine on my desktop for a few months and just ordered one for my boyfriend'd laptop use too. When I use laptops away from home, I find myself wishing I had this little mouse on me. At this price, I could easily buy a third and make it my travel mouse. You can't change the weight, but it is already an appropriate weight for the size. The compact size is also good for my small desk, traveling, being minimal.
 This is a replacement mouse I had for years. Works great does not survive a fall down stairs
 I bought a new laptop and so I bought this mouse.  It's worked great.  I often forget to turn it off and so far haven't had to change the batteries in 5 months.  It's nothing fancy but I like it.  I use the scroll wheel a lot and am at my computer for much of most days.  It's perfect for what it is.
 What is there to say when you can buy something that is *1* a good price, *2*, works as promised, and last but not least comes from a source that does not let you hanging if it does not work !
 I bought two of these things. I thought they'd be crappy and I wouldn't cry if they broke. Its been about a year now and both of them are still chuggin along, despite the beatings my toddlers have given them. I'm pleasantly surprised. and 10 bucks isn't a horrible price either.
 Great product that works well, and at a good price. I bought a second one for my other computer because these are flawless and nice to use.
 It's crap.  The battery compartment is badly designed - super difficult and it stopped functioning after a minimal a amout of use (it's not my main mouse, so it's hard to say exactly but maybe the equivalent of three weeks of use).
 This is a great little wireless mouse. I've had it for quite a few months now and have had no issues with it (I use it with Windows 8). Super easy to use right out of the box. It is a little smaller than the mouse I had previously and I wondered if I would like that, but I adapted quickly and don't mind it at all. My dad (with large hands) has also used the mouse and said he didn't feel it was too small.
 Stopped working after 8 months (turn it off and on it works for a few seconds, then red laser light on bottom dies, tried three sets of new batteries, same story) Clicking on "return Item" results in a "too late to return" message;  but, it also says it was covered "under warranty".  I contacted customer service and after about 10 minutes on the phone they're sending me a new one free of charge.
 Range was rather weak.  Couldn't stay smooth for usage over 2 feet from receiver.  Instead purchased TeckNet Nano Cordless Optical Mouse M002 2.4 GHz, Grey which is AMAZING (and cheaper).  In the products defense, I did nothing to troubleshoot various frequencies of resistance.  I just plugged it in, tried it, and tossed it.  (Not worth the time/effort to return it for the $11)
 I really like the mouse.  I was burning through batteries with my old mouse.  My sense is that the better technology of this new mouse is better and more efficient.
 This is a great mouse and it works just fine for me I would buy the same one again
 Basic mouse. Nothing special. Good price. Used for lightly used laptops at a non-profit. Great for saving a buck on a home device, but I'd spend the extra money on a Logitech or Microsoft mouse if this is for heavy business or a home office. My hand is on the large side and I found it was just a bit small.
 One of the best and easiest to use wireless mouse I have owned.  Would definitely purchase this again.  Works much better than others out there for more money.  This is an opportunity to save and enjoy with good accurate flow.
 I use daily at work with my laptop. It works great. Everyone asks me where I got it!
 I ordered one of these a while back, and it worked great. Unfortunately, I lost it and had to order another one. The most recent one I ordered stopped working after five months. I tried all the common fixes: new batteries, putting the USB in different slots, uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. Disappointed that this mouse isn't reliable.
 This mouse is great.  I love the color and the price.  It moves easily, but isn't too touchy.
 I got my Amazon Basics wireless mouse several weeks ago and I am very satisfied with it.  It seems to be constructed very well and the price is RIGHT !  I guess the nicest feature is the fact that I won't have any more tangled wires coming from my mouse to worry about.  I recommend Amazon Basics and I hope that they keep coming out with more and more products.
 I no longer have to get up and look sideways at my TV from my computer to select movies on Amazon. I have a dual screen so I can drag my computer screen to my plasma TV. This makes it a breeze as I can see it straight on now. Works great, even without a mouse pad. I just use my TV tray ;)
 I have not been able to see the + and - in the battery compartment even with a flashlight. I used the illustration in the quick start guide. Installing the batteries is awkward as was putting the battery compartment cover back.<br/><br/>Once all the above is done, the mouse seems to work without any problem.
 This is the perfect little mouse for my laptop. I love how well it fits in my petite hands and how light weight it is. I don't feel like I am holding on a rock when trying to play games online or browse the web. I normally buy the small microsoft mouses but this is definitely my new choice for my laptop as it's affordable and meets my needs for my small hands.
 It’s. A mouse. It works fine.  Although after 1 yr the battery door sometimes pops off Unexpectedly
 I've used this mouse for about a month now, and it's worked well enough I don't have to think about it.
 I purchased this mouse at the end of July 2018, it is now Oct 18th and the darn thing stopped working about 2 weeks ago. I've changed the batteries several times to no avail. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
 Frequently drops the connection and the on-off button at the bottom is just long enough to prevent the mouse from being level. Cheap mouse but you can get better mouse for the same price
 Attempted install on my Laptop as soon as it arrived. My computer was working well until I tried to install this mouse. For some reason, during install, I got the "black screen of death". Now my new computer will not work after trying several times with the computer vendor's customer service team. My computer will be returned and I will trash this mouse.
 It's a nice mouse but the battery life has been horrendous for my Windows laptop. I've replaced the batteries almost once a week. I have a Logitech mouse for my Chromebook and it lasts almost a year on one battery. Is this mouse defective, poor battery efficiency or am I doing something wrong?
 This mouse did last a month. It used triple A batteries that did not last. I replaced it with a name brand mouse and that one works excellent.
 If you need a wireless mouse I highly recommend the AmazonBasics Wireless mouse with Nano Receiver.  Simply load the batteries (they come with the mouse), plug the Nano receiver into your USB, turn the mouse on and your mouse is up and running.  How easy!  The mouse is economical, and has a great ergonomic design.
 A agree with all the positive reviews, I especially like the nano receiver as it doesn't stick out from the computer, on off switch extends battery life
 if you need a basic mouse, this one works just fine. the only thing i didn't like is that after a period of inactivity on my laptop (like if it goes to sleep), i'd have to disconnect the usb and reconnect it so that it connects with the mouse again (even if left on). it's not a huge problem, just can be annoying. also it's battery operated and it comes with batteries which is nice.
 Terrific, cost-effective mouse for my MacBook Pro. I have been using it for months, and it works very well. I try to remember to turn it off occasionally, or when I travel, so that I don't wear out the 2 AAA batteries.
 Very inconsistent movement tracking: stops and starts.  Very frustrating to use.  Won't buy an Amazon branded product again.  I'm sure most of these are fine, but this one is crap.<br/>UPDATE: this mouse works MUCH better when less than 3 feet away from the computer.  Description should state SHORT RANGE.
 I have bought a few items from Amazon's basics: cables, batteries, etc. All of them are really well priced and perform well.  This mouse is not the exception.  It is small for portable use, just be aware of that.  It is not sized as a regular mouse, but that's why my 4-year old loves it so much.  My wife likes it too.  I would not use it as my every day mouse, but for portable uses its very good.  The USB dongle is storable inside the mouse itself.
 This was the second time I bought this product, because the first one broke when I switched the batteries.  I assumed this was a user error, but then it happened to the second one. The exact same part broke when I pulled the battery out. Very disappointing. Works fine until you have to switch the batteries though.
 The battery life is not long as in Logitech mouses. This mouse is not suitable for everyday use at work otherwise keep spare batteries. For work, I'll buy a Logitech mouse and will use this mouse at home. I'm tired of changing batteries in these mouse. Mouses from Logitech can really work from batteries several times longer than the other mouse. I do not understand why people give high marks for this mouse. I changed the 6 sets of batteries per year of use!
 I love basic things.  Put in the batteries, plug the adapter into a USB port and start using it.  What could be better.  I found this mouse to be accurate without being twitchy.  Best of all, NO software to mess with.  No software engineer trying to impress you with how smart he is in creating unnecessarily complicated and unusable software.
 Never thought a mouse would be that big of a deal.  Having it be wireless makes the desk so less cluttered.  Also much easier to pack up and take with when the lap top goes home from work with me.
 This is a perfectly fine mouse at a good price, but it eats batteries like no other!  I have to replace the two AAA batteries every month.  Consider that when comparing prices.

Replace the battery and it still doesn't work..
 Mouse is really sort of small in your hand.  Sometimes it get hard to control courser, jumps all over the screen.  Mouse is worth what you pay for it.
 Good feel.  Good battery life. My only complaint is with the double click function. Does not respond well with a rapid double click. Needs a conscious delay between clicks to respond.  No apparent software driver to customize the Mouse behavior.
 Great responsive mouse.  Smaller in size but perfect for smaller hands.  Battery ran out pretty quickly, however I did not utilize the power off button on the bottom.
 I got this a year ago because the trackpad on my laptop was a mess so I got this and disabled the laptop one. I never had to replace the battery since! It works as good as any mouse but this was really cheap. A lot of my friends also have this.
 It is not phenomenal, but for the price it wouldn't be.  It is solid and effective though!
 I`ve tried 5 wireless and Bluetooth mouse for my Chromebook and this is by FAR the best one. It works flawlessly  and no scrolling issues, really smooth. Highly recommended.
 A great economy mouse solution.  Mine only lasted a bit over a year, but for the price, I'd buy again.
 Bought for my wife who had cords all over the place. This is a real bargain.<br/><br/>What I really liked was the little (about 1/2 inch square) USB insert that came inside the battery case.<br/><br/>Open the battery case cover, remove the USB insert, put it in your laptop, insert the batteries (came with it) and you're operational.<br/><br/>It's as sensitive as you want to make it and works great. Wife wishes I'd bought it sooner.
 Great quality and comfortable. I normally don't use a mouse for my laptop but I purchased one for school. It work great and there was no trouble setting it up. The cover for the batteries is quite loose but it's not a deal breaker for the price it was purchased at.
 I needed a new mouse; and as I live in the country, ordering from Amazon was the quickest, easiest and least expensive way of replacement.<br/>It was quickly downloaded; the batteries (Which are included) were a snap to insert, it fits perfectly into my hand and so far I've had no complaints. I especially like that it has an On/Off switch, as my older one did not.<br/>Amazon Basics and Prime; a perfect way to shop.
 My last mouse was Dell for $30, this was $10.  The Dell had to keep being connected to blue tooth, slowing up my work.  After several years and I mean years of this I bought the Amazon one.  Not once did have to install driver due to lost connection!  Also it says color is purple - more like fuschia my favorite color.  Very happy with such a small item!
 Honestly, fantastic mouse for when I used it. I'm a graduate student, and need a mouse that can handle my course work. I've been using this for about a year now, and last weekend it just stopped working for me. I changed the batteries, and replugged the reciever but no progress.
 At first it worked great and then all of a sudden I couldn't get the mouse pointer and the mouse in sink so I move real slow and it might stay but other than that it works great
 Great Mouse.....not Mickey either! Received it on time and as promised. Installed the batteries (make sure you read those instructions carefully). plugged the pick-up into a USB port, and I was in business in 10 seconds. I like that this one has an on-off switch. I have gotten so use to using a mouse that I needed this for my laptop. Great price too!
 Works very well, but the metal on the USB dongle separates and sometimes stays lodged in my computer. Easy to remove with pliers, but kind of a pain. I think I've fixed it by crimping the metal a little bit, but shouldn't have to do that.
 No hassle. Long battery life. Makes long hours working at laptop easier. Easier on wrists. Works on most surfaces.<br/><br/>Stopped working altogether after two years. One weird feature was that the left click button sometimes unclicked on its own when I was holding it down.
 So far so good on a iMac running El Capitan.<br/><br/>Replaces the "double-click" wonder Logitech M705.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Its for small hands<br/>has no side buttons ( I overlooked this but wife did not use those anyway)<br/>scroll wheel needs an option to remove the detents you feel as you scroll
 Had to try every port on my laptop and, of course, it was the last one I tried that worked.  I don't get that.  I like the storage inside the mouse for the connector BUT the size of the actual  mouse is very uncomfortable.  It is too short for my hand and too long just my fingers.  Made for men?  Don't know - it just doesn't feel right.
 I just needed your basic, everyday mouse. This fits the bill! Worked right out of the package. The bluetooth captured immediately. No muss, no fuss!
 Instructions in error.  But, a lovely little thing.  very precise and sensitive and scrolling seems good, too.<br/><br/>But the dang directions tell you to put both batteries in + side first.  They meant to tell you the left one goes  + first the right one goes - pole first. THEN it will work, not before.
 Seems pretty decent and doesn't fight with a logitech wireless in the same room.  Doesn't handle couch fabric well at all, turn off at night to conserve batteries, and use a magazine as a mouse pad for that.
 This mouse started out great.  However, we have only owned it for three months and I have already replaced the batteries in it twice.  Other devices that I have owned haven't gone through batteries this quickly - and I use them more each day than I have this one.  Find a different mouse to buy and use!!!
 Remarkable quality at this price point.  I've had Logitech devices that were much more expensive that did not feel as solid.  This device is simple and appears well made, does its job, and is priced very well.  What's not to like?
 It is red, works very well. W-10 picked it up right away.  Smooth as silk.
 Simple product, works perfectly every time.  This mouse has no bells or whistles, but it performs flawlessly.<br/><br/>UPDATE- July 19, 2016.  This mouse still functions perfectly.  Yesterday the AAA batteries finally died.  14 months of use, I think that's pretty good.  Installed 2 new batteries and it's good to go, hopefully until September, 2017.
 Exactly as described. Installation was seamless. Use equally with left or right hand. Textured surface for "positioning" feed back.Scroll wheel has preset positions rather than infinite scrolling.
 I've had to replace this mouse at least twice because it ALWAYS just stops working on me after about a year of use. I'm not getting this mouse again because it just doesn't last. The actual make of the mouse is great but don't count on it working forever.
 The mouse works great. Glides well. Does have "clicking noise" when right or left click but I don't mind. I hooked it into my computer and it worked immediately and started on with my computer searches.  My old mouse wasn't working well. For the price it works well and haven't had any problems for over a month with it at all.
 This was a replacement unit for one that failed. I gets very little use as it's for a back up computer. It (the replacement) just failed again.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
 I really like that this mouse can be turned on and off to preserve the battery life. Works great, would buy again!
 Been through a lot of wireless mouse's over the years and pretty much stayed with the name brands. This mouse fit the bill and works well. Lots of bang for the buck.
 I've had this mouse at work for a year or more now. Very simple easy to use. I work as an engineer, produce design drawings. All I want is a simple mouse that is accurate and this has worked very well.
 This mouse is not expensive, but it has a nice feel to it, a bit rubberized.  It's quite comfortable in my small hands.  It also doesn't have fifty extra buttons to accidentally click.  It does the basics and it does them well.<br/><br/>I took one star off because the nano receiver can be a bit of a pain to get in and out of the body of the mouse.
 Performed as a mouse should. Although not tiny, I liked the smaller size.
 This was for the Acer Chromebook 14, full 14 inch HD........<br/>I hate using those pads, the mouse is wonderful to compliment the Chromebook. You should always buy a mouse with a laptop/Chromebook. It makes browsing and moving around 99% easier! Great buy!
 At this price, I always buy 2... I end up dropping, breaking, or losing them - but they are so cheap and reliable, I don't mind. The only wireless mouse I will buy.
 Bought as a gift for my sister, who very much needed a mouse to control her Chromebook that's hooked to her TV. More than works for that and plugged into whatever else she's hooked it up to. Affordable and hassle free!
 Maybe mine was an exception -- but it does not sit flat on any surface. It rocks around like a 4-legged table with one short leg. This is very irritating. Functional, it does what it's supposed to do -- but the constant rocking every time you click it is very irritating. The good thing is that Amazon's customer service is -- as always -- great. I asked for a refund. It was done right away -- without the need to return this mouse that rocks around the clock.
 I bought this for my parent's last year for Christmas.  Then, I chose it because it looked functional and cheap.<br/><br/>When I played around with my parent's mouse, I enjoyed the basic functionality of it (it works and does its job as needed), so when I needed a new mouse I new I would get a good deal with this one.  No complaints yet from me or my parents!  It travels nicely, the receiver is small and it works on a variety of surfaces.<br/><br/>Would buy again!
 If you just need a basic mouse for a good price this is it. We have one for each computer.
 I'm sticking with Logitech. The cursor shakes all over the screen, even when not in use. I work with layout software, and many option buttons are very close together. This became infuriating real fast. AmazonBasics makes other good tech products for a great price. Just not this.
 Nice. It's on most of the time, 24H. Battery is good for about 2 month. What are we going to do without China.
 This was a replacement for usage with my desktop.  Simple to install and adjustments to fit my needs!
 Works great. I lost the bottom cover to the mouse almost immediately, but the batteries and the wireless nano transmitter (which plugs into an empty USB port on your computer) both stay in, no problems. The scroll wheel is simple, it just works. The mouse feels good in my hand (I'm average size), and isn't shiny, which I appreciate. Recommended for anyone need an inexpensive but good wireless mouse.
 I am very satisfied with the mouse. I purchased it because I got tired of using thed "Bluetooth" mouse and wanted one that I could leave the receiver attached without having to remove it everytime. This works perfectly!☺
 Have used several of these mice on laptops and desktops, reliable performance, happy with product!
 Cheap works great, comfortable and scrolls well.  It's a bit smaller than my wired mouse which concerned me.  But it's not "that" much smaller and much more comfortable in the hand.  It's also nice to have one less wire in the back of my computer.  I'll probably get another one for office I like it that much.
 This is a surprisingly good mouse. I selected it due to the features (you can store the USB part in the mouse itself as an example) and the strong reviews. Was not disappointed. If you are in the market for a no frills - but decent mouse, look no further. So far, in the few weeks I have used it, it has been very good.
 The Amazon design team clearly wanted to create an exceptional mouse. It's pretty. It fits a palm nicely. The click force and distance are fine. The scroll is smooth. So the mouse works well. But what's the secret to removing/replacing the batteries? It shouldn't be difficult on the way to impossible. Gather the team. They can improve this, surely.
 I've had this mouse since the end of October and it worked GREAT...until today. Only five months later and it stopped working (of course I replaced the batteries, etc.). I guess I should have trusted the reviews. :-(
 I'm on my second mouse. First one lasted about 2 years before it stopped clicking. Can't really complain because of the price. Make sure you get some rechargeable batteries, you won't regret it.
 I use this mouse at work everyday and haven't had any problems. This is perfect.
 The form factor and the material is quite nice and perfect.<br/><br/>BUT, the mouse I received was not stable on a plane surface. Though the wobble might be visually minute to the naked eye,<br/>the considerable left to right wobble is especially noticeable with daily use and very uncomfortable and quite frustrating.<br/><br/>Also the the scroll wheel gets stuck most of the times when scrolling a webpage which is irritating.<br/><br/>I could not find a fix for the wobble or the scroll wheel which is clean. This was quite a deal breaker for me since overall the mouse is perfect.<br/><br/>Update: Battery Life is pathetic, have used 3 pairs of AAAs in 6 months of use
 was a bit small in hand which made extended use a hassle and made my had tired
 I purchased this with the original intent of occasional gaming with my touchscreen laptop. Windows 8 recognized it not even a second after plugging in the receiver. This mouse has great sensitivity and is very comfortable. So much in fact that I have not even used the touchscreen or touchpad since I got it. This mouse has a somewhat softer rubber-like coating on it and will show evidence of how you hold it but its not an issue for me. I've only had it for a week so far so I will report back with the battery life when they start to go. Great mouse!<br/><br/>UPDATE: It has been 3 months of constant use of this mouse (2-3 hours a day) and the original batteries are still going!
 I bought this for my mom. This little fella is a great mouse. It has very good range for the transmitter/receiver. Just plugged in the RF transmitter/receiver, Windows installed the drivers, I made a pointer speed adjustment in Windows and it was ready to point and click. Mom was very happy cause she had her clicker back inside of 2 minutes and she was back to watching her TV shows again.
 It worked well...for about two weeks before the NEW  batteries needed replacing.<br/>Now a bout a month later, it's "wonky" and not worth the fuss and bother of replacing.<br/>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
 pure junk...the pointer likes to slide across the screen even when the mouse isn't moving...trying to pick on a button can be a real chore...I went back to a wired mouse which works like magic compared to this cheap cheap cheap piece of garbage...buy ANYTHING else and save yourself some trouble...
 Works very well.  The only downside I have discovered is that it uses up the two AAA Amazon Batteries very quickly.  My old Logitech mouse that used one AA battery lasted probably 5 times as long.  However, I will continue to use Amazon Basics products because all that I have purchased have worked very well.
 Very basic wireless mouse. Put the battery in, put the stick in the computer's USB port and you are set. The ONLY drawback I have encountered is the fidgetiness. In order to get smooth results I had to use a mousepad. I haven't had a wireless mouse that required one so I felt a bit annoyed. Luckily, I found some old ones no one used anymore stashed at the office.
 I have a macbook air, but I often use it with my desktop screen. I have a wireless bundle- a keyboard and a mouse by Microsoft -but I was not happy with the mouse so I wanted give AmazonBasics a chance. This mouse scores poorly. It flickers, goes jumpy. I am not even sure if this is a defective one. It is that bad. I tried it with different mousepads, different batteries, bluetooth on/off, other electronic devices on/off. I hate it.
 For the price, it works great. Bought one for my mom in law and she enjoys it. It is incredibly simple and uses two AAA batteries, and there is a plastic strip to help pull out the batteries should you need it. Also there is an on/off button. It doesn't have side buttons for page navigation, but it's not a big deal! Overall a great purchase and will buy again if needed.
 Great mouse.  Built well with solid feel.  Much better than the logitech mouse I replaced.
 Works fine so far. Used as a desktop spare in case of mouse-pad, trackball, air-mouse failure or batteries need changing/charging.
 This mouse keeps stuttering, doesn't matter which computer I use it on or if the batteries get replaced
 I'm using this wireless mouse with my new tablet docking station. Installation was easy, and precision tracking is very good. I like that the USB wireless stub (receiver) packs away inside the mouse body - nice. Mouse size and shape it my hand perfectly. Sturdy built design. Two AAA batteries should offer longer battery life, usage.
 This mouse worked well for about 3 months and then when it was sitting still, it would start jittering the curser everywhere and made it hard to click on things. About 1.2 years later- it totally died. It was lightweight and did it's job for a while but would not purchase again. It died just after one year so the one year warranty didn't cover it. So aggravating.
 I purchased this wireless mouse and it worked fine for about 1 month and then not....Not only did the mouse stop working, but the dongle got stuck in my USB port because it separated from the casing. Super poor quality, spend a few more bucks and get something that will last - I went back to Logitech, never had a problem with them...
 I have small hands so sometimes wireless mice are way too large. This one fits comfortably and I love the purple.
 works fine, very sluggish.  Update-  works well on a hard flat surface
 I have two of these. I don't use them every day. They have worked great so far though. Great value for the money. They USB adapter is nice and small so I leave it plugged in, no problem.
 Constantly loses connection to my computer, very frustrating. Need to unplug the USB receiver several times before it reboots. Not worth it
 Purchased Nov 2017.  Started using it Dec 2017.  By Feb 1 2018 the mouse no longer functioned.  I have a 6 year old Logitech wireless mouse that still works great on the same laptop, same USB port.  I tried all practical troubleshooting measures (batteries, connection, change USB port).  Good look, good feel, poor performance.  My first bad experience with an Amazon Basics item.
 I thought I liked this mouse.  The price was right, maybe too right.  But over time I've realized that the scroll wheel is too slick, no grooves or texture.  So to scroll you actually have to press hard enough that it clicks the mouse into page scroll mode.  Super annoying.  I tried cutting my own grooves into the scroll wheel but to no avail.  It still happens.  I bought two of these to replace my mice for both workstations.  I regret now.#FirstWorldProblems
 Bought 2 of these for the office. People loved them overall. A few people had to give theirs back to me for one reason or another but that also happens with the logitech mice, so.. pretty good basic wireless mouse. No thumb button, which is sad if you're used to one and which is why I don't consider this good for certain games.
 Never could get it to work on a Windows 7 machine.  Battery compartment hatch is cheap and hard to keep on. It is not clear which way the batteries insert, but trying it both ways and trying newer batteries didn't help.  Arrived DOA. It's being returned.
 The problem with this mouse is it does NOT auto turn off when not in use so the batteries will go<br/>bad in about 3 months. I've got 3 in 3 PC's and they all do the same. Also now having trouble with<br/>the pointer jumping all over.
 Not sure if its just me or what but since I've had it it's been extremely frustrating to own this mouse. Connectivity is intermittent at best. Seems to have trouble keeping a steady signal to the nano receiver or perhaps something else in my house is causing interference, Either way it's a pain.
 This is the sorriest wireless mouse you can buy.  It just keeps stopping to work.  I called customer service and I should have asked for my money back but I asked them to send me another one and now its not working.  Please don't waste your money on this high priced piece of crap.
 Product works sometimes, but cuts out on me a lot. I keep thinking it is the batteries, but it is not. Just stops working sometimes.
 I waa using it with a chromebook, at the beginning it was working good but after an our it stopped, I can't click on anything, the cursor is visible but that's all. I thought it was because I was using with the Chromebook, so I tried with my macbook but it didn't work either. I don't know what to do because I was soo excited with the mouse and with all the good reviews.
 For the price, this mouse is amazing .. very well made, and the Bluetooth adapter fits very nicely into the compartment at the bottom of the mouse. Perfect for having in your laptop bag, as the quality and design is such that it will survive getting mixed in with the power adapters and other junk that inevitably fills your work bag.
 It's so much more sluggish than the wired version of the same mouse.  I was so disappointed, because I absolutely LOVE the wired mouse.  This one doesn't move smoothly over the desk, and there is a noticeable lag in performance.
 This is an acceptable mouse for occasional use but I find it a bit clunky for constant use. It feels a bit sluggish.  I have medium/small hands so that may be why I prefer the slightly shorter and more sculpted Logitech.<br/><br/>I prefer this one even though the Logitech is 10% heavier it feels more responsive.<br/>Logitech 910-003121 M325 Wireless Mouse for Web Scrolling
 Great for petite hands!! I love how soft the material is. Those with bigger hands might not find it as comfy. This mouse is sensitive and agile. I've used it on really slick surfaces and it still works well. You don't need a lot of maneuvering space either.
 Fantastic wireless mouse, works great.  Only thing I wish it did was turn off automatically after non-use, but you have to turn it off manually.  I always forget.  Also, the place to house the receiver isn't super convenient (it's in the battery compartment).  But for temporary/travel purposes, this is a great buy - good solid quality product.
 Just received it today and I love it already.  I needed a mouse to use with my Surface 3 and it worked as soon as I plugged it in.  It also works on all different surfaces with no issues. I literally used this on my bed and I was honestly surprised how well it worked. It is also a decent size, not too big and not too small.
 Mice (mouses) get a lot of use.  This one seems to go the distance.
 Everything about this mouse is great - except for the way the batteries load. They are at an angle and easily wiggle out of pocket, making the mouse go dead. As long as the batteries remain tight, everything is fine. Once this mouse dies for the last time, it will be replaced with a Logitech one.
 Very good technology at a great price. Unfortunately, the enclosed batteries leaked an irritating liquid on my fingers when I opened the sealed package. The mouse works great using other batteries, but the batteries shouldn't leak. If the batteries had been faultless I'd have rated this 5 stars.
 This is a great, reliable, no frills, comfortable, cheap mouse. It has a nano USB receiver that plugs into any computer and connects instantly the first time without having to download/install drivers. The mouse is comfortable, even for bigger hands. It's got all the basic functions, and none of the frills that people don't need.  I'm going to order a bunch more for the office.
 The batteries were not sitting correctly and it was quickly not usable without adding a tin foil bridge. After that it lasted for a while but was intermittent and annoying.
 This is a great mouse for the money.  It is small and lightweight, the exact reason I purchased it.  The dongle stores inside it and one never has to worry about losing the dongle.  So far, as it's used infrequently with the laptop on jobs, the batteries have not needed a replacement.
 Works great and inexpensive, so far just as good as my old logitec.
 Replaced a faulty microsoft mouse. My son is very happy and wanted another to use at school with the chromebooks they use. Will probably buy another for my other son soon as well. Great product!
 I love this mouse. Simple, basic 2 button with adjustable scroll. Works way better than my other USB mouse I paid 3 times the money for. The adapter only sticks out about 1/4 inch. Great buy! Thanks.
 The product is a great size for travel and worked excellent at first from when it was delivered 1/17/17. However, now it is 2/25/17 and the bluetooth receiver only works sometimes no matter what computer it is used on. It will connect as soon as it is plugged in but stops working after about 5 minutes. Have changed batteries multiple times so that is not it. Severely disappointed in the short life span of this mouse. Other alternatives are definitely the way to go.
 Great price, works as expected, comfortable to use. Good battery life and unobtrusive USB connector. Add 5 more words? Okay.
 Ok for the price. However, it locks into a scroll mode all the time due to only a very light pressure on the scroll wheel. Never had this happen on any of the MS 4000 models I have used.<br/>And there is no option in the software to turn this feature off.<br/>I will use until it either breaks or I get really mad...<br/>But I would NOT purchase it again.
 All I can say is " Thank you Amazon ". I bought a mouse off of Ebay before this one and it was so bad that I felt like throwing it against the wall. After just using this mouse for just five minutes I can say I couldn't have wished for anything better than this mouse!! Scrolls nicely and fits my hand perfectly. It may be called basic but I call it all you really need.
 The left button stick now and then. Would not rebuy. Poor quality.
 It's a good solid mouse and meets my expectations for a mouse.<br/>I would recommend the Logitech M185 mouse, tho. Works just as well, and uses one AA battery a year. This mouse takes two AAA batteries, and I replace them several times a year. The $1 you save you will spend in batteries.
 very nice soft click, plug and play, no problems setting up. Very good quality, I definitely dig the AmazonBasics products i've bought and this keeps me confident that the next product I buy from them will be just as good!
 I added this mouse to the other AmazonBasics mouse I have now that both kids are using laptops for homework it's great to not have them dragging around a mouse with a cumbersome cord. I used metallic sharpies to color code the dongle with the corresponding mouse.
 Love this mouse! Only complaint I have is that its a bit spotty sometimes out of nowhere
 This mouse works great, needed it for a laptop and have had do problems at all.
 Was looking at the Logitech mouse but this one actually fit the bill much better. It is a little smaller than an avg mouse. Which I like better. I believe I have more control and less likely to tap the buttons accidentally. Played some games and response was quick even for a wireless. I especially like that I don't have that dang cord sticking out. I am very pleased.
 8 Year old loves this, small for her hands and battery life is amazing!
 Perfect little wireless mouse for my laptop. It is a great price, and works great. I use a "Fancier" mouse for my desktop, but this wireless mouse is perfect to use with a laptop or to travel with.
 Long battery life even when I have forgotten to turn it off overnight, though it isn’t something I use everyday. Mouse is accurate on the screen, no lagging. Works well for what I need.
 Cheap and works (within limited range). If you go more than about 3 feet from the USB plug in, youll have connection issues most likely. Or at least mine does.
 As far as I can tell, this is a poorly constructed mouse. I have tried it with different mouse pads and played with the settings in my preferences, and it is simply not a smooth cursor. It is jumpy, not very responsive, and hard to use with accuracy. I have used a few other (Apple) mouses around the office, and they all work great. Very, very annoying. Wish I hadn't bought it.
 I like it, battery last long, not too big not too small perfect size, works good
 AmazonBasics has become a pretty reliable brand for me lately. I have yet to encounter any issues with any of their products. This mouse is great!
 Pros:<br/>The mouse is the perfect size to fit my hand<br/>You can "feel" the clicks<br/>mouse wheel is superb<br/>slick design<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Took a while to connect to computer initially<br/>Battery compartment is odd<br/><br/>This mouse suits my needs. It's a simple and elegant design, which is what I'd been looking for. Amazon doesn't let you down on this one. There is a piece of plastic to help remove the batteries in the battery compartment which I thought was a bit odd. Other than that it's a fantastic mouse. The only thing I have yet to determine is how long the batteries will last. I would definitely recommend this mouse to anyone who is interested.
 I have a zero-client computer that really does not like logitech mice for some reasons, so I picked this one up to try it out. It works perfectly. Just a straight forward wireless mouse with built in storage spot for the receiver if you have to move it.  I could see this being good for use on a laptop because it is quite compact. I couldn't use it all day, but for minor tasks, it has been perfect.
 I have the mouse less than 2 years and the scroll wheel is malfunctioning.  I realize it lasted well beyond the warranty but I seldom use it.  I take proper care of it and use it appropriately.  I just expected more from an Amazon product.
 Receiver doesn't connect after a year of use
 Great quality mouse. This is a great improvement on cheap wireless mice and even some brand name cordless mice. The weight and size is perfect; it feels substantial without being clunky or oversize. Furthermore, there are not skips or anything else associated with lesser quality mice. This is a great purchase, and every bit as good as competitors like or higher priced.
 For the record this is not a full size mouse. I have man hands and it's a little on the small size. My wrist needs to be at a somewhat awkward angle to use it. I suspect with extended use it would start causing my wrist to hurt.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's a nice, simple mouse, solidly built, and at a good price. And I find the wireless to be flawless so far. On the minus side, the buttons are very stiff, and I find myself missing clicks more often than I'd like.
 Good price for a basic mouse; I liked the silver since it matches my computer.  Another reviewer wrote that it is a quiet clicker - I disagree.
 Your brand works just as good as my last mouse at a better price.  I love the color and the fast shipping.  I like that you stand behind your products.  Thank you.
 Its a nice wireless mouse.  No issues at all connecting with computer, but I did not give it five stars because sometimes the arrow in the screen goes all over the place out of control.  It does not happen too often, but enough to notice it.  With that said, I would still recommend it.
 I've bought about eight of these over the years because my husband works in IT and is always bringing home random computer projects. They work great.
 I recently had shoulder surgery and purchased  this after fighting with the wired mouse. Apart from being wire free, its smoother operation eased the strain I was putting on my shoulder. It glides like a hot knife through butter.
 Love this mouse. I buy several for backup.  For some reason I'm hard on mice, but these little wonders are tough, with long battery life. Has small little unobtrusive transmitter that fits in the USB slot  I'm going to buy more so I don't run out.
 I've been using this mouse for a while now before writing this review. It's a good mouse. The mouse feels solid and overall it's a good product.
 it's a wireless mouse to replace my sharper image one that fell...you have to manually turn it off when done unlike the automatic off I had with my Sharper Image one....no problem joining it to my MacBook pro...works well...good price as well!!!
 This thing out performed all my expectations. I bought it because I lost my Logitech mouse. I then found my Logitech mouse and I am continuing to use this mouse as my primary mouse. It is comfortable and responsive. Everything a little mouse should be.
 Worked awesome for a grand total of 8 days. Now, it doesn't function worth crap. It is registered by my computer. It comes up as a successfully linked wireless device. However, when you move the mouse, the cursor stays in the same place. Tried changing batteries, reconnecting, rebooting, everything. No longer works. Total crap.
 This review is basically just a general overview from what I've seen through pictures/videos about the unboxing because I'm currently not in the location of the product. It was collected by my boyfriend at home. I was sceptical about buying this product because he told me it may not be a good buy. He actually raved about the product. Can't wait to reach home and test it out. Will provide an update when I actually use the product.
 Bought 2 for use in two laptops, to avoid having to switch receiver . One works flawlessly all the time in either of my two laptops. One needs constant reinserting of the receiver into the port and/or turning the mouse on/off to get it to work, in either laptop. So far I'm putting up with it rather than returning for replacement.
 I thought since this mouse was from Amazon it would be flawless. The mouse feels good in hand. However, if your fingers do not completely cover the mouse, the mouse gets "stuck." This is very annoying. I guess you get what you pay for. Sensitivity and everything else is great. Pictures show the problem.
 This mouse worked great for a few days, then it appeared that the batteries died, then I replaced them, then they immediately died again, happened three times, I accept that it was a waste of money that the cost of postage would not justify returning. Unfortunate, I was hoping Amazon Basics products would be trustworthy.
 Works decent, but sometimes the cursor will disappear, and the reappear somewhere else? I've always used Logitech products, so you get what you pay for most of the time.
 Excellent cordless mouse. My one complaint is that it uses two AAA batteries rather than one AA like most cordless mice. I use rechargeable batteries, so I had to get four new batteries (so I'll have two charged and ready to swap in when the other pair dies). But as to the mouse, it's very nice.
 nice in the hand, plug in USB receiver picked up right away on WIN7 OS.  Cant go wrong for $11!!!  And my Logitech 305 died about a few months after for 2x price a couple of yrs ago.  Id buy a few more of these for the price.  Highly recommend, for this reason, id check out the keyboard too.
 Works great, like most Amazon Basics products and accessories.
 dropped my mouse and it broke. so i ordered this one. awesome! it is better then my old one which was priced higher then this AmazonBasice by 10 bucks. this is a great product. thanks
 Three hundred hour battery life? Really? Don't forget to turn it off when not actually using it!<br/><br/>By the way, when you do have a charged battery, this mouse feels and works great. It did need to download a driver before use though. My Logitech wireless mouse didn't need too, just plugged in and worked right off.
 I've owned Logitech and Microsoft wireless (and wired) mice.  None of them were as nice as this one.  Fits in the palm of my hand, doesn't overwhelm it.  Smooth scrolling.  Sleek, polished.  I'm going to buy another one for a spare.  My other mice have lasted about a year or two due to heavy use and the occasional drop on the floor.  Highly recommend Amazon's basics mouse.
 Easy to set up but the cursor seems to lag a bit. Tried adjusting the settings but still sticks then slowly moves to the spot I want it to be at.
 Easy to set up. It was working before I finished the set up process which was easy. Nearly plug and play. I use this for my laptop with Windows 8.1. The USB stores inside the mouse when my computer is put away. Recommended if your laptop is truly portable. The USB will get damaged over time just from slipping in out your laptop case. I know because my previous USB mouse was damaged that way. Highly  recommend  this product.
 I bought this one because I put the chip into another spot on my lab top and it got stuck. But I received this one two days ago, and I absolutely love it matches my lab top.  Its very nice.
 Absolute and total junk. Stopped working for no apparent reason. Lasted for like a couple of weeks! It’s cheap and hence it’s crap....
 very nice mouse- would definitely recommend to others. have spent more on other "Mice" in the past and been significantly less satisfied. Good product here!
 I repair computers. I go thru mice like a cat (I give them as a bonus sometimes). This is the quintessential bargain mouse! Sure, if you bought one of everything out there a few would fit your hand better, but is that possible?
 So far it works just fine, like the other mouse.The price is decent competition-wise but there are mice with more features at the same price.However I believe the price of this thing stems from the materials used in it, feels way different than a regular mouse and the buttons are kinda weak {they press with less effort which is something I don't prefer since my hands are well, my hands.}
 Feels weighty and expensive : ) the top has a very good expensive feel to it as well. connects well. and lazor on bottom reads very well i can use it on shiny plastic surface. Ive used it 15 feet away from receiver with no prob at all. best buy of 2018 so far : )
 I have been using this mouse for 3 years now, and for that I am giving it 2 stars. What I don't like about this mouse, however, is that wheel is not responsive when you scroll between pages.  It's always a pain to go through between pages. The price was cheap though because it was made in China. But I am really sick and tired of cheap items from China.  I just want something reliable.
 Works fine, as expected.  Better than the Logitech, which you should avoid at any cost.  The Logitech mouse worked fine for a couple of months and now it freezes occasionally.  Very annoying.  This is the second Logitech mouse that I purchased, and definitely the last.  Stick with Amazon Basics, save yourself $5 and avoid the headaches of Logitech.
 This mouse was just what I was looking for. Super easy to put together- all you do is put in the batteries (they are included), take out the nano receiver and plug it into your computer, switch the button to ON and you are good to go. This mouse is smaller than the one I was using before, but it doesn't feel awkward. I don't use a mousepad and the curser is smooth even when used directly on my desk. Affordable and works great! I will look into the AmazonBasics again!
 This product has performed the same as all of the Amazonbasics products that I have purchased. Excellent.
 Good basic wireless mouse; the size is perfect for me butmay be too small for large hands.  Easy to set up - my computer initially gave me an error that the driver did not install correctly; however, the mouse seems to work fine in spite of that.  Hope this is helpful to someone else.
 Great unless you occasionally need precision and speed, then you'll want to shoot yourself.  The double-click is unreliable, and the pointer jumps around if you ask it to do to much.  Great for general users who never engage in Lumosity!
 It worked for about six months or so but stopped working with any laptop or desktop that I tried to hook it up to, acting erratic and unresponsive and times.
 Using this mouse right now.  I've got a few others that don't have a switch.  The only issue I have is my own - often I'll forget to turn the switch off; even so, I've yet to have the battery die on me after a few months of use.  Considering the price, it's a fine mouse.
 Works great and I love how you can store the USB plug inside the battery compartment when its not in use! However it is loud and for some reason the scrolling is backwards on my MacBook. I'm not sure if that is due to my computer or if I can fix it, but it scrolls normal on a windows computer.
 perfect!  i only wish i knew about this before i spent big bucks on a previous microsoft mouse at big box office supply.  this little mouse does a perfect job as the $70.00 one i purchased (that now has disintegrated rubber on the scroll feature).  i will buy a spare for sure!  excellent value.  do you make colors?  please consider.
 This mouse broke after 3 months of use.<br/><br/>Update: Amazon was able to send me a replacement mouse when the first one broke but now my replacement mouse broke almost exactly one year later.  This is not a durable product.  You might be better off buying a more expensive mouse that will last.
 This mouse is like a bratty child--works when/if it wants to and quits whenever it feels like it.  It's not ready to go when you "wake" it up in the morning, so you have to try it on different surfaces to see which one it likes.  Once you get it going, it sometimes responds to your movement and it sometimes just does it's own thing.  Do not buy this.
 Needed a wireless mouse. Got this one and havent had a problem yet
 Is my third or fourth AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse and all are still working just fine. They setup easy, work just fine and last a long time. What else can you ask for in a mouse?
 It took a while to get the mouse connected. Seems to work well from a couple of hours of use.  But for 10.00 the efficacy is more than acceptable.
 This mouse, lemme tell you about this mouse. First off, I've got tiny hands ya see? This baby, ugh this baby fits in it perfectly. And the shape? So aerodynamic! I can easily maneuver my mouse with such ease it's like how I imagine gliding on a cloud would feel like. The USB plug is so tiny, if you lose the bastard, you're screwed. But once it's in, it ain't coming loose unless you yank that out yourself! Laser is so good that I now have marks engraved into my wooden table! Kinda like Howl's Moving Castle, yeah? But it's all good, a mouse pad easily fixes the issue. 10/10 would buy again if I needed a replacement
 The mouse is a great size and works great! There's a piece of clear plastic in the battery compartment that doesn't seem like it should be there (part of the packaging maybe?) I don't want to break it, so I didn't pull it too hard. Otherwise... Solid mouse!
 I have to admit, when I ordered this mouse I didn't expect much. I saw the price and I figured it would just be a hit or miss wireless mouse. I knew Amazon was a great company but I didn't know how their electronics worked. This being my first Amazon electronic purchase I was a bit nervous. However after installing the batteries (easy), I just plugged in the usb dongle, turned it on, and that was it. It just worked! This is a great mouse for your everyday, average computer needs. For the price, I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone.
 Works like any other mouse. My hand is small so it was perfect for me. No errors and its been a few months of using this, I'm also on my 1st battery I put in there so it seems energy efficient.

It is $12 and has 3500 reviews with over 4 stars. This mouse is great. Going strong over a year later. My only problem is that I have to steal it back from my partner frequently. On second thought... I'll just buy another one!
 This mouse worked great for about 6 months. Now it doesn't work even though I've replaced the batteries. The light is on but it just doesn't work. Frustrating.
 I use this every day on my work computer, and I finally had to change the battery after 5 months of daily use. The mouse has a nice soft touch, the buttons are clicky and springy, and the wheel is tight. When it comes to mice, I like them to be very basic, so this fits the bill perfectly. Along with their HDMI cables and iPhone charging cables, Amazon once again sets the bar on quality and price-point that so many other companies can't seem to reach.
 This is a nice mouse with a good, solid feel. I spent 4x the amount on a Microsoft a few years ago that finally broke on a work trip, and this is every bit as good (although part of that price difference would be the number of years since I originally bought the old one)
 Let me start off saying that I've purchased many of the Amazon Basics items (mostly cords) and I've been very happy with those.<br/><br/>This mouse however, is bad. I ordered two, the first one I got to send back and get a refund because it didn't work right out of the box, it had very bad tracking issues.<br/>The second one worked great for a bout 2 months and then failed miserably. It not longer even functions.<br/><br/>I'd recommend shelling out the extra $15 for a wireless mouse that actually works.
 Super easy to install and to use. So far all the Amazon Basics items I've purchased have all worked great!
 Small batteries. you need to change them every month. bad quality plastic
 This is a great mouse for the price. It does scratch easily though. The batter lasts FOREVER. I forget to turn it off ALL THE TIME. It’s been going for weeks.
 For the price, this is awesome! It works, no headache or fuss. Just fyi the usb dongle is in the battery box underneath the mouse. Took longer than I’d like to admit to figure that one out.
 I had an off-brand bought at Amazon which never tracked well.  So glad to have this one... Just a good mouse, what I wanted!
 Very good mouse. Does what it is suppose to for a $10  wireless mouse. Came with two batteries as well!
 I bet it is a great mouse. However, upon my first entry with the USB connector into my laptop, the USB came apart getting stuck in my computer. I will give it four stars though because Amazon return service is great and it still worked great even with it being broke.
 Works with Windows 10, affordable, straightforward directions, and your computer should automatically detect the wireless mouse. Comes with two AAA batteries. It does not get five stars because of the loud click and small size, but this will meet your expectations. No need to buy the fancy stuff, just get this one.
 Very small but big enough to do the job. Easy to travel with
 This mouse works way better than my last one which was a different brand. The battery lasts a long time even if I forget to turn it off.  I've dropped it a few times and it still works.
 Excellent price and great product. I love the storage feature for the USB transmitter. It came with batteries and has a variable speed automatic scrolling feature. I highly recommend this device!
 The design of this mouse is great.  Once again AmazonBasic's has hit it out of the park! The feel and the response is great.  I work on a computer all day and all night and this mouse seems to be easier on my hand.  I plan on getting a 2nd.
 Love it, works as it should and connects very fast. I am starting to grow very fond of Amazon products, I bought the Amazon Basics headphones as well and they sound great, much better than my Sony ZX 300 headphones. They only complaint that I have about this mouse is that it is a little smaller than I would like, but that is not a big issue.
 I got this mouse as a mouse for my netbook, but am currently using it on my laptop since I left my regular mouse at work. It's not bad, but I normally use a logitech mouse that was around the same price and I'd give that one 5 stars, but this one is only 3. The reason for that is that while this mouse has no lag or skipping when moving it quickly, it doesn't respond well to slow movements. So, when you're clicking and dragging something on Microsoft Powerpoint for a very specific positioning, it might give you some grief. That being said, the wirelessness is convenient, and the usb adaptor is nice and small (though not quite as small as the logitech adaptor). Would definitely recommend the logitech mouse over this one, but this one gets the job done and is a nice backup mouse and will serve nicely for my netbook when I'm on the go or on campus.
 Perfect mouse, very responsive, good feel and it just works as it should. How can you beat the price for a mouse that does what you want?
 I bought this mouse on March 28th and it just stopped working this week (Aug 15th).  Changed battery, resynched etc but did not fix it. It was only $10 but you should not expect it to last long.
 I have had similar Logitech mice and I'd say buy the Logitech. This AmazonBasics works fine, but since i leave the little receiver in my laptop all the time... I have discovered that my laptop will not  boot up when the receiver is still in the laptop. I have to pull it out and then turn on the laptop again. Very annoying.
 The mouse works great.  It's a standard mouse and has great quality.  The only things I didn't like was that the markings on which way the batteries went (+/-) wasn't clear and the plastic pull tab that sits under the batteries for easy removal is in the way the first time you load the batteries and is difficult to get placed correctly.
 its USB is low quality product and my usb not working any more
 Unpack, plug in the USB module, install battery and works fine.
 I was looking for a small mouse, smaller than a Logitech M305. This isn't it.<br/><br/>ABWM AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse works well for spreadsheet, web browsing, word processing. it works on a carpeted floor, a wooden tabletop, an ordinary tabletop. (Not so well on opaque black glass -- I don't regard this as any kind of deficiency.) The nano receiver fits in a slot in the battery compartment when not in use. ABWM is left-right symmetrical, which I like, because I swap off from one hand to the other when easing my acquired repetitive motion syndrome. ABWM seems to work like I've come to expect a wireless mouse will work.<br/><br/>The batteries go into the device at an unexpected tilt. I don't know how difficult it will be to extract them when the time comes. There's some kind of plastic film inside the battery compartment that seems to have no purpose except to complicate my life. It flops around. I returned my early purchase of ABWM for this reason -- I thought there was something wrong with it. When the second ABWM had the same weird floppy plastic, I figured it was just weird, though I half suspect this will be trouble sometime in the future. ABWM takes 2 batteries. Why not one?<br/><br/>The ABWM left mouse button seems to tire my finger more than the Logitech M305.<br/><br/>ABWM is bigger than I had hoped. Thank you to the customers who post a photo of the mouse alongside a ruler. Why doesn't Amazon or the manufacturer provide a picture or a text measurement description? Showing somebody's hand holding the mouse does little good, because different people have hands of different sizes (this must surprise someone).<br/><br/>I wish I didn't have to try out so many mice to find a really good one. Some mice have negative reviews complaining "This mouse is too small!", on reading which I think "Maybe I should try this one." Now I have ordered Verbatim Wireless Mini Nano Travel Mouse 97471. If that doesn't work well, then I will try Logitech 187.
 I'd say spend a couple of bucks more and save a pile on batteries.
 solid, decent, basic mouse. Works fine with my macbook. All is well. - 1 star for being a little cheap., but com'on, you curmudgeon, that's one of the reasons you bought it... :)
 You get what you pay for.  I have purchased 3 of these so far...and I have finally learned my lesson. They are cheaply made and do not last longer than a few months. They just simply stop working.
 I bought this mouse a while back, but I'm coming back to review it now because it only lasted about a year. The laser kept shutting off while I used it. I'd replace batteries and that wouldn't fix the problem. I went back to a wire mouse and I'm much happier.
 This is a great mouse for the price point.  No bells and whistles; this mouse just works.  What I love is that it came with a set of batteries, plugged right in and worked, and it also has a nice little spot inside the battery case for the USB adapter!  love it, works great.  Highly recommend.
 After about 6 months, my computer is telling me that the "USB device is not recognized", and the mouse does not work.
 I had a Microsoft wireless mouse in 2010 and it was died within one and half years. I then bought a Logitech wireless mouse in 2012, which worked within one-year. I bought this Amazon wireless at half-price of the Microsoft mouse and 2/3 price of the Logitech mouse this summer. It's been working fine so far.<br/><br/>It's portable and sensitive. What a 5-star product sold by Amazon.com!
 I was really excited about this mouse after reading reviews but after one day of using, I have to return. Constantly loses tracking abilities and freezes.
 Yes it was inexpensive.  But I used it 2X and it quit working.  Spend a little more and get a product that does not need to be replaced weekly.
 This mouse didn’t cost much but was branded Amazon so I gave it a try. Best mouse I have had in years.
 TOTALLY AWESOME.  This mouse has blown away microsoft &amp; logitech in the mouse departments.  Easy to get working and NO hassle connecting.  Very smooth scrolling and can barely hear the clicking sound.  I do VERY HIGHLY recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless mouse for either their PC or laptop.
 This product is simple to set up and "amazon Basic".  Plug in and used in 30 seconds.  Directions with photos are so simple to follow you cannot screw it up... cause believe me I can get lost going around the corner.  5 step by step photos and you are using a very sleek very nice mouse.  Thank you Amazon!!!
 Ordered 5. On that order, 5 of 5 didn't work. Amazon confirmed the item was defective on the phone and email. Amazon didn't refund, replace or provide a discount for shipping me deffective items. They couldn't provide me with any troubleshooting ideas and the 4 people I spoke with were not familiar with the product the mice to new dongles. Seem to soon be discontinued by manufacture (Amazon).  Don't order.
 The on/off switch is microscopic.  There is no reason for it to be that small.  It is an annoying inconvenience.  Otherwise it works fine.
 I suppose it is ok for a PC - the write up in your add said it was ok for Apple too and unfortunately it is not.  I purchased a Logitech mouse which is ok with the MAC.
 Replacement arrived for initial order receipt problem talked to CS about. CS sent a replacement and did a great job<br/><br/>Thanks
 Runs thru batteries quickly and stops sending signal often.  Tossing it out and getting something that works.
 The second one I have purchased, I split coffee one the old one, it last for just over 2 years, they are light, easy to use, never go wrong and the batteries seem to last forever. I had to get another.
 Just like the name implies, it's a basic wireless mouse. It has decent weight, mid range feel to materials, and adequate sensitivity.
 Love my wireless mouse and LOVE the color Purple - Royalty.  Most importantly, I'm efficient in whatever I do - Thank You!
 We ordered these to add a little different look to our patio other than basic solar. They looked so good we ordered a second set. In full winter sun here in So. Cal the burn almost all night long. I'm very happy with the quality and look of these and are giving some as gifts too.
 Originally I gave this five stars.<br/>Today it is only 4 months since purchase / delivery; the battery compartment won't hold batteries for contact with receptors. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. It was not too expensive, but I expected it to last more than 4 months.
 Quality mouse doing basic mouse stuff at a low price. There's not much more to say than that! It has a nice feel. The USB connector is low profile so you can just keep it plugged into the laptop all the time. Remember to turn the mouse off to save battery life. BOOM! Nice mouse!
 Works great in any surface, does not require a mousepad.
 Just as one would expect for it to work. Great product.
 3rd one I have had,battery life is short and failed after 9 months
 Great mouse that works every time unless your cat knocks if off your desk/table.  This one was our second mouse.  Does not hold up to cat abuse, but then I don't think it is supposed.  Very good deal.
 Stopped working rather quickly. Lasted less than 6 months
 A simple, basic mouse, for Mac or PC. It comes with the 2 AAA batteries needed. Comes with basic instructions, but it is so simple to use, you may not need any instructions. A very good value.
 It does the job, but I'm not impressed. The pointer on the screen moved sporadically from time to time - an issue I've never experienced with other brands I've used. Not all amazon basic items are created equally!
 Worked well for first month. After about a month or so batteries needed replacing. When I went to replace the batteries the new ones would not got in and I found that the battery contacts had sprung loose. Not worth the effort or aggravation to get replaced.
 After very light use the left button no longer works, to the landfill it goes.
 Once I put new batteries in the mouse and plugged in the usb dongle it worked right away.  However, every time I click the mouse the usb connection disconnects.  So, every time I click I have to turn the mouse off and then back on in order to get a connection.  Pretty worthless.
 Goes thru batteries faster than any other mouse I've had.
 dont care for mouse.  Batteries were difficult to put in.  Battery life low.
 It has stopped working now. I used for a year or so and now it's not working. All lights looks good. Changed batteries as well...no use though
 works great and easy to install. I bought two of them and use them daily. They seem to work on almost any surface, like a newspaper or random scrap of paper or a pad. So far they are great.
 My main go-to mouse for all my computers. Cheap and does the job.
 Decent cheap mouse - definitely beats using the touchpad on a laptop. If you use it for basic mouse functions, it should be just fine. Decent range and good responsiveness.
 Quality mouse. Works very well without any issues. I have no complaints. To top it off, the price cannot be beat!
 Perfect mouse for my laptop!  I would highly recommend this mouse.
 The price was low for this and I was like Im gonna take a chance. It came on time and has worked fantastically. Had a little issue with putting the battery panel on but other than that great.
 I just picked this mouse up to use with my Chromebook and it functions flawlessly. The mouse seems just as well made and works equally as well as more expensive ones I have used. I especially like that the USB receiver stores perfectly between the batteries for safe keeping.
 After a few years use, the scroll wheel only works 50% of the time. I've kept the mouse clean and changed the batteries regularly. Small and convenient but I wish it would have lasted longer.
 I bought the same mouse in Sept. 2016.  I liked the feel of it but all of a sudden stopped working, the battery kept popping out - I thought it was just old and ordered the same one to replace it.  Now I have had the new one a month and the battery does the same thing - so frustrating and really too bad because the feel is nice and it tracked well.
 Never have had issues with AmazonBasics mouses. For the price, they cannot be beat. If I drop it and am forced to replace it (which isn't often and when I do drop it on my terrazza tile floor - very hard surface - this mouse just keeps on ticking) I'm still way ahead of the game in light of the price. It cannot be beat.
 Good connectivity. Battery life is good.  Works well.
 I can't believe I am using this defective mouse that is working for 2-3 second every one minute.  I don't have nothing else to use but to wait use it to get this page to leave comment and to check if I can return it. Simply pay more to get the better one. this one sucks! I am still waiting for the mouse to be working to get out of this page.
 First item I've ever had to return back to Amazon. Could not keep the batteries in place. Wouldn't connect to my laptop. The item arrived with one of the battery metal connector tabs bent.
 These mice are great, work great.  I have used it for quite a while with no issues.  In the future I will probably buy more when I need them
 I purchased this mouse because my old wireless mouse started to jump around and just act erratically.  This one is great.  It's smooth and although many reviews claim that it is very small, I find it to be a nice fit.  The USB is small which is nice compared to my older mouse with its larger flash drive sized USB.  Overall a good, cheap mouse.
 this mouse it just perfect, good price and works well so far!
 Good buttons and the size fits the hand well.<br/><br/>The battery door is designed poorly. It helps hold the batteries in place, so there it a little bit of upward pressure. It doesn't take much to cause it to pop off.<br/><br/>At some point, I'll get frustrated enough to throw it away and get the wired version.
 It was working just fine and was quicker than the Toshiba mouse I had been using.  Also liked the on/off switch to save battery....then, it stopped working after about 2 months.  Connects for about 10 seconds then shuts down.  For the price, I'll order another one and hope for the best.
 These are great basic mice.  The battery last 6+ months and works great. We have made them our standard.  Thanks.
 This is a good mouse. That tracking works well and I like the size. The scrolling, however, is pretty sub-par. If i scroll slowly, nothing will move. I have to give it good whirl to get the scrolling going, which means there isn't much slow control. I have a mac, so it's a little annoying compared to the extremely smooth scrolling on the track pad. That said, ~$10 is a very good price. If you prefer a smooth continuous scroll, go for something else.
 I am very happy with this mouse from AmazonBasics. It comes with it's own Nano-receiver and is truly plug-and-play. Insert the receiver into any USB port and the mouse functions with no further intervention and no re-start. It is slightly smaller than a conventional PC mouse but within minutes I am completely used to the smaller size.
 Works really well with my laptop. The dongle is stored in the battery compartment is exactly what I was looking for.
 Very happy. Actually bought a second one for a different computer. Only had this for a couple of months, but meets and exceeds most expectations.
 Beyond my wildest expectations!<br/><br/>The grip part is really soft and pleasent, very smooth. the adapter to your computer is a tiny barely notisable little USB adapter, easy to loose actually if you set it down on the counter. Cordless is the way to go!! especially for lap tops while sitting on the couch. I don't use a mouse pad or anything and works great!!
 I’ve bought similar mouses and this one is okay. Unfortunately you can hear every click loudly when using it.
 This tiny thing feels awkward. My hand hurts if I use it more than an hour. The battery door flies off if the mouse falls more than a foot off of the ground. Worst of all though is the power consumption. Two general purpose AAA batteries only last about one month before the low battery indicator is activated. It needs an auto off function.
 Come on, who doesn't need a wireless mouse?? It's supppper compact, uses normal AAA batteries &amp; offers a ON/OFF switch. Did I mention the price??!? Come on, I buy the majority of Amazon Basic Products for the simple fact of those products being affordable &amp; equal or greater quality then the competition!!
 I ordered this mouse along with logitech's wireless mouse M510.  This mouse isvery "SMALL".  I am 5'7 and 135 lbs and I found this mouse uncomfortable to use.  I did not return it due to its low price.  Also I plan to give it to my 8 yr old cousin.
 This mouse was PERFECT! No set up needed, just followed the simple instructions and it started right up! Perfect mouse for people who hate using the mouse pad on their laptop. The mouse is small in comparison to a typical mouse, but I have small hands so I personally did not mind it! Highly recommend.
 This mouse works well. It just feels weird in my hand. I'll keep it put it in my laptop bag for whenever.
 I’ve had this mouse for two years now, and have not had any problems with it. Connects very easily. In fact, I’m ordering another one for my second laptop.
 Won't work on a mac. I bought two of them, neither works. Surprised ME. Avoid.<br/><br/>I didn't discover this until after the "return window", so it's a total loss.
 Seller was fine but not the product. The batteries died 3 times in a week, i just went and got  a better one. Yes it is cheap but not after you buy a pack of batteries once a week, better options out there.
 You just plug it in and it works perfectly. That's "basic"ly what i wanted. It's smaller than a regular mouse but i knew that already. It's just what my kid wanted for his laptop.<br/><br/>Edit) seemed to work great for a while then my kid said it started having connectivity issues and eating batteries like crazy. I guess it was to good to be true...
 Kid loves it. Exactly what he wanted for his school chromebook.
 Solid. Works great. Cheaper than practically every other quality wireless mouse on Amazon. This is easily the best choice for anyone that isn't looking for anything special in their day-to-day use mouse. Would have been nice if they also had a different version of this mouse with, say, a couple side (Fwd/Back) buttons.
 This product is very good for general use. I have a gaming mouse, but for general productivity, this mouse does all of it. I would recommend for people that are in for general usage.
 This mouse does the trick! It's held up through some abuse by my 3 kiddos...
 Great product. The USB connector is so slim on my laptop that I often forget that it's there. One piece of advice I would give is to NOT try to remove the piece of plastic inside the mouse where you will eventually be putting your batteries. I thought that it was just a cheap piece of plastic that I needed to remove, but after trying to rip it out, I read on the instructions that the plastic strip needed to be there in order to make removal of the batteries easier later on.
 When I first received the mouse it worked perfectly. It was a great size as I could easily slip it into my backpack and bring it to school to use with my laptop. But recently, the mouse just stopped communicating with the receiver plugged into my laptop. I've tried switching batteries and plugging it into different USB ports to no avail. This mouse when it worked was great but I expected to get more than a year and a half out of this mouse.
 Pros: Easy to hook up, nice design, long battery life wireless (obviously)<br/><br/>Cons: not good for people with big hands unless you can do the claw grip with your fingers at a 90 degree angle. (not for me)<br/><br/>but I handed it off to the girlfriend and she likes it, she switches between her laptop and desktop with it and it does what it needs to do.
 We have bought a couple of these to have, way easier than using a trac-pad on your laptop. So far, they have held up nice to all day use.
 Works very well much higher quality than I expected.
 It worked really well.  I used it for months on the same computer with no issues.  However, I wanted to use it on another computer and tried to take the usb out and it broke off inside my computer.  It was easy to remove the broken piece from the computer, but now I can't use the mouse anymore.
 I find this mouse a bit "stiff".  My finger gets tired from clicking it.  Also, when you are scrolling, sometimes it runs away from you.  Kinda wish I had bought a Logitech, instead.
 I have 2 of these Amazon Mouses and needed 2 more.  I didn't look at other mouses because I have been totally happy with what I have. - Bobby Blue
 Worked for a little bit and died after  few days.
 Started off working well. Shortly began skipping around the screen, not locating where pointed. Bought two, neither work well. Find another brand! Don't recommend this one at all.
 First day using. Seem to be a good build. Works well to date.
 I bought this months ago and have never had a problem with it. It connects easily and the wireless dongle stores in the battery compartment. (Pic attached) It is a good size for a travel mouse as well. I carry it back and forth to work each day. The batteries it came with are still going strong so it sips energy as well. Great mouse.
 I use this mouse daily at work and so far so good. The battery life is great with normal usage.
 Bought a couple of these, they work great for the price but the batteries do not seat reliably. Occasionally the mouse appears to die, opening the cover to replace batteries reveals that a battery has popped out of the contact. Happens occasionally on both mice.
 Cons:<br/><br/>- needs to be close to receiver<br/>- track wheel fails after two yeras<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Did a C+ job at functioning for two years.
 Bought this mouse for my 2nd laptop b/c the price was right. Never worked quite right; bad tracking. Admittedly, I use it on a wood desktop w/ no pad, but my other (name brand) mouse has no issues. After nearly 1 year of underperformance I just replaced it with a name brand mouse. Now I'm happy.<br/><br/>It's true: When you buy cheap, you buy twice.
 Works great with my tablet!  Super easy to install.
 Amazon Basics have worked out well for me in the past. This mouse connects easily, clicks and scrolls without issue, and has onboard storage for the transmitter which should really be a no brainer. Exactly what I needed.
 I love this mouse. It has this rubbery, matte finish that just feels great in your hand. My only issues with it are: 1) the nano-receiver is stored inside the battery casing, so you have to pop off the cover to get to it; 2) the power button is recessed enough that it's slightly hard to turn on and off if you have short nails.
 I just work with it for a week, it seems to work well with white, black and other surfaces, don't need a special mate to work.<br/>I hope it'll continue working like now, and the batteries life will be good enough
 I use my mouse to connect to my projector. Very easy connection and is more effective than my remote. Great product
 The rubber/manure smell hasn't gone away after 2 months of use. I also experienced a lot of skips during use; it is especially noticeable during rapid movement. I have at least 20 different mouse models and this one is at the bottom three. That is to say, there are cheaper, better mouse on amazon.
 One of the batteries keeps slipping out.  I've tried inserting folded paper so that the cover forces the battery back down into place but haven't been able to get the battery to stay in place.  Other than this one issue, I love it.
 it arrived today.  used it today. works great!  it is just what I needed.  easy to use, picture instructions for battery placement.  clear and easy. just plug and all set to go.  my laptop picked it up right away; no apps to load for this mouse.  wonderful.  I am very happy with my purchase.
 The batteries can be just a tiny bit difficult to change, but it's worth it for such a nice mouse. My old one was much more expensive but this seems like better quality. The wheel is smooth and doesn't make that loud, annoying clicking sound that some do. Very easy installation since all you have to do is insert a small stick into a good port (the first one I used didn't work, but I moved it one port over and it worked fine, so I'm sure that was a problem with my older laptop and not the mouse). Very happy to have it. I can now play Minecraft again with ease!
 I am using this on my Lenovo laptop running Windows 7.  The device tracks nicely and does not jump or stutter on the screen.  The only issue I have with it is that sometimes I have to reset the USB receiver when the computer comes out of sleep mode.  You just pull the receiver out of the USB slot and re-insert it and it comes right back.  All in all for the price, this is a great unit.
 I have had zero issues with this mouse. I see other reviews state they have difficulties with the batteries and all. I don't know what they are talking about. Couldn't be easier to insert, and take them out. There is a little clear plastic piece you place under the batteries as you put them in so you can pull them out with no problem. Many products have this little feature. The mouse is a great size, nice click feelings and the scroll wheel works great.
 This mouse has a nice feel and seems to be a good choice.  And who would want a black mouse when you could have a fun purple mouse.
 This is the best mouse out there for the money.  I have had one for a couple of years for my desktop and got another one now for my new laptop.  Works perfectly - what else can I say!
 Works great. Can't comment on battery life yet as I have just received.
 Seems to eat up batteries.  Also, the batteries are not held rigidly in place.  I'm always having to jiggle them around to get the stupid mouse to turn on.  With all that fooling around, I've lost the battery cover.  I'm writing this post because I'm on Amazon hoping there's a super deal Black Friday deal on a computer mouse...
 Smaller than a regular mouse -- but just the right size for me.  Works great.  Great price.  Seems well built.
 Works great, like any other mouse you can buy.  The size is pretty small though.  I'm a very average size man (5'10" 168 lbs) and the mouse is extremely small for my hand.  There should be a sizing guide or something other than raw dimensions to help a customer recognize the size of this item during an online purchase.  At the very least the title should say "Compact" mouse to be more descriptive.
 Ordered and tried for my son’s laptop.  Even with multiple different batteries it wouldn’t turn on. Maybe I got a defective one
 The name is as it implies - basic<br/><br/>Here are some things I have found out about the mouse, as my more expensive Logitech mouse suddenly died on me (I contacted them, they weren't very helpful).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Small<br/>-Good battery life<br/>-Works fine for internet browsing and doing everyday things<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-This mouse seems to have issues under stress. Playing any games above minesweeper may make this mouse's movement go from smooth to choppy and at times, unresponsive for very short times, usually less than a second. While this may not affect you if you are playing Farming Simulator 2015, this is a HUGE hindrance when I am using a flight simulator.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a cheap gaming mouse, I suggest you buy a wired one.
 This is a great mouse. I have no complaints. The color is beautiful!
 I own several of these. Sometimes I have to carry my work laptop and also a customer laptop, so I will carry 2 of these, one for each laptop in those cases. They have never let me down, very comfortable to work with, and the price can't be beat!
 Very happy indeed. Purchased this for my work issued laptop so that I would have one less cord running around my desk. Easy to set up, rolls smoothly, no problems. My hand is smaller, and the mouse fits well.
 I like the battery life in this wireless mouse
 Palm sized, nano USB connection, and super responsive. I can't really say much more. It's a basic mouse, but after a month or two of usage I've got nothing but nice things to say about it.<br/><br/>I do some mild gaming with it, nothing twitch, and it's been great.
 earlier set up  lil temperamental when using surfaces non super mouse friendly but I like the feel n good for on the desk use
 Although cheap this may be one of the best mice I've ever gotten! Love it a lot, it's small length makes is perfect for Fingertip holders among us. Also great design and it's cool that the USB receiver is so small and compact.<br/>I didn't expect it but the smooth plastic covering it on the top is awesome. Just make sure not to clean it the wrong way - I already destroyed this kind of mouse texture on my Razer Imperator mouse in the past. Clean it as they instruct in the manual.
 I love Amazon products! This works great, haven't had one issue and it's sleek, compact design is nice too
 I bought 2 different mouses to test.  This was my least favorite because it isn't comfortable to use.  Package opened once to test and then repackaged for return and there's a $6 fee to return ... not worth it.  Skip this mouse all together.
 It seems to be of good quality in that it is durable but it is so glitchy on my mouse pad. I keep having to turn it off and back on for it to cooperate. This happen about every 2-3 minutes.
 been using this for over 18 months now with no issues. amazon did a great job with the amazon basics product line.<br/>this mouse feels very comfortable in your palm.
 I PURCHASED THIS WIRELESS  MOUSE AND RECEIVED IT ON AUGUST 31,2017.TODAY IS NOV .4 ,2017 AND IT HAS STOPPED WORKING ...STARTED HAVING TROUBLE WITH IT LAST WEEK WITH IT STOPPING AND THEN STARTING TO WORK AGAIN SO I REPLACED THE BATTERIES WITH NEW ONES ..IT WORKED FOR 7 DAYS AND TODAY IT STARTED THE SAME THING AGAIN SO I REPLACED THE BATTERIES AGAIN AND IT IS STILL WORKING ONE TIME BUT WILL NOT THE NEXT MINUTE WITH THE NEW BATTERIES IN IT .....NO GOOD ....
 Does what it should. Feels solid and like it will last a while.
 works great- plugged it in, turned it on and moused around. what more can you ask for?
 These little devices are great. Compact and fit well in small bags (such as laptop bag) and the receiver takes up almost no space. Mouse functions perfectly.
 This mouse doesn't work well on some fabrics.  We're using this on the couch for the HTPC.  It doesn't like fabric with ridges or carpet so if you're planning on using this to surf from the couch, try a different mouse.  Otherwise, it seems to have a consistent connection.
 Worked fine, while it worked. I'm used to cheap mouses giving out after some heavy gaming, and this one did just like expected, unfortunately. The middle mouse scroll button's rubber casing began loosing up to the point of it being unusable.
 I was hesitant to switch from a corded mouse to a wireless but I'm ecstatic.  I don't even need a mouse pad anymore as it works on every surface I've used it on.  No issues whatsoever!  Start up was simple, just pop out the USB drive from inside the mouse and insert into your computer, stick in he provided batteries, turn it on, and that's all there is to it.  Note:  I use Windows 8.1.
 This product, like all other AmazonBasics products, is great for the price. It's a little small if you have bigger hands like me, but not significantly. The scrolling wheel is smooth and consistent and the matte finish on the top adds user friendly grip. The batteries will die quite quickly if you consistently forget to turn of the mouse when you are not using your computer. The Bluetooth connection setup is as easy as plugging in the small USB. No sign of wear after 2 months of use.
 Going into the trash.  Not working.  Computer sounds when the chip is inserted, mouse lights up but there is no connection between the 2.  I'm trashing this and going back to order my old stand by hp mouse.  Never a minute of trouble with the HP.  It connects and you are working right away.
 This little mouse worked great in the beginning, but after 6 months of using it, alas it has quit working!  Tried everything from putting new batteries in, to hitting the connect button to moving the adapter to a different USB port.  It would have been a great item had it lasted longer than 6 months.  Sometimes it is not better to buy cheaper because as they say I guess you get what you pay for!
 Love the feel of this mouse, it is the right size for my hands and it responds quickly.  Amazon Basic items, I have found, are a great value for the money.  So much so that I look for them first now when I need electronic items to see if they are available before looking for other brands.  Should I need another mouse, I'll be buying this brand again.
 This mouse worked perfectly for about a month and then randomly died on me. I really loved it and it was easy to use but wouldn't recommend it based on the fact that i only got 1 months use for it. Pretty disappointed.
 Perfect. Good price!!! Just what I wanted. Works just like I want it to work. Similar Mice are lots more expensive at Brick and Mortar outlets. And Amazon delivers to my door!<br/>I like the on/off button to save battery when I travel with this mouse.<br/>I like the tiny dongle (the item that plugs into the USB port) as oppose the long dongles that get in the way or can damage the USB port.
 We purchased this about two months ago, replacing the wireless Microsoft mouse that had stopped working.  Installation on our Windows 7 HP laptop was a painless, plug-and-play process.  Compared to the Microsoft mouse, the AmazonBasics mouse was less expensive, fits the hand more comfortably, and works better.
 Mine only lasted 2 years, it just stopped working today, I even changed new batteries. I need a mouse now and have to order a new one (definitely not buying this again). So frustrating
 I must have received a defective unit because my scroll wheel doesn't scroll well if it scrolls at all. The vertical scrolling is iffy at best. One work around I found is to scroll -lock keeping the wheel pushed down and then panning the mouse up and down.  Even so the scrolling  is anything but smooth. All in all this mouse has been  a real annoyance and it's going back.
 I purchased a few different "cheap" wireless mouses to find an alternative to logitech and this was overall my favorite. Mouse feels good in the hand, tracks well, buttons are responsive but not to easy to accidentally click. Wheel works good but unfortunately doesn't do the left to right clicking. Overall great mouse for the price!
 This is not a "full size" mouse. I would have ordered a different item if I had known. However, the device functions well. Still a good value for a basic mouse if you can stand the smaller size.
 Great size for medium to small hands. Have had mine for over a year and it has worked flawlessly even after many drops onto the floor. Uses 2 AA batteries that last ~3-4 months with average use of 2-3 hours per day.
 Metal surround on the dongle separated from the plastic receiver when removed from the USB port on the third use.  Had to use needlenose pliers to remove the surround from the port.  I realize you get what you pay for but one would imagine that for a wireless device, it could be more travel-friendly and allow multiple uses.  I guess I don't mind leaving in the USB port of my laptop but it is larger than the Logitech dongles and gets caught.
 Plug in and go. It works as-advertised and gets done what needs getting done. I thought it might be too small, but I'm a 6-foot guy with 6-foot-guy-hands, and I completely forgot about the size in 3 seconds. If you want a cheap mouse that works like any other wireless mouse, get this, it's a steal of a deal and works great!
 This is a cheaply made mouse that works very erratically and goes beserk all over the page. This is garbage
 Easy to set up and use. I don't like the top button on the wheel because I tend to push it in as I use the scrolling wheel. Otherwise an OK wireless mouse.
 Works great, just like the first one but blue
 This product is a compact wireless mouse which has been wonderful to use.  I recommend it.
 What a terrific mouse!  Easy to connect to both my mac and to my chrome book.  Uses 2 AAA batteries.  Very smooth and the perfect size for every day or travel.  The receiver stores in the back of the mouse so no more lost receivers!
 You get what you pay for, this mouse was cheap and only lived for 5 months. You can tell that its cheap just by holding it. Do yourself a favor and buy a trusted brand. These are dirt cheap computer mice with the amazon label slapped on them and for a few extra bucks you can buy a real one.
 A mouse is a mouse is a .... as long as it works the way a mouse is supposed to work. This one does. It doesn't light up, it doesn't have extra curves, doodads, geegaws or any other extraneous stuff. No lag time, latency or whatever it's called. Move the mouse and the cursor arrow moves immediately and smoothly. It worked right out of the box after plugging the USB thing into my laptop (Dell Inspiron) and putting in the batteries - "assembly" time maybe three minutes, counting looking at the pictures in the quick start guide. And all for $12 or so, delivered the day after ordering. What more could anyone want in a cordless mouse?
 Bought for my Samsung galaxy tab a 10.1 but have been using it for my gaming laptop. Works great. I recommend this. What doesn't amazon make :)
 This mouse works very well for everyday use. It feels solid and is very responsive even when not using a mouse pad. I current use this mouse with my smart tv and have never had any issues with connectivity. Highly recommended for those looking for an inexpensive, but solid mouse.
 Mouse worked fine the first few months and now continues to stop working intermittently for no apparent reason.  I have tried changing out batteries twice and turning off when I am not using. Seems like it's just a poor quality product.
 This is the perfect device to accompany a laptop. My old laptop had a Microsoft Mouse that died and I needed a replacement badly. I looked at other mice on Amazon in the same price range. I even looked at original Logitech and Microsoft mice but decided on the Amazon Basics and I am glad I did.<br/><br/>The mouse is small but it's a normal size for a laptop. In fact, it's a little larger than the MS mouse I was previously using. It's larger than my wife's Logitech mouse.<br/><br/>The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver  comes with two AmazinBasics AAA batteries, a Nano Receiver inside the battery compartment and basic instructions you don't really need.<br/><br/>The box it came in was minimalist and perfect. A perfect brown cardboard box and label.<br/><br/>Setting up is easy. Open the battery compartment. Remove the Nano Receiver. Plug the Nano Receiver into a USB port. Unwrap the batteries and insert them ON TOP of the clear plastic that is there to help you remove the batteries when the time comes to replace them. Replace the cover and turn on the mouse (there is a switch on the bottom of the mouse.
 10 bucks for a wireless optical mouse? It's a deal.<br/><br/>It is optical so depending on if you prefer laser, that's either a pro or con. The optical sensor emits a red LED on the bottom. The battery insertion is kinda really weird. Compact, solid. On/off switch on bottom. Performs just as well as my Logitech M310 which it replaced.
 Awesome mouse. Slightly smaller than normal size. Has good grip. used AAA batteries. Good clicker and very easy to setup
 Used this mouse immediately upon receipt. Have been using it for a couple weeks and it is working well. The test will be how long the battery lasts and whether the tracking wheel gums up (which is what happened with my Microsoft mouse). So I will have post later about that.
 Put batteries in  which are included  plug it in and go  couldnt be easier
 Its small but its comfortable in the hands. I like the face that the usb input is small enough to go inside the mouse so you don't lose it. Batteries come with the mouse and its been 4 months and I haven't changed them so its gonna last.
 If you need index finger exercise just buy this mouse. After about 30 minutes use my index finger was strained. It hurt to even think about using it again. Sorry Amazon but this one gets a D and  and that is being generous! I have been buying Amazon products for years and usually have no problems. This mouse is not one of Amazons best efforts. JJ
 Quick and Easy.. Plug and play.  it works perfectly..
 Great quality product for an affordable price
 This little mouse looked like such a good idea.  After a few months it corroded a battery and now turns itself off after a few mouse clicks.  It is also extremely loud in the clicking department.  I will look elsewhere to replace this.  My other small/travel mouse lasted years without issue til I lost the USB plug.
 This product broke within 2 weeks of purchasing it.  I tried posting a review however Amazon blocked any negative reviews.  When I called, they indicated they had many issues and were no longer accepting any reviews.
 I am very happy with this purchase.  Batteries last several months without me switching it on and off, which I suppose I should do when I don't use for long periods but I have enough things to remember.  Batteries are easy to replace.  It fits my hand well, it's on the smaller side.  This is not my first "amazonbasics" purchase and as always, I am pleased.
 This mouse stopped working after about 2-3 weeks... It took me a few months to get someone in to look at why my computer wasn't recognizing the mouse driver and it was determined that it was just malfunctioning.  At that point it was too late and  I wasn't given the option to return it anymore.  Disappointing!
 Perfect size and works great. No sense in spending a lot of money on a fancy onw when this one works just as well.
 I have tried various brands and have spent much more money on these devices but I am both impressed and very pleaased with this performance. I am running Windows Home premium 64 bit on my laptop. I inserted the nano transmitter and the system went out and installed what it needed without any issues. This mouse has excellent sensitivity and I hope it give me long service.
 The wireless mouse works very well.  It is a beautiful blue color. I have not had any problems with it.
 Bought this a couple times- it just stops working after a couple months. Tried changing batteries, on mac and pc. It connects for a few minutes, then just stops
 Cheap and it works. My only complaint is that I wish it was just a little bit bigger.
 I bought this item because my boss bought me a terrible Staples wireless mouse. That thing was awfully. This mouse was less expensive and the quality has been amazing. I have had it for a few months and it has worked flawlessly every time. Love ❤ this mouse.
 Good but battery died in 2 months, because I wasn't manually turning it off when I turned my computer off. I wish the off switch was on the side or somewhere visible so I can remember to turn it off. Other than that it's really great. A bit small. Wish it would turn itself off when not being used.
 Easy convenient storage of micro USB so traveling with this mouse a snap. One of my laptops still has windows xp and this mouse worked immediately with it. Plug and play with no hassles. One note - the micro USB comes plugged into its storage spot in the battery charger and since I blew right past the instruction manual, I found myself looking for it! Nice product. I would recommend it to anyone!
 Was great until it died after 5 months.
 Pretty nice. Slight input delay and not the highest precision. As someone who usually uses a corded gaming mouse, this can be a bit annoying sometimes when selecting text or clicking small buttons. Overall it's decent.
 It is Magic!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The mouse is smaller than the one that sits on my desk, but okay since I purchased to go mobile with my laptop. I have used it on many different surfaces, Formica, stainless steel, denim and marble.
 I bought two of these at the same time because I was so sick of my Microsoft mice.<br/><br/>Quite honestly, I have small hands, so using these with desktops are the best thing for me. I have no issues with clicking, tracking, or my computers recognizing them. I love how they use nano receivers, because my other mice, even though they, too, were wireless, had these huge, ugly receivers and made me want to hurl.<br/><br/>These mice are simple and direct. No fuss, all work and play. Love 'em.
 Headline really says it all.  I refuse to mouse with a wobbly clicker..
 The mouse worked fine for the first five months, then started to work inconsistently, and it has now almost completely stopped working at month 6.  I tried it on two different computers with different operating systems and with new batteries.  I also had to change the batteries after 4 months.
 Takes AAA batteries, so I stocked up. Bought for office use and its terrific.  No problems interfacing with Mac OS
 Works great, good price, no complaints.
 Did not last long. Stopped working very early on. Need to replace it with a different product.
 From throwing this thing in my backpack and working on the go to everyday desk use, this thing is perfect. Ideal size, sleek design, and easy to clean material. It is the basic of basic mouse, and I am a fan.
 This is a good quality travel mouse. It's smaller than a normal size mouse but it's ergonomic and feels good in the hand. It's very responsive and feels like it's well made.
 Bought this when the wheel on a more expensive wireless mouse started acting up. I have been very impressed so far- this sits comfortable in your hand, just the right size and shape, very responsive. In other words, it does what a mouse is supposed to do- work well and not attract attention to itself!
 Bought this several months ago to get rid of the mouse wire that was always getting in the way.  Just plugged the included transmitter into a USB port on the front of my desktop computer and the mouse booted up quickly, and has been working flawlessly since.
 FAST EASY SET-UP..FOR A OLD SCHOOLER..
 The clicker on my laptop was going, very frustrating, and then a friend mentioned getting a wireless mouse. Great idea! This mouse works great with my mac, and was so easy to just plug in the receiver and go. Didn't require installing a program or anything.
 Batteries have a slightly less life span than in other wireless mouse, but it's OK
 The day I received this, I immediately went on line and ordered a Logitech.  'Nuff said?  If not, I'll add a few specifics.<br/><br/>It's not awful - I didn't throw it away and could use it in a pinch if the Logitech broke and I couldn't get another one right away, and it's very cheap.  My biggest complaint was the response time.  There was a measurable time lag between the click and the action.  The scrolling was a bit off-kilter as well, and it didn't seem especially well thought out ergonomically speaking.  But hey, it was only 11 bucks.
 This mouse worked great for a little over 2 years and then it started freezing intermittently.  Replaced the battery and still freezing intermittently.  Time for a new mouse.
 I changed my review because this eats through the batteries. It takes two AAA batteries &amp; I'm changing them each month. I'm going to order a new mouse because this is costing me a lot. It doesn't have a sleep mode &amp; I often forget to turn it off. My last one had an automatic sleep cycle.
 Love the color, fits well in my hand, and does what I want it to do. So, all is well.
 IT IS NOT A BAD MOUSE FOR THE PRICE HOWEVER IT DOES NOT TRACK WELL WEATHER ON A TABLE OR A MOUSE PAD.  IT WOULD JUMP THE POINTER BY IT SELF.
 Easy to get started. Works the first time
 Worked from the start like it should!
 Just out of warranty dies after 13 months. New batteries red light on for a few seconds and then it goes off. Tried everything to get it to stay on. Just ordered a HP hope it lasts longer.
 I have  had the mouse for a little over a month now and it works well,  it was very easy to set up, simply place the batteries (2 triple A , included with purchase) into the  mouse and place the USB connector into an available USB port on your computer or laptop.  I have a windows 8 pc and I have discovered that it works well with the lap top and functions perfectly, overall it is exactly what you might expect from a mouse ,but only time will tel how long it lasts, I've found  it is great for everyday use and so far meets all my needs.
 The pointer  lags and jumps across the screen; battery changes make no difference. It's cheap, but whatever you spend is a waste.
 Probably the easiest wireless mouse I have ever bought. You can literally put the batteries in the mouse and plug the USB Receiver in the computer and start using immediately. The mouse might be a little small for some. I like it that way because I have smaller hands so it works out great.
 Bought this for my "Technically Impaired" mother and she is in love with it. Easy to set up and use, this is great value for your money. Plus the batteries that came with it are still going strong.
 So far, so GOOD!  It works flawlessly and something tells me this one will last awhile, unlike some other mice I've bought.
 Bottom battery door keeps popping off.  Bought this for my daughter to use at school and it's basically useless because the door keeps popping off.  I've looked and it and it looks like a manufacturing defect not allowing the door to seat properly.  Waste of money.
 This has been a pain ever since i bought it. It keeps losing connection with the computer, you have to unplug it and shut the mouse off then plug it back in and turn it back on.<br/><br/>Stick with the Logitech.
 I was reluctant to buy a mouse other than Microsoft brand because that was the only brand of mouse that lived for more than a couple months. But the price was right and I needed it quickly so I relied on Prime to get it to me fast. I'm very glad I did. This mouse works perfectly - much better than the mouse I'd been using. Specifically, the scrolling is smooth and silent and doesn't jump around on multi-page scrolls. Only time will tell if this mouse lasts, but even if it dies in a couple months I'm inclined to replace it with the same one.
 The mouse functions fairly well, it's not as sensitive as more expensive wireless mice You get what you pay for. The biggest problem is that the batteries don't snap in until the backing is on. And the backing is constantly popping off. Drop it and batteries fall out, set it down less than gently, the batteries fall out.  I had to put tape on the underside to keep them in, I've had the mouse less than two weeks.
 This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon. If I could give less than one star I would. When I first received the mouse it seemed to work fine; however over the next few days I began to experience extreme lagging and sometimes the mouse would just not work. I initially thought maybe it was the batteries, so I bought new ones, the mouse seemed to work for a few hours but then again started to act up. I even tried changing USB ports only to find I was having the same issue. Eventually I began to get an error message saying "the USB drive is corrupt" or something along those lines. I understand that this is one bad experience among many great reviews, but for me this mouse caused more trouble than it's worth.
 Great for the price. My dog ate my Logitech, so I thought I'd give the Amazon one a try. The mouse itself is perfect. The USB plug is bigger then the Logitech one and the sticker on the end of it bothers me, but all in all a good product.
 I'm sure Amazon has it's reasons for describing this as a basic mouse, but it's much more.  Very capable and extremely comfortable to use, it's one of the best cheese burners I've ever owned.  Much nicer than some units costing 10X more.  Congrats to their buyer who decided to stock this one!
 This product was good for a while, but then the USB sensor stopped working. It made the mouse useless. Go with a different brand and spend the money. You'll be glad you did.
 Good portable mouse. I bought this for when I have class, It is super easy to install. This Wireless adapter stores right where the batteries at are in a little pocket. It works for both MAC and PC (tried on both). Its a nano mouse so a little smaller. The mouse seems to glide easy over any surface. Battery life seems to be very good as well.
 I mean, it's a mouse. Nothing outstanding. But it feels good in the hand and works well. That's all you want in a mouse. Good price for a solid product from Amazon.<br/>Update 10/29: just stopped working.  cursor on screen doesn't move. changed the batteries and nothing. Less than two months of use. awesome.
 I've always been a fan of Amazon Basics so I was very happy to see they carry wireless mice. This is a full size mouse which is what I wanted. It fits nice in my hand and has a sensitive enough sensor so I can use this for graphic design
 Works great! Have not had any problems yet and have been using it for a few months (with the original AAA batteries that it came with). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the design is a little bulky and not sleek, but it feels like a traditional mouse in your hand and is comfortable.
 Bought this less than 3 months ago and the mouse already stopped working. I tried switching out with new batteries as well as tried testing on 2 different laptops. Switching back to Logitech, which previously lasted me 5+ years.
 We use it on a Chromebook. Works flawlessly and it's better to have a mouse for precise clicks.
 Cute mouse, smaller than I thought it would be, but it was easy to adjust to.  The color is bright, and the mouse looks and works perfectly.
 This is a great little mouse.  My hand is small-average female hand and it is very comfortable to hold.  It never breaks connection.  It's very nice, Thanks amazon!  Even my son said "I like this new mouse Mom!"  So go ahead and get it.  You won't be dissatisfied.
 It's a mouse.  It works. Price is right.
 Long lasting battery life. Very portable and slim
 My hands small and this fits great
 No frill or thrills wireless mouse. Has on/off switch on bottom. Nano receiver is small and discreet. It works and that's what matters.
 Works great! it's smaller, but it does what you need it too.
 I recently got this mouse in black.  Can't beat the price, but it's junk. It only works for a few minutes, then it stops.  Over several days I pulled out the batteries, changed the batteries, moved the dongle from one USB port to another - each time I would get another few minutes before it stopped again.  Until I gave up.<br/><br/>I thought mouses were generally interchangeable.  Not so.
 At first glance, it’s a good looking mouse. It’s quite small, but definitely usable. It’s got theee different textures to it, the one you touch the most being a very pleasant almost rubber like one.<br/>It comes with Amazon’s AAA batteries and I’m noticing they last quite a while.<br/>Connecting it is as simple as plugging the usb into your computer and pressing ‘connect’ on the mouse.
 Great mouse for the price. First one had issues, but there's a 1 year warranty. Got a new one and it works just fine.
 Use this daily in my classroom. I am able to walk around and use the wireless mouse from all across my classroom. Awesome product. Great price.
 we have bought two of these Amazon wireless Mouse products....they don't last.  They go bad without warning.  we returned one and now the second one has gone.....we are buying a different brand for a little higher price.  Works fine while it lasts.
 It’s amazon basics, that means it just works great
 I got this for my wife and she likes it. She can be quite particular about a mouse. I got one for me too and it works just fine.
 My husband was skeptical about the AmazonBasics brand since he typically buys Logitech, but I wanted the cheapest wireless mouse I could find since it would only be used occasionally during meetings. I have been using for two months with no real issues. The only thing is sometimes it doesn't work on the surface I'm using (certain tables or notepads), but if you were using a mousepad there'd be no issue.
 The mouse was working fine up until the left side of the mouse stopped working. At first I thought the batteries ran out, but after changing the batteries the mouse still did  not work when I clicked.
 Very nice mouse for the price. The only downside and it is minor, is having to remove the battery cover to store the USB antenna. I bought two and would buy two more if needed. I have used this for approximately six months, give or take a month and just changed the included batteries. They would have lasted longer if I remembered to use the on/off switch.
 Good enough for the price. USB receiver could be smaller. It uses 2 AA Batteries, that makes the mouse a little heavy.
 I like the mouse, it works well but eats up AAA batteries at a rate way more than my Logitech. It may use more power in sleep mode than most.
 Great Product, Arrived as scheduled
 I used this mouse for work every day for a year. I generally like it, but recently the scrolling wheel has started spinning free from the scrolling mechanism. In other words, you spin the wheel and nothing happens on the screen. In order to get it to scroll, you have to push down a bit on the wheel, which can be tricky because if you push down too hard, it engages the click-scroll function thing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I guess a year's worth of daily use for a $10 mouse is not bad. But I'm shopping for a new mouse now, and I think I'll get a different model.
 Serviceable for the price. The good news is it doesn't cause jump arounds on my iMac the way a Magic Mac Mouse does. The bad news is that it needs a mouse pad to function well, and it doesn't keep my set track speed when I restart my computer.
 I purchased this mouse to use with my work laptop when I travel or work remotely.  It was inexpensive and works well.
 Works good. Just get good batteries and remember to turn off the mouse when you are not using it.
 while i liked the price and the packaging that the device came in this mouse should be listed as a portable/notebook mouse, this device isnt full size mouse it the size of a portable mouse which means is not ver egonomic, while this wasnt a deal killer for me other people should know this, the device functions flawlessly and it even came with bateries whick is a great plus I only marked it 3 stars because it wasnt labeled how it should have
 What a DEAL!  This mouse works fine, just like it should.  I love it and have replaced my Apple Magic Mouse with it.  I have nothing bad to say about this simple device, it just works and the price is incredible.  Thank you, Amazonians, for bringing this to me.
 Comfortable and easy to use but apparently has no speed adjustment in the driver.
 Cute, efficient little Mouse that works well. One problem, it has fallen on the floor twice. Bothe times the back came off and batteris flew. I know DON"T DROP IT! I taped the back on to avoid it opening up and  sending the batteries all over. Been fine since.
 excellent product and good value
 This is the second Amazon basics mouse and the last one is terrible. Returning this crap. The pointer keeps moving while the mouse is still, and it also happens when you are using it.
 Battery cover won't stay on.  I've inspected it for cracks or other damage or defects but see none whatsoever.  Can't recommend.  Going in the trash....
 works and looks good, very light
 This is a fantastic product that my computer teacher recommended.<br/>I could not be happier.<br/>Thanks
 Husband likes.  what more needs be said?  We always thought Logitech was the go to.  Not so much any more.  Last one Hubby had he hated.  Now relegated as the back-up if one of ours quits.  Expect this will be like all Amazon products....Amazing...
 Been using this mouse for almost two years but it just stopped working a few days ago. I've changed the batteries, switched usb ports, reset my laptop, reset the mouse but it's still not working, even though the red light underneath is on. Would have given this 5 stars if it had worked past the two year mark. But is that what I get for paying less than $10?
 It just works, and that's all I need.
 This mouse, compared to my Logitech mouse, takes more effort to use. It's not as ergonomic, it doesn't slide on my mouse pad as easily, and it seems to lack precision in pointing and selecting the spot for clicking. Will keep it only as a backup mouse and not for everyday use.
 I had to get a replacement sent to me because of an issue with with nano receiver breaking into two pieces when I tried to remove it from the USB port.  Customer service experience was great (like always) and the mouse itself is great.  There is literally nothing special about it but I couldn't be happier for what it costs.
 I've never owned a wireless mouse before I purchased this for my daughter's laptop.  It is pretty amazing.  Very easy to install.  Just pop the chip into the USB and the computer did the rest.  Highly recommend.  Priced right as always - thanks AmazonBasics!
 This product worked fine, but after 4 months it stopped working. At first I though it was the battery, so I changes that, but it still wouldn’t work. I tried it on other computers just to make sure it wasn’t my USB port, but the mouse still wouldn’t work.
 Decent mouse for the money. Use it on the family laptop in the kitchen.  Its pretty small, which is what I wanted.  Would probably not use for a computer I would need to sit at all day.  I would want something more ergonomic.
 Great wireless mouse...great smaller size. Works well!!
 Bought this in September and stopped working already.
 This mouse rocks. Mouse click is pretty slick and responsive. Can't beat the price compared to Logitech. Amazon outsources this mouse manufacturing with a strict supervision.
 First one was missing the usb connection, but got replacement and works very well. Just plug n play.
 the wireless mouse is a good choice for those how look for good quality product at a reasonable price<br/>and do not need a fancy mouse ;)<br/><br/>I'm using this mouse from almost 6 months and I'm satisfied.<br/>I use it daily and I have change the batteries only once.<br/><br/>I recommend it!
 Awesome mouse and unbeatable price.<br/>Open box. Install included batteries. Plug in the Nano receiver. Done.<br/>Comfortable size. Light weight.<br/>Precision up, down, left and right scrolling.<br/>Precision clicking.<br/>To zoom, press the Ctrl key while scroll to zoom in and out.
 In the modern day you will go through one of these a year at school. These are great for the abuse.
 I was having problems with a much more expensive Logitech wireless mouse. It kept losing contact and I would have to turn it off and back on again to get it working. I've had good luck with AmazonBasics products in the past, so I decided to try this instead. It has worked flawlessly.
 I do not care for the battery compartment, the door to the battery compartment, and thus the storage of the dongle is a pain in the backside since the door and compartment are problematic.
 I like it, but the back cover, where the bluetooth doogle and battery compartment are located, tends to fall off easy.  I am afraid it will fall off and I will lose it.
 love the item, but wish it was more durable.  great soft feel, great price, great value...but...after 3 months the right button is failing and the item is about dead.  yes i am a pretty heavy travel user and yes the thing was 11 bucks, but i expected it to last more than 3 months.
 This mouse worked very well for just under a year before it stopped working completely. I think it had to do with the usb receiver which plugs into the computer.  Either way, Amazon was good enough to replace it, as always.  So far so good on the new one!
 Love it! Works perfectly with my Mac Mini. Couldn't be easier. So convenient without a long "mouse tail" getting in the way. Just wish I'd thought to get this sooner. Thanks to Amazon for putting their name on top quality products only. Reasonably priced also.
 Excellent mouse!  Have gone through many, many, many, many, many Logitech mouse on my Mac. So far this one is still going strong.  Smooth, light, perfect.  I was surprised, but very happy!
 After 8 months the scroll wheel became jittery and a real pain in the butt to use. Normally, Amazon electronic products have worked fine, but this one is definitely inferior.
 You have to turn the mouse on and off each time you want to use it and when your done using it. I've used other wireless mouse that you didn't need to do that with. I guess that's why the lower price though.
 This mouse is on the smaller side, but I love that.  The battery has lasted a long time. I have plugged it into several different brands of laptop and haven't ever had a problem with it.
 This mouse is very small. It is more a travel mouse. If you are used to a mouse that fits the better part of the palm of your hand try something else. If you have small hands this may be the mouse for you. The silly branding cannot be scratched/rubbed off unlike Logitech branding.
 This is the second one I have bought. The first one lasted nearly a year. Considering the price, this was acceptable. The second one lasted four months. That is no longer acceptable. I have gotten the Anker mouse in the same price range and it seems to be better constructed. I have not yet had it long enough to comment on its longevity.
 It seems the batteries wear a bit faster in these, but otherwise perfect
 I wanted a good working and low cost wireless mouse to carry in my bookbag, that's exactly what I got. It works great and it looks great. The only nit pick that I have is about how easily the battery cover pops off. If someone could get in contact with me that would be amazing. I need a replacement cover.
 Lost the old office items in a house fire. Using this little guy for hours a day. No issues at all. Very nice.
 Easy to work and looks great.
 Works well. It is smaller than an average mouse but I've adjusted just fine. I have two complaints: one, the little low-friction feet come off too easily. Also, when changing the batteries, if I forget which way around the new ones go in, it is difficult to see the indicator. I've learned to pay attention before removing the dead batteries.<br/><br/>EDIT 3/23/2017: I reduced my rating from 4 stars to 3 because clicking the scroll wheel sometimes does not register unless I press down quite hard.
 Works great! I never turn it off overnight and I have been on the same batteries for over a month.
 So much better than a mouse with a cord!  This is for a laptop and the storage space IN THE MOUSE for the USB piece is awesome!
 Stopped working after about a months use. And there is no way of contacting the seller (that I know of).
 Good product for the price. Packaging for the batteries was a bit of a problem. And then installing batteries in mouse was odd as on the mouse there is no indicators for + or - for placement of batteries. Works well though and is easily portable.
 Perfect. Great price. Worked immediately, instead of installing drivers for five minutes. Comfortable in my hand. Smooth motion on the screen. There even is a storage spot for the little USB thingy in the battery compartment. That's a great feature that I've never seen before. Now, I can carry the mouse in my work bag, and not lose that very important USB thingy.
 Works great.  The only knock on it I have, is when you take the back off, to insert the batteries, there is a large, clear, plastic piece that is hard enough to remove, that it's tough to discern whether or not it was intended to be removed.  I pulled it mostly out, put the batteries in, and things are working great on a laptop with Ubuntu installed.
 I am so pleased with this mouse.  I needed one for my laptop and this has more than exceeded my expectations.  You can't go wrong for the price.  Nothing fancy just a great portable wireless mouse.
 Its a god mouse, my wife is very hard on hers and this makes a good one for her.  She loves the wireless freedom.
 The top is very smooth...great texture for your paws.
 This is a great mouse.  I sent the first one back and later realized that was my mistake!  I could not find the USB receiver.  It is kept inside the battery compartment.  I felt like a fool, but glad I ordered another one.  It works great!
 I have had this mouse for 11 months and use it 5 days a week for work.  Recently the wheel to scroll doesn't work properly.  If I try to scroll slow it doesn't respond the wheel spins but doesn't work.  If I spin it fast it still works.  It is becoming annoying because I use the wheel all the time.  Still giving it 4 stars because it cost $11 and lasted almost an entire year of heavy use.  Will probably buy another one.
 In theory, this is a great product.  Unfortunately this wireless mouse did not work for more than a second at a time, so I returned it and purchased the same Amazon mouse with the traditional plug in which works great. I was very disappointed because it can be frustrating working with the cord from the mouse.
 Amazon Prime saved the day when my mouse went on the fritz. My husband ordered one of these a year or 2 ago and his is still going strong, unlike his computer. It's nothing fancy but it works and was a great price.
 Purchased this for my 13 year old to use with his MacBook.  After about an hour of using it, he said it didn't work very well so we sent it back.
 Works great, but it chews through batteries. I had an old Logitech that used two batteries in the 5 years that I owned it. I've changed the batteries thrice in the past year in this.
 Mouse worked fine at first, then just stopped - just outside return time.  This is the second one.  The first one failed just like this one.  Would recommend looking for a different one.  I just ordered a different mouse as a replacement.  Certainly hope it works longer.  ;&gt;)
 Looooooovee my new mouse! For years I was using the laptop mouse...I got sick of it and now I have this mouse! Is sooo precise! nice appearance, love my mouse!!! I highly recommend this product! Amazon products are the best! Really good value.
 I don't recommend.  Works well in certain conditions  (on hard surfaces and with just the right mouse pad) and works with Macbook.  Does not work on soft surfaces- so if you sit in bed and expect to use this off to the side on the mattress on top of a mouse pad forget it.  Doesn't work well enough to be functional.
 This mouse came quickly and set up was very simple. Amazon did include 2 AAA batteries to get you started. I put the dongle into the USB cord and it set itself up and just a few seconds. It does have a clicking noise,  not a loud one, but you can hear it. If you are looking for a quiet mouse, this would not be a good pick for you.
 I literally have no idea how I lived without a wireless mouse before receiving this. This optical mouse was several dollars cheaper than the cheapest model at Walmart. It came with a nano receiver that fits into the bottom in between the batteries, which makes traveling super easy! I love this thing, so much, my Mother wanted one too!
 It works, usually... sometimes it doesn't... and that angers me... until it works again, perfectly.<br/><br/>update 2-7-19. After 3 years it has officially pooped out and stopped working. I guess that's about all you can ask from a $10 mouse. So I guess that's good?
 Nope. Just nope. The bluetooth dongle is bigger than necessary. The mouse sometimes only works iff the plastic bottom lid with the batteries is closed, AND THE LID IS REAAAALLY CHEAP. Seriously, I can see myself accidentally breaking that trying to open to remove the batteries, and rendering my entire hardware useless. It uses two AAA batteries. And it has a rather ominous connect button, that hopefully I never had to use. I would recommend getting a mouse from Dell.
 Very good performance and feel.  Has textured top and doesn't slip.  I'm left handed and it works well for me.  Got a second one for my laptop.  I hate using the touch-pad or touch-screen.
 I love this and it works well
 Was excited for a wireless mouse.  Generally Amazon Basic products work just fine but this mouse just couldn't keep up with my computer, or me.  It was glitchy and would freeze mid-screen or in the land between my two monitors.  I really wanted this to work, but I guess you get what you pay for.
 The mouse is comfortable and works well if used on a black mouse pad.  Otherwise, the curser will be jittery.
 Looking at it on line, I thought this mouse was a smaller size.  I need a smaller size due to my small hands and carpel tunnel.  Unfortunately, it was not.  It will be used by another of our staff members as needed.
 Ehh. The wireless connection isn't the best, so it's pretty frustrating to use. I'm gone back to using my wired AmazonBasics mouse.
 Perfect connectivity. Feels good in the hand. It is basic without a lot of extra buttons or features which is very nice since those buttons can get in the way of basic uses.
 Connected easily, by plugging it into the USB on my Macbook Air.  It's very responsive - no lagging, but not overly sensitive where it's hard to control.  I've purchased two of these for both of my laptops.
 Stops working in a few months<br/>I’ve bought two and both were like that. Invest more in a mouse that won’t die in two months
 Can't beat it for seven bucks or whatever it cost (not much). Using it right now (after both a pricey Bluetooth mouse and a USB mouse failed).
 You get what you pay for, this thing is junk. It feels cheap, the cursor isn't sensitive enough.
 Almost a great product. Works great, but the bottom does not lay flat, so every time I try to left click it wobbles. Very annoying. I will try to exchange and hope for better on the next one.
 Good price and good product
 It simply didn't work from the day it arrived. And it was so cheap (in every sense of the word), I didn't bother returning it. I bought a more expensive mouse from Logitech and it functions beautifully. So, yes, you usually do get what you pay for.
 Already quit working!!! No more wireless mouses for me they never last long!!!!
 i used logitech and now ordered this..both are fine..but when i compare both i felt in operation and feel amazon basics is good when durability is a concern i think logitech was more appropriate..logitech i used big batteries, in this 2 small batteries..i can easily say this amazon basics beats logitech with the price..12 dollars is better than buying something tht costs 20-25 dollars..<br/><br/>if any one gets good deal lik getting logitech for 10-15 dollars go for it..
 I tried this mouse with several different computers, both Mac and PC and this mouse is slow and choppy.
 Good. Working with my laptop very well. Better than other versions available in the market.
 it's a little small - would prefer if it was bigger - not a fan of the size - I wish the size of this mouse would be multiplied by like 1.2 - works though
 I bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer at Christmas. He has used it for less than a month and it stopped working.
 This is my second AmazonBasics wireless mouse.  My first mouse worked great and suddenly failed a short time after the warranty period ended. I wrote to Amazon asking if there was a way to get it repaired at a discount and to my pleasant surprise Amazon sent me a replacement at no charge. That is superb customer services and the reason we use Amazon as our primary shopping resource. I use this mouse with my Toshiba Chromebook 2.
 Affordable and easy-to-install (seriously, it's generally just plug and play), this mouse fits all of my day-to-day needs.  I work from home on my computer 40+ hours a week and have been using this mouse for over a month now without any issues.  With a nano-usb receiver, you can plug this mouse and it will not interfere with your use.  If you're like me, you find the larger receivers to be clunky and get in the way with regular use.  The mouse itself has a smooth wheel and fits right in the palm of your hand making it comfortable and easy-to-use.  You can't find a better mouse at this price (or higher, really).
 Works great easy set up nice fit in the hand  batt has lasted for 2 months now of every few days use
 Awesome mouse.  Couldn't be any easier.  Just plug the dongle into the USB port, add 2 batteries, and it works instantly.  It has the standard 2 buttons for windows users too, and the scroll wheel is real smooth.
 This was a breeze to use. Put in batteries, switch it to "on" and there it is. Works perfectly.
 I bought this to try the Amazon brand and to replace my Logitech mouse that I lost, and I was very disappointed.  The Logitech one came with a case, which this does not.  The USB part is larger on this mouse, so I can't leave it in my laptop when I put it in my case.  I have to open the battery compartment to store the USB portion every time I take out or put away the mouse.  It would be fine if I was using it on a desk all the time and didn't have to travel with it, but it's a hassle for travel.  I will not be buying this mouse again.
 I was really liking the mouse, but it stopped working completely after just five uses. I wish it worked better for me!
 Perfect if you just want a mouse.  It's a great mouse for the price, just don't expect ultra high quality but it is a good mouse!  It works perfectly for what I need and if you don't need it for gaming or anything, this mouse should be on your list!  I love it and you probably will too!  I'd certainly recommend it!
 Perfect solution for a wiggy glidepoint on my laptop. Literally plug it in - it's perfect - even came with batteries! Used it on several surfaces, works great. For the price, can't be beat..  On a side note, it does make the annoying audible 'click' noise I could definitely do without, but it is what it is.
 It's so small it is painful to use. It needs to be twice as large to be comfortable to use. The batteries only last about 3 weeks. We would expect the batteries to last a year. Other then that it works perfectly.
 Item seems to be working ok
 I buy lots of these. Especially for Laptops. Great Price and I receive Them fast. And it works great.
 Works great for the pirce
 Low-cost alternative to other mouse brands. Fits in hand well, works with both my Windows work machine and my Macs I use at home. Other than the fact that it needs two, AAA batteries (the one it replaced ran on a single AA cell), this is a great buy. I would definitely consider another one when the time comes to replace a dead mouse.
 got mine with my chromebook a couple months ago.  One day, it started to have delayed responses and would start and stop working randomly.  Changing the batteries did not fix it.  So I stopped using it for a few weeks.  I pulled it back out after those weeks and plugged it into 3 different computers (Chromebook, Surface, Asus Desktop) and each one says it has "been corrupted" and thus it will not work.  Annoying.  At least it's relatively cheap and easy to replace.
 Easy to connect to my pc. No problems at all. Very affordable compared to the rest.
 I had trouble with the mouse - it was a struggle to move directly to a spot, and I had to lift it constantly.  I'd have returned it but didn't install it as soon as it arrived.  Had to buy a better one.
 This turned out to be an awesome mouse! I never expected anything at all, just wanted a wireless mouse because my wife is used to having those and not a big fan of trackpads on laptops. But it's way better than Logitech I use at home and the other Logitech in my office. Size is more suitable, tracking impeccable and it's pretty slick too.<br/>Not a mouse gamer would want, obviously, but very nice for casual browsing and office work
 Unlike the previous mouse I owned (different manufacturer), this one lacks a slot to store the USB antenna. So when I am traveling with my laptop, I have this little USB antenna to keep track of. Outside of that, the mouse is fine.
 Not at all happy with the quality of this product I took the mouse out of the package and went to put the batteries in and the little tab that holds them in broke. It is paper thin, not strong enough to be handled.<br/>DISAPOINTED.
 Need a wireless mouse and this gets the job done. AmazonBasics is affordable and quality products.
 That's the mouse that I had before this, and I'll be going back to it when this AmazonBasics wears out.<br/>Cons:<br/>One AA battery in the M325 would last well over a year. The two AAs in the AmazonBasics mouse last for a few months at most. Also, the little sliding pads on the bottom started to fall off within a year.<br/>Pros:<br/>Ergonomics and overall feel are good/fine. Mechanically and electronically, this has held up well for the two years that I've had it. My old M325 mouse wheel click stopped working consistently after about 3-4 years of usage.
 This is a great little mouse!  It does not have a "rubbery" finish on the sides.  My last mouse had a rubber type finish on each side and got very sticky and uncomfortable when I used it.  This mouse has smooth sides and, I feel, is a much better fit for me.
 Great value and nice compact size to put in the computer bag.  Small, yet large enough to use easily.
 I have one of this already and got this for a backup. It is well made and for me just the right size plus a great price
 The mouse jumps all over the screen. Found 1 mouse pad where it works ok. Will be buying a better quality one later down the road.
 works great...smooth movements and easy to use
 Using this mouse to write this review.  Easy to start up, smooth movements.  It is used intermittently when I am working from home; I turn off the mouse when I remove the dongle, so haven't had any issues with batter life.  After a couple months it is working well.
 Great mouse! Easy connection, great size, smooth operation!
 Great mouse. Bought this as a gift and it does the job without issue. If you are looking for quick cheap fix you can't go wrong with this. This is the second piece of hardware i have bought that are amazon basics and both are perfect price and all.
 This is a great mouse for the price. I would recommend everyone get one as compared to a corded mouse. I have used it for several months now and have not had any problems.
 I bought a cheap wireless mouse recently that was about $10, nearly the same price as this one. It was awful, didn't work well at all. I was somewhat skeptical this being almost the same price but I am pleasantly surprised. Feels and performs at a much higher quality than it's price tag would indicate.
 Terrible battery life. A pair of AAA batteries lasts six weeks. My previous wireless mouse had a battery life of about 18 months with similar use.
 I ordered this mouse in June of 2014.  The battery indicator just started blinking tonight on the ORIGINAL Amazon batteries.  Not joking.  Gets used daily for at least a couple hours.  Phenomenal!  Hopefully the new (not Amazon) batteries last as long...
 Bought two. Neither one worked with my Mac. Don't know if they will work with a windows machine.
 It worked a week. Then, it started skipping and shutting down. A new one was sent to me, no questions asked.
 I use this with my chrome laptop since I prefer a mouse. Just bought last week but so far it's been fine. I bought the blue and love it.
 I can't say anything bad about it.<br/>I recently purchased a very similar mouse that would never wake up.<br/>This mouse is much simpler and it is very reliable.<br/>Basically, it's perfect and I only regret not having seen and ordered it first.<br/>Update November 14:<br/>It's still Perfect, making it better than a Logitech.<br/>Plus it seems easy on batteries, not really sure (I changed them today, but it was months ago the last time, I think).<br/>I bought it a nice mouse pad a few days ago,. It didn't seem to care. It worked either way.
 I bought this and a Logitech M325 at the same time. The Basic seems to skip around. Though it could be Windows 10 causing it. The logitech is on my laptop that came with Win10. I upgraded my desktop that has the Basic from Win7. The M325 is just smoother operating.
 this computer mouse I have now is really a good one it fits my hand perfectly  so easy to use  love it love it love it
 The pointer jumps around or gets frozen in place.  Tried changing the batteries - same thing.  Will not be buying another.
 I called Amazon before purchasing this mouse, to ask if it was compatible with the new Windows OS (Beta). The representative was unable to confirm that it would work with Windows 10. Having had success with an earlier version of the same device mated to Windows 7, I decided to try this one with Windows 10 on a Toshiba laptop. I am pleased to say that it works perfectly. Plus, the mouse is still available at a reasonable price.
 Super easy to use. Nice size for travel. It's basic, but if you aren't doing much more than office work/web browsing, you don't need more.
 used it for gaming (cs go) and the mouse is not precise whatsoever. Actually the worst compared to the microsoft sculpt and amazon basic wired mouse and SROCKER mouses such as rechargeable and SROCKER compact soundless optical mouse 2.4ghz.
 Purchased this for a laptop computer.  Easy to install the batteries, turn on and off and easy to use.  No problems at all.
 I'd purchased a logitech wireless mouse but after some time of use, it inexplicably died on me.  I then purchased this.  This was the first time I'd bought some thing from the Amazon Basics line but I have not had any problems with it and it's made me confident in trying other amazon basics products.
 Mouse is sensitive, comfortable to the wrist.
 I have not found a mouse yet that I would give a 5 but this one for the money is a good buy. Smooth and convenient.
 Pointer jumps like a rabbit.
 It Does do the job. Easy to find when it is purple
 Great product. Great price.
 This mouse works great! It is well designed and feels really good in your hand. I purchased an HP mouse before this one and it was comparatively cheap feeling and the scroll wheel ceased to work within a few weeks. Save your money and go with the basics!
 Really great wireless mouse!
 This wireless mouse works better than most other high dollar mouse's. I would definitely recommend the Amazon Basic. Great product and super fast delivery.
 This mouse rocks! Great price, great performance! I only wish I had bought the mouse/keyboard combo pack since it was a much better deal than buying separately. I had just gotten a new work laptop and didn't think I'd need the keyboard, but now I think it would've been helpful.
 It does the job and was very reasonable.  I was afraid it wouldn't work for the price I paid but so far it works fine.
 Working just as it should. Nothing fancy prefect click every time. Haha.<br/><br/>EDIT: Range of mouse does not work with my desktop computer. Worked well with my laptop but sadly its useless for the desktop I have upgraded to.
 Very reliable mouse. Good quality. However I didn't think of it when I bought this but I much prefer a mouse which is more contoured to the shape of my hand. When I'm working for 8-10 hours a dayday, the shape matters more than I thought.
 Works great most of the time with my laptop. Sometimes a little jerky or flies around on the screen but that could be me.
 6/19/2016. Still WOrks WOnderful . It has a flashing red LED on top that will flash slowly when batteries begin to. Did not even know abut this. I leave the mouse ON all the time and the batteries have been changed just once in over ayear.
 Fits good in my hand and responds well to commands. Perfect for day to day use.
 I bought two of these in August. It is November and they are both trash now. Tried replacing batteries, tried everything, but they only work sometimes. when they feel like it. HATE THEM.
 The mouse works great with the computer
 The mouse worked fine ... until it started acting up 2 months after the purchase, experiencing some and then much more latency until it became too frustrating to use it.  I removed,  re-installed the driver to no avail.  I would try a few troubleshooting steps, get it to work fine for a few hours, until it would stop being fully operational.  Pay a little more and go with a reputable brand.  I do not recommend it
 I have used an Amazon Basics wired mouse and was pleasantly surprised by the quality, so I had high hopes for this wireless mouse. But, it does not track as precisely and smoothly as its wired cousin. Also, the bottom is not completely flat. It isn't noticeable on a mouse pad, but it wobbles slightly on a flat hard surface, as if the lowest point on the bottom is in the middle of the mouse.
 I purchased this wireless mouse to use with my laptop because the touch pad seems awkward to me.  It works great!  It has a slight rubberized feel to it which allows my hand to grip it well.  Very high quality product.
 Very good mouse.  Repeat buyer as my old mouses in my business have gone bad which were very old different mouses.
 Does every thing I expected it to.
 I really like this mouse. Have absolutely no complaints.
 Works great. No issues
 This mouse works OK. Sometimes It loses signal on my Chromebook. It feels a bit cheap, and after only a few months it is already scratched. But this mouse was only about $7. So I got what I paid for.
 This mouse worked perfectly the first year. Just yesterday the right side battery kept popping out. If I push it back in it will stay put for a couple minutes, but pop back out. It hinders productivity and is quite frustrating so I will need to look for a new mouse. Before this started happening, I enjoyed this mouse very much- size, tracking, price, simple and clean. So unfortunate that I can't use it anymore.
 Exactly as advertised, it is a wireless mouse made by Amazon. Despite the low price, it is high quality. I have no complaints.<br/><br/>My only qualm is that this connects via nano-USB receiver as opposed to Bluetooth, but I (and you) already knew about that before I purchased it. 5 stars/Perfect.
 It works wonderfully so far. It's small, so it fits comfortably in your hand, and it's not too sensitive that you have to treat it delicately. If you do get it and are eager to use it right out of the box, don't panic when you can't find the little USB chip to use it! It is tucked safely inside between where the AAA batteries (included in the box) go. It says so in the instructions you receive with it, but I'm adding this in case you end up tossing them aside just as I did. :] I would very highly recommend with the experience I've had so far.
 Awesome, great value for the money.
 Purchased this to work with my Zmodo NVR wireless security cameras, so I could monitor the cameras on a TV. This thing works well even when the tiny USB receiver is plugged in 15 ft away from the unit.
 Easy to use, basic wireless mouse.  I bought it to replace my logitec mouse that was malfunctioning.  This is comfortable in my hand and I appreciate the on/off switch so I can save my battery.  BTW it comes with 2 AAA batteries.
 Good while it lasted.  Worked for 10 months and then just died.
 Honestly, I really like the little mouse. It works very well, not stutters that you see on some of the older wireless mice, or cheaper ones. Smooth operation, overall it does just what it is supposed to, and does it well.
 Work quite well and inexpensive.  No complaints and no issue with them.
 So I have had this mouse since March 19,2015. Today's date is May 25,2015. This particular mouse has connectivity problems with the receiver. The mouse stops working. I could jiggle the receiver in the USB slot and it would start to work again. Unfortunately, it was a temporary fix to a bad problem. Over the next couple of weeks the issue got worse.So far, this mouse has been an epic let down. Made in China. Who knew? I finally contacted Amazon and received a replacement free of charge. I may change my star count if the replacement is somewhat better.
 Great quality for a cheap mouse!  I was impressed, although Amazon Basic stuff is normally pretty good.  Clicks are super quiet, scroll feels good.. no issues
 I like this small size light wireless mouse because it has a built in storage area for its receiver.
 Wouldn't think too much about a mouse even if it's wireless. It does what it's supposed to do for its price and I'm thankful for that. Has a small USB connector so keep it safe, thankfully there is a slot in the mouse you can put it in. Overall it's simplicity is what makes it great. Dropped it a couple times but it's still working fine and responding perfectly. There is no DPI changer for those looking for that, I would guess you would have to do that through your PC mouse sensitivity​.
 Liked this one best
 I am very happy with the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with the Nano Receiver that I bought from Amazon.  It is compact and comfortable.  I have used it with a laptop with Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 with no issues.
 Christmas purchase and so far so good!
 Hate this mouse. I have had MS Mouse 6000 for a few of my laptops. They were sensitive and responsive. I have to repeatedly bang on this thing  to get it to work.  Perhaps I received a lemon.  Don't have problems with other Amazon brand techy things. Fed up, going to the office store tomorrow to look at some decent technology.
 I bought one of these for home and it has worked very well. Purchased a second one to use in my office and the connection is unstable; it jerks around the screen with no precision and is impossible to use after just a month or two of owning it.
 Bought as replacement. Good for small spaces
 Searching Amazon on my laptop just got a whole lot easier ;)
 This is an excellent wireless mouse, especially considering the price.  It tracks very well and executes commands without problem.  It's basic and basic looking, which is fine with me.  I bought this to work with my Chromebook, and it syncs perfectly.
 Works great. Now Amazon should offer a keyboard to go with it, then it would be awesome
 I love this mouse. It’s very durable unlike other mouses I have used. On top of that it has a compartment for the USB port to be stored that doesn’t wear down over time being used.
 The mouse did not work.  Batteries worked, and lights on the mouse worked.  Further, USB recognized the device, but the device would not communicate with the USB receiver provided.  Tried to reconnect manually using the 'connect' button on the bottom of the mouse, but nothing I did would cause the computer to recognize the mouse.  Tried the mouse on multiple computers to no avail.
 I have narrow and long fingers; thus, it's difficult to find a good sized mouse for a reasonable price.<br/>It does feel cheap either. The scroll wheel doesn't fly when you use it. It was easy to install and comes with 2, AAA batteries.
 What can I say? It's an optical mouse that's inexpensive (but not cheaply made), and portable. It's as responsive as any other mouse I've ever used. Ergonomics are just fine. I especially like that the USB receiver is stored in the battery compartment when not in use.<br/><br/>Amazon got everything right with this. Will probably buy more in the future.
 The mouse worked so well on my laptop that I bought a second one for another Laptop.  Putting the batteries in the mouse was a little different because they insert at a angle,  but it wasn't a big deal.  The mouse has a good natural feel to it and works better than a lot of name brands that I have owned that cost more.
 Great wireless mouse. Nice hand-feel and laser-light tracks on a variety of surfaces. One word of warning/caution, however. The USB terminal is tiny and comes (hidden) inside the battery compartment. I returned the first mouse I ordered thinking that, somehow, that part must not have been packed at the factory. Amazon very promptly replaced it (great service!). When the second mouse I received didn't have the USB terminal, I decided to look deeper, took off the battery cover, and BAM! There is was.
 So far, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and doesn't seem to have any adverse effect on my computers operating system. If needed, I will continue to purchase this product, so long as the prices stay where they are at.
 Worked wonderfully for a while, but then like others have noted the nano receiver started malfunctioning.  If I press on it while it's in the USB port, it works, but if I let it go it fails.  This happens on three different laptops.  I was expecting better quality from Amazon.
 Item came as described
 Unless you're a gamer or a graphic designer who needs some sort of ultra-precise mouse, this is a great, affordable product.<br/><br/>Note: If you have large, viking/ lumberjack-sized hands, this mouse might be too small for you.
 good size easy to use
 Very pleased with quality. Fast shipping.
 Does the job exactly the way you’d expect.
 Once again, I purchased this for my mom. It does its job but not anything special.
 Highly recommended!<br/><br/>My daughter wanted this for her laptop, that while a super powerful gaming laptop didn't come with a bluetooth adapter (go figure...). We didn't realize this had it's own bluetooth adapter with it, hidden in the battery compartment that you just pop out and put in your USB port (we used our 2.0 port with no issues, so 3.0's are open for other things). We originally bought a bluetooth adapter and this not realizing there was one within. (Note: another Amazon shopper let me know that it's technically not a bluetooth adapter that it comes with, but however it works it does so really well).<br/><br/>The beauty of it having it's own bluetooth adapter is that there is essentially NO set-up other than plugging the adapter into the port and turning the mouse on once batteries are in - you really can't find installation simpler than that! So, pretty much anyone - even the least techie of persons - can easily use this mouse. Honestly, the installation of the mouse was so simple I thought for sure I was missing something! However, once I put in the usb adapter and turned on the mouse it immediately started to work. Yay for super easy to use tech!!!
 It does the job.  I needed it to replace an older wireless mouse that was not responding.
 I use my laptop as my primary computer and having the wireless mouse is incredibly helpful.  I wish I had gotten it sooner.  The Amazon mouse fits well for my hand size too and works really well, even without a mousepad.  I was worried that the battery life wouldn't last very long but it does - and I rarely turn it off (which it has as a feature).
 This is a great little mouse, so far the best wireless one I've bought or tried.  I constantly forget to turn it off and still one battery.  You move the mouse and it works like a wired one, it just sync's no screwing around.  Being able to leave the receiver in all the time a plus as well.  Nice product, quick shipper.
 Inexpensive and well-built. A great value for the price paid. The included "low battery" indicator is great, and I like that I can store the receiver inside the mouse when I move things/travel/etc. In this case, the "generic" (AmazonBasics) is as good as (if not better than) the brand names.
 April 2016 - update - It gets wiped after every use with disinfectant and still rock solid.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>Bought it, two days later I plugged it in and it worked. Just like that. Right left click and a roller. Infrared reader on the bottom. Batteries included.
 The fact that the battery dies when you don't manually turn this off is a deal killer for me. This is going in the trash so I don't have to buy another large pack of batteries.
 This lasted just 3 1/2 Months!  It keeps cutting in and out, making it impossible to get anything done.
 Works well so far.
 Thought I had a bad product. It just needed a new battery. D'oh!!
 You can never go wrong with AmazonBasics products and this mouse is no different. I expect this to endure lots of clicking and scrolling for years to come. Battery life is average with normal use, I'd say 2-3 months life. Probably the best buy for a wireless mouse on here, get it and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
 my 4th grader is able to use this mouse without any problems with her school laptop.
 Got one for my wife's laptop.  She loves it.  Much more comfortable than using the touchpad.  The mouse is kind of small - definitely not as large as the average wired mouse - but still comfortable.  Setup on Windows 8 was a piece of cake; plug the nano receiver into the laptop, remove the battery protector on the mouse, turn it on, and you're ready to go.  Happy mousing!
 This mouse is fantastic!  I love it!!  Got it for work since we have laptops, and use it 100% of the time (not just when my laptop is undocked).  It's that great!!  I have great control of it, the feel is very nice, and it seems very durable.
 Bought this product in May, and it worked flawlessly for a couple of months. However, it had begun randomly seizing up and freezing, while sometimes straight up losing connection to the USB stub. This has absolutely destroyed my productivity as the mouse will not function for a quarter of the time.
 Good working,fots great and works just fine
 It only works for 3-4 months. I bought one last year and worked for few months and then its wireless simply stopped working. Then, I thought maybe that was only one time problem for that single mouse, So I ordered another one. Again, after exactly 3~4 months the same thing happened to second one. So I am pretty sure the life time is around 4 months more or less.
 With close to six thousand reviews and 4 and a half stars I'm kind of disappointed.  The first unit crapped out after two weeks, the second after five days.  Perhaps I got two stinkers in a row.  Replacement number three is on the way.  Keeping my fingers crossed.
 I love the mouse.  I find the touch pad on my computer to be a bit frustrating to use and the mouse took care of that issue.  Very easy to use.
 This one may be a dud.  It arrived March 12, as of May 13 it was on the 3rd set of batteries!!  The batteries are new.  Other reviews comment on long battery life but not for this mouse.  With new batteries the mouse works great, but instead of replacing batteries again I will get another  brand of mouse.
 This wireless mouse arrived today. It was sitting at my door step when i got home from work. It took me less than a minute to get it to work on my laptop. I've been without one for about a year and am really satisfied with how easy it connected to my computer! I would recommend this one to anyone!
 Mouse had erratic tracking.  I confirmed the problem was the mouse by substituting another mouse to confirm.  Returned the item.
 Such a reasonable price for a great little mouse!  I have a new wireless HP computer and printer and I wanted a mouse.  I saw this one for sale and read the favorable reviews, so I figured that I didn't have a lot to lose as the price is so reasonable.  It works GREAT!  So easy to set up and use.  I recommend it highly!
 The mouse is perfect and the price is phenomenal.  All I need to say about that.+
 Just as expected
 Worked well for the first few weeks but is now no longer working. The nano receiver malfunctioned and came apart first use. I believed it would work if I left it in the laptop but after a while it kept saying it wouldn't read and would not connect to the mouse. The mouse is nice and stylish and amazingly good but yeah, the Bluetooth stopped working a few weeks in.
 Connects instantly, tracks very well, and hasn't shown any glitches or defects whatsoever. Got this to replace a faulty Bluetooth mouse (I suspect it might actually be the fault of my Mac's Bluetooth module), and I won't be going back. Still on my first set of batteries after long hours of daily use.
 So far no issues with it! It is a good quality wireless mouse!
 Basic mouse usage a few hours/day 3 or 4 days/wk.  Nothing unusual.  Replaced batteries, restarted, reconnected.  Nothing.  Just won't connect or work any longer.  Until today it worked great!  Probably not worth trying to return, etc.
 What can I say? It's simple, of high build quality, and works as advertised. An easy, no-brainer purchase. No issues with the item whatsoever, and it's compact enough that it makes travel a breeze. Alternately, it's not so small that the device is uncomfortable in a static, office/desk setting. Excellent design, excellent balance.
 I use on shop computer and it works good and fast
 Works like a dream. Easy to install and has worked perfectly ever since
 I love the storage compartment for the USB! Nice fit - easy to use. I have confidence in this mouse that it cannot be hacked.
 Because of the price of these thigs my expectations were low, but I was blown away by the responsiveness and feel of it. I would highly recoment this as your daily mouse (not for gaming)
 I can't believe how long the batteries lasted right out of the box.  The cursor will occasionally start flapping around uncontrollably, but it isn't usually a problem.  You move this mouse, the cursor moves.  Why spend more money to do the same thing?
 Good battery life. Accurate. Affordable. Will reorder this mouse for life.
 I had the same experience as others with negative comments.  It worked great the first day and then was very jerky the second day.  I replaced the batteries, and that seemed to solve the problem until day 3.  Now its back to jerky again.  I tried turning the mouse on and off and moved the receiver from one USB port to the other, and that didn't help.  You get what you pay for. Very disappointing performance.
 Super fast delivery, great colour and solid mouse.
 no issues, no problems. Performs as advertised and expected. Great buy.
 Good mouse for the price.  but I just which it would not skip when I used it.
 Questions &amp; Answers indicate this is a "normal sized mouse" and a "common size mouse" but it is much smaller than expected (I consider my hands small-average for an adult).  I would only recommend it for someone with small hands or for travel/somewhere with limited desk space.  Overall, as a very basic wireless mouse it works well.
 What is there that I had to say specifically, after so many positive reviews about this item. Works best to its specification. Very Responsive and very Cute! That's right very cute. Only wish it could have been little larger that what it is now in size. Cause little pain after continous longer usage time.Especially could be hard on bigger hands. For that only reason giving 4 star else would have easily a 5 STAR worth.
 I've purchased two of these.  The first quit working after a few weeks.  Now the other is going out.  It seems the receiver doesn't make a good connection with the computer's usb port. And it's not with just one computer.  I have two and it happens with both of them.  Not a good mouse.  Not buying again.
 This mouse started malfunctioning after less than a year of use. The laser started going nuts and the cursor danced across the screen even when I was not touching the mouse.  Do not buy this if you plan on using for accuracy or any PC gaming needs.
 Love the mouse, but wish it was Bluetooth instead of RF, I wouldn't need to use a dongle. Regarding that dongle, I didn't read the manual at first so I couldn't find it. I was about to call Amazon when I saw it was tucked inside the mouse. Smart, but please add a removable sticker or something on the mouse that says so.
 Worked for 2.5 month, then Windows 10 would no longer recognize the USB device.  Unfortunate.  :(<br/>Tested it in 3 machines, so must be a hardware failure with the receiver, not a software/driver issue.
 This didn't last long. Within a few months it would just stop working unless I restarted the computer. I don't have time for that. My mini corded USB mouse it more reliable.
 Easy to connect. Looks business. Works good.
 No problem. Install included batteries. Plug in Nano chip ,turn on mouse. Ready in 5 seconds.
 Strong and high quality wireless mouse
 This mouse works great unlike my last one that died within a few months of purchasing it. Though, I've never had a problem with AmazonBasics products I have bought so I wouldn't expect it :). It's stylish and small (if you have large hands, it may be too small for you). I love it!
 SO easy to setup, comes with batteries included, love that there's a compartment inside the mouse to hold the usb receiver when it's not plugged in to the computer (e.g. when transporting, etc.)
 Haven't use this Mouse yet. I've purchased as a back up to my wireless mouse for those times that I forget to recharge it.
 I received this mouse a few days ago and I love it. I don't mind the small size and it even makes it easier to travel with. I take it with me everywhere with my Asus. It connected flawlessly and the design is simple. Even has a little slot inside to carry the USB connector when not in use.
 A little smaller than standard mouse. Perfect for my child sized hands. Hooked up in seconds.
 Worked fine for 60 days.....<br/> 3 days outside of warranty / return.....it dies :-(<br/>I know it only cost $10 dollars but a mouse should last a lot longer ......
 Great mouse plugged the dongle in, and away it went. The sole reason for me purchasing this product is that the dongle fits inside the mouse, so when travelling and placing your Lap-top in a carrying case the dongle is not accidently pulled out and lost.  Like the size of the mouse. Fits into ones fingers correctly.
 Bad quality. Not efficient. Very hard and heavy.
 For the value, this mouse is UNBEATABLE.<br/>So, it isn't bluetooth, but that's fine. It DOES work with Android phones and tablets if you plug the USB dongle into an OTG cable.<br/><br/>I've had this mouse for months and months now, and it is simply excellent. Batteries last a very long time, I go months before replacing them.<br/><br/>Very good signal. I play games like Skyrim with this mouse and experience no latency at all.<br/><br/>Recommend to anyone, for any purpose. Buy this product. It works.
 These are great, cheap, wireless mouse options.  I have a few of them for my laptops and they take a lot of abuse.  They have found the floor on multiple occasions.  Only wish the battery door would stay on during some of the drops to the floor (though that may be asking too much) because I lost one - the mouse still works great...
 Works great! Nice to be able to use my laptop without wires. The one thing I didn't realize was that there is a usb hub that now sticks put of my computer that the wifi works out of. Minor issue.
 I've bought several mice in recent months. I was impressed with the Amazon Basics mouse. It had an overall "better" feel &amp; function. Seemed to be of a higher quality. I'll likely buy another.
 Word to the wise. This is a mini!
 One of our wired mouses was functioning poorly so bought this on a 'deal'.  It works, has some lag which I don't like... kind of like steering a bumper boat.  Husband uses it without complaint, but I much prefer my wired mouse which is precise.
 I love this mouse because the transmitter is low profile.  I had one before that stuck out quite a bit and it was always getting in the way.  This one is awesome!  House works great and the scroll wheel has a "click" about it which helps with some of the applications I have to use for work.  Love it!
 Don't bother. Small on / off. Difficult battery door. Keeps opening.
 It does the job for the price. I feel like the mouse is a little laggy.
 It works only in close ~2 foot proximity to its wireless dongle. This means I can't use it when my laptop is connected to my larger screen because the display port interference doesn't allow me to use the USB port next to it and my USB hub is too far away (~3 feet) to make a good connection with the mouse. On the other hand, the mouse works fine when I am traveling and have the dongle plugged into the USB right next to where I am using the mouse.
 Item arrived on time and in condition expected.<br/><br/> There was no need to install driver software. As soon as the mouse was turned on and the USB receiver was connected to my laptop the mouse was working as expected. Quick and simple installation.
 Great device
 This mouse is great for normal use. Great battery life, no signal interruptions, and gets the job done for a very low price.
 I take my laptop everywhere and I hate using the stupid little finger swipe mouse on the laptop.<br/><br/>I'm a college student and stay on campus often so this mouse gets used often.<br/><br/>THis mouse as slightly smaller than a standard mouse and It has a on off switch which is a plus.<br/><br/>It comes with batteries.<br/><br/>Overall A++
 too small to hold comfortably in my hand but my 6 year old niece likes it
 The mouse was priced well and came in different colors. It worked flawlessly for 6 months, then sporadically. I had to unplug and reinsert the nano receiver to make it work. Other "mice" worked fine, so it wasn't a problem with the PC. This became so distracting that I stopped using the mouse.
 I was really looking forward to receiving this mouse. After reading the reviews about how good it was, I was disappointed. When I opened the battery compartment I tried removing the plastic but some of it was stuck. I decided to pull as hard as I could and it never came out. Will be returning.
 It's inexpensive, works great, and we love it.  Simple...<br/>I don't mind staring at the "Amazon Basics"  logo for the duration of the mouse either because the cheap price makes up for it.
 Very nice mouse. It's hard to review a wireless mouse, but this one somehow exceeds expectations. It had a solid feel, and smooth movement. The buttons feel sturdy as well, and the exterior finish prevents any type of sweaty Palm discomfort. Overall, I'm happy with this mouse for the price, and would consider purchasing one again in the future
 Solid mouse, but goes through batteries like nobody's business.<br/><br/>Had to revise this down to one. Despite even turning the mouse off for long periods of time, it burns through batteries every 1-2 weeks. Just freaking ridiculous to the point of being defective.
 Works great. Small and comfortable.
 Pros:<br/>Cheap<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Eats batteries 2-3 times faster than Logitech mouse<br/>Cursor often has nervous jitters, regardless of surface the mouse is on<br/>Batteries do not fit properly - they want to pop out until the cover is put on (don't lose the cover)<br/><br/>Would I recommend this product to a friend? No
 I wanted an old school style mouse that I could simply move around as I cannot get used to the ones with a touch surface or trackball. Product has been working well for me and was also very inexpensive.
 Works great! The scroll feature is smooth and not too fast. Feels good in the hand. Blue color is nice!!
 Works great. Reactive but, not over sensitive like other brands. Highly recommend
 Feels good in your hand.  Small and easy to transport.  Little receiver conveniently fits into the bottom of the mouse.  Responsive and easy to set up.
 Works well, but after a while, it stops tracking properly and gets the jitters.  I found that all I had to do was turn it off and back on and it recovers.  Small nuisance.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Update: After further use, this lack of tracking is driving me nuts. I constantly have to turn it on and off. I now consider it a major defect and wish I hadn't ordered it.
 I bought this AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse in hopes it will work with my Acer Chromebook. To my surprise it works just perfect for my Chromebook.<br/><br/>(I spoke to Acer twice regarding what kind of accessories will work with a Chromebook such as a wireless mouse and they both told me you can only use products that are for Chromebook's only). I decided to purchase this Amazon Wireless Mouse and it works great with my Chromebook.
 I ordered this product and then asked for a replacement because I couldn't find the receiver.  Be aware it is in the battery compartment.  Amazon sent my replacement quickly and it works great!  Connected quickly, and I am in business.<br/>It is a good product and just what I needed.
 I love this mouse! It had a nice feel to it and it is very responsive.<br/>It fits perfectly in my hand!<br/>However I have pretty small hands being a girl and all.<br/>When I told my boyfriend I would buy him one too since his wireless mouse (from highschool) broke not too long ago, he used it for a minute and said it was far too small for his hands.<br/>So for the guys out there, this may be more suited as a travel size mouse!
 Great low priced mouse that has never had any issues.
 Battery cover keeps falling off. It is poor design and too loose.
 Perfect size to carry in laptop bag when traveling.
 I don't really like the location of the chip inside where the battery is located. It makes it inconvenient to take out the chip and then put it back but for the price, it is a pretty good mouse to use. Haven't had any problems. Also note that it comes with 2 batteries! I almost through out the batteries with the box it came in but then I saw it.
 Works perfectly and feels like the right size for my hands.
 Great value, nice colors, works wonderfully with my chromebook.
 I got this for my mom who is not very computer savvy. Easy to use and comes with the batteries, plug in the tiny adapter and use right away. May not be appropriate for those who plan to use it for gaming but I would not hesitate to buy this item again.
 as usual amazon comes through again. I ordered this because the mouse that came with my new Microsoft keyboard was junk with jitters. this one is perfect in every  way so far. no jitters and nice and small for your hand. very much worth the money. thank you amazon......R. Jones
 I love this mouse!  I had another one that was a pretty color and was like, 9 bucks, but was never connected!  I had to unplug and replug every time I shut my lap top.  This one is NOT like that!  I close my laptop 20 times a day and this little thing is connected every time!  I have smallish hands and this mouse is perfect for me!
 This is a very nice mouse. It is very comfortable in the hand, works perfectly, and it looks nice too.
 Great addition!
 My computer runs W7. This was the most difficult to install mouse I've ever used, but that's only because it took 3 tries and one USB socket change to get it to load and operate. Since then it's worked fine, and smooth. Give it a bit more time, with no problems, and I may raise the rating to five.
 Great value for the price. The little interior compartment for the USB wireless adapter makes it suitable for travel. Setup was easy -- plug it in, turn it on. There have a been a few instances where mouse movement got jerky and sporadic, and I had to pick it up and put it down again to re-establish it -- I've never had to do that with a wireless mouse before, and the only reason I give it four stars. That might have something to do with my desk.
 Great value!  Perfect companion a small tablet computer or chromebook.  I have the awesome Toshiba Chromebook 2 and this little mouse compliments it really well.  It came with batteries to boot so it's ready for use put of the box.  It feels good to the hand, just the perfect small size.
 I bought this mouse to replace my old larger Microsoft mouse that has an "Optical Receiver 3.0" thing with a cable... that always needs to be within a few feet to work well. I was hoping to have something to work a bit farther away, perhaps on the couch for the media center PC. So this mouse is about 2/3rd the size and comes with a USB receiver (found in the battery compartment!)  that is not a Bluetooth, but rather some other wireless device. It really needs a proper mouse pad to work even marginally well. My other mouse works well on the carpet - this one is virtually unusable in that scenario. I disabled the other mouse in device manager and fussed with the speed and "Enhanced Precision" settings with not much improvement. So ok, a mouse pad is no big deal - but even there - it seems to "stutter" and jump around. Not at all a fluid movement like the other optical Microsoft mouse. Amazon is really great on their return policy, but I still give this only 3 stars as it is really not usable for me. If you are using it at a desk, with a good mouse pad - it may be worthwhile, particularly for the price. So I've ordered another Microsoft mouse - this time the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse with something called "BlueTrack Technology" that (supposedly) "Works on more surfaces than optical or laser technology".
 i love this mouse i bought it for my mother, and me being a more of the touchscreen pad kind of person i'm starting to think about buying myself one of these, i think my hate of computer mice came from the cord itself and from the couple times i have used her laptop i see that its very comfortable. i would recommend this to anybody its very efficient and durable ( my mother wen through three different mouses last year, which was what led me to buy this for her.)
 So far, so good, it's a mouse, it works, and more importantly it doesn't matter if I'm using my left or right hand, it feels the same. I use this with a MacBook Pro and it was plug-and-play, worked out of the box. Have only had a month, and I keep it off when not in use so unsure of battery life yet.
 Its working well.
 Worked perfectly for my Mac. I'm a huge fan of the Amazon Basics line. So far everything from them has worked flawlessly and cost less then any branded counter part. The mouse is no exception. Fits comfortably in the palm of the hand and has a nice grippy texture. Buttons and wheel feel very responsive.
 This is my second one--got this to have in case first one conks out--that one's 2 yrs old and<br/>A working great!
 Easy to set up and use. Would recommend to others.
 Surprisingly high quality, like most of the Amazon Basics stuff. I really like this mouse, it's small, has a comfortable feel to it, and the click is positive, not sloppy at all, and quiet.
 Great basic mouse for the price. Nice response and works well on my tablet. Good value for the price.
 Basic wireless mouse! It seems to be holding up fine! It's only used periodically, but when it is, it works! It was simple to set up, and came with batteries which is GREAT.  I will purchase this mouse again as needed!
 We ordered two of these,  Both died on us after a year.  Also it takes two AAA batteries and goes through them very fast.  Don't waste your money buying this product
 Why didn't I switch to a wireless mouse sooner?  I love this thing!  It connects automatically and it's so simple.  I do NOT miss the extra wire.  It has a nice feel to it.  It's symmetrical, so lefties would like it equally.  Seems like it's well built.
 Works great. I leave it on all the time and the batteries haven't run out in two months. It is a bit small though, so for me it'll only be a travel mouse. It just doesn't quite fit in the palm of my hand (and I have pretty small hands). The body feels nice though, and it has a good weight without being too heavy to carry around.
 Okay but lasted less than 2 year and then started acting erratically.
 VERY DISAPPOINTED. I so MUCH wanted this to work well but I removed it only minutes after installing it. Very poor tracking accuracy and much too heavy. I have generally had excellent results from AmazonBasics products, but this was a major exception!
 It works
 work great.  Easy to use and i love the color
 Perfect functioning, but would like the power switch to be larger so it can be operated without "Sloth Claws" and maybe "UP is ON" like everything else in an American home?
 Was a gift
 Optical sensor never lit up after correct battery installation and turning unit to "on" position. Does not work. Amazon policy requires buyer to pay for shipping return which costs as much as the product itself. I am going to fight my Visa charge.
 Very good
 I bought this for my wife, who has limited real estate at her recliner.  It's a basic mouse with basic functions, but she finds it very comfortable.  She has had problems with a couple of other mice with cursor speed, jittery cursor, etc.  None of those problems have shown up with this mouse, as it works perfectly.
 Nice basic mouse. Feels comfortable in my hand and works fine even on my couch cushions. I knocked off one star because it uses more batteries than my previous mouse and the way the batteries are inserted makes them difficult to remove. Overall, happy with purchase.
 I'm using this mouse for a desktop computer at work that is less than 3 feet from the mouse.  This mouse is extremely jumpy and freezes up constantly.  It's a huge pain to work with.  Might be ok for a laptop mouse where you're using it right next to the receiver.
 i bought two of these one for me and one for my daughter.  It works great with my pc but does not work with my daughter's MAC.  The product description says it would work with the MAC.
 I love this mouse. I haven't used a mouse but for some school related software, I needed a mouse. This is perfect for the purpose. The one thing I love about this mouse is it has a compartment to store the little receiver inside the battery compartment. That is a brilliant idea.
 Basic wireless mouse. What is it that i like so much about it? well, it works very well, it is comfortable to use, basic but with good looks and totally inexpensive. A go for Amazon products!
 Great mouse for a fraction of a Logitech price. Works well and I really like it.
 Works great and saves me having a mouse with an attached tail!
 Nothing fancy, but it's all you need
 This is a full size wireless mouse. I bought a 11 inch laptop not sure why they paired it with this
 This mouse is awesome!  I use it with my laptop all the time and I would never know it was a wireless mouse.  I have used a few in the past that didn't feel like a regular mouse.  It has a really great feel to it and it connected to my computer with no issues.  I have several Amazon Basics products and love them!
 It's a nice mouse, great fit into palm of hand, but I get interference ( I live close to train tracks) and will cause the mouse pointer to lag. I don't know if this is common, but the mouse itself is a great bargain buy, good quality.
 It started off working great but after a few months, the cursor would just not respond well. I tried changing the settings in the control panel. Ordered a new Logitech mouse and it works perfectly. I guess you get what you paid for. This mouse lasted about 6 months.
 I use the mouse everyday and it is working fine.
 super simple mouse, that works great. It is a smaller mouse, but it fits in the hand perfectly.
 Very satisfied with this product. I use it for daily computer use. I recommend this product to anyone who's thinking about it. One thing though. The mouse wheel doesn't have that thing that can move back and forth you web browser like other mice have. But not a deal breaker.
 This mouse is the best I've ever had!! It is super easy to connect to your computer. Love the storage for sensor. Some say the mouse is small, but it fits my hands perfect with no problems whatsoever! You will not have any problems with this Amazon Basic product!
 Great little mouse.  Has a very nice quality feel, especially compared to my Logitech 510, which feels very cheap in comparison.  Everything just feels right, it glides over a mouse pad, the scroll wheel feels great and the button action is perfect.  The only gripe I have is the range isn't that great.  If I plug it into the back of my desktop computer, it behaves poorly, it needs to be front mounted for good reception.
 Good price, good quality, I use this on my laptop, nice to have a mouse...
 Setup and first use could not be easier. This is a great little wireless mouse at a good price. The Bluetooth adapter plugs into a USB port and its ready to use. I like that the adapter conveniently stows away in the battery compartment.  I am very happy with this purchase.
 As expected. Will see how long it lasts.
 Works exactly as it should, but be careful and don't lose the small USB - Bluetooth plug (Nano receiver).  Although very small, the plug is jut big enough to interfere with a tight fitting carrying bag.  Almost too small for old clumsy fingers.
 Lights came on, but nobody was home... This would power on, but I could not get it to work with 3 different computers.
 Barely works 2 ft.
 Sturdy mouse and the batteries it came with lasted a while.
 It does what it is supposed to, but not as smoothly or effortlessly as other expensive mice. If you need a good basic wireless mouse, this fits the bill. Have used it for a month and haven't run into any big issues, just minor inconveniences like the tracking not being smooth or getting hitchy.
 FAST SERVICE USE PRODUCT DAILY GREAT
 Works great for over 4 months now.
 Works great. Smaller mouse. Wireless and easy to use
 Great mouse! Love the color blue! Love that it works and easily connects to my computer!
 I am using it right now and it is absolutely wonderful. I would be willing to purchase other products from this company.
 Update - one year later.  Not working. . .Not sure if there is a fix or if these only have a one year life span. . ..Nice affordable mouse. . .feels and moves well.  Not too loud of a click (if that makes sense.)
 Works ok, but eats batteries. I have to replace them about once a month.
 batteries a little difficult to get in but got it to work
 Not only is this a great mouse for the price, but my daughter simply loves it.
 Working from home
 Happy with the wireless mouse. Works well from a distance, can pass around the classroom for student to use during presentations.
 This mouse is perfect for on the go and connecting it to your laptop. works great but not for everyday or all day use.  something to be using quickly. I use it at work when i have to take my laptop out on the production floor (i work in manufacturing) and need to hook up automation equipment for troubleshooting. works great build la little cheap but fine for what i need it for, no complains.
 Purchased this a while back, I've been running on the same battery the mouse came with and it's still works. Very easy installation, no disc necessary, it's more like plug and play that easy! If I could give it 10 stars I would but limited to 5.
 Still working great, nice feel in your hand, roller nice and smooth
 It is a working mouse, I did not expect anything more than what I got.
 Worked fine as basic mouse for first few months, then began to respond erratically.  A battery change did not help.  So, no surprise, it's no top of the line Logitech or MS, but I'd expected a longer trouble free period.  Fortunately it's covered by the Amazon warranty.
 Exactly what I wanted. An inexpensive wireless mouse that can withstand daily use. 8+ hours a day, 40+ hours a week I have this little mouse rocking.
 Item thus far is out performing old mouse which was also purchased from Amazon. Dell's comfortable in the hand.
 Functions pretty well. Haven't had any issues with it yet and it's worked seamlessly. It seems to adapt well to different surfaces because I usually don't have a mousepad and it hasn't dragged yet.
 Really fantastic economy wireless mouse, very responsive, nice fit, good battery life (I turn it off when not in use), smooth and quick response.
 It was a great choice, I love it, very helpful<br/>Thank you
 I have purchased four of these - 2 for work, and 2 for home.  They haven't let me down yet...even though my kids never remember to "switch them off" when they are done with them for the day (home school), the batteries are still going strong!
 Bought this for my son's laptop for school. Works great easy plug and play installation. The only downside he notes as that it is a bit small so larger hands may have an issue with this. Other than that a great solution for those looking for a wireless mouse.
 the mouse works great, The battery last a good long bit, the battery cover falls off when the mouse is bumped or falls, even from a couple of inched.
 Best $9.99 I ever spent.  My new HP laptop's touch-pad has dead spots that were driving me crazy, to the rescue this hero mouse.  No delays at all. No more frustrations or accidentally clicking on the wrong thing. I would recommend.
 The mouse is very pretty. The one I received worked inconsistently. When it did work the mouse was slow to respond.
 Disappointing. I bought two. Both seem to go through batteries very quickly, nd one of them stopped working normally after only limited use over an 8 month period.
 Great cost and color
 Great product, love it, will buy off these people again, when I need something.  Thank u
 Cheap mice that will last only a few months.
 This mouse is perfect. It has a very nice material that allows for a very strong grip and smooth feel. It glides very smoothly across my mouse pad. The receiver is so small that I can leave it plugged into my USB hub and it still easily fits in my computer bag. If I needed another wireless mouse, I wouldn't need to consider other mice since I would definitely buy this again.
 What a bargain &amp; it works perfect.
 Loud, heavy click. Still somewhat heavy.  They should design for use with a single battery.
 Fast delivery and mouse works great
 Great mouse, good price! Just changed my batteries after about 3 months use, but I would turn the mouse off half the time. So if it's always on, probably would last 2 months.
 Noybused much but feels comfortable and easy to use ... quite handy actually
 everything worked exactly as advertised - great price
 Worked great initially but over time, the material that the scrolling wheel is made of has become super smooth. While trying to use the mouse, my finger moves but the wheel stays still unless I press down on the wheel. This makes line-scrolling nearly impossible.
 Very good product and easy to get set up.
 Worked really well at first, then the metal covering the plug broke off in my USB port and i cant remove it. So now I have an unusable USB port and a worthless mouse.
 The mouse is amazing. Not too small, but not too big. It feels good when you place your hand over it to surf the net or move around your computer. And the price is perfect! Highly recommended!
 Great mouse that is durable and works good.
 And inexpensive option that that works great. A wonderful device and operates flawlessly and I use it daily! Battery life extremely good as I have yet to change the first set that I put it from the day I received it.<br/><br/>Hightly recommend!!
 Wouldn't' connect to my Windows 2-1 laptop. Doesn't come with any instructions on how to use it either, i figured it worked like a Bluetooth keyboard but I wasn't able to figure it out.
 Do not buy this. Very odd design and very difficult to insert batteries. Did not work at all. Threw this unit and bought another units (Anker brand)
 Nice wireless mouse for the money.  Battery installation is a bit of a pain, but not the worst.
 This wireless mouse met my needs at a great price
 the back won't stay on, so I had to scotch tape it down. it looks ridiculous but actually works now that that issue is squared away. I like lots of other Amazon Basics things but not sure I'd recommend this one
 Compare to my other cheaper off-line mart mouse, I wouldn't get this one again.<br/>I liked Amazon basics but not this one.<br/>Battery life is very short, it doesn't work well when you have obstacle between the mouse and the dongle.
 I used to buy fancier mice (mouses?), but I won't anymore. Why spend 2 or 3 times as much for the same thing? These work great. I never used any of the extra buttons that some pricier mice (mouses?) have anyway.
 The size and use is just what the Doctor ordered.
 My brother who is a gamer didnt like the mouse to much but I just need it to browse and do other things on the internet and its been good. Another thing I will add is the batteries have lasted a while (three weeks so far) and Ive used this a lot.
 Works pretty good once you get it connected... Like allot bt devices connecting can be a chore
 Awesome
 using it now great
 Exactly what I needed! Super easy to hook up and works perfectly. Amazon Basics products are good quality and affordable.
 does what it should.  good for on the go
 Nice matte finish, easy to grip, smooth movements on screen.
 It works
 The mouse roller stopped functioning 4 days after the return window closed.  I was hoping Amazon had better quality assurance on their products.  I was actually excited to order an Amazon product, but this was truly disappointing.
 This remote is great, left mouse button, right mouse button and a clickable wheel. I got it to use on my Macbook while working with Autodesk Maya, and it works exactly as I needed it to. I have only just started using it, so far I have encountered no problems.
 This is a great little mouse. Came in hassle free packaging. Batteries are included, the nano receiver is housed in the battery location of the mouse for easy storage. Tracks great and I am able to use it on bed. Couldn't ask for more.
 works well and price is right.
 Nice simple wireless mouse. I was expecting basic functions and this mouse fulfills all of them. Did not take me more than 15 seconds to set this up. Comes with two Amazon AAA batteries.<br/>There is no lag in synchronization of mouse with screen.
 It is too tight when I click and hurt muscles around fingers and hand.
 Works great! No problems with it, other than the battery cap was pretty loose fitting
 good. been using for awhile with no glitches
 The Battery compartment in mine won't hold the battery tight so I cant keep it working. It is the right size and operates great when the battery was working. Says 1 year basic warranty but I can't find a way to submit for a replacement unit. Had to buy a different unit to get one for my use.
 I have always used a wired mouse, but was amazed at the difference of the wireless mouse. On my computer at least, it doesn't require pushing the button to make it link up. The minute I turn on the mouse it is linked and working. I plugged in the transmitter on the computer and I was instantly hooked up. Great addition to any computer
 Definitely one of the best deal and product for a very good price, working with no problems for years
 Good mouse that uses 2 AAA batteries and has a very small USB transceiver.  The only drawback, in my opinion, is that the switch to turn the mouse on and off is very small and a little difficult to actuate.
 The mouse died.
 Love the color &amp; works well for my workplace computer!
 Love it. Exactly what I expected it to be. 0 complaints.
 It stopped working after 3 months!! Is very pretty but is a poor design. The batteries are very hard to insert &amp; do not "lock in" they try to "Pop out""
 This is all you need at an affordable price.
 still working great after years of use
 Love this.  We have this same model at work and they are so easy to use.  It's working very well.
 junk
 After a few month use the scroll wheel has gotten to where you 'click' it if you scroll quickly. Browsing I end up opening mulitpe windows becase of this.
 I only buy AmazonBasics wireless mice, now. I've had them last for over 4 years.
 Good replacement to standard corded mice.  Long battery life.
 Sometimes it has a mind of its own, scrolling with the wheel it jumps all over the place. Would be nice if it turned off without having to use the switch. Next step up would be a better choice.
 Works like a more expensive mouse
 Does the job but the matte material gets fingerprint smudges over time! I got a different wireless mouse for work which I prefer to this one, but it's good enough for the price.
 It is an inexpensive mouse. It does exactly what it says it will do. That is all I can expect.
 We have gone through 3 of these mice and replacements in the last 2 years.  I still have mice from Logitech working that are 10 years old.  Save yourself the headache and spend a couple dollars more and buy something that will last.
 As the brand name goes, "Basic". It simply does the job in a rather good way.<br/>Nice ergonomics and feel to it. Hands leave marks on the surface easily though. Works on all surfaces and doesn't need a pad.<br/>Be careful though, this thing won't live with more than a couple of drops, more or less.<br/>With the price tag, I couldn't ask for more.
 I've decided to revise my review, as this mouse has become usable again after changing the batteries out and I am now satisfied with my purchase. Thank you.
 Love this mouse.  I was tired of my wired one which was beginning to fray and this mouse worked perfect out of the box and easy to use/install.
 Best low-price wireless bluetooth mouse on amazon! Amazon basics never fails to come through with quality at a cheap price!
 The mouse worked fine for the first two weeks. After that the mouse would no longer connect to the receiver. The batteries that came with the mouse died after the first week, and the batteries that I do put in only last for two to three days before it’s time to change them. Just go with the wired mouse. Save you a lot of time and money.
 It's much smaller than I expected, but that doesn't get in the way whatsoever, nor has it caused any hand problems. the wireless piece is also small and doesn't get in the way of the other ports on my hub. One thing I do recommend is that you don't plug the wireless piece into a USB hub because it will cause problems with your mouse speed.
 I really like that it's durable and just works. Doesn't take that much battery even if I don't switch it off ever. It's small and comfortable to use unlike those big heavy mice.
 I Like Using this Mouse, Better Than My last One ! ! !
 It's a mouse!
 works great. this is the first NON logitech mouse i have purchased in over a decade. very pleased with it
 Love the mouse but I've had to replace the batteries 5 times and I've only had it for 8 months! Seems very unreasonable since I have had other mouse in the past that I have only had to change the battery once or twice a year.
 I lost 2 logitech in a row. This one has yet to reach 1 year but so far solid.
 This is the best mouse we have ever purchased.  You don't even need a pad for it.  It is not clumsy and clicking is almost silent.  Will buy again and highly recommend it to anyone that wants a good mouse.  We have been using it for a few weeks.
 Device stopped working after a year, Amazon refused to replace device.
 I can't believe how amazing this mouse is. I bought it because I needed a mouse with a better click-wheel for using REVIT, this one has a very light pressure click-wheel and works perfectly even 10 feet away from my laptop. Great mouse.
 Works fine.  Uses up one of 3 USB ports on the laptop, so I need a USB extender when travelling.
 I use this mouse for work daily, and I couldn't imagine going back to a laptop mouse ever again. It's invaluable, but a great value. I've dropped it several times, too, and it still works perfectly.
 I purchased this mouse to replace a Microsoft mouse that had a very loud and annoying scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is quiet on this one but the left and right click is louder than normal. Still recommend the mouse for purchase based on price and comfort plus it has a small receiver.
 Great when it works, but I've gone through several of these mice and eventually it gets to the point where my computer says the device has malfunctioned and nothing will make it work again. Uninstalling the driver and such does nothing.
 Great
 I am very Happy with this mouse. I have yet to need new batteries, and I use it every day.
 I really like this product
 Mouse works well for the most part, it would be intermitent and so that got frustrating.  I do not know if that was because of the surface or the laser portion not working properly so I cannot say for certain.  Other then that it worked well.
 I might change this later, we'll see.<br/>But so far it's very comfortable to use, it was pretty darn simple.<br/>The only two things I don't absolutely love are that it's kind of tricky to get the batteries in (not that bad but that piece of plastic in there kind of gets in the way even as it helps, so you have to make sure you really push them in) and it's a little difficult for me personally to switch the on/off switch. It's not obscenely difficult but if you have any motor function problems or tremors this will be somewhat complicated and take a few tries.<br/><br/>I like the texture and size of the mouse, I don't feel it's too small or too large. I use a lap desk frequently that has a mouse pad built in and this fits nicely and works very smoothly. The scroll wheel is great, too, for all I don't use it quite as much overall.<br/>The dongle doesn't stick out too far for me, for all I've read for some people it's a little bigger than other brands. I've noticed it too, but I don't think it's enough of a difference to matter.<br/>So, all in all it feels like a pretty good buy. I've only been using it a few days though, so I'll try and update it when I've had it longer.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>it doesn't work. It just stopped working randomly for no reason whatsoever, and then on top of that to mail it back you should take the batteries out. Near impossible . I had to get tools to help me, I actually broke off part of a nail pretty badly to try and get the battery out. Painful as heck. Not sure if I got a defective mouse or not, not too sure if I'll try this brand again or not. Extremely unhappy. It worked great for a few days, at least.
 Poorly designed!!!!!!!  The battery will not stay inserted and connected to the contact.  Thus, to get it to work for more than one click I have to pull out the battery and reinsert it.  I've tried new batteries and jiggling things around all to no avail.  I ordered a replacement mouse, which should work better.
 Light weight, easy to use, simple mouse for our family computer
 very good quality and sturdy for my uses. I like the portability and price.
 Basic and works GREAT.  Batteries last FOREVER.
 Opposite scroll reaction. WHY does the scroll wheel take you the opposite direction of what you choose while scrolling?  It goes down instead of up and when you roll down it goes up!  ???????WHY?
 I got this mouse for my laptop because using the built in mouse thingy was hurting my hand. My hand is no longer screaming in agony, and the funky color is so nice. Oh, and my brother taught me the wonders of Minecraft PC.<br/>The only issue is that my cats also like mice...
 Works perfectly at an economical price.
 So far, this product is working well. Very basic/ standard which is great, affordable too!
 A little smaller than some mice, and quite a bit lighter than some (especially the MS Mouse), but it works like it's supposed to.
 Does the job. Bought to replace one I got at Staples that didn't work out of the box.
 Works great and was able to plug right into a MAC and worked as expected.
 Just what I needed, Works fine
 This mouse is cheap but WAY too sensitive.  The middle wheel button gets pressed constantly just from the weight of my hand while moving the mouse.  Highlighting things is also difficult because of the buttons being to close to their respective triggers.  An ok mouse but I wish I'd spent $5 more for a better one.
 Purchased this over a year ago and am very pleased.<br/><br/>It's a bit smaller than previous mice although have adjusted to it.<br/><br/>It doesn't eat batteries.<br/>Have been using AAA rechargeable batteries 8-10 hrs/day 6 days a week for work.<br/>One set of batteries usually lasts 2-3 months before they die.<br/><br/>Would recommend this Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse.
 This mouse is great. Works well on a variety of surfaces like my bed and sofa. Good range, good battery life. Comfortable to hold. I've dropped it a million times and it never breaks (the battery cover usually pops off when it hits the floor, but it has never cracked or chipped, just pop it back on and it's fine).
 The back of the mouse won't stay on and the batteries keep falling out.  I'm through buying these 'mices'.
 Not as smooth or responsive as more expensive mice but great for the price/
 Great price for a very useful mouse.  I love the size... its lightweight and not too large of a mouse like I've had in the past.  Works wonderfully and easy to start using!!!!  Would definitely buy more!!
 Battery life ???
 I really like this mouse, it a bit smaller than normal but it's perfect for use with a small laptop computer and carry case.
 works very well with IOS or android tab
 Works great, connects to every laptop I've tried it with, no issues at all. Worth buying this one over the cheaper $5 mice (did that, returning the cheaper one).
 Horrible mouse.  I bought this in November and some nights it works and some nights it doesn't.  there is no rhyme or reason as to why this mouse wont work.  I have tried 3 different mouse pads, 4 different surfaces, changed batteries, etc and it still will not consistently work.  This is not reliable at all.  Would not recommend it,
 I made the purchased with some caution due to some reviewers comments regarding battery usage. The mouse has an on/off switch and if used properly, I found that it does not unduly go thru batteries. However, I also have a wireless Logitech (more expensive) with no switch and batteries last up to a year or more.
 I mean, it is a basic mouse.  Great for on the go!  Tracks good too.
 Excellent product and great price. Nice compact design makes it nice to have an easy to use solution.
 I bought this mouse for use with my laptop and love it.  The mouse is the perfect size for my hands (small women's hands) and feels velvety smooth.  It glides easily.  It is a wonderful wireless mouse, that hooked up easily, and I would purchase it again if necessary, especiallly for the price.
 I would agree with all the other one star reviews.  Eats batteries and didn't last after very light use.  Buy a different mouse and do not be lured by the price.
 Had one for my last lap top, wanted another. Battery placement was not marked clearly.
 Very good get one now
 Works great, even after my grandkids dropped it on a concrete floor.  I thought it was going to be a goner but after putting the batteries back in it was just like new.  Great mouse at a great price.
 Works fine. Comfortable.
 Mouse was great size - it felt perfectly in my hand and was so comfortable to use.  Unfortunately it died after 6 months even with a fresh change of batteries.
 Seemed good at first, but noticed it was fairly glitchy and not reliable to click on screen (because it could jump as you are clicking).... I may consider trying new batteries and see if that makes a difference, but I switched back to my smaller wireless mouse - and it works much better! I got the bigger mouse because my hands are bigger and thought it would be less cramping for my fingers to use.
 Works well and easy to use.
 Great mouse
 Love it very convenient and works very well
 This mouse works it just doesn't work as smoothly as I think it should. I wasn't expecting perfection for this price but this mouse kind of binds up and lags behind often on my system. I'm going to keep it as a spare but I went back to my cheap chorded mouse.
 This wireless mouse is Awesome. You cannot beat this for the price that I paid. All the other wireless mouse I checked out around town were more expensive so I decided to give the Amazon Basics Mouse a try and I am completely satisfied.
 Nice part, great value.  I've been using mine for 3-4 weeks now with no issues.  The battery lasts a LOT longer than a  wireless (MS) mouse I used to have.  I'm still using the original battery.
 it was advertised that the mouse comes with a free gel mouse pad when the item arrived it was only the mouse you know the rating is going to be bad i would like to know when i will receive the mouse pad...when am i going to receive the free gel mouse pad
 This is a very comfortable mouse, high quality and great price. Loved it. Be careful though, try not to drop it too many times (mine stopped functioning after about 20 drops... I know...)
 Ordered one for myself after my wife was so happy with hers.
 I never expected such a quality product for so cheap.  My Logitech mouse has been having issues (double clicking when I only single clicked, problems with scrolling, etc.) so I decided I needed a new one.  This mouse is incredibly responsive, scrolls amazingly, and is tiny!  I will definitely keep all my mouse purchases to Amazon after experiencing the quality of this one!
 Works great; no problems at all.
 Got this AmazonBasics  wireless mouse to replace a 3 yr. old Microsoft 3500 wireless mouse.  The latter Microsoft mouse was super quiet and fast the 3 years it lasted, but I thought I'd give the AmazonBasics a try.  So far the AmazonBasics version is not as fast or quiet (can hear it clicking), so I'm a tad disappointed, but perhaps I'll get used to it and it'll last longer than the last one.
 It took 3 days to start either freezing or jumping uncontrolable.
 The hook up was very easy.  Batteries were included.  I had it working the moment I received it.  Feels comfortable.  The arrow movement was very fast, I had to program it to slow down.  I needed a new mouse and a friend told me about going into wireless.  I look up the web for a wireless and saw this on Amazon.  It have good reviews so I bought it.  I am happy I did.  I am very satisfied with it and would certainly recommend it.
 The mouse is a little smaller than a standard mouse, but I actually like it.  It works great, I haven't noticed the cursor skipping or malfunctioning at all.  I really like how small the USB attachment is, and its great that you can store it inside the mouse. (That sounds a little wrong, lol)
 Good Device ...
 good
 I have three of these mice for various laptops now, they are a great value. Long battery life, good feel in the hand and can be used in either hand, i switch back and forth during the day. Scroll wheel is smooth, buttons click with a positive feeling. Highly recommended for folks who just need a solid basic small mouse for traveling with a laptop.
 LOVE IT
 Exactly what I wanted! Looks nice, fits perfectly in my hand, and it has a soft material.
 Been a great mouse so far, I dig the internal USB storage too
 Comfortable scroll-wheel mouse for left or right-handed user. Comes with two AAA batteries. The receiver is initially located in the battery compartment and can be stored there for travel. I plugged the receiver into my laptop and it worked right away (Windows 8.1). The clicking surface has a matte finish and does tend to show finger oils, so if that is a problem for you, it might be something to consider. What else can you say about a mouse?
 I love all things Amazon,  so when I needed a wireless mouse, I decided to get the Amazon brand. Love it! Super easy to use and it's plug and go! The battery I got with mouse is still working great even though I leave it on all the time. Also, I love having a place to store the usb plug. Reliable and easy to use.
 I really like the mouse and I am glad I bought it. Its a good size, no wires, easy set up.... and the part where you click is very smooth feeling. Its a great product so far and I haven't had to change any batteries yet. I would order this again if I needed to.
 I love this remote mouse. I have one that I have used for an entire year before needing a battery change, and this one should give me the same performance. I bought it so I could use it in my living room when my laptop is playing a movie on the TV. That way, I don't have to have the laptop right in front of me.<br/>Recommended.
 Very nice
 ok
 Good Qualty works well
 I wanted something totally functional -- good quality for a low price -- and I definitely got it with this product.  I don't need extras on a mouse; this one glides great and rolls like a champ.  Done.
 This really is a perfect mouse.  I have ordered 3 now for different computers.  I bought my first one a year ago and really like it.  The range is awesome, the batter life is really good and it has a really nice texture.<br/><br/>It is just a great mouse.
 Awesome for a High school graduates gift
 Much better construction than my previous wireless mouse, such as internal  (inside the mouse) storage of the receiver when not in use.  It remains to be seen if its life expectancy exceeds my last wireless mouse.
 I keep losing these darn things and this is like the 10th one I've purchased in the last year, and I am totally impressed that as the cheapest mouse I've ever bought, it is by far the best quality. I can't believe I used to spend $30 on these and this one was only $10! What a great value and what a great mouse!
 I suppose it could be good but the chip that was supposed to be stored between the batteries was missing rendering the mouse useless. Threw it away!
 AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse Is Great. It arrived fast, and in very good condition. It had the battery, and the Nano Receiver in very good condition. Overall I am very pleased with this little mouse. I will buy another one for one of my relatives. You should buy one too!
 Nice wireless mouse. Good fit in my hand. I gave it away since I prefer a 5 button mouse.
 Works very well! The only problem I had was in the beginning putting the back onto the mouse, but then it went on fine and worked seamlessly!
 Works as expected. No real issues.
 This is a smaller mouse and it works great for my laptop. Small USB receiver can be plugged in and left in the laptop USB port. A simple on/off switch on the mouse saves battery life. My son even tested the range from across the room and found it hilarious that he could control it from there. Simple and well made. 5 stars.
 Great quality, great design. I actually came back and bought several more for the office to use. Small enough to easily carry for business trips as well. Get a mouse pad because if you're working on a glass table it wont work.
 Ok.  Did not expect too much of it.
 well it worked for a month and then didn't. got it in texas and brought it to costa rica so returning the mouse for a refund was just not worth the cost of all the postage. i probably won't buy amazon basic again.
 AB product so I wasn't worried at purchase. Works great on my Mac. Love the USB plug...very small ans discreet.
 When I try to select text (hold left button and drag), it breakdown in the middle of the text. Midway, it neglects the previously selected text and starts selecting newly from middle.<br/><br/>This is not just one-off. I got a replacement for the defective mouse. The new one has the same problem as well.<br/><br/>Everything else is great. But the above problem makes using it uncomfortable, especially when you want to focus on the work you're doing.
 I love this mouse. It's not to big like some mice come these days. I have little hands and it fits perfectly in the palm of mine. Plus it feels like it's made of good quality material and the response time is lightning fast.
 Wasn't sure if it would work for my mac computer as it only advertises for PC, but it works great with my MacBook Air and I had no problem setting it up.  When traveling, there is a convenient place inside the mouse to put the nano receiver so you don's lose it.
 Really great, reliable mouse with a great feel.
 It is ok but I have a hard time getting the left clicker button to work all of the time
 Purchased in May, center roller no longer working in December. It is okay for the money. Id give it 3.5 stars out of 5. An inexpensive option but expect to get what you pay for.
 Great mouse at a great value!  Happy that it did come with the batteries (so be careful how you open the box; they are efficiently placed within it!)
 When it comes to wireless mice I'm always amazed at how many of them do not have built in storage for the wireless receiver.  Once you lose it it's worthless.  The AmazonBasics mouse has storage for the receiver, comes with batteries, and at a Prime price of $11.99 I had it in 2 days.  No complaints here.
 At first I was nervous that it wasn't going to work with my macbook because there was a lot of information in the packaging about getting it working on a windows computer but then I just threw it in my computer and worked like a gem
 Comfortable mouse I like to use with my laptop. It fits nicely in the hand and moves well on the mouse pad.  I was able to take the product out of the box, get it set up in minutes and start using right away with easy. Good product.
 Perfect mouse! Batteries last forever and mouse works great!
 We have have used these for years and they have never failed.  We bought more for our children in college.
 My son loves this for his school laptop! It's perfect to take to school and use at home.
 Great mouse. Very basic so only buy if you just need to use right and left clicks. Nothing special but absolutely reliable and I like being able to store the nanoreceiver in the mouse during travel. I don't need a mousepad in order for it to work on my desk...and it works on my couch too, when I'm trying to work in the living room :o)
 Great deal on a great product
 Been using this for a few years now. Great second mouse for my laptop. It is built fairly well and the rubberized texture is nice for off-camber scenarios. It's a smaller style mouse.
 Looks good, color coded for my computer. Works as expected. Would buy again.
 My son needed a mouse for his chrome book at school and this was a perfect fit.
 use it every day and has lasted for almost a year.  definitely a great mouse - amazon basics rocks!
 Many of the mouses I've used in the past have been too large or too small for my hand. This is perfect! It's a great price and good quality, plus it's wireless! I purchased this 5 months ago and I haven't had any issues whatsoever.
 Everything that I've ever bought from Amazonbasics has been amazing. This mouse is no different. Easy to use,  and it glides over my mouse pad very well.
 I must have a "heavy" middle finger (too much use :) ). My middle finger is forever hitting the right button on the mouse. I've never had a mouse that was that sensitive. Very annoying. I'll pay extra for a mouse that isn't quite as sensitive.
 As other reviewers have noted, this mouse is comfortable to use and works very well. I do want to clarify, though, that it's a FULL-sized mouse, not a travel mouse. When I searched for "travel" or "mini" mouse on Amazon, this mouse came up as fitting the criteria both times. Silly me; I was in a rush and took Amazon's word for it! While I'm satisfied with the performance of the mouse, if you're looking for a mouse for the road, you may want to look elsewhere---don't be a poor reader like me ;)
 I bought this on price but has quickly become my favorite small wireless mouse. Small but not micro, has an on/off switch for on the go, and ergonomically fits my hand better than most. Definite recommend
 After two years the battery cover would not stay clipped in making the battery fall out. Was good while it lasted.
 It is compact, works well with my MacBook Air and has a long battery life. Not the most stylish but is comfortable to use and the scroll wheel works as it should.
 I bought  Amazon Basics mouse in the month of August and it was working fine until last week. Nano receiver circuit came out and no longer this mouse is working. No technical support or number to call for Nano receiver replacement.
 Solid wireless mouse. On the smaller side, but still a full size mouse.
 I bought 2. 1 as backup.. its not fluid..spend a extra couple bucks and get a logitech
 I've been using the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Received for about six months.<br/><br/>I bought the mouse to replace my original Logitech Wireless mouse which I thought I had lost. I chose AmazonBasics for a couple reasons:<br/><br/>1.I have a few other AmazonBasics products and they've worked well. Certainly, they're a good value for the price.<br/>2. High % of positive reviews (5 and 4 star).<br/><br/>The Amazon mouse worked perfectly out of the box for me for the first three months. It's not as solid as the Logitech mouse it replaced but not a big deal. The position of the batteries makes them a little awkward to replace. Again, not that big of a deal.<br/><br/>The reason for my one-star rating is after approximately 3-months, I began having what "seems" like problems with the batteries. At least that's my assumption. The light would go out and the mouse stopped working.<br/><br/>So I replaced the original batteries with name-brand alkaline batteries and that seemed to do the trick for another month. Then I began having the same problem with the mouse suddenly losing power &amp; connection.<br/><br/>If I was using the mouse all the time, I'd be more accepting with the problem but my Logitech turned up and I only use the Amazon mouse when I'm out of the office. AND when I'm not using the mouse, I turn it off so the batteries aren't draining.<br/><br/>It's possible I'm missing some nuance when it comes to power management with this mouse or there's something I could do to improve the USB connections but, hey, it's an $11 mouse and it feels like a waste of time to mess around trying to get the stars to align properly so I get the mouse working in a reliable way.<br/><br/>Looks like I got one of the duds.<br/><br/>I decided to dump this mouse and I'm replacing it with the HP x4000b Bluetooth Mouse because it's been getting great reviews and if I'm buying a new mouse, I might as well ditch the stupid dongle. (Oh, those stupid dongles...what an opportunity there is for dongle-free peripherals).<br/><br/>I'm not totally turned off with AmazonBasics but this experience has made me more wary and less likely to buy the brand.
 Works good with no issues.
 I've been using this mouse for well over a year and I love it. No problems.
 mouse is useless to me since piece was missing. i already feel so overwhelmed in trying to get set up for my new classes without having to deal with another hassle. i'm very frustrated.
 I should have returned this item it will NOT pair with anything, ever. Directions were small but simple and straightforward BUT nothing. Save your money buy anything but this worthless mouse.
 works great
 Good mouse. Works well. Good shipping speed. Instant usage was nice. And the size is perfect.
 battery cover kept popping off.  Kept using it without the cover which worked for the first 4 months, but the micro usb receiver connection wore out as I made the daily transfer between home and work.  Although I liked the size I was disappointed with how quickly the usb connection wore out.  I've been much more impressed with the quality of the logitech that I have since purchased as the replacement.
 This is the worst mouse I have ever owned.  The back keeps coming off and the batteries keep popping out.  It's very difficult  to re-insert the batteries - it's kind of slanted. '
 Very good mouse.  I use it for work.  I did have some issues with Windows 7 recognizing it and actually accepting it.  Strange.  I had to restart my computer three times before it fully was usable.  However once in use, its a nice comfortable mouse.  I use it about 8-10 hours a day, and I am pleased.
 Bought this for by macbook bro.Average daily usage. Was ok for about 3 months after which the mouse pointer just dies despite fully charged batteries. To make it work, you have to constantly unplug and replug the nano reciever.  I realize its cheap but practically unusable after 3 months.
 Cheap. Works great. Exactly what amazon promised.
 Good product.
 I have two of these, one for my desktop and one for my laptop. The durability and quality is great. Because the first mouse was working so well with my desktop, I bought the second mouse about 6 months later. They are both still going strong and I have not had any problems with them at all. They work perfectly with both Mac and PCs.
 Eats batteries, works when it wants to. Just stops for no reason. Very frustrating.
 Very comfortable.  Works perfectly.
 Super easy set up. The receiver picked up the signal immediately and had been working like a charm since. I like the smooth grip surface too.
 Seems to be working fine so far
 Good value and seems to work fine.
 I returned two of these. The mouse light kept going off on one and the other was spotty with periods of not being responsive. I'm surprised considering Amazon put their name on it. Loved the size of it.
 Works very well, no problems at all. I've used it quite a lot over last few months.
 It works fine.  Just don't drop it,  it will break.  Something in the area where the batteries are held unto place broke after dropping it on a cork floor,  so the batteries would stay put.  Had to throw it out.
 works great for me
 Wife loves it.
 Hooked up instantly and works great.  This is a basic mouse, easy to use and is much more usable than the mouse pad on a lap top.  I'm sorry I didn't get this sooner.  For functionality, this can't be beat, particularly at this price.
 Amazon basic mouse working very well. Very easy to use....
 I had trouble manuevering a computer with whatever it is they have under the keyboard on laptops.  This wireless mouse comes with a USB that is about the size of a fingernail.  I ordered this several years ago and the only maintenance is changing the two AAA batteries once in a great while.
 This mouse is nothing fancy and I like it for that reason. Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but you don't pay for em either. If you want your mouse just to move the cursor on your screen and scroll then it's good. Battery life is pretty good - I replaced them only once after 2 months of heavy use.<br/><br/>One complaint is the design of the nano receiver is very flawed. The edges are literally pointy that I cut myself on it. I literally took sandpaper to remove the sharp edges of this thing. Laptop users might notice this problem
 If the user presses down on the mouse, like in PC gaming, the pads underneath the mouse start rubbing off on the mouse pad, but this is after a half year of use.<br/>Other than that, for normal use, like web browsing, MS paint, etc, it's great.
 this is one of best mouse.
 Exactly as described, works great.
 This worked fine until the batteries died.  It's almost impossible to put in new batteries (at least for me) ... no matter how hard I try they won't go in.  I didn't know how to deal with the plastic, but another reviewer here said you put the batteries on top of the plastic.  But still nothing is working.  My mouse is not that old, so I am really unhappy.  I tried a number of different batteries, BTW.
 Amazon has got it right with their devices, cords, and peripherals. Another awesome Amazon product - And no I'm not a paid advertiser :-) I just like getting quality product fast and cheap. Great value.
 I accidentally bought this cheap mouse, but as it turned out, it works just fine. I have no complaints!
 i like the mouse other than after a week i will not work!!! just won't connect!
 It worked a few months then quit. I tried a new battery, nothing. Just dead. I threw it away and bought a mouse elsewhere.
 This was a Christmas gift and the person I gave it to is very happy with it.
 working so far, easy to use
 This mouse uses two AAA batteries, and it burns through them rapidly.  Trust me, any money you save buying this mouse will quickly be spent on batteries. You'd be much better off spending a few extra dollars on a higher quality mouse. There are several that only require a single battery, and almost certainly operate much longer on said battery.

That's why four stars. I bought two of them: one for my wife and one for me. It has a nice material good operation distance, great positioning, but as I do much video editing my hand felt tired because of friction. So I ordered some "Teflon Mouse Feet" and the problem is solved.<br/><br/>Check the attached video
 exelente producto
 Most of the products from AmazonBasic does its work very well and this mouse no exception. The click is a little loud than I care. Apart from that its great. The battery compartment design could have been improved a little as it needs the little pastic thingy to remove the battery. But, it doesn't bother as you won't change the battery for months.
 Pretty straight forward basic mouse, but I'm won over by the exceptional price of these, nothing else of the same quality is available at this price point.  Also, the laser works well on a variety of surfaces, which I've had problems with in the past so overall I'm pretty please.
 No problems setting it up on my laptop (Toshiba Satellite). Plugged in the dongle, inserted the batteries, turned on the mouse. Presto! No worries about loading drivers. After 3 days of use, still working flawlessly.
 lightweight, easy to use and even had batteries.
 I purchased this to use at work bc I don't like the wired mouse. The receiver is easy to remove so I can move from computer to computer. I wish it were a little bigger but it's not tiny by any means. Great price too.
 Takes two batteries and back is easy to lose. Spend the extra buck or two and get a Logitech.
 Gorgeous color
 Works great with my MacBook Air.
 Great little mouse. The mouse has a matted finish on top, and feels great. I always turn the mouse off when not in use, and battery life has not been an issue thus far. The mouse is responsive and tracks movement exactly as it should. As some reviewers have noted, this mouse is on the smaller side. I don't think this is a flaw, but something users should be aware of.
 Terrible! Only works once in a while! I even put in new batteries still stops! Very aggravating!
 Very user friendly, but need to be sure to turn off mouse when not using. Batteries wear down very quickly, even when not in use.
 works when my trackpad doesn' t but batteries are an awkward fit and back can fall off
 It works well but kind of sticks to the desktop when navigating the cursor.  Probably will just take some getting used to.
 Worked perfectly, just what I needed.
 Worked great until it didn't. Purchased in January, replacing it in July. If you are looking for a 6 month lifespan, than 5 stars. It's cheap, so maybe that's not too bad. Yes I checked the batteries. It does what they all do when they are dying, becomes less responsive which may be worse then just quitting altogether.
 Exactly what I wanted, at an affordable price. Works perfectly and couldn't have been easier to install and use (literally plug and play).
 good
 Easiest thing in the world to use. Come with a little plug-thing that goes into a USB port on the computer. Put the batteries in, plug it in, turn it on and you're good to go. I'd call this little thing a bargain.
 The body is  smaller than my desktop wired mouse.
 This is a REALLY nice wireless mouse. It's compact and very comfortable to use. It's simple and I think that's what makes it awesome. My logitech wireless mouse died after about a month's worth of use so I hope for better results with this one.
 I don't typically give one starts or five stars so be proud. The Amazon products seem like the best cheap alternatives with the least problems. I honestly would've love to buy that cool Microsoft mouse that bends but...well, for one, the only "cool" thing about it is that it bends and that's pretty stupid. Two, I'm not paying $45 for a mouse whose only function I use the most, when I have a touchscreen laptop, is the scroller in the middle.<br/> Amazon spreads its logo feces all over its products like Tommy Hilfiger but I don't mind in this case; I like this.
 This mouse is just about perfect for basic users. However, you must manually turn off the mouse when you're finished using it or the batteries will die within a couple months. Other mice I've used have features where it automatically turns itself off and on..
 Second purchase of this for our family. Works great, at a great price!
 Worked GREAT for about 18 months and then died.
 I've purchased 2 of these mouses. Both of them stopped working after the first pair of batteries died. Once I replaced them with new batteries they stopped working a day or two after. I think they are designed to fail so you keep buying a new one.
 works good.  good price
 Just ordered and received my second Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver.<br/>Recently the cursor has been more difficult to control with my old Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver. I was alarmed: how could my trusty mouse be dying so soon?<br/>After thinking it through, I realized I had dropped the mouse a lot recently. It had been sliding off my trusty old mouse pad.<br/>Hmmm - on examination, I realized that my trusty old mousepad was worn and dirty.  So, i changed the batteries and grabbed a newer old mousepad.<br/>Doing better but still not great. And I was thinking that I had just purchased the mouse in Feb 2015.<br/>After looking at my Amazon order files, I realied that the mouse actually dated back to the year before that.<br/>During my investigations of this problem, I managed to drop the mouse a few more  times.<br/>I also realized that I was using the scrolling wheel a lot for what I do online these days.<br/>Finally, I broke down and ordered a new one and discovered that it now costs almost $2.00 less than my original one.<br/>New one arrived today and is perfect!. Still the most comfortable mouse my smallish hands have ever used. So, I figure that $10-11.00 for a new mouse every two-and-a-half years is just fine. Especially since before, with different brands, I was replacing my mouse about once every 2-3 years and those mice were costly me $25,00 to $30.00.
 great value
 This mouse sucks.  The batteries don't seat properly, so it doesn't work.
 Great mouse but not at all durable.  Within 2 wks the battery compartment door no longer latched resulting in loss of contact with the batteries.  I had to scotch tape it to make it work.  I'll buy another one that look better constructed.
 This mouse feels really good in my hand when I use it. The clicking sound it makes when you click on it is just a tad more subtle than most Logitech mice, which is a good thing. It comes with two AAA batteries.<br/><br/>This mouse isn't quite as precise as more expensive mice, but most people won't notice or care at this price.
 The included batteries were dead so at first I thought this mouse was a dud but it worked immediately upon putting in new batteries.  It is slightly jumpy once in a while but not overly so.  For the price I can't really complain.  I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat.
 I use this product at a distance of 12 feet from the receiver on the tower, and it tends to drop the signal, and the power saving feature makes it unresponsive after not using it, and some surfaces are not great for cursor tracking.<br/><br/>However, for basic web browsing this product is sufficient.
 i have owned better mice
 It is so comfortable! I love it
 Smooth, precise, and easy to use.
 Why don't all the mouse makers make them with a nano receiver.  That's the bigger problem with these mice when on a laptop, they need the nano receiver as the others are cumbersome and can be knocked out of their slot risking damage to the computer and the receiver.  I love this little mouse... and highly recommend it.
 Ad does not tell you this is a Mini Mouse !  For a laptop maybe - NOT a desk top.
 My computer has a touchy touch pad, so I turned it off.  Then my mouse died and I needed a new one.  The old style had a long stick this had just a little stump sticking out of the USB port and you can leave it there and put the computer in the case.  No misplacing the connection.  Really responsive mouse!
 good mouse. Small but I have small hands.
 Most people probably use this device with a laptop or computer and keep it 2 feet away from the mouse, I installed mine in a very long distance application. I have a Security Camera DVR in my storage room under the stairs and ran a 60 Foot HDMI Cable from the DVR (Hikvision) under the stairs to the TV Room ~30 or 40  feet away or 3 rooms away So when someone rings the doorbell I can see who it is by flipping the TV input to the DVR. The Mouse sits in the TV Room ~30 or 40  feet away and yes I can operate the DVR click to enlarge a picture  redo settings etc. using this wireless mouse ~30 or 40  feet away! That's pretty good for a $10 device. One Caveat. It only works when all the doors between the TV Room and the storage room under the stairs are open and It only works in the corner of the TV Room that is closest to the storage closet. I would say that about 30 feet without obstruction is the limit at which the device will work. Im happy that a $10 device does this job for me.
 Do not waste your money.  It is cheap and it does not work.  Battery compartment does not take the batteries.
 Works great and even though batteries are required, they last a long time.
 Great mouse, especially for the price. The only complaint I have is that the storage for the receiver is under the battery door. This requires me to constantly remove the door as I travel alot and don't trust leaving the receiver in my computer while transporting it (although it probably would be fine because the receiver is small).
 doesnot work with my desktop, was planning to return it , but it turns out it works with my laptop,
 Replaced a Microsoft mouse. Worked better at much lower cost!
 Bought and returned no less than 3 of these. So disappointed that the quality I've come to expect from Amazon.<br/>Either didn't work out of the box (x2) or broke shortly after purchase. Will never buy this again
 Not really, but a very solid mouse for the price. Much better built than a more expensive Logitech mouse I bought at Staples, which crapped out after a couple of months. Going to get a couple more of these and put them in drawer for future needs.
 The mouse feels comfortable and appears well constructed.  The problem is however in the way it functions.  This device should have a fluid feel to it when using it.  A mouse allows you to flow from one point to another with basically one clean movement.  Using this mouse, I continually found myself getting near the point I wanted but not exactly reaching it.  I had to add another small movement to get to the desired item be it a check mark, a word, an icon, or whatever.  There is some sort of subtle hesitation if I had be put a description on it.  After a few hours, I decided that it was not worth have to fight against the way it functioned.  I guess for the price, you will satisfy the need of having a mouse for your computer.  That will not suffice after continual use in my opinion.  As always, Amazon's policy of hassle free returns is second to none. I really wish it worked better as most of Amazon's "Basic" products are an excellent value.
 Bought this to replace a mouse on my older netbook and it works great. Perfect for the price. It paired with my netbook without any issue. The dongle uses one of  my USB ports but I do not need it on my netbook. For my laptop I want a mouse that does not need the dongle but I will pay more.
 For the price, it worked well right away.  Simple easy to use.
 Works well. Loading batteries is kind of a pain, but the batter life has been good. I've used the original batteries for about 2 months, leaving it on overnight a few times (it doesn't turn off with a timer like other brands).<br/><br/>Pros: Batter life, function, price.<br/><br/>Cons: No automatic turn off on a timer, changing batteries
 I did not pay attention to dimensions or size if it was listed.  This mouse is very large.  Much larger than the "standard" size mouse that I was used to.  But I like the way it fits my hand.
 Great portable mouse I had one for about two years before it broke, which is a long time considering I use it for work 8-12 hours a day. I replaced it with the exact same mouse.
 I really prefer this mouse.  When I left my mouse at a friend's house, I ordered a second one because I don't mind having two.  It's comfortable and reliable.
 works eratically. being replaced as I write
 It is a good mouse when it works. I've only had it for 5 months and it no longer works. I realize it's only $10. But thought it would last a bit longer. Disappointed in Amazon basic items. Spend a few more dollars and buy a better wireless mouse.
 Buy something else.
 Works great. My first wireless mouse. All I did was add batteries, insert usb and voila. Can't beat the deal either
 I have 19 sites and I use the Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse on each site. If you read my reviews you will see my batteries purchased for these mice. Very good no problems.<br/>Jesse
 Great price and great product. It even came with batteries!
 I purchased this mouse so I could have it for use on the go and it's small enough to fit in my pocket, but big enough to hold and use comfortably. My ONLY complaint is the battery tab is not explained to you, and it's impossible to remove the batteries without the tab.
 Oh, hello!  Easiest computer "repair" I've ever had. :)  My Dell mouse went bad, so I ordered this inexpensive AmazonBasics mouse via Prime.  It arrived in two days; I installed it in two minutes (less!!).  Works like a dream...smooth, comfortable, and steady. Why can't everything be this easy?! :)  Five stars! *****
 I have three of these wireless mouse and they work flawlessly.  Batteries last me a couple of months.
 No complaints.<br/>Not complicated.<br/>It works.
 Over the past few months, I have become a huge fan of AmazonBasics products - well priced, high quality, easy to use, to the point where if I see it's a AmazonBasics, I'll purchase that over another.
 Works great, feels good. Right size and everything. Plug it in, instantly recognized by windows 8. Also by Mac OSX Mavericks. I've had it for 2 months near daily use, still going on the first set of batteries.
 Using it right now ! Well I am really using one finger to type , but I used it to get to this page . Plugged in the little USB device , put a battery in the mouse and it works great ! I do turn it off , just to save battery lift.
 This is a good, quality mouse for anyone needing something basic. I would of preferred more options such as side mouse buttons but otherwise it's a decent quality that I've come to expect from AmazonBasics.
 I have a home office with an "IOGEAR GCS932UB" 2-port KVM switch, which switches my keyboard, mouse, and<br/>display back and forth between my work computer and my home computer.<br/><br/>My wired USB mouse finally wore out (intermittently sending multiple left button clicks when I only clicked once),<br/>and I decided to go wireless and bought this one.  When I replaced the wired USB mouse plug in the KVM<br/>switch with the wireless USB mouse plug, the wireless mouse moved the curser, but vertical speed was about<br/>20 times faster than horizontal, and it received mouse clicks even when I wasn't touching the mouse.<br/>I'm guessing this is because the KVM switch cannot load the drivers this unit needs.<br/><br/>When I put the wireless USB plug directly into either computer, it works perfectly fine (the first time you<br/>plug it in, it automatically loads the mouse drivers, and this did NOT happen ever when I plugged it into<br/>the KVM switch).  I thought perhaps having the mouse drivers installed on both computers would fix the<br/>issue, but no.  Even after both computers could use the wireless mouse perfectly fine when the USB<br/>plug was directly plugged in, when I put the plug back into the KVM switch, the bad behavior was back.<br/>I considered the idea of getting a 2nd plug, but if that even worked, both computers would sense all the<br/>mouse motions and button clicks.<br/><br/>I 'solved' the issue by using this wireless mouse on my travel laptop, and swapping out the nearly new wired<br/>USB mouse from that bag.  A wireless mouse on that laptop will be handier than the wired one anyway.
 We had to wait till they had this in stock to send it.  It was part of my granddaughter's birthday gift.  I haven't heard how she likes it, but her mother said she thought she would love it!
 great basic mouse- compact size. super smooth wheel for fast zooming and scrolling
 Great value, has storage inside of the USB connector. If you need a small travel mouse for home or office, this is the one!
 Sad to say I bought this and was never able to get it to work. Had our IT guy look at it, and he said the receiver did not correspond with the mouse—they were mismatched. We tried it on multiple computers, and it did not work.
 This has performed perfect, I like the Amazon Basics products.
 Nice I just use right now and it works well with Mac pro laptop pretty good. I recommend that produced better than any other kind of mouse wireless is. Nice comfortable with it.
 Product came in a couple of days, it's cute
 It worked well for the first 10 months.  However, now it's stopped connecting or responding.
 Great product and delivered on a timely basis.
 The wheel has the perfect amount of resistance (I can't stand loose wheels that spin very easily), the buttons are nice and clicky, and it has a very good weight to it. Often times plastic mice are very light. Note that this mouse is a bit on the smaller side, which I like, but not everybody does.
 I purchased this wireless mouse to use with the laptop I bought my wife and although the laptop can be used without a mouse she prefers to use one and she is very happy with my choice of the AmazonBasics wireless mouse.
 Even when the batteries are brand new, the mouse skips on the screen. I've used a mousepad, no mousepad, different types of mousepads, moving the mouse right next to the receiver, and the cursor still lags. I'm not terribly upset though because it was cheap. You get what you pay for.
 Excellent Mouse for home use.  The design features are very well thought out.
 Its too small for me. I use the Logitech M510 at work and it's more comfortable and it has zero hiccups; the Amazon mouse has some  "stuttering" at times. I've never gotten a hint of that with the Logitech mouse.
 This mouse is perfect to take with me when I travel for business. Connects quickly and very easy to set up.
 good purchase
 Amazon allowed me to return my broken Chromebook, but refused to allow me to return this, as it wasn't broken. But since I needed a computer that worked right now, I now have this worthless mouse that doesn't work with my new computer.
 Comfortable, wireless, easy setup.
 I bought this as a backup last year and just started using it regularly the last month or so.  I really liked the functionality, but today it just started shutting off when I was using it.  I thought it was the batteries, so I put new batteries in, but the problem did not go away.
 Very impressed with weight and feel - a bit heavier than Logitech M305 mouse it replaces, but it gives a sense of greater durability. Ergonomics is comfortable. I especially like the ON/OFF switch which is better design that the M304. The recessed switch on it had a ridge to catch fingernail. After 5 years, it wore off.
 works well most of the time altho it required me to remove and re-insert the little USB device every other day as it does not recognize it (that's what the mini-screen says); there are no instructions to tell how to overcome this either so I can't in all good conscience give it a wonderful rating
 Bought these for my wife and she says she loves it. She has smaller hands so it fits her better but it is just too small for my man hands. Also there aren't any side buttons for backwards/forwards internet browsing for which I am used to.
 Ingenious design! I love how the USB connector is embedded in the battery area. This way, when I move locations or am traveling, and have to take out the little USB connector, I no longer have trouble finding where to put it. I lost one connector for my past USB wireless mouse because I had to put it in my wallet in a hurry, and it was lost. The design of this mouse however is simply ingenious! Amazon, good job.
 This inexpensive wireless mouse works well and handles all non-gaming tasks I have handed ti without a problem, I am a fan of the scroll wheel which is often poorly done on other budget mice.<br/><br/>Yet again the AmazonBasics product does a great job.
 It is not a Logitec prodct
 My workstation is on a poor surface to reflect light so I have to use a mouse with a ball or a mouse pad. A customer had one of these and started using it on my desk and I was amazed how well it worked. I bought one the same day and have been using it ever since 10-14 hour days.
 Not bad for the price, lasted the year that the warranty lasted and one of the top buttons stopped working
 this mouse came in around 12 bucks when i purchased it and it has done a great job for a mouse for my grandparents easy to use and much more affordable than some of those mouses out there
 Best wireless mouse I've ever used. Never skips.
 Worked great while it lasted. Broke after three months of use. I guess you get what you pay for.
 Durable
 So the first one arrived without the nano receiver. This one, the lights do not light up. I have tried three sets of batteries-- those provided and two more sets. Getting a mouse to function should not require this much effort!
 Simple and easy. this mouse works as well if not better than my Microsoft mouse and it was much more affordable. Pleased with the product. Easy to set up. Batteries were easy to install--two AAA--and the first two are included. Tracking wheel works great with no skips. Will purchase again when I finally wear this one out.
 It worked wonderfully for a few months but recently it is having connectivity issues. I changed the batteries thinking it might be it, but nothing. I changed the usb port, nothing. It will work fine for a while and then randomly stop working. All the lights will still be on and everything, it will just lose connection. I guess it was nice while it lasted.
 Really easy to use, just plug and play. Its very light and good size to fit comfortable in your hands. It feel a Little different if you are use to Microsoft or Logitech mice, but Works perfectly and for that Price it just make it a really good buy.
 This mouse works really well when close to the computer. However, I have noticed that I get interference when sitting further away. For example, if the computer is on the desk and I try to use it on the coffee table 5 ft away, it usually is very jumpy. But for being at the same height as the desk, it still works fine.
 Mouse will not pair up/be detected, on multiple computers. Documentation that comes with the mouse is worthless beyond telling you how to use batteries; offering nothing in the way of troubleshooting. Have tried just about everything to get it working, with no success.
 Good product for the money, however I found it wouldn't work with my existing Logitech keyboard until I got an online tip.
 Need Bluetooth in pc
 it work very nice
 good enough
 Great product! Fast shipping!
 Talk about bang for your buck! This mouse like all of the Amazon Basic items we've purchased are excellent quality. Sleek and comfortable to use, it is very responsive and easy to set up.
 Exactly what I was looking for and really appreciate the nano receiver.
 Easy to set up basic mouse, no problems with battery life
 Best wireless mouse I've ever found and believe me, I've tried a bunch of them!  I do wish the batteries lasted a bit longer (on average 4-5 weeks) but then I'm using it 10-18 hours a day.
 I loved this product until the receiver stopped working on it after about 6 months.<br/>However, the price is great and I will probably be repurchasing again in the near future!
 This mouse works great with windows 8.1. It is very easy to set up. Open the battery cover remove the nano receiver , put 2 triple A batteries in it which are furnished with the mouse. Insert the nano receiver in a usb port, turn on the mouse and presto it works.. You can go wrong with this mouse.
 AmazonBasics is the best. I have this mouse in addition to a laptop bag I bought a month or so ago. The mouse works great and is super easy to install. I use it for work since I travel a lot with a laptop. Just remember to cut it to "off" on the back at the end of the day to save your battery.
 Works as expected.
 Works until it doesn't... but I give it a workout!  When the one I have goes... I will buy again.
 I own two of these (one to keep in my laptop case) and BOTH of them have started failing. The computer doesn't read the USB nano receiver until I've jiggled it into the perfect spot. Reading reviews I'm realizing I'd better switch to another brand!
 This was exactly what I needed. I had no problems connecting this with my computer!
 This is the 2nd AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse I have purchased and both have died on me after just a few months. I thought the first might have just been a lemon so I purchased a second and now the same thing has happened. Not worth the money!
 As expected
 Hardly works
 Great, simple, little mouse, I have smaller hands so it fits my hand very well. Does everything as expected and has good response time.
 The baby dropped my first one, and it broke. These aren't meant to be super durable. However, they are super inexpensive, so buying a second isn't a problem. Battery life is pretty good, I have to replace about once every three to four months, with constant use. Mouse wheel isn't super loud or difficult to spin as with some mice.
 Christmas Gift-<br/><br/>I purchase this "Mouse" for my Grandson for a Gift to take to College and it is working out, just perfect for him.  He is very happy with his "Mouse".<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>F.E. Manuel
 Comfortable design, great price. Was very happy to find out it comes with amazon batteries!
 Mouse pointer movements are accurate for day to day computing. I have not tried it with any games. The mouse if quite comfortable for my medium-large hand.<br/><br/>One thing that I'm not keen on is that matte finish of the top part of the mouse. It's a magnet for grease stains :)
 This mouse was probably the easiest to set up and works extremely well!
 This is a great little mouse, but it wasn't the right one for my laptop.  I had to send it back.
 Still going strong
 It worked okay for a bit, but then I had issues with it switching between my Dell PC and my Mac. Eventually I gave it away and bought a new Insignia mouse.
 Great for the money. I had this for two years now, and stil kicking.
 I've only been using this mouse for a short while, so I can't review the durability. But so far it works well with my Win 10 laptop. I like the feel of it.
 Not giving it a low review, because of the quality of the item. Works very well. But it's small. Made for a laptop when traveling.
 Does the job!  And holds up to a lot of abuse.
 This was purchased as a gift for someone who needed to access their computers from a distance. I haven't fully tested the mouse but it works perfectly for what I needed it for.
 not use a good material there's no back and up bottom
 It works great just uses one of your USB drive spaces. My aunt liked how wireless it is so I gave it to her. Gotta buy me another one soon.
 Great
 Cheap mouse that works.  Would buy again.
 Works perfectly with no hassle. Windows driver loads automatically and is ready to go in no time. I like the built in storage for the USB Nano receiver inside of the mouse. It even comes with AAA batteries.
 Works just as well as higher end counterparts. We love it!
 I want to drift into the 19th century life experience. But must move ahead. This thing somewhat mitigates my general distaste for modern computers. A mouse with wires is Satan's handiwork. A mouse without wires is an unexpected blessing.
 Fantastic mouse for the price. No issues at all. Returned a Logitech mouse that was garbage (M310) and bought this one instead at half the price. Stick with this one and you will be happy as well.
 Heavy duty works just fine!
 I've purchased this mouse three times because I like it so much (and I tend to lose things).  Great size for carrying around (traveling, commuting, meeting-to-meeting schlepping), it feels great in your hand (thanks soft touch coating), and the scroll wheel is fluid with subtle, quiet clicks.
 This mouse had problems almost from day one.  It wasn't reliable, didn't work well, and the battery cover finally fell off.  It has stopped working completely.
 VG
 Liked it so well on the laptop that I ordered one for the desktop too.  It's a cute little guy compared to the standard MS wired mouse and it scurries all over the pad.
 Great mouse that is low-cost and reliable. I am using it right now as I navigate this web page. Thanks Amazon! Keep the products coming! Now I just need a bluetooth mouse for my Windows 8 Dell laptop. Maybe Amazon will make one of them in the near future.
 Hooked up quickly on wireless.  Comfortable, easy to use.  Cool color.
 This is the most infuriating piece of “it” I have ever used ...or tried to use. The cursor jumps around like a crazy monkey.
 I love this wireless mouse, works great, great price.Thank you.
 The bottom of the mouse had a high spot somewhere, so whenever I clicked a button the whole mouse would wobble, very annoying, so it has been returned
 I love this product. Comfortable fit, perfect size for my hands.
 I love this mouse. This is the second mouse i had bought. Because it is the best wireless mouse ever with very reasonable price.
 Bought for my son, he uses it everyday,
 I would agree with other reviews that this mouse is slightly small, but it doesn't bother me and works very well.
 Works perfectly for my Chromebook; far better than the L brand.
 This is a pretty basic mouse and it does everything I would need it to. It even has a nice little place to put the USB receiver. I do wish it ran off of some kind of internal battery that I could charge but it came as advertised on here and thats all I expect. Its fantastic for the price and worth getting if you just need a basic mouse.
 Works well.
 Only had these for a few days so I can't comment on the battery life or durability yet but they seem fine as long as I can keep the dog off it!<br/><br/>Very nice and a great price!
 Perfect mouse, very good for the price and it works flawlessly. I am using it on a MBP 2016 Touch bar, and its amazing.
 It works very well. However I only gave it 3 stars because of short battery life. You must shut it off when not in use.I wound up buying a Logictech wireless mouse that senses when it isn't being used and shuts off automatically.
 It works just fine but the batteries are very difficult to put in. The angle of the battery tray is such that it takes several attempts to get the batteries in securely.
 It works just as described. Just a few.seconds of putting together,  insert the batteries, USB reader, switch on and.laptop mouse was off and running.
 Easy to connect.
 It is not a bluetooth mouse, but rather a nano receiver mouse. If you look for it to pair on your list of bluetooth devices, you will be waiting a long time. It has probably paired already.<br/><br/>Once I realized that, it worked great!
 Works perfectly. No issues.
 Love it normal i say away from small wireless mices because they have always been jumpy when moving around the screen. The only thing that this on had that i didnt care for was the usp plug in was inside the battery case making it a but of a  inconvenience.
 It's exactly what I expected. Nothing crazy but I do like that the piece that goes into the computer can be stored inside of the mouse when you don't need to use it anymore.
 After using this mouse for a few hours I have noticed one issue: It's too small.<br/><br/>Perhaps I just have larger hands then the average person, but I am finding to grip the mouse, I must alter my hand on it so that there is a gap between the mouse and my palm. This creates a very sore wrist.<br/><br/>I will keep using it to see how I real like it over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>I will say this though, the shipping time was incredible!!!
 Expect it to work for a few weeks
 I like the mouse better than touchpad,
 Unboxed the mouse and was about to set it up for work and it had everything but the USB adaptor. Highly disappointed. Hope I do not have to send it back and can instead just get a USB adaptor for the mouse.
 Works exactly as expected. Don't break the plastic inside as it is used to remove the batteries.
 plastic peace came messed up, back wont stay on :( still works though
 Easy installation was nice. Plug and play! Very light and easy for travel. There is a storage area for the plug when it is not plugged into the computer. I use this on my home laptop. Batteries do not seem to die very quickly.
 This is a great mouse. Small size, great color, and excellent performance. Great price too!
 Great
 The back is always falling off and we have lost it
 As advertised.
 Can't complain
 It gets the job done.
 I have trouble with the scroll bar on my laptop.  This suits my case.
 work great
 Worked fine for a while then the single from the mouse to the receiver was easily  interrupted, which continued to get worse until finally it would no longer connect.
 Very nice mouse, connected fast and works fine. Good fit in the hand.
 Works great!  I love the material on top, it makes my hand not feel sweaty when I use it.  The Bluetooth capability works awesome so if I plan to turn it on and off just to use it for a second, it doesn't lag or delay to connect
 I have been using this mouse for the past 6 months with zero complaints and still have not had to change the batteries. Excellent buy!
 Love the way it feels in my hand.  Simple connectivity.
 Ok mouse but constantly scroll mode appears on page, that is irritating.
 flawless
 Cheap and efficient. It brings two mice.
 so far, so good. Even came with batteries. Very comfortable shape, handsome, seems sturdy.  Fired right up no problems recognizing the chip and all buttons and wheels work as they are intended to.  Only reason I did not give perfect rating is that time will tell if it lasts longer than other wireless mice that have failed after a year or less.
 This mouse is one of the best I've used, especially for the price.  Batteries don't last a real long time, but as long as mouse is long lasting I don't mind replacing batteries occasionally.
 Product as described. Compatible with both windows and mac. Super portable, I take it with me wherever I go with my laptop. The batteries that came with it only lasted me about a month, though. I switched them out for Duracell and am seeing if they will last longer.
 I like this mouse. I've been using it for 3 months. So far so good! It's easy to use, I love how the USB fits inside the mouse, and the price is great!
 This is soooo much better than the wireless Logitech it replaces! There are no hiccups when<br/>navigating  or having to click several times to get something to open, and though this mouse is more<br/>compact, seems to be contoured better and is quite comfortable over extended use. Pleased
 worked right out of the box - does the job.
 A quality office product for a decent amount of money! Love it; would recommend.
 Just that the battery economic isn't the best.<br/><br/>For a daily 9 hrs of usage the battery life will be more or left 2 months, based on Duracell batteries
 Works perfectly  and easy to set up
 East to use, plug and play and works immediately
 Seems light weight and cheaply made
 Easy install, works with windows 7, the color is exactly as in the pictures!
 AmazonBasics really does a great job with a lot of it's products.  This is one of them.  This mouse is small just so you know.  It is very small...other than that it works perfectly, but just don't expect a full size mouse when you buy.
 Love the size! Has worked great for over a year!
 I really like the AmazonBasics products and this is no different.  Works just likes its supposed to, at a competitive price.  I will continue to look for AmazonBasics items when I shop.
 Just exactly what it claims to be.....  a great basic wireless mouse.  Nothing fancy, but who needs fancy in a mouse? This is the second time I've purchased this mouse (the other one lasted for several years until I spilled milk into it), and I'll probably do so next time I need a new mouse.
 AmazonBasics have all been phenomenal items - not only is the quality and style there, the customer service is phenomenal too. After 5 or 6 months of having my mouse the USB chip started to malfunction. Amazon sent me a replacement immediately. Constantly impressed with quality and service!
 This product is about 30 days old. It worked at first but I am on the road and it no longer works. I have tried to unplug and replug the nano receiver, reboot the mouse and connect. Sometimes the mouse stutters the pointer but nothing useful. My main frustration is not that I am having an issue, it's that I cannot find ANYWHERE to get help. I can return it but that seems like overkill.
 I would strongly recommend people not considering this mouse. It is okay with the accompanying batteries (Amazon). However, once I started to use Duracell batteries, the battery compartment cannot fit well with Duracell batteries. I need to use "tape" to help to make this mouse functionally. It is very annoying!
 Worked good for a while.  Then it just stopped working.  Amazon replaced it and the new one worked as expected.  I quite using it for a couple of months and then when I tried to get it to work again it would not.  Tried 2 computers and still nothing.  The computer recognized the USB but the mouse would not work even after pressing the connect button several times.
 After a while, impossible  to get the batteries out without a knife. Also, difficult to read the polarity markings.
 This is an excellent mouse because it allows scrolling and is compatible with my MacBook Pro.  Don't forget about the power on switch on the bottom, Etc.<br/><br/>So far--I have had very good luck with Amazon-branded products.
 works great!
 bought as gift no complaints
 I like the feel of this mouse and the ease of setup. However, the one thing that detracts from it's nice look is the fact that oils from your fingertips show up as shiny spots on the mouse. Otherwise, great product.
 Tastes great, less filling!  What's not to love???
 Nice mouse sort a rubbery surface for great grip, crisp buttons, nice size for netbook or laptop (also fit my full size male hand well). Great to Amazon bring out a line of Good products at a solid price, as its so easy to get a cheese mouse or other no name low priced interfaces.
 Very good mouse for the price. Accurate, easy to set up right out of the package. Comfortable to use, overall a great product!
 It stopped working after a couple weeks of use.  I do not recommend this product. Terrible customer service as well. Wouldn't contact me back after 4 emails.  Update: they still have yet to contact me.
 pretty good just wish more colors
 Will say, I was pleasantly surprised by this little mouse! Perfect fit for my hand, elegant design, and much better quality than I expected. Works perfectly and I love the little receiver storage place inside the mouse. Thanks Amazon!
 Worked for a while and now it's collecting dust.  Not sure what the deal is with this thing and don't have the motivation to return it.  I'd  take pass on this one if given the chance again.  Worked off and on from the beginning.  Win some loose some.  Your mileage may vary
 Simply works!
 Eats batteries a LOT
 It has a stiff feel, unlike better mice I've used.
 A little smaller than a full size mouse but I works great.<br/><br/>I read the negative reviews before purchasing this and I have absolutely no problem drawing straight clear lines when using a straight-edge as a guide.
 I have done everything I can think of - replacing batteries, turning my computer off/on, checking settings -and this mouse has stopped working.  It was great for 3 months and then nothing.
 I use it with the computer connected to my home entertainment center.  Sometimes you just need a mouse.  I shut it off when I don't need it.  All Amazon product should work this well.
 Impressed with the quality of this wireless mouse.
 MUCH nicer than the price would indicate. Moves smoothly and feels good in the hand, though maybe on the small side. The buttons and scroll wheel all work smoothly and quietly. Unlike the Bluetooth mouse I was using, it stays responsive even if I leave the computer alone for a while. It compares favorably with a much more expensive Logitech I had before (which died after a year or so).<br/><br/>Also, in contrast to the Logitech, this requires no extra software to run, at least on a Mac. Plug in the receiver, turn the mouse on, and you're good -- no need for bloated and terrible software like the Logitech Control Center garbage.<br/><br/>Not sure if it's an issue with the mouse, receiver, or my computer, but I have the receiver plugged into the back of my iMac and my cursor occasionally starts stuttering and jerking on screen. If I move the mouse over closer to where the receiver is plugged in -- even just for a moment -- it seems to reestablish contact and start working well again. Tried plugging the receiver into an unpowerd USB hub that sits closer to the mouse, but then it works terribly. Could be USB 3.0 interference, which I've heard is an issue with some of these receivers.<br/><br/>edit: I moved the nano-receiver to a USB port on my keyboard, closer to the mouse, and it's great now. Range of that nano receiver seems a bit weak.
 Mouse works great. Just recently had to change the batteries after about a year. I haven't had any issues with it.
 Util
 Good feel in hand. Good response.
 This product works great! It's a great price. It's small and convenient (thought it still has a comfortable feel on the hand). I have had this for a while and haven't noticed any problems with it. Great product for great price!
 Quality was sub par but for a mouse, it served its purpose.  However, it no longer works.  Tried changing batteries, different computers, nothing works.  A mouse shouldn't die within 60 days of purchase....especially for this price.
 The worst part about this mouse is replacing the batteries. Not that it is difficult to replace them, but the fact that you have to replace them.
 Purchased in August for someone in an office who works 50-60 hours a week. Worked fine at first, however, by March the scroll button had worn down. Now it scrolls intermittently, but only with pressure. But not too much pressure.  It seems as though the "wheel" has just worn down.  Not worth the $5 you save by buying an off brand mouse. This is my first Amazon brand product purchase, and probably my last.
 I bought this mouse after I got upset with my wireless Logitech mouse. I use this over my wired Razor Adder series mouse that kind of sucks. Amazon Basics mouse is responsive, and has good battery life. The center click button works after several months of use(the reason I quit using my other mice.) It's a good buy. Trust me.
 Great mouse and quality for the price. Also very durable, been using it very hard for about a month and have experienced no issues. Also, works seemlesslg with my Mac and pairs up instantly.<br/><br/>Computer - Latest 5k iMac.
 Worked fine for about 6 weeks.  Now the scroll bar doesn't work anymore,  It's a cheap mouse.  Don't go for the cheap solution.  I just ordered a new (more expensive) mouse..
 I bought this mouse to use for my laptop.  The computer recognizes and installs the driver quickly and effortlessly every time it's connected. There doesn't seem to be any lag while using it.  It's small enough to store in a pocket of a laptop case and the nano-receiver fits neatly inside the mouse when not in use.  I would buy it again.
 The cursor on the screen sometimes wouldn't move or it had a delayed reaction when I moved the mouse.
 it broke after I have it less than a year.  amazon would not replace it for me.<br/>I am trying another one.<br/>while it did work, I had no complaints.
 Works like a charm
 What an amazing price for this absolutely functional mouse. I mean it, i've ordered other mice in the same price range that are in a land fill somewhere. this mouse however, is still a staple in our household.
 Nice compact size but it goes through batteries really quickly, like once every 2 months. Also, the battery door doesn't like to stay on. I'd pay a little bit more money and get a better mouse.
 Ok.
 I love all of Amazon's electronic products. I bought this HDMI/micro cable, USB extension, wireless mouse, iPhone charger etc. all AmazonBasics brand -they're phenomenal. Not only are they cheaper than name brand product, but they work just as well (if not better).
 There was no nano receiver in the package, how can I get one?
 Nice and small and works even after i dropped it on the floor several times now. Batteries dont last as long as some other mouses Ive had but still good for a few months.
 Searched for a bluetooth mouse.  This was suggested by amazon.  It's wireless but needs it's own receiver
 Reliable and nice price.
 Smooth mouse; very quiet.  ;)
 Great mouse, but skips or misreads it's location or movements. I do use a polished hard wood desk.
 I use this for both my desktop and laptop computers.  There is a tiny piece that plugs into a USB port, which is all it takes for the mouse to work seamlessly with any device I've tried it on.  It's a comfortable grip for me too, although it might be too small for someone with really big hands (mine are medium-large).
 I've had this for quite sometime and forgot to review it. It's great. It's worked well and haven't had to buy another. And it's been well over a year.
 Does what it says, and is surprisingly durable.  Still works perfectly after 3 years, and has aged better than most of my other computer accessories.  Comfortable to use, and couldn't be easier.  The click is quiet (but still audible), while the wheel is totally silent.
 Initially ordered a Technet wireless mouse. After futzing for an hour decided it was DOA. Amazon efficiently refunded. Bought the AmazonBasics. Worked perfectly out of the box under Windows 10. Tracks without a mousepad on white Corian. Nice size for my laptop. For about $10 an amazing bargain.
 I bought this in a rush after my beloved apple mouse died. I was prepared not to like it as much, but this thing is a WORKHORSE! The only slight downside is that I feel like I go through batteries slightly faster than the other one did, but still not a big deal.
 works fine but i have only had it for a week .
 After 18 months of very light use, pointer "quivers" on screen making it almost unusable. out of warranty of course. Recommend better quality purchase. Problem with mouse only not touch pad so must be mouse issue.
 Pretty good, lightweight, inexpensive mouse, but three months later the Nano USB piece is in two pieces, with one part stuck in my machine. The mouse works (for now) anyway, so I keep using it, and for $14 will likely replace it with another.  However, the mouse seems pretty disposable, and not durable, as a result. Maybe I just got a dud.
 Gave it to my sister, it works well
 Great.
 great price but mouse not so sensitive.  take awhile to find cursor.
 Really good mouse - my daughter loves it - but I think it's a little small for adult hands and starts to give me hand pain if I use it too long.
 using as I write this review good little mouse for the price
 I love Amazon, but I have never bought an Amazon Basic product before. I am so glad I did, the price was unbeatable and the mouse is smooth and I love the convenience of keeping the USB plug right inside the battery enclosure so that it is safe from damage and won't get lost.  Great Quality product and I would highly recommend!!  I will definitely more Amazon Basic products.
 This works great. Amazon Basics has a lot of very good stuff. Not all of it has all the bells and whistles but this mouse does all the basic things a mouse is supposed to do except eat cheese. And batteries last a long time. I leave mine on all the time and the batteries have lasted about 4 months now.
 it's an adequate mouse but it chews up batteries.
 Bought this to replace my mouse at work. Its straightforward and does a really good job. Solid battery life and good response time when gaming at home.
 This item meets all my expectations. I was actually thinking about cancelling my internet service because my tablet touch mouse was not working. The pointer just kept on freezing. Had to manually shutdown the tablet, (pressing down on the power button). But this wireless mouse is perfect. Just take out of the box, install the batteries then attach the card to the computer then turn mouse on. That's it &amp; my tablet is good as new. I would of given it 5 stars but the on/off switch is so tiny.<br/><br/>Extremely pleased<br/>"D"
 Great when using a windows computer. Did not need when migrated to Mac.
 Ever since I've purchased this wireless mouse I never use my laptop without it! It has the perfect feel. Only problem I would say that I've had is that it will not work with my Toshiba Laptop, but works with my Dell laptop. No Idea Why..?? But Otherwise, 5 Stars!
 Does what it says on the tin. I have no complaints. I popped in the included batteries, put the nano receiver into my laptop's USB slot, and 2 seconds later I was mousing.
 Amazon does it again with a really nice well made wireless mouse .  Took less than a miute to unbox and install - works well - its perfect
 Poor Quality. Flimsy battery door kept falling off and eventually was lost. Returned and bought a Logitech for $5 more - worth it. Return to Amazon was easy though - thanks Amazon.
 Its ok
 Bought this to go with my laptop... works Perfectly!! This will stay on my list if I ever need another, like if my desktop one dies!
 Seems to work great
 Good
 Excellent product came on time and smoothed using it; I love it.
 I've purchased many of the Microsoft Wireless Mice, but decided that I didn't need to spend 40 plus dollars for a laptop that doesn't get used all that often.
 Puuurfect for my small hands...actually relieved Carpal..Goes great with my laptop..easy to turn off and conserve Batteries<br/>Surprise..There was a set of Batteries in package...I almost missed that..Great shipping box to protect too...<br/>Great Price...I wouldn't PAWS to get another...CAT Grateful
 This thing works with a 10 year old Mac, and 15 year old windows computers as if it were made together with them.  For those who know how annoying Macs are with non-Mac products, this thing is a life saver.  Would buy it again in an instant.
 I was struggling using the mouse pad located on my laptop.  Thank goodness I purchased this inexpensive wireless mouse.  Its EXACTLY what I wanted.  Purchase this inexpensive mouse without hesitation.  Take out of the box with easy install.
 It functions well enough, but there is a cover on the bottom over the area where the receiver is stored and the batteries are. That cover does not stay on very well. More annoying than anything.
 I use this mouse everyday at work. I like the small size and it is very responsive. I replaced the batteries after 2 months of week day use. I do feel as though the plastic is wearing down a little quickly though.
 I bought this for my husband for father's day. Very impressed with the amazing quality of this mouse and my husband loves it. Would definitely purchase again
 Works well now but wasn't as easy as suggested to setup and I am computer savy. Maybe it was my PC. The mouse wouldn't recognize the USB device and I had to use my old mouse again for a little while. It's working for now though.
 Didn't use. Got the old one working again.
 here are great and durable
 Works well.
 Perfect
 Works great, lasting. Can turn on and off to save battery
 AmazonBasics anything as far as I'm concerned has turned out to be not only just a term for a good price but a good product, which overall means a good value. I bought two of these for nieces and nephew. Like all the other Amazonbasic products I've purchased, I haven't been disappointed one time. Good job AMAZON.
 Don't the best, but it does work, and I use it daily.
 Product is exactly as advertised.
 This mouse has exceeded my expectations, I really love it! I purchased it when I bought my Dell computer online and it's great! Feels nice, fits my hand great, and the receiver is IN the mouse so you won't lose it! There is a nifty little compartment where it goes and it is awesome! There is no excuse to lose it.
 Trash, spend 5 more dollars and get the logitech. I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time I let sit for more than 5 minutes. I have since purchased another mouse and do not have this issue.
 I was a bit worried about the negative reviews on this mouse but so far things have been working pretty smooth.
 We ordered this mouse to use with our new Dell laptop.  It was simple to connect and works perfectly.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a wireless mouse.
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
 Love these things. I've bought one for work and one for home. They're a good size, even for my big hands. They were totally plug and play, no setup required for my Windows XP machine, and my Mac. Added bonus: the batteries last a long time too.
 This was my first Amazon Basics purchase.  Very quality piece of electronics, without the price tag of other brands.  Nice shape, suitable for right or left handed users.  Looks sleek, plastic is durable, mouse control is very smooth and accurate, no lag.
 I am actually quite impressed with this mouse.  It gives good value, works pretty darn good and despite some other comments, I found the battery installation to be easy if you are handy with mechanical things.  Good deal for good value mouse.
 Exactly what I was looking for.  Looks great and works perfectly.
 Very nice not to have the wire getting in the way.
 Four months of use and it began to malfunction.  Will eat batteries too, if you don't turn it off whenever not in use.
 I've purchased a few of these. Great basic mouse (appropriately named) with no extras, just a scroll wheel. Nice for a laptop or to use in an office. The mouse is very comfortable to use and has a softer material than hard plastic. Highly recommended!
 Great mouse. Works as I expected.
 Economical wireless mouse.  My previous wireless mouse gave up working a few weeks ago and I didn't want to spend a ton of money as I only use it in my home office with my laptop.  Worked perfectly right out of the box.  Very happy with his.
 This is great mouse but battery life is very poor. i use this mouse everyday 8 hour in a day and battery drains every month and batteries are much expensive then this mouse now :)<br/><br/>Update: Wheel is broken after 1,5 years. So too bad...
 Works very well with my laptop.  The batteries last a very long time.
 If you just need a cordless mouse this is a go to. Works great for those times that my touchpad is not cooperating
 love this mouse
 Perfect mouse for the money!
 Great mouse for a desktop computer.  I had it for about a month and the USB connector broke off in my USB port while in my bag.  Mouse no longer works and the shell of the connector is stuck in my laptop port. I won't rebuy this.
 Works well and seems durable.
 Works well, especially for the price. Rides a bit small in my hand. Not sure if it's too small, or I just need to adjust to a different mouse. All in all though, worth the money.
 Perfect wireless smaller mouse. Battery's came with it.
 No problem with the mouse, but in the first two weeks, I took the laptop with me someplace and wrecked the little transmitter.  It is not durable at all.  Take it out every time you move the laptop at all.
 Died in less than six months. I guess you get what you pay for.
 Sleek, that is because I am an Amazon fan. But I like the coating of the mouse. The top is some softer feeling material, allowing excellent grip. It is not better or worse than a MSFT or Logitech mouse, but it is just the mouse you expect to get for little $. I can definitely recommend this mouse if you want a companion for your touchpad.
 Unlike most wireless devices out there, this mouse does not automatically shut off when not in use. The base has a bright red light constantly on unless you switch it off, which causes the battery to die within months (as opposed to years like prior wireless mice I've owned).
 Pros:  This mouse is inexpensive, has a nice feel in the hand, rubberized top and nice clicking feel.<br/>Cons:  Two AAA batteries only last for a month, if you're lucky.<br/><br/>Verdict:  This mouse is going in the garbage.  I have since gotten a replacement mouse with a much higher battery life rating.
 Not ideal for gaming but will work well for everything else.
 Happy with this mouse - I've been using it for about 2 weeks and haven't had any issues with it.
 Petite, affordable, works perfect.
 vERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN. MOUSE CLICKER STUCK. I THREW IT IN THE TRASH
 Mouse is reasonable but not very comfortable in my hand (compared to logitech).<br/>Another cons is the USB dongle which is oversized compared to other mice I have and protrude from the laptop a little too much.
 Lately, I've been buying more and more AmazonBasics products because they are definitely worth the price. It was time to upgrade my old wireless mouse since I was tired of its weight. The old mouse used two AA batteries and it had a large hump which didn't make it too fun to use. After browsing a bit it came down to two mice. This AmazonBasics mouse or the slightly more expensive name brand mouse. What made me decide to go towards this one was the amount of reviews and ratings compared to the name brand. The price sealed the deal.<br/><br/>The size is perfect and cups in the inside of my hand just right. It feels slightly larger than a laptop mouse. It's a little lighter than my old mouse. The wireless reception is fantastic. The PC tower sits below the desk. Just now, I reached back about six feet and the mouse is still very responsive. The on/off switch is a big plus. The light rubber feel on the top is very comfortable. The clicks are very quiet and very responsive. I would recommend this mouse to everyone.
 I really like this mouse and the price is unbeatable.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it never turns off or enters a sleep mode when you aren't using it. The battery life is pretty good (maybe about 200 hours?) but this can get quickly used up if you forget to turn it off at the end of your work day (which I do, constantly).
 Works great on my pc, but when I switched to a mac it seemed sluggish. Battery life is good so long as you turn it off between uses. I recommend using rechargeable batteries.
 Good product, but I kept the adapter in my laptop's USB while putting it in my bookbag and has caused the product to not work properly. I suggest always taking out the USB wireless receiver when traveling.
 it works great
 Trabajo bien
 I am not very good at using the track pad on my laptop. I used to have a desktop at home and that's what I have in the office, too. I always needed a mouse to scroll and click around the computer. This device does what it is expected to do. The little nano receiver might be annoying to some users, since a newer version operates through bluetooth nowadays. But this mouse performs very well.And at the price I paid for it, I'd say I got the best deal. Besides, laptop has multiple USB ports, I might as well make use of some of it.
 This was a waste of money even at the low price I paid.  When you move this mouse near any hyperlink it starts to jump around on its own, making it very difficult to accurately click links and often leading to inadvertent clicks of things you weren't interested in.  When I let go of the mouse it wanders around webpages on its own, which is pretty distracting when you're trying to read something. The mouse's jittery behavior has left me unable to use Chrome. I am using a laptop with Windows 10.
 perfect for my needs. works great.
 Simply did not function.
 After my Microsoft mouse turned into mush (it wasn't hard plastic like this one), I decided to try something a litter cheaper. This is a great product that does exactly what it should do with no frills.
 Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourself. You have no right to take down<br/>people's honest review, just because it doesn't play nice towards your own<br/>Name.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Not Happy Customer!
 Great mouse.  Feels sturdy.  Good accuracy on the optic.  Only drawback is there fact that the receiver is stored in the battery compartment instead of having a external spot with a release button.
 I would have liked the usb adapter to be able to connect to the mouse when it isn't being used without moving the battery. Otherwise, it is great.
 Good wireless mouse. Small/compact and soft to the touch.
 Perfect for travel or everyday use. USB connector stores inside mouse for easy on the go. I am very happy with this!
 Just no. This didn't work at all.
 Great mouse, handy to have a wireless one, especially for the price. Works good, reliable, no skips or lags in movement. Dropped it a few times, nothing broken.
 Extremely satisfied.
 The pointer movement is just not very precise. During slow, methodical movements (such as highlighting small text on a web page), the cursor/pointer jumps around a fair bit. I've tried the mouse on multiple surfaces, and have seen no improvement in pointer movement on screen.  A PS/2 mouse from 1998 worked better than this.
 OK, lazer read is kinda weak.  Took 2 different pads to make it work well.  Even then was not real sharp.  Cover on back would not stay on.  I returned.  Batteries included and easy enough to get in.  I think I just got a little off one.
 It was a breeze to set up and fits my hand perfectly. The tracking is very smooth and I like that the buttons aren't so sensitive that I accidentally click, which happened a lot with my previous mouse.
 I purchased this mouse several months ago and all of the sudden it stopped working. Amazon replaced it at no charge, I received the new one rather quickly and it works fine as well. Hope it lasts a little longer, but definitely worth it for now.
 Price was fantastic coupled with quality of product - scrolls easily and easy to set up.
 The mouse is not powerful, and it is not smooth. I tried to change the batteries, problem remained.<br/><br/>I am an engineering student, and I prefer to use my mouse on a couch, or on my jeans. I had Logitech M18~ series and it worked just fine.
 Great mouse!
 I bought this to use with our security camera system's DVR that came with a wired mouse.  Works great.  Price is right for what I needed it for.
 Very poor quality USB Nano Receiver.  Its internal board got separated from its metal casing within barely 2 months of use and Amazon does not seem to sell a spare Nano Receiver.  I am highly disappointed in Amazon Basic products.
 Perfect for my convertible laptop/note pad.
 I love my little purple mouse.  It is sleek and smooth and works very nicely.
 I bought one for myself, gave it to my partner, and bought a second one for myself again. Love the small, compact size--great for traveling.
 Have 2 of these mouse's and have had zero issues. Battery life last about 2 months
 Great value. Working well.
 I am amazed by the performance of this little guy. I use it on my Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB and it is so responsive and accurate and fits my big hand so well...it is the best mouse I ever owned. I bought two more in fact...one for a friend and another spare for me.
 Great price, great mouse. No need to spend more on the expensive ones. Here are a couple notes: 1) the nano receiver stays in the USB port during use. This is ok for me since my laptop has 3 USB ports so I can still plug in my printer. 2) You have to remember to turn the mouse to the off button so the battery doesn't drain. These are only notes &amp; by no means bothersome. I think for the price, Amazon made a great quality product here!!
 I love this mouse. I received the package quickly, plugged it in and it immediately started working. I have small hands so I like the way this feels in them. It is the perfect size and moves smoothly. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a standard but great sized wireless mouse.
 I bought this in february, and got it with a pair of amazon batteries, 3 months later and I haven`t change the batteries yet!<br/>it`s an ergonomic mouse, and totally worth it for the price
 This is my second Amazon Basics mouse that has just died on me after a little while. Works great... until it randomly stops working. First one took about 18 months, second one died after 6. Even though it's cheap, I'm going to look elsewhere from now on.
 I love this mouse.  I thought I would never replace my wired mouse from early 2000.  This one quickly became my favorite.  I bought my wife one too for her computer and she loves it too.  The battery life is pretty good.. I've only changed the battery once.  Oh.. and the range is pretty good too for the receiver.
 So pleased with this mouse! I have a small hand and it fits perfectly. Connects to my laptop right away. Takes two triple A batteries. Convenient size for travel.  It has great battery life, too!
 nice to get rid of 10 ft of cabling from my small desktop.  Has worked flawlessly and required literally no setup.
 This is a great little wireless mouse.  Easy setup.  The first one I bought stopped working, but Amazon replaced it immediately with no problem.  I would buy this again.
 Works Perfect!
 A good, basic product.<br/><br/>I needed a simple, wireless mouse as I lost my last LG.<br/><br/>It says on it "Basics" - which is exactly what I wanted as I do not use it all of the time.<br/><br/>It is a simple, sturdy wireless mouse.
 The mouse arrived on time and was exactly what was advertised. I have been using it for about 3 to 4 weeks now and have had no complaints. Works great.
 Very cute, works great
 First wireless optical mouse I have ever uses.  Nice to be disconnected from a wire cable.  Is working great.
 LOVE IT ON MY DESK TOP.  NO MORE WIRES
 Pretty good price and works fine!
 Love it!  Paired it with a new Dell laptop which is also awesome.  Feels high quality and works on virtually any surface!  Currently am using it on my leg curled up on the couch!  Buy this, can't go wrong!!
 Perfect. Best mouse for the price. Once agin amazon pulls through with another great cheap item.
 Good basic laptop mouse.  I keep one of these around for when I inevitably lose my more expensive Microsoft Bluetooth mouse.  It gets me through those times admirably.
 I like the internal compartment that holds the Bluetooth receiver.  but the batteries are always shaking loose in travel.
 This mouse is not bad, it is responsive and feels smooth. But its range just seems incredibly short. I got this so I could play games on my PC in the living room. But, past about 4 feet or so, its connection gets very fidgety. I was able to use it at about 7 feet but it was rather unbearable.
 GOOD
 It works.  That is important.  I love the fact that I can turn it off and save battery power.  It fits nicely in my hand, and glides across my mouse pad like a skater over ice.  Totally worth the price.
 Works fine. The price is right.
 I find that this mouse works fine and feels nice in my hand. Every time I drop it (not even very hard) the two batteries and their cover go flying, which is pretty annoying, but if you're not clumsy like me you shouldn't have a problem.
 I bought this mouse a year ago to use for my work laptop. It worked for a couple of months but randomly stopped working. I often received messages on my computer stating that it could not recognize the usb. I was able to get a replacement at no charge but that one also stopped working after a couple of months. Luckily because the warranty hadn't expired I was able to get a refund. I would not buy this product again, I was disappointed.
 Very good wireless mouse. From what I can tell, it has a range of ~15ft, not that you would regularly need that full distance, but it's still good to know! I prefer it to my girlfriend's comparable Logitech M185. It has a bit of a heavier feel in the hand, plus it's made with rubber rather than plastic. Highly recommend
 Mouse is big and bulky, I go through batteries like crazy and doesn't work on all the surfaces that my old mouse worked on. Its been less than a year and I am already looking for another replacement.
 Its wireless signal is very poor. It's tracking is poor. I do not recommend this item. I would try to send it back but the battery cover fell off and I can not find it. I had to replace it with a AWESOME M510 Logitech for only a few dollars more only a week after receiving it. Go with a much better item. Pass on this one.
 The mouse works well, connects easily, and has no issues; however, if you have big mitts like me, this thing feels tiny.  I mean, it is uncomfortably small for my hand.
 EASY TO INSTALL. PLEASED AAAAAAAAA++++++++++ED
 Have two of these. Like most Amazon Basic products, they are a great value and work well. Effortless to set up. Note they these are not Bluetooth.
 Solid function. It works well. It does feel a little small after a day of use, but it has been working for many days with no complaints.
 Comfortable in the hand.
 Excellent value...windows 10, Dell Inspirion 15
 This is the second mouse I got, the first one died after 10 days. This 'new' one has also failed and does not operate at all. I attempted to return it but am past their return date. Its only 6 months old. Really Amazon? You won't let me return it after 6 months? Nice. Don't buy this one!
 Quick and easy set up of the mouse, just plug into tablet USB, put in batteries and turn to on position and you are ready to go.
 I was sold a malfunctioning mouse! Unbelievable!
 Great mouse, highly recommended!!!
 Comfortable and Easy-to-use ... being confined to bed I was irritated with the wire on my previous mouse so decided on this mouse... wish I had done so sooner. Set up easy and performance is great. No longer worried about wire tangles or that wire flopping all over.
 Excellent mouse - haven't had a problem with it yet, unlike our other two (which were not Amazon).<br/><br/>Just wanted to update this review as I purchased a second one for another computer.  These work so great.  Really dependable and never glitchy.
 using for a couple months now.  seems quite rugged as it has been dropped MANY times and doesn't skip a beat.
 Was great for about a year - then stopped tracking even with new batteries.
 I like that the usb is really small and doesn’t protrude from my chromebook too much!
 Must be Neverready Knockoffs. Went through 4 of them in a remote control in a month. The remote control only uses 2!
 I replaced logitec mouse using this. Response on this is very choppy and not as smooth as my previous wireless mouse.  I was about order 2 but I am glad I got just one. 2nd one that I needed will be logitec.
 Very happy with it.  Easy to use and store.
 This works fine on a mouse pad but I like to use mine all over the place and it doesn't work well on fabric or other surfaces.
 Works perfectly, inexpensive, lasts long. Best economically priced mouse on the market.
 I don't like that the wireless adapters isn't smaller. It's much larger than the one for my wireless keyboard and the old mouse I replaced with this one. Otherwise, it's great!
 Our previous wireless mouse ate batteries almost daily, not this one.  You can leave the mouse on with it not eating up batteries like crazy.  We've had it for over a month and it's stills on its original batteries.
 Great mouse! Great price! One complaint was that I had to snip away some plastic wrapping that got stuck on the inside of the battery carriage, but it worked great after that.
 We love amazon so decided it was a perfect mouse for us. The first package we got was missing the usb to connect to the computer. We sent it back and amazon sent another right away. The second worked great and I am using it to hit submit now! :)
 Great product for the price.
 Great mouse, as far as computer mice go. There's not much to say. It works as it should and looks nice.
 Love it. I had been having problems that I didn't realize were due to the mouse. When I began to realize i needed a new one I was really out of sorts trying to do anything on the computer. When I received this one it was so easy to hook up and works great.
 the batteries will not stay in place. the cover which is should hold the batteries in place and cause full contact will not force the batteries down<br/>.<br/>to create a full contact and so the mouse does not work.  i tried a wedge of paper  to secure the battery and i could not dot it.
 When I first received this mouse, it was perfect for what we needed. After about a good 3-4 months the mouse just became extremely slow, and when I would turn it on it would take 5 minutes to stop with the terrible, terrible lag. Even when it was warmed up, it was still pretty laggy. Another downside is that it was very small for even my 12 year old son's hands.
 A bit small for my hand. Also, when USB dongle connected to the back USB port, connection to the mouse is spotty at best. To work reliably dongle needs to plugged to the front USB.
 This wireless mouse is exactly that......a wireless mouse.  It works great, has a right click, a left click and a scroller.  It feels comfortable.  It's also sold at a great price compared to other wireless mice. Not sure why people would even bother buying a more expensive one.
 Better than expected - light weight - Was unsure what the branded amazon would be like but better than my old one and lighter - buy it
 Two out of three might work
 Nice!  It paired up with my laptop quickly.
 I'm not much of a tech guy, but this worked so good I actually am writing a review. It's as simple as taking it out of the package insert the batteries (included), insert the receiver into USB, turn on mouse. Work away. Simply works, easy to plug in and go also it has an astonishing battery life (several months if not year with batteries it came with).
 I couldn't live without my wireless mouse. I was initially disappointed that it used two AA batteries instead of one, but they last so long I forget all about that. I use it about 8 hours a day, minimum. It works great. I have had no problems with it and I have had it for almost three months.
 I've owned one for a few months now. I bought this for work and have had some serious issues. I think it may be the refresh rate because the mouse will work fine for a minute or so, but then it lags and goes completely whack on-screen. I thought it would be nice to not have a wire at work, but I'm about a month from throwing it away if this continues.
 There are no forward/back buttons on the side. this is a very basic mouse.
 works great &amp; more compact than my previous mouse
 Is a mouse
 Great item and a bit cheaper that the name brand.
 Super little mouse.  Replaced a Logitech mouse that gave up the ghost way too soon.  So far this one does the job .... and at a great price.
 works o kay but has a weird setup for placing the batteries. Also, a Bluetooth device goes into your computer taking;  up a port.  Not bad but not exceptional either,
 I should of bought this before I bought three from the store's. This (basic) mouse is perfect. I would buy this again.
 I like this mouse, very easy to use
 I really love Amazon Basics products. They are simple and quality. I have had no issues with this mouse and use it every day. I would recommend to friends.
 This mouse is just what I needed
 works great, installs in a snap. was having trouble with my dell wireless loosing signal and replaced with this for my laptop. so glad i did, high quality and i love it. no lost connections anymore with this fantastic mouse.
 It Works!!!!
 Great wireless mouse! Easy to install, works perfectly, and is the right size for my hand.
 Good mouse- works -does t eat cheese ha ha
 Works very well/
 I have two of these and they both use batteries in a matter of days.
 It's a small wireless mouse, but it works very well. The compact size is great and the dongle can be hidden inside of it. It goes great with my boyfriend's Surface Pro. It makes it so much easier to use.
 DOES JUST WHAT I GOT IT TO DO.  NO MORE CORDS TO TRIP ON.
 Works like a champ.  I screwed along with a pad for a week until I bought this and am back to normal. (if I am normal)
 I don't know how much you can say about a mouse - but this one would be included in anything worth saying.  It's priced quite reasonably and it receiver is a micro usb - responds well, center wheel works quite well - I'm pleased.
 Does the job. Plugged in and recognized by my computer with no problems.
 Bought this so we could use it and a wireless keyboard for the computer we have attached to TV for Netflix and Amazon Prome. The range is very short so we still have to get up and go to unit to use it
 This thing takes a beating and keeps going.
 All you have to do is plug it into your USB port and turn it on and it works great! I'm hooked on a wireless mouse and this one has given me no problems. I will probably buy another one as soon as it breaks, but I don't expect it to break for a long long time.
 Insterted batteries<br/>Connected USB Receiver<br/>Mouse activated<br/><br/>All within 30 seconds. Mouse works flawlessly. You can't ask for more. Don't think about it any further - add it to your cart now.
 Broke already. Strangely the rolling wheel got stuck and now doesn't want to cooperate. Maybe it was a bad piece? Oh well for $9 it's not too much of a loss. Buy HP instead.
 Satisfied
 Amazon, fix your search algorithm.  Don't return this non-bluetooth mouse as the second result when I search explicitly for "bluetooth mouse"!
 I've ordered 3 of these. They have a fatal flaw: require new batteries too often. I have wireless mouse at work and change batteries maybe once a year. These little buggers require new batteries everyone 1 to 2 months. So buy a more expensive mouse that doesn't waste batteries.
 Simple and stable mouse. comparatively bit on the heavier side, which is good thing as it increases the stability,<br/><br/>I Use this mouse daily for office work. Batteries needs to be changed every 3 months.
 This item came to me twice without a nano receiver and I have had to return it twice.
 This is the second one of these I have gotten and they give very good service.  Price is just right.
 The mouse has been working great so far. The only thing that will maintain this 5-star​ rating is the battery life. That only time will tell as I just started using.
 Does its job. Good price for the stuff, It is ok and I would buy again if needed.
 Within a few months of owning this mouse, the right mouse button stopped working.  I have never had a mouse do this before.  I have 10 year old ball mice, that both buttons still work.<br/><br/>It's Made in China, so that most likely has something to do with it.
 Just right work good love it
 It stopped working in less than four months.
 I have never been more dissatisfied with an Amazon product. The plastic piece inside would not come out of the mouse for me to use it. I even had my IT team at my work try, eventually is broke in half and now I cant use it at all. I will think twice about purchasing Amazon products.
 Good basic mouse.  Connects right away and movement and buttons all responsive.  I've been using it for a couple of months, a couple of hours most days (and more on the weekends) and on first set of batteries.
 This is wonderful! Quiet as a mouse........... and everything I needed at less than I would ever expect to spend.<br/>Plug and play in Windows 7 and regular tweaks worked to slow down, add pointer trails, etc.<br/>Why pay a dollar more?
 The Mouse works great.  However the batteries that came with it must have been old.  I have already replaced them (after less than a month).  No problems with the mouse however.
 Perfect for the price.  Be careful not to drop it, they break very easily.  This is my second one
 The tracking accuracy is good, but could be a bit better. However, it is great for the price. I wish it had extra buttons, but for its price point, it is great.
 Bought for my daughter, this is a smaller version from what I use.  It plugs in well with laptops, tablets and desktops, and doesn't cause problems when traveling.  The receiver and battery are easy to use and fit well in the bottom.  Not very costly, but a great buy.
 Does it's job
 Thanks.
 Amazon branded products rock! They're high quality and well built. We own a laptop backpack and iPhone cords that are also Amazon branded. We love them all.
 Worked for a year
 I bought it for faster gaming responses and it basically sucks as a game mouse. Probably fine for normal use. I chucked it and went for a razor mouse instead.
 Compact and works great.
 I had problems with the first mouse that I received, so I returned it. Amazon quickly replaced it, &amp; the replacement works beautifully. It has a nice hand-feel &amp; works with both my PC laptop &amp; Mac desktop.
 Great deal. Perfect size and no set up. Just plug and play. Even comes with the batteries.
 Easy to use. Easy to hook up.
 Product exactly as advertised
 Works fine but was a little disappointed that i had to have the USB jack on the same side of my computer that the mouse is located, meaning that it doesn't work very far away.
 This mouse was working very well, better than any mouse I'd had until It stopped working after a month of use.  It still functions (terribly) and is the most lagg mouse I've ever had.  It's so annoying that I have begun to just use the touchpad on my laptop even though I hate that.  I got a refund from amazon so the 3 stars are for how great their customer service is!
 Exactly as expected.
 Easy to use! No complicated installation stuff.<br/>Battery life was short. Other than that, so far so good!
 Mouse is fine, the usb is very large.  I like to keep it install on my laptop.  Due to the size, it gets caught on my laptop sleeve and briefcase all the time.
 Love it - very easy to use.
 Works great for the price. Once in a while the cover to the battery will fall off but it works great. In addition, it plug in and play no software or anything needs to be installed.
 This is my 4th time buying this mouse because I'm THAT satisfied with it. Price: Great! SIze: Great! Click Noise: Quiet! I love this mouse and even bought a few for my friends.
 This is a nice laptop mouse.
 Cheap wireless mouse.  You know what you're getting.
 Mouse works fine My batteries keep falling out most be somthing on the inside pushing it out and the bottom cover keeps falling off its been like 2 weeks ive had it
 The price is great but after it stops working, the mouse is futile. It came on time with shipping.<br/><br/>I bought this mouse in late 2014 and for the first couple of months since the purchase, it worked well. After the initial use, I stopped using it, probably around February 2015. I noticed then in the summer of 2015 when I decided to use it again, it had a really hard time trying to find a connection and the mouse would lag on the screen even with new batteries inside.
 This broke within the first two weeks of purchase.  The USB connector is fine, but gradually the mouse movement on the screen lagged and the connection became unstable, even after replacing the batteries.
 Been using this wireless mouse for months now and have zero complaints. Fits in my hand perfectly and does its job,
 Works great, even thru KVM switch.
 It works great, feels good, but it eats batteries very quickly. I'm careful to turn off the mouse when I'm not using it...and I use 3 times as many batteries as my previous Logitech mouse.
 This mouse worked but used batteries like none other.  Logitec mice are tops this one is a juice hog!  I finally threw it away tired of replacing batteries so often!
 Had to get a replacement after it broke after about 1-2 months of some usage. Must have been defective. The second one is still going strong.<br/><br/>It's not the most ergonomic mouse but it serves its purpose and is responsive.
 Works. Wish the battery cover fit tighter.
 Inexpensive mouse that works even better than my Microsoft wireless mouse.
 Amazing how much better this mouse is than most anything else Ive used, except for much more expensive Apple mice or touchpad. I recommend these to all my friends, coworkers, and clients
 Continues ro work. I like it.
 All my coworkers saw mines and demanded I order them one!! I must admit this is a really nice wireless mouse. Never had any issues connecting and it works perfectly
 I like the attempt in making this product slim line...  Because the upper portion is held by very small plastic clips, it breaks easily and can't be repaired.
 Works as advertised
 I ordered this mouse for my grandma because she has issues using the track pad on her laptop.  She loves it so far.  Very responsive and easy to use, and the price was right.
 Simple and worked without any extra configuration.
 Easy plug and play for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. My desktop is one saved from the recycler. Tired of the corded mouse I tried this one. Instant success, no downloading drivers. I recommend this mouse. No problems at all. No CD install required. Another outstanding and affordable product from Amazon. I did not try it on the Windows machine.
 Great feel which is what I like about the Amazon mouse. Highly recommend it. Don't cheat yourself by buying a cheap mouse. You'll use it once and never use it again. I know. I made that mistake before I purchased the Amazon mouse.
 No comment it was a gift for someone else I personlly haven't used it
 I love how sleek and classic it looks and feels!
 basic, cheap, works
 Works great! Love it so much I bought a second one. Use one for home and the other on the road for work.
 Used it for a year. Worked great. Then it just started acting up, with the cursor sort of wandering off on it's own and not responding to mouse movement.
 It works on many surfaces, hasn't run out of batteries yet.<br/><br/>The shape is not super nice, and the texture is weird. It is super light also, which isn't the best for a mouse.
 Works so much better than expected. Perfect for main use or even just a throw in a bag spare. Highly recommend and would buy again
 I don't know if it's the batteries (which I tried changing) or the mouse itself. But it keeps turning off - after just 2 months of use.  Not happy. I'm in the middle of a project!
 Just your basic wireless mouse. No more no less. Fit well for people with small or medium hands. Tracking is fine. I don't have any problems with it. Nano receiver can be stored in the back of the mouse. Price is nice.
 Great wirelessI mouse works as should and feels good especially for how inexpensive it is. Connect wireless quickly every time. Storage inside mouse for usb chip.
 This was my very first AmazonBasics purchase, and it is true that I was a bit suspicious of how well they make their products compare to other better-known name brands. But after getting this moue for my dad, I can say that AmazonBasics did a great job making this wireless mouse. My dad loves it. We were very satisfied that it came with two AAA batteries, which made it super easy for us to set up right when the package box was opened. The bluetooth receptor is already very small that I don't have to unplug it before putting my laptop in the laptop sleeve. But I also like having the option of being able to store the receptor inside the mouse.
 Get it. Works immediately when I plugged in and I love how the USB antennae stores in the mouse when it's not being used. Fantastic feature
 Works like a charm and beats the heck out of the mouse cord.  Never a lick of problems with it and the battery lasts forever, especially if I remember to turn it off after use.
 Worked great for a few months... Randomly stopped working. Attempted to take the receiver out of my Laptop. The "receiver" came out, but the metal housing did not. I had to use tweazers to take the USB housing out of the laptop.
 You get what you pay for.  Functionality of any normal mouse but doesn't shut off automatically.  Battery dies quickly if not switched off after use.
 This feels so good in your hands. Nice texture to the top surface.
 Not quite OK. I am a bit surprised at the quality...it does not hold its batteries when there is a drop from the desk. Battery life is poor. The mouse arrow is not stable. I'll go back to Logitech or Microsoft wireless mouse.
 Works great - love it.  Wish I had purchased on sooner for my laptop.  The over on the keyoad wears out and you cannot maneuver around - the mouse gets stuck.  This solved my problem - works so well and was a great price.
 Works perfectly and was perfectly easy to hook up with Bluetooth technology. Just put batteries in push button to pair up and go. Up and running in less then 5 minutes
 Works great for my laptop.
 I had an older wireless mouse that would skip. The skipping was getting more frequent, and thus this mouse. It doesn't skip, and works well. 1 star off for it being a little small for my hand.
 Easy to set up and use. Came with a battery too which was great..
 Great value and first time mouse for my 7 year old son.  No issues with setting up or connectivity.
 Great quality. Great price.
 Good quality for the price. I'll provide feedback in one year if it is still working. Most of Laptop Wireless mouse I've had don't last longer than 3 or 4 months. Hope this one make it
 It lives up to the AmazonBasics quality. Worth it!
 Easy to use, beautiful to look at, great price. What's not to love?
 It works. The included batteries where not very good.
 Does everything I’d expect a mouse to do. Works great and is nice and compact.
 I'm using this with a security system, but you have to unplug and re-plug the dongle each time the system power cycles for the mouse to reconnect.
 I can't believe the quality of this mouse considering the price I paid for it. Obviously not for hardcore gaming but for typical daily use it works great.
 Took me a minute to find the bluetooth USB  receiver-but it stores inside the mouse!  Very convenient for when I want to throw it in my bag to take to various work locations.
 Pros: Price, decent material, size (Smaller than main stream mouses - Is this really good thing?)<br/>Cons: Distance between the receiver and mouse must be very short.
 Junk - quit working on Windows 10 after a few months....bought the LESS expensive TeckNet mouse and so far it's lasted twice as long and has a much better feel to it along with more functions.  Get the TeckNet
 very happy with this mouse
 I've been using it with my laptop for months. So much nicer than a touch pad and no extra wires on my desk.
 I love this wireless mouse.  I bought it for my computer at work because I was tired of the mouse cord getting in my way.  It does everything I need it to for basic applications and scrolling on the internet.
 Very easy to install and great to use.
 works very good, the batteries go in at the angle which is different but works fine once I figured them out
 This mouse is not level on the surface and wobbles back and forth when you use it.  We tried it on several different surfaces and it awkwardly bobbles back and forth.  We returned this item; you might pay a few more dollars for a branded one.
 the clicking sound is too loud
 They work well
 Second order, this one is for family member.  First ordered a year or two ago and it still works like the day it arrived and works perfectly, never had any issues whatsoever.
 It works just fine.  I can't believe that it is so inexpensive.  You can't buy a hamburger in this town for that kind of money.
 Works great.
 love the color - works great with my computer.
 This is a great product. I've had for a few months and just had to replace the batteries. Works very well and doesn't feel cheap. Great value.
 Wow! I am pretty impressed. This thing was so cheap I had my doubts but it works great! I love that I can just switch it off on the bottom when I am not using it so it does not drain the batteries. It is accurate and I am so glad I did not order something more expensive.
 Don't last. Went through 2 in a couple months. Really? Cover falls off. Cheap plastic. Not worth it
 Does exactly what it's supposed to do! Good quality and reasonably priced unit.
 I like the color,the way it fits in my hand ,and the way it preform.  It is great that I don’t have to have a wire dragging.  It give me longer reach.  I love it.
 It will drain your battery very soon.
 It does everything it is supposed to do and I LIKE it.
 I am unable to use my existing keyboard with this mouse.
 Works perfectly! I use it every day and haven't had to replace the batteries yet. Easy to set up. No problems at all.
 It's great to use a mouse with a laptop. I haven't had any issues with the product. It does take up one USB port, but so does a wired mouse. I'll never have a wired mouse again.
 The left clicker is very difficult to press down on. With minimal use, its functionality already seemed like a great nuisance. It is at a great price point and has a nice simple design, however my hand started to hurt after less than 5 minutes of use.
 Does not work at as advertised for Mac Mini running OS 10.12.6.
 Bought this for my son.  It works, but only if it is essentially next to the computer.  Tried new batteries.  No luck.  Might as well be a wired mouse.
 Good quality.
 Works perfectly. Really nothing more to say.
 I purchased 2 of these one for my office (I did not want to take my Microsoft wireless to the office) and one for my boyfriend.  As it turned out I like this product better than the Microsoft wireless mouse.  So I kept one at home, took one to the office and the boyfriend got the Microsoft mouse.  He also prefers the Amazon Wireless Mouse so it looks like I will be purchasing another one.
 Love this mouse. I use it in place of my $70 apple mouse. Going to buy another to replace my work mouse which is causing me pain in my index finger from an overly harsh click mechanism.
 Works like a champ.  I've thrown it on the floor (accidentally) 4 or 5 times and it just keeps ticking without any issues.  This mouse is smaller than a regular desktop mouse but not the diminutive "laptop" mouse of a few years back.  This mouse tracks well on every surface I have used it on from polished black wood to a sheet of tablet paper on my lap.
 Cheap and easy.  Just what I need.
 This product worked for all of 60 days, then receiver began dropping out and lock-ups started.  The receiver listed for this mouse is NanoReceiver (MGR0975),  but the modual I got is (RG-0976).  I had to return to the wired mouse.
 It hooks right up to every computer I've used and it tracks on almost any surface. With a bit of patience you can even use it on glass, though I'd recommend a mousepad. The clicks are soft but solid, and its easy to switch on and off, with a place to store the usb connector inside by the batteries. Love it!
 Small. Efficient. I am very pleased with this purchase.
 It works!
 I use this mouse for my laptop and also in the desktop PC to use with the TV. It reaches incredibly far across the room, and doesn't lag or have any scrolling issues. I prefer it to my wired gaming mouse!
 Using it right now. Perfect performance.
 there was a stinking piece of tape stuck inside the mouse that wouldn't come out.  I pulled a little too hard, and now the stupid thing is a paperweight.  I've never had problems with a mouse in my whole life.  very disappointing.
 I have a laptop computer and use this all over our home and my laptop mouse was not working. I attached a mouse with a cord which was driving me crazy. This small wireless mouse works great and the price was right, great amazon product.
 Easy to connect and use
 Perfect
 Works well, especially if you get tired of navigating the touchpad on a laptop.
 Well, the mouse works. Thats all. Its not precise, as I am a heavy user of excel sheets and would have preferred more accurate cursor movement in a mouse. Its not just me, my colleague who used it in my computer also complained about the lack of precision (and jumpiness) in the cursor movements. However the mouse is solid otherwise, easy to hold and the battery lasts for a few months. So If you are looking for high quality mouse for game play and sundry look else where.
 It has gone through the batteries much quicker than other wireless mice I have owned.  However, it is small and lightweight which is nice.
 smaller than Logitech
 Received item in tact , on time, good condition.  The Mouse is smooth, no complaints. I recommend this from Amazon!!
 Basic cordless mouse at a good price.  Gave it as a gift and the person has no complaints.  It's been 5 months and she hasn't replaced the batteries yet.
 This is the absolute best wireless mouse I have ever purchased! Super simple installation and start-up. No drivers to install. Nifty space between the batteries to store the receiver so it never gets lost. Overall, the best ever for a reasonable price!
 Great mouse! Make sure to turn off the power if you're transporting this in a bag for long periods of time - it'll stay on and drain the batteries.
 I really like my mouse and the color too. It is all of that. Didn’t go wrong with this one. I love it.
 A great mouse if you need it on the go. I take mine to class, so it's perfect for that. Not to bulky and I like how the USB connector can be stored in the mouse so you don't lose it.
 Beautifully crafted and works great.Love it.l highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless mouse that works.It does!
 Trying to return. Why is the cost to return almost the same as the cost to buy?  Very unhappy. I have not even taken it out of the box.
 great mouse for traveling. my only gripe is that there are no thumb buttons for additional functionality. but overall its solid and materials feel pretty nice in your hand.
 awesome for the price
 I have purchased this mouse back in December. After using it for little more than a month, it stopped working. Light comes on and everything but connection is completely dead. I tried on different computer but I had no luck.
 Works great and is comfortable to work with. A good value!
 Promptly delivered. Looked and feelt good. Worked fine the first day. But suddenly dead the next day. Try as I might, it just won't work. Tried all the troubleshooting tips, changed batteries, changed computers, tried on a different day, but no luck. Returned it. Perhaps I just got a bad item.
 Product quality was great. I am really pleased &amp; would recommend to anyone. Thank you.
 Made a perfect gift
 Not the best mouse that I have used.  It ate the batteries that came with it quite fast.  I have replaced them and we will see.  The mouse seems a bit jumpy and quite particular about the surface that it is on.
 Works great for an inexpensive mouse! I should'a bought two.
 Responsive and love that I'm free from a mouse wire.  I've purchase a second one for my other laptop.  It's a great value for the price.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wish it was lager.
 It's a little small as compared to my old Microsoft Mouse, but it works great. And I like the on/off switch. Good for saving the battery.
 Perfect price and works great!  Right click button on my laptop took a dive.  For $9.99  its alot cheaper than taking it in to get fixed. Besides, I was tired of getting up and walking across the room to my computer that was hooked up to my TV to click "Continue to watch" while binge watching Netflix!  This solved both issues.  You can't go wrong with this mouse.  Thank you Amazon!
 Works like a charm, compared to my last mouse, the connectivity is much more stable. There is no delay in it's USB wireless transmission.
 This mouse works as expected.  I will say this, though, one thing that irritates me is that the mouse does not have a built in idle function to power down after sitting unused for a period of time.  It's always on, unless you manually shut it off.
 Works seamlessly with my Lenovo Windows machine. Does not require any complicated software or anything. Easy to turn on and off and store. Mouse movement is smooth.<br/><br/>Be sure to have the plastic tab UNDER the AAA cells so that it can be used to remove the cells when required.
 Good mouse with lots of value. Works well and the nano receiver is nice. Does not sleep well when traveling and the battery is not going to last as long as some of my Logitech's, but for the money, I LOVE IT.
 Works Great! It's a good size for my small hand, glides smoothly on the couch or bed, was very inexpensive, and the part I like best--the receiver is so tiny, it can be left in the USB port. I'm very happy with this mouse!
 This little mouse can't be beat for the price. It isn't anything special, but it gets the work done and is super reliable. I've gotten the big name brands and had them fail in less than 2 years. Hopefully this one lasts as long. But at this price, I could buy two new ones a year and still not be wasting money compared to buying the expensive name brands.
 Just what I needed. Great product and service.
 Perfect size for use with my laptoprather than ysing the touch pad. The LED makes it a very smooth operation.  Has a nice little storage sort for the USB fob
 I bought this on March 17, 2016. Stopping working on June 22,2016. I only bring this mouse to school for like 10 times(The Mouse looks fine, the red light is on, but left or right click does not do anything). I bought this mouse because its amazon brand product, so I trust it. However, Amazon Brand product does not mean good quality. So disappointed.
 Notice that the Nano Receiver is in the battery compartment which is ingenious and great if you carry your laptop around a lot.  Your less likely to misplace the Nano receiver.  The instructions are not very good.  I did not see the Nano Receiver and thought that It was missing till the replacement Mouse came in and there appeared to not have a Receiver.
 Fits my hand perfectly
 Works well with my Microsoft Surface Pro and the inside storage for the receiver is nice as well. Overall good product for the price!
 Cheap, useful and delivered fast. Seems to work as well as the Logitech and Microsoft mini mice I have used in the past, but half the price. The USB receiver stores under the battery cover, and it has a proper on/off switch. Now to see how well it holds up.
 Adequate basic mouse. I overworked it.
 Simple to setup. Works well. I have not experienced the battery life issues other reviewers have reported. Not sure if it has an automatic sleep mode after so many minutes of non-use. Maybe Amazon should clarify if such a feature is built into the mouse.
 I bought this to replace I had a "cheap" Microsoft mouse similar in size that I lost.<br/>This mouse is half the cost of the Microsoft mouse but the texture feels better and more durable!
 Works great!!
 I prefer the economic model.
 This wireless mouse is just the right size, not too small or big. USB receiver can be stored inside the battery compartment, which is a great idea to prevent losing it. Both left and right buttons have the proper click; not too sensitive as I've experienced with other smaller / wireless mice. Excellent value for the quality.
 Less than a month later, the USB piece kind of fell apart and I needed to use tweezers to get the metal outside out of my computer.
 works great, just plug the stick into a open usb slot, install battery's, hit the connect button and welcome to your new wireless mouse.
 great price - smoothe movement - easy to install - love the color
 Stop wasting your time playing with the track pad on your laptop.  This mouse works great, even if it's not on a table.  I use it on my couch all the time without problems.  The USB input for the laptop is very small and the battery has lasted months
 It is basic as it says, but it works and that's all I care about!
 'Works just great! Install was super-simple. I'm using it for a desktop - 'keep the thing on alla time. 'Battery won't run down for a l-o-o-o-o-o-ng time!<br/><br/>No fuss; no muss.  Worth the $$$<br/><br/>GET YOURS TODAY!!
 Like others have said, it works great, until it doesn't. Had it for about 9 months and now it does not work. No amount of computer or software troubleshooting, battery changes, or hitting the connect button will fix it. It was great and very portable but does me no good and I won't be buying another one.
 terrible ergonomically.  difficult to use
 I was very much motivated to buy anything with Amazon name on it. I purchased tis mouse. few weeks earlier. It was working good. However, stopped working after lapse of 2 weeks.
 This is just the mouse I need! It has a good price, looks nice, feels comfortable, and works, perfectly!
 It is working great after about a couple months.
 Perfect!
 Good mouse...a mouse is a mouse is a mouse!!  :-))  Just the right size.  I don't like the real tiny ones.  Fits in my hand perfectly:-)
 Almost 9 months old and has been a great mouse, it's a bit small so I lose it easily, but I lose everything easily LOL! No complaints at all! Original batteries lasted 8 months
 simple, good value
 Was expecting that this can last longer but it pretty much stopped working after half a year. For the price I guess I shouldn't complain that much but I had higher hopes for it. Not going to purchase again.
 I am deducting one start because the mouse arrived without the batteries mentioned in the product page. The mouse installed almost instantly (Windows 7 on a Lenovo laptop) and feels really great! I have small hands, so this mouse is comfortable to me. It also feels solid and has a bit of weight to it, which feels more natural to me than a lightweight mouse.
 I have gone through a lot of wireless mouses and by far this is the best one I have uses, especially for the price. It glides smoothly, is easy to set up and the battery life is excellent, in fact, it works so well I bought another and am loving it as well.
 Use it everyday. Never turn it off and still does not drain the batteries.  Very Happy.
 Good shipping time.it works well on my mac.i recommend it.
 Works perfectly with my iMac. Inexpensive and gets the job done.
 This mouse does everything I need it to do! I have had no issues with it. What a great price and I love that you can store the USB connector (whatever you would call that- plug it in to make it connect to the mouse) inside of the mouse!
 Excellent article. I recommend it.
 Not much more to say than this: a great little wireless mouse for the money. Receiver range is not great, but not bad. Perfectly serviceable for my uses. Very accurate.
 Excellent article, comfortable and economical
 I like the product.
 Purchased less than 6 months ago, and I have replaced the batteries 3 times. Currently the mouse will not work. Very disappointed .
 Needed a mouse for my laptop and saw this at a reasonable price. I gave it a try and couldn't be happier. For 14.99 it's a great little mouse and does everything needed. It even comes with the batteries. I found that most Amazon Basics items are good value at a much cheaper price.
 Easy, plug and play set-up.
 Great mouse, perfect price
 the mouse dongle came apart :(
 mouse worked right out of box-Great
 it broke after a month, and amazon warranty had expired
 had to return it
 great price and works great
 GREAT PRICE! WORTH THE MONEY! DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD DO!!
 This mouse is smooth and comfortable in the hand. Good quality and highly recommended!
 I use this for a laptop which is connected to my TV set. I can sit on my futon and control the laptop easily to watch Amazon Prime videos.
 Effective &amp; easy-plugged &amp; played on my system, no need to recognize/pair. Nice fit too.
 Excellent! On/Off switch is tiny and hard to work but otherwise awesome and a great price.
 My mouse died. Purchased this one and actually love it better then my other one.
 After one year it is no longer working right.....
 The mouse stopped working after 3 months. No recourse.
 It feels nice in hand, but the precision is really low even at this price range. OK for web  browsing but not for CAD.
 The mouse is Crap. Windows 10 keeps telling me it doesn't recognize the device. That's laughable since it's an Amazon mouse...
 Love this wireless mouse!!
 Good for this price
 The scroll wheel does not work which is the whole reason I purchased this mouse! Disappointed :(
 The power button is on the right bottom of the mouse such that if you want to turn it on/off with your right hand (as I am right handed) its impossible to reach the power button with your thumb. See pic attached for illustration
 I have to say that I was honestly a little disappointed with this mouse. I needed a new mouse for my computer and when my search returned with an AmazonBasics product I didn't hesitate to purchase it. To my surprise the mouse doesn't sit flat on hard surfaces. Functionally the mouse is great, the track-wheel is smooth, and it responds well. I just wish it didn't rock when I right click.
 Have used other wireless mouses and this one just doesn't feel as comfortable.  Perfectly acceptable for routine computer work.
 Product arrived ahead of schedule in excellent condition and works great. Highly recommended
 What a beautiful color sure puts the old sliver and black ones to shame.
 Nice easy set up,,,plug and play,,,excellent price
 Nice little compact mouse. It works but the little cover that goes over the batteries keeps popping off. Nothing a piece of tape can't fix I suppose, but...
 For the price......this mouse does exactly what it is supposed to do and it is comfortable in your hand!
 Great item. No issues yet.
 Like most Amazon Basics, it's no-frill but works just fine. I use it with a laptop with Windows 8.1 to keep tile world from taking over when I move the pointer to the left.
 I love this wireless mouse!! I am a cord freak meaning I hate them so I love the fact that I do nit have to have a cord in my way!
 broke really quickly
 This is a great mouse. Pairing is super easy and it works great with my surface pro 3. I like that the battery compartment also has a spot to store the usb plug so it doesn't get lost.
 I love this wireless mouse. It is the first time that I have ever used this type of mouse and I really like it better than the conventional ones.
 Not reliable tracking. Sometimes the mouse skips around my screen, and it doesn't seem to matter what table surface I am working on.
 This mouse seemed to be a reasonable value for a cordless mouse for normal tasks, but the cursor keeps freezing and it gets annoying to have to shake the mouse to make it move.  How do I get it replaced?
 Broke twice after Amazon resent it.
 Great USB connected mouse at a very small price. Super easy to set up and use. No frills, but if you are using your computer for everyday use only this will work just fine.
 Love this mouse it's worked quite well for all of our computers including our desk top. We now own three and will continue to purchase because of the quality and price.
 just a cheap mouse
 Works great. Easy to use. Simple instructions and easy to instal
 Fantastic price for a well built little mouse.
 I bought this when the mouse built into my keyboard pad started sticking. It was a much cheaper alternative to having the laptop repaired, and I find it much easier to use. Being a mouse, it's obviously small enough to be easily portable.
 Before this Mouse I had bought a couple from Walgreens at the same price as this mouse that failed within days. This plugged right in and performed without any problems.
 Works fine. Stopped responding to wireless usb about a year after purchase. Would update to 5 stars if Amazon sends me a new one :)
 the design is nice, but the operation or service (machine) is very bad, the cursor or pointer moves alone, sometimes the cursor is lost. and I need to get back to using my old mouse. the quality for a normal work is very poor. no recommended
 Came with a connect button which is not mentioned in the documentation. I had to make several attempt to get it to connect to my Win 7 laptop.
 Phenomenal for the price. I needed a wireless mouse for business trips and meetings as I dread a trackpad, but it's hard finding something reliable and small for my small hands. This was perfect for me.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this for people with large hands or else you will get "the claw"
 STILL WORKS GREAT AFTER A FEW YEARS. Highly recommended
 Good value compared to other mouse alternatives.  Seems to work as well as more expensive options that I have used in the past.
 Perfect companion to my Chromebook. Auto install, ready to use in less than 2 minutes. Very inexpensive
 I've never been disappointed with my AmazonBasics purchases and this one is not different.  Great value for the money.  I hope Amazon continues to add products the the AmazonBasics line.
 Works fine, easy to install.
 I purchased this product and kept it in an unopened box as a spare if needed.<br/>I recently purchased a new laptop and after using this mouse I find it shuts itself<br/>off repeatedly. Change batteries, nothing, make sure the mouse pad is smooth<br/>with no tiny bump to trip the on/off switch nothing. AmazonBasic non-quality.
 It's much smaller than I thought it would be -- too small for my hand.  It would be okay for occasional laptop use, but I bought this for a desktop workhorse.  Also the weight of the batteries makes it slide on its own on even the slightest incline.
 It's small and easy to move. It works very well. But today it did not work and the light at the bottom turned off as well for several times. I had to restart it which made it work for a few minutes and it just blacked out again and again. Is it because of the batteries?  But I just bought it for less than 4 months. It should not run out so quickly.
 Basic but cool mouse. I like that the receiver can be stored in the battery compartment, and the mouse just works as expected. The mouse is on the small side, so it's best for laptops and small hands, but I'm using it fine on my desktop. There doesn't seem to be a low-battery indicator anywhere, but that would be a helpful addition.
 Everything was great except its size.<br/>I have average sized hands for female and it's way too small for my hand.<br/>The end of mouse doesn't reach the middle of palm so it gives the feeling that my hand is hovering on the mouse uncomfortably...<br/>I'll change my mouse soon again, if this one gives me too much pain on my hand.
 I use this at work--they didn't have wireless ones for my office. It works great. I frequently forget to turn it off at night, but I don't think it uses too much battery when left on.
 its a quality wireless mouse
 This is the best wireless mouse, period.  It comes exactly as expected, no extra buttons, works immediately, and feels good to hold.  Amazon got it right with this one.  Includes batteries, so you're good to go right out of the box.
 A+
 good price and function well
 worked for 6 months after that it would only work 10 minutes before you have to remove the receiver and reinsert it. Happens on multiple computers, so it isn't the computer.
 good
 nicely made, but had a shiny surface, not a matte finish like pictured.
 It is what it says basic.
 This works great and is easy to stow away in my backpack.
 Works great!
 Echoing what many others have said. The mouse works great but the dongle dies after a couple of months. I went through two of these, but with the thousands of positive reviews, it may be computer dependent. One possible cause could be that some computers USB ports voltage is not as regulated as others computers and over time wears down the dongle. That is just one guess. If amazon could fix this, it could be a great mouse.
 do not buy this ,inconsistant ,cant tell which way to insert batteries,change batteries and still doesnt work
 i'm old fashioned and just can't get used to the track pad on my laptop, this makes life much easier.  every easy to pair as well
 Use it for school and have not any trouble with it.  Contemplating getting one for work as well and dropping the mediocre mouse supplied with the computer.
 Excellent mouse.  Especially for the price.  Have replaced batteries twice, but not a big deal.
 Excellent product and exactly what I expected.
 Cheap, works straight out of the box, what more could you ask!? Perfect for a laptop when you don't want to use a touchpad. Used it from about 15 feet away and there were no issues whatsoever.
 Works as expected and is the right shape and size.  That you can store the receiver in the mouse for transport is a plus.
 Basic mouse that has been working perfectly with my Macbook.  Wish it had side-to-side control via the button though.
 -stuck in the batteries, plugged in the usb, turned it on ------- IT WORKED! I'm and old guy - I hate those cursor pads (or whatever they're called). I would never be without a mouse with my non-touch screen laptop. -Love this mouse!
 works and smells great.
 did not work
 I was looking for a mouse for my laptop that had a smaller thumb drive to insert in the UBS port. This one is very small. It works very well. Very happy. So far I have been having good luck with Amazon basic products and at a very decent price.
 Nice basic mouse. Reasonable price.  The last few cheap Chinese wireless mice I bought all had back jumping scrolling issues, or were hard to wake up when they went to sleep.  This one works like you expect it to.  I bought a 2nd one for a spare.
 very nice . got this am
 This mouse works very well with my old Mac Book.  The mouse on the Mac Book is having issues, so this mouse helps me navigate<br/>around the screen very well!
 Does the job at a reasonable price-----Thanks
 Absolutely amazing product! The dpi on this mouse isn't specified but is very high, no lag at all, and very ergonomically correct. Quality product by amazon.
 Great mouse and snappy looking too!
 This mouse is so cool. The only negative thing is that I always forget to turn it off! Is not the mouse's fault of couse. Overall this mouse shows to work perfectly fine, highlt recommended product.
 This is a really good mouse at a good price. It feels comfortable in your hand. I even accidentally dropped it in a cup of hot tea (yeah I know, how does that even happen?), and it still works perfect!
 works great
 simplistic and works great for the price
 I used this mouse for about a year and it worked fine. A couple months ago it started disconnecting randomly. Now I can't get it to connect for more than a couple of minutes. It is essentially useless.
 This is the second mouse i purchased. Its small, easy to use and has a little compartment to keep the USB when i'm not using it. Well worth the price!
 Works ok but could glide across pad a little better
 Great Product works great
 Great mouse.  Very responsive and super easy to use and great price.  I like how the dongle hides inside the battery area (but this is an adults-only design).  Not very child-friendly - thus 4 stars only.  My kids are notorious for breaking every battery cover of every remote in the house - that never needs to be touched.  Snap-fit outside may have been better.
 Good value wireless mouse. Solid feel, quiet buttons. The fast scroll switch in the scroll-wheel is very sensitive, requiring a light touch. Be warned.
 It stops working time to time, only re - plugging  helps. This is not because of low  battery charge, some other issue. Don't waste your money
 Simply said, it does the job, and is inexpensive.
 stopped working properly after 1 year of normal use, scroll up and down is not consistent, nano receive stop communicate to mouse and needs to unplug and plug it back multiple times in a day.
 Did not ever work properly and didn't last a year
 Easy operation and comfortable.
 Love that wireless mouse, easier than plug in!
 After about 2 weeks it stopped working. When I told Amazon about it I got a refund within a few hours. So 1 Star for the product and 5 star for the amazon service. I'll give it a 3 (taking average)
 Amazon Basics ---- Dont know who really makes their stuff but much like Kenmore.. There stuff goes and goes at a great price.<br/>Finally a mouse my daughter hasn't destroyed in a month.
 Really solid mouse at less than half the price of competing brands. I've previously had a Logitech mouse that I needed a replacement for and this mouse fulfilled my expectations and even raised the bar a bit.<br/><br/>AmazonBasics continues to amaze me!
 A marvelous &amp; inexpensive fix for finger fatigue.
 It's very easy to use. I like how simple it looks and feels. 2 Batteries came with it. You can put the USB inside of the mouse when you don't use it. Very convenient and I love it!
 Nice mouse and a great deal.
 Simple tool, does the job well.  There's nothing like going wireless with your mouse - if you've not done that yet, give it a try and you'll wonder how you ever got by with those pesky wires in your life.
 Works as expected.
 Not bad for the price.  Works just as well as the $15 Logitech wireless usb mice sold at Target.  Great add-on item if you're a non-prime user trying to get your order over $35 for free shipping.
 Worked well at first. Battery cover popped off a few times. Then after about 6 months just stopped working out of nowhere. You get what you pay for.
 The mini-USB wireless transmitter is not compatible with my docking station in office. It only works when I plug it directly into the USB port in my laptop. I also don't like the battery compartment - it is hard to install/remove batteries.
 Love this mouse! I'm glad I went with a amazon basic's product versus another brand. It glides very smoothly on any surface. This product works so well everyone in my office is now buying one!
 A bit heavy.
 Pretty good mouse, no problems with connecting it to my Raspberry Pi and for the price, you really cant beat this for a wireless mouse. Good quality, nothing fancy, just your basic mouse. Which was exactly what I needed.
 Mouse works well and has worked well from day one. Plug in the receiver to your USB port, turn on the mouse, get work done.  No issues whatsoever.  It's perfect for my small hands and feels comfortable when being used.  This one's a keeper.
 This mouse functioned fine but it is not a 'standard' mouse size. It's compact and very small. Ended up returning and purchasing a different mouse that was regular sized and more comfortable to use.
 I really like the mouse as it is very comfortable to use. I had to give it 3 stars because this is my second one since March. the first one stopped working. Hopefully this one will last a bit longer.
 After 6 years my previous mouse gave it up. I am glad I chose an Amazon mouse. works great
 I have had this mouse for a while, and I really like it! I have owned other affordable Bluetooth mouses as well, but this one is the best I have had so far. I have been using it for more than 6 months now, and I did not need to change the batteries yet! I also forget it to turn it off most of the times and still! Nice design, good size and comfortable to use. Highly recommended
 Works great.  No problems here
 Bought this because my toddler stole my $30 wireless mouse. Im very impressed at how well this mouse works. Its better than my old one!
 Battery didn’t stay in mouse at all
 it works fine
 I have had this for just about a year and i have yet to turn it off, so it is safe to say it will last battery wise. I also gave it some usual "around the house waer and tear" and it is still running. Great Product!
 Worked fine for about 3 months but now the pointer is erratic most of the time. The batteries are fine and I'm using the same mousepad I've used since I purchased the mouse. It's like the receiver is not working correctly.
 These mice are great.
 works great
 You really can't beat the value for this quality product.  There's nothing particularly special about it.  I was pleasantly surprised that batteries were included in the packaging.  Very portable (small), and contains all the basic features you'd expect from a wireless mouse.
 Perfect little wireless mouse. It's very responsive and the batteries that come with it last a LONG time which is nice!!
 I'm a geek. I'm terrible at touch pads. The nano receiver can be stored IN the mouse for portability. No special drivers needed. It's small size is great for smaller hands or a more comfortable "grip" if you will. The battery life appears to be long, it has an on/off switch on the bottom. Very pleased.
 great
 Good price and it works just fine.
 Works pretty good, especially on surfaces that other devices don't work well.
 It seems to be working well.
 Good while it lasted.  Bought 5/31 and by 8/1 not working well.  Went to take receiver out of usb port on computer, and the metal housing of the receiver came off, and stayed in the computer.  Had to use pliers to get the housing out, and receiver now useless.
 I've had the mouse since October 2015.  It was working fine until this past week (7 Months).  I replaced the batteries, checked the connection, and it just stopped working.  I had to buy a replacement.
 Perfect mouse. Compact and instantly connects to my PC. One thing I really like about it is that the USB goes into the bottom of the mouse under the cover so you won't ever lose it.
 Works like a charm! Has now been about a month on the original batteries, and we haven't had any problems with the mouse itself or connection.
 This has turned out to be quite a handy mouse that I keep at the house for a backup.<br/><br/>Its lightweight and was easily usable.
 totally 100% worth it.....
 I really like this mouse, it works great!
 Would buy again.
 Great Mouse!!! Really easy to use!
 I bought two of this for two different laptops. The mouse works right out of the box with either Mac or Windows laptop. If I have both mouses  turned on and connected to the laptops - they wouldn't interfere one with another
 Great mouse, feels great in the hand too.  UPDATE:  Mouse functioned for less than 2 months!  Changed from 5 stars to 1.  GARBAGE!
 I love this mouse! It is exactly what I needed. As soon as I plugged in the USB drive, Windows installed a driver and I was in business. It works well, and I especially appreciate the price
 Great mouse for the price.  Comes with batteries and appears to be good quality. Only complaint is the center wheel controls opposite of what I'm use to.  Roll down for scroll to the top of the page and visa versa.
 I use this with my laptop.  I do not like touch pad built into the laptop.  I use this whenever I can.  Works great and doesn't need a cord.<br/>I recommend it.
 The mouse worked great initially, but after a couple of weeks, a sort of delay began.  I will move the mouse device on the mouse pad, but the movement on the screen will pause.  Very frustrating.
 Great product and speedy delivery
 Sometimes, simple IS best!  No bells and whistles.  It does what it says.  It's small, wireless, comfortable.  And it works.  That's what I paid for.  That's what I got.  Amazon got it right.
 The design of the mouse is actually quite nice. The scroll wheel is smooth with just the right amount of clicking feedback. The texture of the mouse makes it easy to grip and control for many hours at a time. Unfortunately, the wireless connection is not stable. I used this mouse on a Windows 7 system for over a week, 8 hours a day.  The USB receiver was plugged into the back of the workstation about 20 inches away. I immediately noticed a difference in the smoothness of pointer control with this mouse compared to a corded optical mouse. I fine tuned the mouse settings in the control panel, however the precision remained distracting.  Many times through the day, the mouse pointer would quickly jiggle around on screen while the mouse was idle. This also occurred while using the mouse - the pointer skipping and jumping rather than smoothly tracking across the screen. I checked the cleanliness of the optical sensor, but it was fine.  It appears that cheap transmitters and receivers are used on this mouse which results in poor control.  Returning to my corded mouse was an immediate relief even though it is the inexpensive Amazon basics optical mouse. Mouse control was again smooth and responsive. If you will be using the mouse for anything detailed or for long stretches of time, it's not worth skimping on this wireless mouse. Get a high-end wireless mouse or use a corded mouse.
 Worked fine - but only last a couple of month and others describe the same experience with MULTIPLE purchases.  Its the Amazon basics model - should at least be a little reliable :/
 Would buy again. Works great!
 This mouse works great BUT it absolutely devours batteries.  I've had many wireless mice over the years and they all would last months without battery changes I guess because they have some ability to power down and go to sleep.  This thing has to have its batteries changed every month so long term, you're better off paying a little more for better quality.  I'm upgrading to a better mouse that won't die all the time.
 So far so good. I like the size. The roller in the middle is a bit tricky sometimes, but for $10, I'm not complaining.
 No complaints.  No problems
 Works well, beats insignia mouses (Like the one I used to have)
 Not bad, but batteries could have lasted longer.
 Stoped work , very disappointed.
 Easy transaction. Product as shown. Happy with the mouse works great.
 ok
 I remember trying the wired amazon basics mouse at my school's computer lab and I could not get over how great the material on the top of the mouse felt when I tested it out on my laptop. The mouse just feels great.  I ended up going with the wireless version because I like to plug into a monitor a lot and have my laptop off to the side and I felt that I could do that if I had a wireless version.
 Very good mouse, good price too. Works flawlessly with my Windows 7 notebook.
 After only two months owning this device, it stopped connecting to my computer. I would move the mouse and unplug/re-plug in the USP, and it would not work. I have tried replacing the batteries several times and reconnecting the device but nothing has worked.
 It stopped working after a year (I wasn't even using it on a regular basis). thought it was a battery issue and I replaced the batteries but it still doesn't work.
 Plain and simple. Works like and charm and the usb tab is small so I can leave it plugged in while transporting my laptop. No need to have a mouse pad either.
 Very pleased with this purchase. I use this as an additional mouse for my laptop and it works perfectly. Very simple to sync and was up and running in no time. It's very comfortable in the hand and a good size - not big and clumsy, but large enough to easily manipulate. Another great AmazonBasics product.
 Sticky button, jumpy cursor. I'd have rather have paid another few bucks for a Logitech or Microsoft mouse. Going in the trash, it's too cheap to bother shlepping back to the UPS store for a return.
 You can't beat the quality and price of this wireless mouse unit! Easy to install and feels solid. I  just installed the battery (that was provided BTW) and my computer did the rest. This mouse is very comparable to more expensive ones and I love it!
 It arrived quickly and was just what my wife wanted.
 So far so good.
 Very easy to maneuver and works well with my chromebook.
 Great Mouse - Great Price - Nothing fancy, just solid performance
 While touch pads are getting much better, it's still a good idea to carry an actual mouse around.<br/>This one I particular is what most people will need, it's reliable, easy to install and the quality is comparable with Logitech, of course it's just a basic mouse, but it's the best choice if that's all you need.
 Good to have a wireless mouse.
 I'm using it with a laptop, I hate that little finger pad that seems to be the norm nowadays. I leave the dongle in the computer all the time and it works great.
 broke in one week
 Great little bugger. Looks good and Feels right in the hand.  The connection was a breeze. Note that the USB tiny stick is inside the unit where the batteries should be.
 ok
 Loves it
 This mouse gets the job done! I use it at work, and the size is very convenient - not too small and definitely not too big. Happy with the quality and functionality.
 Like it. I have a similar one which I have been using for last 3 years. It still works fine.
 no complaints works great
 Very good, basic affordable wireless mouse. Not for gamers or power users though.
 My touch pad was failing on my lap top and this mouse saved the day!
 Small, compact.....works well....if you need two cursors on the screen this will do it....lol<br/>I don't know about battery life yet but so far so good.  Might be a good choice for small hands.<br/>Don't forget to look in the battery compartment for the receiver it is easy to overlook ...stuck between the batteries.
 I bought this for my son's Acer chromebook.  The mouse works great as soon as you connect it.  My 6th grader is very happy with this device and it was compatible with chromebook.  Highgly recommended and you can't beat Amazon price.
 Everything was ok
 Had a problem with the battery compartment not staying shut when i put batteries in.  Then it started to turn off randomly.  not impressed.
 I never read any review about this item,but I always had a good deal with Amazon basics,it was just a quick plug in of the little USB device,and it self loaded and mouse was working right away,so no problems here I am well pleased with the mouse.
 It's a two button mouse.  High quality.  Works great.
 Does not work too far away from the monitor
 Nice and pretty
 Bought for a friend.
 Right price and best mouse I had in a while
 I love amazon basic products. I can always trust that they are going to be high quality and backed by a great warranty.  This mouse proved the same thing.
 great little mouse
 I don't like using touch pads on laptops so this is a must have. Since it's wireless, it fits the bill very well.
 Title says it all. It's cheap but worked just fine when it wasn't broken. The usb that connected to the PC just fell apart.
 Works great, simple set up, great battery life. Only complaint is that the little pull ribbon to pop the batteries out might be difficult to use and to insert back when replacing batteries if you aren't agile with your fingers. Might not be the best option if the person who will be replacing the batteries has arthritis or whose vision isn't great.
 This mouse is just right for the price. I haven't had any issues with it. The roller has a soft click that feels good when scrolling.
 Great mouse, works just like the ones that cost twice as much.
 Easy install, works nicely.<br/>Nice that it has an on/off switch on the underside so that the battery life can be extended when not in use.
 Love my product
 I purchased this mouse for my husband to use when he uses our laptop as he really dislikes using the built-in mouse pad on the laptop.  It works really well and is responsive to movement, doesn't seem to get stuck or jump around. Works as well as other mouse options from other brands I have purchased in the past.
 Not sure why, but my wheel is wonkie on this mouse. On some pages it works sluggishly, others not at all. It's real annoying and all adjustments do not fix this problem.
 UPDATED: I've purchased three of these. Each one has last between 13-15 months.They are good while they work.<br/><br/>Nice small mouse.  Nano receiver is a little larger than the other nano receivers I have but it is still small.  Great mouse for the price.
 Inexpensive, had it since April, no problems works fine.  First set of batteries still so no problems with battery life.  It is a compact mouse so I don't get the "it's small" comments.
 This mouse is garbage. Don't waste your money. I'm on my first replacement and this one cut out in me to. They both lasted about two months and stopped working.
 everything i ever wanted and more
 Love this mouse, does exactly what I need it to. Love the satisfying click of the roller. I bought a second to use on another computer! At this price point you can't buy better!
 Recognized by my Windows 10 laptop as a "wireless device". No tech support for the product! Only option is  a replacement because, "it's Plug &amp; Play so it should just work". I'm not expecting a lot for a low price but I do expect a mouse to be recognized as a mouse!
 Great deal for a wireless mouse. Very happy with the qualify and performance.
 Installed its own small software within seconds. Mouse is smooth, works on many surfaces, and scroll wheel is silent, clicks are normal and firm. Great product for price. Running on windows 7
 It's a mouse, it does what a mouse is supposed to do. Only thing I've realized is that this thing goes through batteries very fast compared to my other wireless mice.
 What can you say ?<br/>Its Amazon basics .<br/><br/>Simple and good value mouse if you're on a budget.<br/>Cheap but good quality :)<br/>Of course it doesn't come with all the extra features of a gaming mouse or something.<br/>But if you're looking for a basic mouse. This the way to go!
 I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger, but I like it. I love smooth texture on the surface of the mouse. It's very sauce. It won't take too much space in a backpack and it is really responsive. I use it on my mac. It serves its purpose of right-left-clicking and scrolling.
 If you're in the market for a wireless mouse this is a good one. Works as expected.. A little small for my hands. I mostly use a big Logitech that is rechargeable. When its' on the charger I use the Amazon. The Amazon is a great buy. The Logitech (mine) is big bucks and suitable for long hours of computer work in one stretch.
 Its a mouse
 Work great!
 Good stuff!
 I was looking for a cheap wireless mouse to use with my laptop on the occasions I use computer software like CAD. Although it's not nearly as nice as a Logitech, it definitely works seamless and gets the job done for a 1/3 of the price. Some people have been saying that it's too small but I have small hands and was looking for something mobile to carry in my backpack.
 This is a good mouse.  Fits well in the hand and performs well.  My only gripe is the battery usage.  I have had this mouse for almost 4 months (used only in the office so 8-9hrs per day) and have replaced the batteries 3 times already.  In contrast I have a Logitech mouse that required battery changing once a year.  It seems as though the optical part of this mouse never turns off.
 it works fine. never used for gaming.
 I like it - nice and slim. No more missed clicks
 This mouse is a winner! I liked the way it is constructed, how it is designed, how it feels, and how it performs.  What really impresses me is how quickly it connects to either of my laptops. Best mouse of this type I have ever owned.
 I love this mouse! Nothing fancy, but unless you're willing to spend $60+ on a mouse, this is as good as it's going to get.
 Quality and look of mouse is good. Was initially impressed when opening for first time. The design is a little off, though. The mouse wobbles slightly on a hard flat surface. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you're planning to use a mouse every day for 8 hours or more, it's annoying. A mouse should be a precise instrument.
 Nice, simple, ergonomic, works great, and great price, what's not to love?
 Not compatible with Win 10
 Stopped working within 3 weeks?!? I got this to replace a mouse that was leaking battery acid. Turns out it was a better purchase.  This item randomly quit working and I missed the return date buy 2 days! Avoid this product!
 This may be a good value for PC owners, but not for Mac owners. I hooked it up to a late 2012 Mac Mini running Sierra. It worked fine for a week or so. Then, the cursor behaved erratically. It would stick in place after I moved the mouse and then dart to some random location. Read: unusable.<br/><br/>This seems to be a Mac issue, not an Amazon Basics issue. I replaced this mouse with a more expensive Logitech wireless model, and the same thing happened. When I searched online for help, I found many accounts of people having problems with non-Apple wireless mice on Macs. I bought a corded Logitech model, and it works perfectly on my Mini. I'll give this one to a friend with a PC.
 Unfortunately, the product arrived damaged - one of the metal prongs that keeps a battery in place was broken.
 I was pleasantly surprised on how nice the mouse was for the price. I usually pick up a logitech or microsoft wireless mouse for about $15-$20 but figured i'd give this a try. I would say it's the same or better quality as those brands.
 no problems. still working  two months later
 works great
 Exactly as advertised. Works perfectly with my 2010 macbook pro. Looks sleek and is easy to use.
 Love the versatility of this wireless mouse and being able to use it without getting tangled up in a cord.
 this wireless mouse is great, I have had it for over a year now and it is still working like a champ.
 Great basic mouse. I bought 2 of these for people in the office and they love them, they like the soft touch coating and the quality construction. Once again Amazon proves that their "Basics" are better than a lot of companies standard products. I will be buying more of these.
 Works as expected.
 A Nice basic wireless mouse. although with my big hands it could be a little bit bigger, But it works fine.
 Works as advertised.  Best performance though would be to shut it off when not in use to save on the battery life.
 No-frills but very good mouse from the AmazonBasics line - has a micro-USB input, and is very ergonomic.  Zen in its simplicity - i've had mine for about a month and a half, and love it.
 I absolutely love this mouse. I've purchased about four of them to share with my family and use with my different computers. They're responsive, slick, and comfortable in my hand. Way better than getting carpal tunnel by constantly using a laptop's touch pad.
 Small dongle (identical size to logitech receivers), good for work use. Not so great for games that require quick movements (LoL, FPSs). Slightly small for my hand, it hurts my wrist after a few hours on it not having a rest. Overall good product.
 It's not the most accurate mouse, but it's hard to complain when it's just so cheap. It doesn't feel cheap at all, though, which is definitely a plus.<br/><br/>Would I use it for, say, gaming or photo editing? No. But this mouse more than suffices for browsing the web and clicking on links, etc.
 Easy install, works great. I like how the USB wireless connector stores inside the battery compartment so that it doesn't get lost.
 works; no problems.
 What could be more fundamental than L-R &amp; wheel on a mouse?  And they work.  Don't ask for more because it isn't there.
 No matter what I did to get it to work....it did not, so I returned it for a refund
 Received the mouse, installed batteries and began using it immediately. Works as advertised and on any surface tried to date. My job requires travel so sometimes any spot available is used and it has performed flawlessly to date!
 This is my second one and am keeping it as a back-up since I couldn't get another w/o a mouse.  Such an improvement over corded "mice".
 I needed a new mouse (obviously) that WASN'T a Mac mouse. I can't use those trackpad things because I have limited flexibility in my hands. This mouse was better than I could have hoped for. It's a nice small size but it scrolls VERY nicely and I love the dual-button accessibility. Great for those who can't stand Mac trackpads or weird mouses that have no distinguishable buttons and have to use your fingers to swipe along the top of the mouse.
 Comfortable in the hand, easy to use, travels smoothly across the mouse pad. Uses AAA batteries.
 Works fine
 works well.  Held up for 4 months.<br/><br/>Only ding is that the battery only lasted 3 months for me.  Usually, I feel I get 6-12 months of battery usage on these wireless mice.
 works great!!!!
 This is a great deal for a basic mouse. It came with batteries included even. The feel of it is nice, it's a non-slip kind of coating on it, and it works great with my computer.
 Firstz don't buy it. Waste money and hurt your finger. Too small to hold it . The material of this mouse is very cheap. After ine day usage, the left button is broken.
 Good wireless mouse for the price.
 I've got a fairly large hand and although this mouse is small, it feels comfortable. Its not too large nor small. Plus, its got a convenient storage location for the USB (so maybe I won't lose it). All in all, great product for a great price!
 great product
 I use this mouse every day and have not had any issues. I would buy it again!
 Basic wireless mouse that automatically synchs with your laptop. I use rechargeable batteries in it with no issues. Worth the money to me.
 Easy to connect to my laptop, and is pretty smooth when using it.
 Basic mouse gets the job done. After you adjust the mouse sensitivity in the control panel this thing is a god send for laptops.
 I just received the mouse and I love it.  It's easy to use and I really like the size of it.  It's smaller than any other mouse I've had, it's perfect.
 For a laptop user, the trackpad is OK when mobile or for light duty.  For day-2-day, the seperate mouse is a must to avoid wrist damage.  This is cheap, works perfectly and takes regular batteries.  The USB stub is tiny, and fits inside the mouse for travel purposes, which means you should not lose it.
 good mouse durable
 Great purchase and good price. Was a birthday gift for my son to use with his chrome book.
 It lasted for a while but the optical sensor seems to have crapped out so now it is useless.
 Works great, easy to use. My 11 year old set it up in minutes.
 Seems to compare pretty well with other brands, but at a very good price. If you are looking for an inexpensive computer mouse this is a good option. Works with windows 8. Only reason it doesn't get full stars is because it took 10 days to arrive, don't know how it can take that long, but that is very poor from Amazon.
 Ok have not used it for a year yet.
 Bought as part of a gift for my grandson.  He says the computer, carrying case and mouse are the perfect setup for him.  Thanks for the great service.
 Perfect for my laptop bag and a great price.
 I would prefer a longer mouse, but the rubber part of the wheel is better than the Microsoft Mouse and should last longer.
 It works fine
 Super!
 Just right for small hands...<br/>.
 The mouse needs to be manually turned off!  I've never owned a wireless remote that required that.  How many times do you think the batteries will need to replaced because you forget to turn it off???????
 Works great! I had no issues at all. All you need to do is put the batteries in, plug the little usb connecter into your computer, turn the mouse on and bam, done.
 The mouse does what is is supposed to do, is simple to use, and the onboard storage for the Nano receiver makes it great for travelling, which is why I got it.<br/><br/>Using it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop, and have no complaints at all.
 once the back piece is opened it doesn't stay in tightly any longer. I am just not impressed with the quality of this mouse at all.
 not as small as I would have liked. The receiver is Nano te mouse certainly is not.
 So convenient. I bought this to use with laptop playing Amazon or Netflix across the room. It has 20 feet of range at least.  Just remember to turn off after use to save batteries.
 Great product.  Love the small size, easy to set up.
 doesn't connect to my old mac
 Works great and battery lasts long
 perfect size and good battery life
 The unit is a simple but effective and inexpensive replacement for an old mouse that worked. This is just the same simple but effective mouse. Does the job, smooth movement and easy to position. What else is a mouse supposed to do ?
 Working flawlessly so far. I love all Amazon Basic products, they always work for me.
 What's not to love about a cheap simple straight up mouse?!  No need to go name brand, stick with Amazon... you won't be disappointed.  If you aren't trying to do anything fancy or computer gaming, this is the mouse for you!
 worked fine but has since died - think it made it around 6 months - used it on my work laptop so 9-5 use every week day - it was a mouse with buttons that did mouse stuff
 Battery cover repeatedly falls off easily and I keep losing my inserted battery and/or phob . I have had to stop using this mouse, Cute but useless.
 This is a great mouse. I ended up getting two of them so I could keep one in my briefcase for travel or working at Starbucks.  They are really great!
 Was an exact replacement and it works fine.
 Does not work very well. Feels like an old school mouse when the roll (that rotated with the ball) was dirty and stuck.
 Great replacement
 Good range.
 Now this is annoying.  I bought this abut three  months ago and it worked just fine. Then two days ago it just quit.  I tried the on -off button in the back and that kicked it on. unfortunately that only lasted a day.  I suppose I need new batteries. But for the price of those I can buy another mouse. what a pain.
 For some reason it won't work properly If u are even 2 feet away from the USB piece that goes into the computer ...extremely not happy with it. Stopped using it cause it would just stop disappear and come back then have terrible lag.
 Overall a great value.  The only complaint I have is it isn't quite as sensitive on some surfaces as my previous mouse, but it still works well and has a long battery life.  Good product at a great price.
 This is the worst mouse, cheap, poor quality. The lid for batteries doesn't close, the plastic inside doesn't fit right, just crap.
 Worked fine at first but after a couple weeks the wireless connection was inconsistent and I'd have to turn it off and turn it back on. But now it barely works and I think the sensor in the back is the problem.
 Super little mouse!
 Works for me, and love the color.
 MUCH smaller than it looks. All I want in this world is a wireless replacement for my 90's style Microsoft mouse. I thought this would be it, but it isn't. It's much too small for my hand.
 It works. But usability isn't great—but for the price it's what you'd expect. The scroll wheel movement is clunky. I also don't like that it takes up another usb port.
 I had great trouble with this mouse. For me it was Terrible, no accuracy, difficulty using, have to slide mouse over and over to get it to move on the screen.
 I bought it on Sep 5th, it is dead now. Newer batteries don't make it work. Only worked for 3 months. I used it daily just like the previous one. Never buy it
 Use this when I travel or at Starbucks.  Works great and makes navigating through WIndows, Photoshop and the web much easier than with the built-in laptop trackpad  Small enough to be portable, but not so small as to feel awkward in my hand.
 Do not purchase! It works for a couple of months and then the nano receiver stops working. I asked for a replacement, and they were quick to replace. But the replacement stops working after a few month as well. Go for it if you plan to buy a new one every two months. That's just not me!
 This mouse worked great for the first two weeks or so, then it stopped connecting consistently. Now It rarely connects even though everything seems to be working. I recommend buying another wireless mouse.
 The mouse feels great in hand. But when I try to put batteries in and get it working. The mouse doesn't turn on. I was very disappointed. So I tried putting new sets of batteries in. Still doesn't work.
 This mouse eats batteries. I've replaced them twice in less that 2 months.
 Even if the total distance is less then 5 feet, the signal just doesn't make it through drywall.  Works well as long as your within eye sight and within 8 feet.  It does work on the QSee QC DVR, just be mindful of objects and distance.  I wont be able to use it on mine, seems to work ok when I moved it to my laptop though.  No special drivers needed.
 This mouse works great as a travel mouse.  I don't use this on a daily basis, but from my experience using this while I travel it's been just fine.  No issues with it disconnecting or sensitivity.  It's also durable... I know this because I've dropped it 2-3 times from desk level.
 So simple a child could hook this up. Works great and looks great
 Great mouse. I like the on/off switch to save battery life.
 I love the color and it works great on my touch computer.
 Could not get that to work
 Just your standard mouse. Its super small and not really any good for long time use. I keep this mouse by my bedside, so I can watch Netflix from bed lol.<br/>You wouldn't really want to buy this as an everyday use kind of mouse
 Grandson don't use this with his laptop but I have on mine and it works wonderfully.
 i thought i would not like the manual on/off but it grew on me.
 Fits perfect in my hand!
 I use this product in my office and it works great. Good range, good battery life. The only critiques I have is that the matte finish wears off and it does not stay connected to the receiver. Good starter mouse.
 I would give it 4 stars if it had automatic shut off. Just be sure to turn off the switch every night.
 Day 2 and loving it! Easy to install and use. The easy start guide could have indicated something about the weird plastic piece in the battery compartment though. But other than that, the mouse works great and frees me of those pesky wires!!!
 An inexpensive mouse that doesn't feel cheap
 This mouse DOES NOT work with WINDOWS 10. I want to return it for a refund, but it's not worth it. Will cost over $8.00 to send it back and it originally cost $9.99....guess I'm stuck with it.
 It's precise, accurate, comfortable, plug it in and its done installing. I enjoy this mouse lol. I've never said that about a mouse before.
 Works great with my macbook. Good timed responses between mouse and macbook.
 Had been using a wired mouse and decided to switch so that I could access my computer from a greater distance than I'd been used to. Fits my needs perfectly.
 This product arrived on time and in good condition.  I purchased this mouse for my 68-year-old mother who was able to install it with no problem.  She has no issues with it and continues to use it everyday
 Neat unit - I like how it stores this USB responder in the battery compartment.
 I was surprised by the quality. It's easy to install, just plug and play!
 It's convenient to use as your second mouse. It doesn't have omni-directional scrolling, but the usb receiver is tiny. I only use this as my secondary mouse.
 So useful for my laptop. Its small and easy to travel with. I usually turn it off after use to conserve the battery.
 as its name its basic....but it gets the job done...if you are not looking for a gaming mouse and just for a wireless daily usage mouse this is prefect.
 It's okay. Not really exact, like no one should ever game with this mouse. But that is not its intention. It would work perfectly for everyday office work or browsing. Overall, three stars.
 The mouse has good ergonomics and has a great range. However, it started acting up within 9 months of getting it.<br/><br/>Now, it has problems connecting to my computer and Windows cannot recognize it.
 I bought 3 of them in a row. I first bought one, was very happy. Bought second one and just now bought the third one. Very good size, smooth scrolling, great look. Great value for the price. Its been 4,5 months since I bought the first one and don't see any issues.
 I was looking for a super basic (no pun intended) wireless mouse, and this has been perfect for that purpose. It only has the right/left click and a scroll, but that was all I needed. What really sold me, though, is that I bought this mouse months ago, and I still haven't needed to change the battery.
 Awesome product! Works better than the expensive brand name ones. It's easy to use and the batteries haven't been drained out of it for the past 2 months and I use it a lot for my classes
 Works great, once your finally figure out how to put the batteries in...
 Decent basic mouse at a reasonable price.  For a bit more, though, other mice are noticeably better.
 Simple, minimalistic, the battery lasts for a long time. Definitely great choice for those of you who just want a mouse. Not fancy but does the jon perfectly. And looks smart too.
 It is small and fits nicely in the hand. It works for my son. It does what it's suppose to without any issues. I liked it so much I ordered one for myself too!
 Easy to install, fits well to hand, tracks great, has an on/off switch. Love it! Awesome price.
 Pros, small and easy, works on most surfaces.<br/><br/>Con, the click is a bit loud. I use it when no one is around because its still a soft an amazing sound. Not conducive for quit settings.
 Well built! Nice features, and fits well in the hand.
 WORKS GREAT SO FAR. REACTION TIME APPEARS A LOT QUICKER THAN A CORDED MOUSE, WHICH IS GREAT. NOT SURE AT THIS POINT WHY YOU WOULD BUY A CORD MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.
 Love it. Simple and not too expensive. Just what I need for day to day things
 Very good mouse. Good response, high quality material and texture, convenient for travel.
 Works great, feels great in the hand. No complaints.
 Excellent and simple mouse. Bought two of them since they are so awesome. Easy to use and well priced.
 Nice mouse.  The only thing that is a little odd is that when it is on a flat surface it kind of rocks from back to front slightly.  Nothing for me to be concerned about.  So far so good.
 Works great
 It does not work for Windows 10.
 Great price. Exactly what I needed.
 This is a gift
 Loved it, although suddenly it will not work with my laptop, although I have a feeling it's the laptop not the mouse.
 Bought one in April 10th 2014. Now the left click doesn't work so I had to order a new one. Different brand though coz I believe a mouse should live longer!
 It works and at a great price!  Amazon rules!
 Perfect for what I needed. Plug and play.
 Poor quality.  After only one day, the USB adaptor's plug came off from the case.  So I can not pull the whole thing out of the USB slot.  The metal part stays inside the slot.  The mouse still works, but the adaptor is stuck with one computer.
 Its cheap, but some of the parts break in 12-24 months. Maybe thats what is expected, but for a few more dollars you can get better
 This device works very good, I just plug it and it begins to work instantly,<br/>I have it working with Windows 8, Windows 7  Windows XP Linux and Mac  it even works with a raspberry Pi<br/><br/>No issues whatsoever
 Great mouse! No latency and easy setup.
 I tossed this out and bought another one at Staples.  My mouse pad was a little darker color and for some reason this would not work on the mouse pad.  On a white piece of paper it worked ok.
 My daughter loves this mouse
 Very good.
 The mouse works great!  I don't know why anyone would spend more money for something else.
 The first Amazon basic mouse I bought worked fine, mostly as my travel mouse (for business meetings and trips), but suddenly stopped working after 2 years (probably 60 days usage total). The LED comes on but it doesn't work. I put in new batteries, reconnected, etc., all to no avail.  My second Amazon basic mouse is still going strong after 5 months, but I'm seriously considering replacing the dead one with another brand.
 I use it everyday, I bought because my laptop is the kind you tap and scroll with your finger. I didn't like that so now it has a mouse that works great.
 I'd give this wireless mouse 2.5 stars.  It work's fine when plugged in directly.  Unlike my other mice, the pointer jumps all over the screen when plugged in via IOGEAR KVM GCS932UB.  As such, I can't use it.  Amazon has promised a refund within 3 days.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you don't use a KVM (or don't even know what  a KVM is), it could be a nice bargain for you.  If you use a KVM, don't try this one.
 Great. Reliable and well made.
 My mouse came without a nano reciever. Not happy! Now I have to return it!
 Works great hubby loved it
 Perfect!
 Bought to replace a dead Logitech VX Nano, which is out of production.  The Amazon mouse is certainly a step down from the VX Nano, lacking some of the solid feel, the laser tracking, and the quick-scroll wheel.  That said, for the price, it certainly exceeded my expectations.  It has a good quality feel, connects easily, and tracks well.  If you are looking for a high-end portable mouse, go with a Logitech.  But if you are looking for a really cheap but very capable mouse for occasional use with a laptop, this is a perfect fit.
 still using it.  for $6 wtf?
 One of the rubber pads on my mouse wasn't lined up perfectly when glued. It kind of stuck off to the side a bit and made it really hard to close the battery pack. But other than that it works great on my macbook pro.
 Plugged it in, and it instantly loaded the software and started working. No fuss no muss and no high price.  Nothing to complain about for the price.
 This mouse has been wonderful, just plug in the very small receiver into the usb, turn the mouse on and away we go!  No problems whatsoever, and there's no complaint about the price, very reasonable indeed.
 Its been four months. There has not been a moment where it occurred to me "my life might be better if I got something different".<br/><br/>Just thinking about other things, you know? Smooth handling, no problems.
 Mouse has been great. Plug in and go. No issues with any sync or anything. Very comfortable in the hand and the grip is nice.
 Great little wireless mouse. I use it every single day and meets my every needs for travel and at home. Its got a small usb receiver and it can be tucked into the battery compartment for travel.
 This thing is amazing! The price combined with total functionality make it the perfect companion to any laptop or even desktop computer. It responds quickly, has never frozen up, and so far has had a great battery life. Definitely recommend to all.
 I use it on a laptop and 2 in 1 because I don't like touchpads.
 Great Cheap mouse, and the battery life is really, really long! Still on the original set of batteries!  Love the mouse and doesn't feel cheap at all.
 works perfectly
 I keep forgetting to turn it off and the batteries are still going strong. Really sensitive and the storage compartment is very convenient.
 This product isn't cheap, it's affordable. Great basic mouse for everyday use. Really responsive and fits my hands well.
 I prefer this simple 3-button design to most competitors that have 3 extra unnecessary buttons that get in the way.
 Good mouse. Holds up to time. No need to purchase anything more expensive.
 Great wireless mouse.  my second and both work great.  good battery I sometimes forget to turn of overnight and 1st one is still going strong expect same for #2
 Best features I like about this mouse are the on/off switch and that you can tuck away the USB receiver into the mouse itself. This mouse certainly has that clickety sound. Some folks may find it annoying. But I don't care as this mouse really works great.
 works well with note book
 Bought this mouse about 18 months ago. It worked well initially, but now does not hold a connection to the blue-tooth port. It will, frustratingly, connect for a minute or so and then lose connection again. Amazon stuck by their product and resolved my issue, so I guess the only downside is wasted materials after a year and a half.
 Very good.
 It worked well for 6 weeks. I got my money back and went to town and bought a new one.
 Easier to use.
 The mouse works great but after a few months it stopped working on me. I emailed Amazon about it and they sent me another one for free but now this one is doing the exact same thing.
 If you don't have it on a completely flat, untextured surface, it'll fritz out at random times to the point where you can't even use it.
 Can't be beat for a basic mouse @ this price level.
 perfect for me
 This mouse worked great until I dropped just once which destroyed the mouse.  Certainly one should be able to drop a mouse once.  It was too late to return it, so lost the money.
 Good mouse. Easy to forget to turn off, which can make the batteries die fairly quick, but aside from that it is quite and operates smoothly.
 Nothing fancy but a wireless mouse that works.
 It's wonderful. It maybe too small for some big hands but perfect for me. Love the texture too.
 Arrived fast and is as expected.
 got used to a wireless mouse for work and wanted one to use at home. the price on this was just right and it works great!
 Simple bargain--works fine.  I still don't know if mouse turns off after some inactivity--so far I've just been turning it off at the end of the day.  If it doesn't turn off to save on battery, I'd be a little less happy.
 This mouse is great and good quality for the price.
 You can't beat the price or performance with this.  Great design for the Bluetooth adapter too.
 Worth the purchase!!
 This mouse stopped functioning in less than 60 days. Tried on multiple computers. Very disappointing. Wish there was a way to return it but apparently it is too late.
 great little mouse-i like that the receiver thumb/usb plug stores in the mouse if you wnat to pack up and take it with you. Liked it so much bought the hubby one for his laptop. it also has a really nice rubbery grip feel so its not a slick feel in your hand.
 Great product. Would purchase agin.
 Don't bother, just spend more and get a mouse that actually works
 meets great standards. Not really sure how far the signal can go. In performance it is great. Pretty basic, it does what it's supose to do and very easy to hook.up. still takes one USB slot but thats okay and comes with batteries so yeah. Not much experience with battery power but should last long. Not much else to say but if you have questions feel free to ask me.
 Works good! I was worried it would be too small but it is not bad
 for the price, great deal and works well.
 Excellent worth every penny spent!  Will Buy again..... for sure, if there is a need.
 This works perfectly, and for me it's a great size for my hand and my small desk.
 Love it
 Great inexpensive mouse. It's small so a perfect travel mouse (uses 2 AAA batteries). Perfectly fine for desktop as well. Receiver USB plugs inside requiring you to open the battery compartment, very small nit. Would purchase again.
 It gets the job done. Very standard wireless USB mouse. It's good for using with a laptop on the go, but if it's for home use I would definitely recommend getting a full sized mouse.
 Works just fine.  Four stars because it's easily packable (which I wanted).  Not five stars because I "assume" it's not as ergonomically-correct as a somewhat larger mouse.
 I was worried when I saw the word "nano" that the mouse might not be a full size mouse and be too small for me. It's just the right size.  But make sure that after you open the packaging you don't throw it away before getting the 2 batteries out of the box.  They are affixed inside the box where you can not see them and I had to go surf the box out of the trash to get the batteries out of the box.  They are hiding in there.
 Good value for a wireless mouse. Very portable and lightweight. I like the grippy texture that gives it a good feel while using it.
 My wireless Logitech M510 mouse (from Amazon) died after 5 years so I looked for a couple of replacements wanting to have backup.<br/><br/>This week I bought 2 new from Amazon, one works and the other I had to return – AmazonBasics @ $13.99 &amp; Victsing  MM057 @ $10.99.<br/><br/>The Victsing MM057 I tried first and it worked fine during for a couple of hours – then the cursor image froze on my screen and I couldn’t resolve it to navigate.  I did a cold shut-down, waited and rebooted – no cursor.  I unplugged/replugged the nano USB and tried different USP ports – nope.  This mouse has many reviews, most very positive but some of the negatives report a similar mouse freeze.  I contacted Amazon for refund – easy.<br/><br/>The AmazonBasics is working without issue – thus far - and I have now reordered a second unit for backup.  My first color was what appears on my screen to be Royal Blue, but on delivery was a very dark blue shade making it harder to see on the desk, especially on a black mouse pad.  It is smaller in footprint than either my Logitech or the Victsing, but not uncomfortable.  The Victsing had a sleep function to save battery life and the AmazonBasics does not rather a manual on/off switch underneath.<br/><br/>The backup AmazonBasics I ordered today is silver as I prefer brighter colors that are harder to leave behind when traveling or misplace using around the house on darker surfaces.<br/><br/>My Logitech served me well, no complaints.  The Victsing by reviews is a very reliable unit, it sounds like mine was an outlier.  AmazonBasics is fine so far and I purchased because it was Amazon recommended and my experience with Amazon is very trustworthy.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.
 Great mouse for packing and taking on the road.  Smaller, but not mini.  Dongle stores inside the bottom, with the batteries. Less chance of falling off and becoming lost, during travel.
 Its a very basic wireless mouse and it will do what its supposed to, the one thing I liked about this was the nano receiver is inside the battery compartment so it will never get misplaced.
 Works well.
 Bought one May 13th.  2 months later it no longer works and I am unable to return it.  The contacts in the mouse are not maintaining connection with the batteries.  It worked great up until I cannot get power to the mouse.  Sad that Amazon will not replace a simple mouse when I bought their brand on purpose.
 This mouse has been great. We were sick of the apple mouse. This has been a fantastic low cost alternative
 Not as good as the ergonomic one
 It's okay.
 it is a very small mouse if you dont have really small hands. it works perfect, comes with 2 AAA batteries. just like any other amazon basic product this one is well built too.
 good mouse, works great and worth the price!
 Good price. Clicks on things just as good as any other mouse.
 Always works great
 Works, basic
 Excelente.  Funciona muy bien y es muy comodo usarlo
 Previously had a bluetooth mouse and dongle. But the mouse would cut in and out. Tried this as a replacement and it works great! No cutting out and this mouse stores the receiver for travel so I don't lose it when traveling.
 This is the best small wireless laptop mouse that I've seen.  It really exceeded my expectations and my wife loves it.
 Mouse stopped working after a day or two. contacted Amazon and they sent out another only to get the same problem. It seemed nice while it lasted but i would avoid it.
 Love this mouse. At the beginning I thought that it could be too small but instead it is very comfortable. Of course, amazon things. I am in love with this mouse and my new mousepad.
 This is my second Amazon Basic wireless mouse.  It is small enough to pack both in my laptop bag and in the Chrombook Amazon Basics 11.6 case.  Great quality, fits well and it works - the first one has had much use and is still as good as new.
 This mouse is a good, compact size and works great. 4 stars because I bought one of these a few months ago and the USB stick broke and got stuck in the USB port. Fortunately, this new one seems to be holding up so far...
 Nothing special, just a decent wireless mouse for a decent price.
 I love this mouse, I bought 2 (one for each laptop), I had to do so because the nano receiver broke inside my laptop so I can't remove it without pliers. Even tho it's broken (and stuck in my laptop) it still works so its all good. I was surprised that that happened.
 Easy set up.  Very sleek, fits nicely in my hand.  Great product for the price!<br/>The on/off button is better than others I have had.
 Had this for at least a year now.  Stays on 24/7 and only had to replace batteries 2 times.  Does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Would buy again if I had to.
 works great
 It's cheap and it's good :)
 it works very smoothly, you get the feeling works identically to a wired mouse in every way (minus the cable)
 Works perfectly right out of the box with Windows 10 PC. No setup just plug and play.
 Very good quality.
 Worked well with laptop. No issues and the battyer lasts forever! My son uses it constantly so that is a plus. Very happy with it.
 Great value &amp; well made<br/>Highly recommend.<br/>Can't go wrong with Amazon's best customer service!<br/>SAN
 So easy to install and use! Can't believe how I ever did without it!<br/>Speedy delivery- would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!
 Plugged it in, five minutes after use my computer crashed and have not been able to load my desktop since!!!
 Sleek and simple. Comes with batteries and internally storable small USB link. Setup and use was straightforward - just put in batteries, connect USB receiver, and mouse is active. No special skills needed. Just worked (used on ASUS PC running Windows 10).
 I really like this mouse. I like the feel in my hand. So far I am on the first set of batteries, seems like others I have had go through batteries like crazy. It in inexpensive, but better quality than other cheap mouses or is it mice?
 The center button is too sensitive and it keeps getting pressed accidentally.  The lightest touch will activate the center button function.
 sometimes the pointer jumps around. if you touch the mouse again it will resolve the problem. try changing the batteries but the problem persists​<br/>when it works, works perfectly.
 Works better than expected for the price.  It even works on an all white desk where I've had problems with other optical mice in the past. Will buy again!
 Mouse was inexpensive, works well and easy to hook up.
 The USB adapter is small and very low profile. The mouse feels *great* in my hands. As with other "AmazonBasics" products I've bought, this is a solid-quality, low-price, no-frills product that fits the bill perfectly.
 NO PROBLEMS
 Needed a wireless mouse for the office, good price (prime day).
 My screen rolls until I hit the left key to "lock", stop rolling screen. Unit has been doing it a lot for weeks. I plugged in my old wired mouse and no issues. Is there a guarantee on this mouse?
 Good mouse for $12. You can't ask more on this price. The mouse feel really good in your hand. I just don't like that you have to open the battery cap to get the connector.
 I've owned this product for about a month and after a few uses I lost connection between the mouse and the nano receiver. I attempted to unplug the nano receiver from the USB port and the metal shell separated from the receiver becoming lodged in the port. Issued a refund, but now I have to ship my laptop back to the manufacturer to remove this piece.
 This is a great product for a great price. Installation was easy just plug in the wireless device and wait five to 7 minutes while it automatically installs the software, no need to download drivers or anything! The wireless piece fits neatly inside the mouse which is great. The mouse and scroll bar feel very fluid and it is a nice small size.  No complaints here :)
 Product is great!  I wanted an inexpensive, wireless mouse and this fits the bill.  I was actually surprised at the quality.  It is far sturdier than I expected and much more so than the cheap wired mouse I had been using.  As soon as I turned on the mouse (after inserting the batteries and the USB wireless receiver) it immediately worked!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
 Very short range, may be good for use with a laptop but it misreads only 3 ft away. Scrolls are sloppy and exaggerated, precision is out of the question. Wouldn't recommend for gaming or anything other than as a laptop mouse.
 Its very basic. But it works. My old one quit working. This one works good. One thing it has that Ive not seen in other blue tooth mice, an on-off switch. I guess if I could remember to use it, I could save on batteries.
 I love the small USB "transmitter"!  Great for leaving in place all the time without having to worry about hitting the USB insert and breaking it.  The one/off switch is a little hard to get to but still very usable.
 This is a very failed purchase. The mouse is very insensitive and the cursor often runs around.
 Easy to install and worked great immediately.
 no complaints, it came with batteries and once i turned it on and plugged it in  to all 3 of my computers they found it right away, and it works great its made nice and looks great, great deal for the price
 A true lifesaver! Can't beat the value of amazon basics. This little mouse delivers and it was priced right. Highly recommend.<br/><br/>Usage: Day Spa
 work great and comfortable. deducted star because it took me 10 minutes to find the receiver.
 Easy to use when I use the laptop at my desk. Easier and faster to move around then the finger pad.
 The on and off switch is hard to get to. It is not big enough for a normal size finger. Very difficult to cut off and on, If it was a little bigger I would highly recommend.
 So far, a great little mouse. Extremely inexpensive and a clear bang-for-your-buck. The laser picks up crisp movements on many surfaces plus it feels good. I took a star off because when received there was a bit of paint stripped from the top end of the mouse. It doesn't bother me so much, but I would have preferred it to look new so I could maintain the factory "look"
 Works great. Easy set up. Much cheaper than Apple's version, if not as pretty - I'm satisfied.
 recieved it in october checked my email before going to work 1st of december returned from work in pm would not work<br/>it was not a battery issue
 Love the feel of the mouse. Works great.
 This is a great wireless mouse. It is the perfect size for my hand, and the rubber-like surface is easy to grip. And it works great. I have no complaints at all.
 Perfect little mouse!
 I purchased this when the touchpad on my work laptop stopped working. It took a few seconds to set up and works perfectly.
 Great price for a dependable, accurate mouse that works much better than the last one that I had tried.  Lowest price that I found too!
 Amazed that the original batteries are still going strong 3 months later. My old Bluetooth mouse would only last about a month on a set. Great mouse for the $.
 Had to get a replacement because it stopped working but Amazon replacements are so easy, was no big deal. 2nd worked great for long time!
 Computer sense the USB receiver is inserted but the mouse don't works
 Not bad but not great, either.  Nano receiver has come apart and is now in two pieces, but it still works (just can't remove it without needle-nose pliers).  Also, the cursor seems to jump around a bit - but again, it still works.
 Works well,  as expected to work.
 What can I say, it's a mouse and it mouses!
 Runs on batteries, I have to get use to cutting the mouse off when not in use. No issues and way more flexibility than a wired mouse.
 I don't get it battery life is so short I've replaced twice and you must remember to switch off but still short battery life.
 junk, 2 one. i got, they don't work. buy one that works. STAY AWAY FROM AmazonBasics STUFF. BUY A MOUSE THAT WORKS. YOU BUY THIS TYPE, IT WON'T WORK. buy a microsoft, one that works. they work. i have ones, from them are are 2 years old,. THIS ONE WON'T WORK. THEY ARE JUNK. ALL THEY ARE.
 Easy setup, easy to connect and to use
 Worked great for about a year, then just stopped working.
 Great product.
 Seemingly works as it should. I've had it for a bit now and haven't had any issues.
 The price so perfect. I bought this for my parents and they loved it. They asked me to order them another for their other laptop.
 Works well, good price, nice it has an on/off to save battery life
 This works very well. It installed with no problem. It fits nicely in my hand.
 Xmas gift for friend
 I would like to be able to disable the automatic scrolling function, otherwise better than the other ones I have had.
 Didnt work far - maybe 4 feet.
 After some use, the mouse started showing a red light on any attempt to activate it and stopped working. Since it has a one-year warranty, I will try to return it.
 FOR THE PRICE IT CAN'T BE BEAT.  CHEAP ENOUGH TO BUY 3-4 IN CASE YOU LOSE THEM.
 The best mouse ever. The only thing that i don't like about it is the receiver it is kind of big for laptop use.
 Mouse received was wired and all black-so basically exactly wrong/opposite of what  I thought I was purchasing.
 Works really well.<br/>I already ordered another one.
 This mouse was a great purchase for the price. It worked perfectly with my Mac as soon as I connected it.
 This is my first wireless.  Is fantastic and its nice not having that wire in the way.
 Works well.  Its a basic mouse but that's exactly what I needed.
 I really like the idea of having a reliable brand of generic electronics that just get the job done that they're made to do without pretending to be more than it really is. I've bought and used several AmazonBasics products, such as the external DVD drive, and HDMI cables, and I've yet to have any sort of problems with any of them.
 The pointer and scroll are both too sensitive. I have changed my settings on my computer and it still feels too sensitive. It works but it is not my favorite.
 Looks and works great.
 Mine died after years of use. Bought this one. Worked less that 2 weeks. Now in my junk drawer.
 This mouse works great and is easy to use and transfer between computers and my laptop.  It clocks very quietly, it's not annoying or abnoxious or anything like that.  It's not too heavy or light either.  Would repurchase.
 I'm about as computer dense as you can get. Set up was easy breezy. It works great. My biggest problem is w/ ME not the mouse. I keep forgetting to turn it off when not in use which they recommend to preserve battery life.
 Cheap. The wheel started not working properly after 10 months, but since it's covered by AmazonBasics warranty, I had no problem replacing it to a new one. Wonderful service! I wish batteries last longer though...!
 Power switch is very small, and breaking a fingernail to use it is an ongoing problem. Batteries are difficult to change. Would not buy this brand again.
 Amazing mouse.
 Works great, not the best build, but I have dropped it a time or two and it hasn't broken. Highly recommended at this price point.
 The mouse I received functions erratic, sometimes works fine, sometimes moves the cursor all over everywhere except where you want, even when you are not using the mouse. I can click on a link and it will open several other adjoining links, pretty annoying. If I can find the box in the recycling bin I will try to return it.
 This mouse works perfectly and is a great value at this price. Definitely recommended. I've been using this mouse for a long time and have no complaints.
 Not bad if you're leaving it within a few feet of the dongle but I bought it to use with my media server in the other room thinking it would be bluetooth strength and it just isn't.
 l like it
 This was purchased for some friends whose old mouse went to mouse heaven.  They, ludites to their core, love the wireless feature and have enjoyed using this mouse.  They have told me it fits the wife's hand perfectly.
 Can't beat this one for the money.  It is perfect for travel since it is small (and I don't like using the pads on notebooks )  It feels substantial and works as well as my Logitech ( who really make the best mice on the market )  Buy this one and you won't go wrong.  No software involved.
 Works well on all my computers, definitely a less than fancy feel to it but it works.<br/><br/>IT'S JUST A MOUSE! Get it already!
 The mouse works great on my windows 7 laptop.  It has a nice texture to it and feels solidly built (only time will tell if it really is.)
 I'm very impressed with this mouse.  It's easy to use, feels good in your hand, and is super simple. Perfect.
 This is perfect- great size and all the necessary features.  It works as it should and seems to hold battery life well-enough.
 Bought this to use for my security system and it works great. In my case it is over 30 feet away from device and it works great.
 works well
 Excellent product, and the batteries so far have lasted over six months, even when I have forgotten to turn the mouse off for days at a time.
 For the price it does a good job.  Needed a mouse that I could use while working in public areas and not be upset if it disappeared or got broken.
 Great wireless mouse.  This is my 2nd one - the first one failed after 20 months or so.  It's the nano receiver that fails.  Otherwise, it would be 5 stars.
 Great mouse and very easy to set up. worked perfectly and I would recommend.
 Started to have problems connecting.  Search the web for possible solutions or causes.  Found out this USB receiver is unencrypted and can be hijacked (Mousejack).  Will stop using as firmware updates are the only means to fix this.
 I bought 3 of these for various laptops and in all three the battery cover keeps falling off, only tape will keep it on.  Other than that annoying inconvenience the mouse works really well.
 I ordered two of these and both had SERIOUS lag issues. Huge disappointment since AmazonBasics are usually such great quality. They were returned and replaced with Logitechs.
 Very vague instructions. The mouse is not clearly marked for proper battery insertation.
 I bought this mouse and i just simply love it. I use it pretty much all the time. Good battery life too i would say. In addition to these its easy connect easy use and would recommend it to anyone.
 Excellent. Works like a charm. Sleek and very well balanced. Amazon Basic is making some good quality stuff. Ill always look to see if Amazon Basic has what I need first.
 Nice inexpensive product. Does just what it's supposed to. Easy to use. No problems noted.
 great mouse and easy to travel with
 does not work through tables, legs, any blockage at all interrupts the signal. even without anything in the way of the receiver it does not work outside of three feet away. utter nonsense.
 Works great. Good price! We have many laptops and Chromebooks. Works perfectly with all of them. Cannot beat the price.
 I LOVE this mouse! For work I have a Think Pad and the track pad is horrible. This mouse has been a life saver! It's super easy to install and works flawlessly. I am so much more productive because of this mouse. LOVE it!
 I have never had a product from Amazon be so poor in quality, the plastic covering for the batteries broke at the first use and now 3 weeks later it does not even work. VERY DISAPPOINTED
 No more and no less than exactly what I need. And I think it's held up for about two years now? And still going.
 It clicks really loud. Other than that, it's great. Connects automatically, no issues. The Connector is small and doesn't get in the way. A+<br/>Batteries are included, which is neat.
 Storing the wireless dongle could be a bit annoying and battery access is a bit tedious, but the mouse is reliable and ergonometric in design. Need to wait on battery life and reliability.
 Great option, connects immediately and works flawlessly.
 Got tired of mouse cables causing problems, so I finally bought a wireless.  Works so well.
 Amazon proving themselves gods with their Basics once again. Bought this as a simple mouse to go with my laptop. The Nano receiver is incredibly fast, plugs in and works almost immediately, none of that waiting for the damn thing to install. Small mouse and does very well, thanks amazon!
 Works very well.  I never did like the touch pad, so this mouse is a real improvement for me The price was right.
 PRETTY GENERIC , THE LORERAN ULTRA THIN KEYBOARD AND MOUSE  GOOD RANGE MUCH BETTER PRODUCT
 Works great. Nice and smooth. I would buy it again.
 Easy to set up and works well -- even on my pant leg when I was working the laptop while sprawled out on the sofa! Great Value!
 great item just needs batteries about every three months.
 I finally don't mind using my wife's laptop. Easy to install. It's Plug 'N' Play. Remember to turn it off when you're done with the computer, otherwise you'll be using a lot of batteries.
 Works fine.
 Simple, functional, well built mouse for a great price. Will update as to durability - but one of the best cheap devices I've purchased in a long time.
 Like the title said, it is very durable. Dropped it on hard floor more times than needed and still works like new. Doesn't look new though. The battery cover stay on even if it drops, but can get ruined if you keep opening and closing it. The USB receiver is also small has a good range.
 Good back up mouse at a cheep price, and have used for about 1 week (Nov 2015) no problems or issues.  Will update if for some reason it fails in the future.
 Easy to set up with clear instructions included.  Works great!  So happy I purchased it as I'm able to quickly navigate pages.
 I've been using it for over 2 years and it still does the job perfectly.
 Great mouse..Great price
 This is so nice to have it unattached to another wire. I can move it around freely without tugging on a wire.
 The mouse worked great for three months but then the battery contacts became loose and now the batteries won't stay in place. Perhaps, as someone else noted, the inclined position of the battery slot is to blame? Buying a Logitech.
 Item as described, a very good mouse, worked great until  someone stole the nano transmitter, and I can't  locate a replacement.
 Good mouse but too small for me
 I just needed a productivity mouse for my laptop in college, for the price tag it feels remarkably good and works better than most microsoft wireless mice I've owned
 Mouse linked up to computer very easily - works great - good value!
 It connected really easily and works so far. I've only had it for about 2 hours though. It's a little on the small size, but I like that because so are my hands.
 For the money, this is a very good Mouse.
 using it right now
 its better than the other one I had...before
 Works, feels nice, long battery life
 Works well, can't ask for more!
 It works. That's it. I have it for more than a month now and it still works fine. As long it works, 5 out of 5.
 This mouse is very easy to use.  Simple installing to device and is comfortable in your hand.
 When I need a new one, I buy these, last longer than many others I've had.
 This uses 2 AAA batteries, and it burns through them pretty quickly.  My Amazon mouse died after about 13 months and I switched to the "Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 - Graphite", which uses 1 AA battery... 2 months later and I am still on the 1st battery with the MS mouse.  Much better!
 Wireless mouse works great for my mom's laptop. Bought it for her so she didn't have to deal with a touch pad.
 The mouse came today but the battery compartment won't close. I can't use it. I hope Amazon will be able to send me a new one or refund my account.
 I use this for several hours five days per week.  It works flawlessly on a wooden desktop and only requires two AAA batteries.  Based on my experience, I'd say that under heavy use, you can expect to replace batteries every 4-5 months.
 Cheap, good, affordable.
 Mouse is incredibly frustrating to work with.<br/><br/>The mouse will not register fine movements, and thus behaves jerkily and requires multiple attempts to do basic functions like closing a browser tab. The update rate seems to be too low, and there is no way that I can see to improve it. I am back on my old mouse. Avoid.
 Good quality - good as new after 18 months of regular use.  Small enough for portable use, but feels substantial in my hand.  Great battery life, especially since I usually forget to turn it off.
 Very good device. Affordable and easy to use.
 Best mouse I have owned. I've paid much much more for mice from Logitech and Microsoft and been disappointed. I love the size and the shape, and tracking is smooth and responsive, but not overly so.  Larger hands may find it a little small, but it was perfect for me.
 Not a huge fan of the fact that you have to turn the mouse off after each use.  I prefer mice that have auto detect on and off so I don't go through so many batteries.
 I've been struggling with my "stupid" mouse for a few months now. It's so wonderful to have an excellent mouse in the house!
 Awesome mouse from Amazon - another great product.  I love the small usb connecter that fits inside of the mouse in-between the batteries.  The packaging is awesome and very frustration free and the mouse is a great feel.
 Great little mouse.  Only drawback is that is takes 2 - AAA batteries that are difficult to insert or removed.
 This mouse made my computer much easier to use than my laptop's touch pad.  However, after a couple months, it started malfunctioning.  It still works, but not for long period of time.  I occasionally stops working.  It is possible this is due to the fact that it gets gently jostled while transporting my laptop, but given it's built for laptop use, I'd expect it to be able to handle gentle transport.
 works great and with a very minimal design, some customers say that they are having issues installing the drivers, i plugged in to my windows 10 and start working without any issues
 This is a very nice mouse for the price.  I opened the package up, took out the mouse, put the batteries in, removed the cute little usb thing, plugged that in to my laptop and BAM, it works!  No instructions or set up needed, fits nice in my hand, love it.
 This is a good mouse but I am giving it a four star rating because at times the cursor would jump for no reason. Also sometimes when I switched computers the mouse would not connect. Now I do not have any issues and I use it at home and at work.
 I don't need a mouse to look fancy; I just need one that does its job.  I bought an off-brand mouse which was less expensive than this one and after thirty minutes of heartache, I threw it away.  With the amazon mouse, I unpacked it, loaded the batteries, plugged in the USB unit, and it immediately worked... all in less than a minute.  Simple, easy, inexpensive.
 Good, basic mouse for a reasonable price.  Nothing fancy, but it works.  A possible problem is that it is on the list of wireless mouse that could enable someone with inexpensive hardware and bad intentions to hijack your computer:  ...]
 Inexpensive but does the job.  No need to buy higher priced or more elaborate ones for routine use.
 Works as expected...
 so far so good has on off button I 'll see if the batteries last longer in this one than in my old one of course it will look who it is from  SMILE
 Love this mouse. It works amazingly - just as well as it did the first day I got it. Used it for college and even casual gaming.
 Wow, this mouse works much better than the brand name one I paid twice as much for. Quick tracking. Quiet scroll wheel. Definitely the mouse I will buy again if I need one.
 The mouse worked fine for about 3 days and then reception from the dongle stopped working unless you held it really hard into the USB port. Completely useless and waste of $12. Ended up buying a Logitech mouse from my local Best Buy that continues to work a 1000X longer and better.
 Great value!
 Happy with this so far. Replaces my Microsoft mini mouse, whose USB receiver quit without giving notice. Comfortable and well-designed. I use it left-handed and plug the receiver into a hub (no lag time).
 Within six months the metal 'sheath' detached from the USB receiver--it was left behind in the USB port and had to be removed with pliers.<br/>Our company has used many, many wireless mice over the years and never seen this before.<br/>We had bought this mouse as a cost-saving experiment--we will be going back to Logitech mice.
 Easy to set up. Easy to use. I've had it for about a month now and the batteries that came with it are still going strong.
 This is an excellent product! It's made with good quality and works great. The optical laser on this mouse functions well! Its easy to use. I really like it.
 works ok I've had better ones
 It's a cheap mouse. So I'm cheap but it works fine for what I want.
 It serves the purpose. I prefer them a little larger for my hand and fingers but I am getting used to it. I like not having to drag the cord around which I was stuck using temporarily since my other mouse died.
 it worked OK.  But after buying/returning 3 wireless mouse i realized that I'm very particular.  I have small hands and wanted something smaller.  this one was too big and bulky for my taste
 Got two of these.  Seemed OK for a while, but after a few months, both became intermittent.  Cursor jumped and single click selections sometimes took two clicks.  New batteries didn't help.
 Amazon knows how to make products.  Reasonably priced, works as advertised, and feels great.  Would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who wants an affordable mouse.
 This a good basic  mouse.  I purchased it when my touchpad stopped working as a result of Windows 10 upgrade.
 So far I am completely satisfied with this mouse.  If I were to complain about anything it would be the on off switch, it is a bit small and inconvenient to turn on/off.
 Great wireless mouse, good fit for the hand, works well.  Good price for a good product, fast shipping.
 Great mouse for the price. So far run it one several laptops including a Mac and it worked flawlessly.
 So far so good. I use this mouse with my Asus Laptop. I haven't had any issues. It was affordable and does the trick. Make sure you get a mousepad or I use an old folder.
 mouse works great, instantly connects to PC when turned on
 Love it
 Using it now.  Works well.  I haven't tired 'mousing' five feet away but why would you?  Can't speak to battery life yet but I have forgot to turn it off over night  a couple of times and that didn't kill it.  Just plug it in and go.  Simple
 Perfect solution for my laptop (HP). Perfect tracking speed out of the box. Took less than a few minutes to initiate nano receiver and mouse. Ergonomically comfortable and precise.
 The mouse is great. Plugged in the remote, popped in the batteries, and off I went
 As usual, AmazonBasics delivers - at a reasonable price. No need to spend $30 on a mouse when you can have this one.
 Excellent product - works perfectly. I have used it ever since receiving it and it hasn't skipped a beat. Give yourself flexibility and purchase one of these and trust in its performance because it's an "Amazon Basic".
 The click is a little stiff but for the price, it is a very good value.
 Dead after 2 years.
 This little thing is great. It is a tiny bit small, it doesn't quite fill up the whole cup of your hand like other mice will but it's a perfect every day mouse. Would definitely buy this time and time again.
 This cordless mouse works great. But it goes though 2 AA batteries pretty fast (at least every month).  I have to get in the habit of shutting it off.
 I want to give this mouse a good review because I love Amazon Basics products but either something is wrong with the driver, or something is wrong with the hardware.<br/><br/>I lose signal with the mouse regularly where the pointer is not working. Sometimes I cannot move the pointer but can still click. I'm using a Thinkpad X1 Carbon laptop that I'm very pleased with so I cant really point fingers at the laptop. sometimes unplugging the usb, waiting a few seconds, and replugging it in will work. Sometimes turning off the mouse and turning it back on will work. It's sporadic.<br/><br/>I expect the thing to just turn on and work. Plug and play, is it not? Then why am I having problems.<br/><br/>The connection issues are my only complaint. The feel of the mouse itself is fine. All other aspects of the design are good.<br/><br/>-----------<br/>Couple months later and I have to update. I've tried other mice with my laptops, usually wired, but have no problems. To me that means there's something going on between the mouse and the receiver, or for some reason the receiver doesnt translate right. I don't car, what I care about is I use this for works and it's very aggravting when once or twice a day I'm stopped in my tracks, and fiddling around with a mouse for tow minutes. For the record, this is my second one, I already exchanged one mouse in due to similar problems.<br/><br/>I'm about ready to throw the thing away and go find a different brand.
 I bought this wireless mouse to use on a computer connected to my home TV monitor. I found that the range was far too short to be useful. I will need to purchase an alternative.
 Good-bye irritating wires! I love my wireless mouse.
 Works great.. Had it a few months now. I have yet to change the batteries even though it is used literally all day. For the price you cant beat it!
 works well, but wanted it to replace a broken mouse, wont work with other USB part for keyboard so i had to use both USB receivers.
 Another great AmazonBasics product. Works well. Feels nice to the touch (it does matter to some). A bit small for bigger hands.
 Scrolling is erratic. At times a down or up click will not work to move the list. This happens too often
 This mouse works well and I still have the original batteries that came with it.
 Batteries are hard to locate in battery compartment, positive and negative markers are nearly invisible.  Compartment cover does not stay on.  Pops off by itself.
 Worked great for the first 2 weeks then intermittently quits on me even with fresh batteries. Each time it quits it won’t reconnect until i unplug the nano reader, take out batteries and reinstall.
 The mouse works great however it is a bit small.  It feels more like a travel size mouse but other than that it works flawlessly and the buttons are responsive.  Battery life is good too
 It has everything you need for a great price, the finish feels really nice in my hand. Its also not too big and bulky like some of the others but also not too small that its a nuisance or uncomfortable. Scroll wheel has been working well, and after a couple months of use its still going strong with the original pair of batteries
 Clicks really loud, like that it comes with batterys
 WORKS EXTREMELY WELL. TURNS OFF WHEN NOT IN USE.
 Poor battery life and no automatic shut off.  Bad combo.  The grip is wrong too.  Not good for extended use.
 Perfect little wireless mouse for the price.  I like how the usb piece fits right into the mouse for storage.
 Nice! Make the laptop so much easier. I have some distance between, so the mouse does it's job nicely.
 I love the scroll wheel of this mouse, it's quiet and it doesn't click. It fits in your palm snuggly even though it's a wee bit bigger than a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500. I would've given it all 5 stars if the power switch is on the bottom so even with a thumb, it could be turned on and off easily and save battery life. Or Amazon can just throw that all aside and redesign it to have auto on and off :)
 good
 This lasted about 4 weeks.  I would not purchase this again.
 This is a great basic wireless mouse - I use it on an older laptop where I switched the existing wireless mouse to a new laptop, but we still use the older laptop and a wireless mouse makes it more convenient.
 My grandson likes it.
 Does what a mouse should do. I can use it with my chromebook, which I couldn't do with my old Tecknet.
 worth the price and works awesome.
 Great wireless mouse, plugs right into the USB.  Comes with 2 AAA batteries so it's ready to use.  Very happy, this was a great deal.
 This is an affordable mouse with very good button clicks. I've used it for a week and noticed that it's a lot more precise than my previous mouse. I forgot to turn off the mouse a few nights and it literally left the mouse on 24 hours for a couple of days, but the mouse hasn't shown any sign of being slower or weaker. Highly recommended for its price.
 easy to use
 Great mouse! Very responsive and feels high quality. Only complaint is that the mouse click is a little louder than I prefer. Other than that it was a great buy
 very nice mouse!
 Buy a Logitech.  You have to replace the batteries every month or so if you don't manually turn it off.  Logitech with self power down when not in use to conserve battery. Worth a few extra dollars to buy a Logitech and save money on batteries.
 Not fancy but does everything I need and I have had over a few years
 I am extremely happy with this mouse.  In fact, several of my co-workers and friends have purchased the exact one after using mine.
 Not much to say, batteries last long, has a wide range of connection (mind worked from like 20ft away, God knows why you'd need it to). Good buy.
 Works great.
 A basic simple wireless mouse that just works the way a mouse should.  Like it so well that I just ordered another one for our other computer.
 honestly, just get a decent bluetooth laser mouse instead of this.  i get interference all of the time unless the dongle is inches away from the mouse.  very frustrating.  battery life is great though.
 Does exactly what it claims to do. I travel for work and need a compact, full feature, wireless mouse and this one fits the bill perfectly. Comes with everything you need. The USB receiver stows quickly inside the mouse when you are traveling. It works flawlessly, what more can I say?
 Beats the Microsoft 3500 wireless mouse that I replaced with this one. So far the scroll is firm and actually works. As well did I mention the mouse works, so that is kinda the main point of the purchase!
 This thing is great. It's cheap. Takes 2 AAA batteries. And is nice and accurate. A cool thing is the USB adapter has a space in the battery compartment. This isn't a gaming mouse, but it will get the job done otherwise.
 Completely non-functional out of the box.  For the price, I guess one should not expect any quality control efforts.
 This mouse does exactly what I need it to. I took one star because while it is perfectly functional, it is a bit small for what i feel like is an average hand.
 Nice, inexpensive mouse.  I use it a lot because my tremor ridden hands are a mess on a touch pad.
 Seems nice but should have done research on it because it will not work with my Toshiba Chromebook 2
 Product matched description and happy with my purchase.
 Works well so far and I thought the price and speed of delivery was what i needed at the moment.
 Its designed for extremely small hands.  Otherwise its a good mouse.
 Yes has met my expectations
 Inexpensive, not too small, perfect for average sized hands, works right out of the box. Always works. I have been using it everyday for 3 months, and batteries are still working.<br/>My previous bluetooth mouse always had intermittent pairing issues, and was a huge battery hog - it required changing batteries every few weeks. I also like that you can store the receiver in the mouse so you will never lose it.
 everything as expected, no problems
 The battery life lasts a LONG time. I leave this thing on ALL day and it'll go months before I need to replace the batteries. Perfect mouse.
 It was exactly what I wanted.  Worked great.
 Works great.
 Love it
 Great product works fine
 Works great
 Works great but the battery cover is horrible quality will probably break at some point when I open the cover. I broke the first one on the first time I opened it and I had to return it.
 Works great.
 It's a mouse. It works well and has a decent battery life.
 Great mouse. I have trouble sometimes with the connectivity when I plug it into the USB port on the back of my computer. (4 foot distance)<br/><br/>But this would work great with a laptop.<br/>I bought a second one for my mom.
 Works well, I find it better than more expensive wireless mice(?)
 Everything works really good...I have since been upgraded to a gaming mouse but this still works, the scroll wheel gets a little wobbly after a while but that's probably because it is so cheap of a wireless mouse.
 Excellent wireless mouse! I have two and the keyboard is great too.  High quality and just works...no lag like some have claimed.
 using this mouse right now.This mouse has been working like a charm. plug it in and turn on the mouse and you're good to go.
 This is a great little, inexpensive mouse.  I use it with my Surface Pro 2 and highly recommend it.
 Works great and what a price!!!
 This is an amazing mouse! I love how the USB receiver fits inside the battery case of the mouse. I travel for work, and that feature makes it easier to pack everything up. The mouse works beautifully, and although some reviews complain about the difficulty of removing batteries, it is actually pretty easy if you just use the plastic ribbon.
 Great mouse. Very economical. Works great.
 Good for the price, wish it was a touch bigger. Never any trouble with the connection, batteries last a long time.
 Solid mouse but terrible for any sort of Ergonomic comfort. I used it for about a month and then had to buy a Logitech as my hand was cramping.
 Solid mouse... never failed with Amazon Basic purchases
 Worked 10 days
 The laser sensor is not the best, and the scroll wheel is very easy to press. Overall, the mouse is portable and nice to carry around with you if you need a mouse.
 can't see the pattern  very disappointed
 I did NOT get a discount for my review.  Love it.  Works well.  Perfect size. Another great Amazon Basics item.
 Was a little doubtful but have loved this mouse. Perfect size and functions excellently on various computers I've used in the past few months. Amazon, you've outdone yourself.
 Feels good and accurately tracks movements.  It's also sized just right for an adult hand.  Another AmazonBasics product that does its job well and at a great price!
 Great mouse, I highly recommend it.<br/>However, mine came with a small issue, it seems to be a bit... lopsided? On the bottom of the mouse, there are 3 or 4 pads. One of them seems to be uneven from the rest, resulting in a small gap. This is a small annoyance. I am considering sending it back for a replacement.<br/>I suspect I'm a rare case, though, so don't worry about buying it.
 The best wireless mouse I've ever used. I have two - one for my desktop and one for my laptop. Installs in a second and is very responsive. Scrolls perfectly and no lag.
 Works great, but the battery cover won't stay on. We ended up tapping  it on.
 The Material Covering the Scroll Wheel becomes a bit disengaged from the wheel itself after a few months.<br/>Now for the Scroll wheel to work, I have to apply quite some force with my finger, otherwise, endless scrolling without effect.
 I reordered this because the 1st one that I purchased worked great for 8 months. The second one that I purchased only worked for 3 weeks. The usb receiver is no longer recognized by my computer so its useless.
 This mouse lasted 3 months--my husband dropped it once (that I know of).
 This mouse works exceptionally well and from all the way across our living room (we use our big screen as a computer monitor). I recommend this to anyone who wants a great mouse for a good price.
 The mouse appears to be well made and has a slot to store the xmitter which is handy and the price was reasonable. The only problem I'm having is that the wheel is too sensitive. I try to scroll and suddenly I'm chasing the cursor up and down the page before I remember to hit the wheel to stop the unintended motion. I will probably get accustomed to the thing in another month but in the interim it is giving me fits.
 Love this little mouse! $10 well spent. It glides smoothly, quickly, and is undeniably easy to setup. All I did was open the package, unpack the hardware, insert the batteries (which are included), pull out the nano receiver from the inside of the mouse (which has a secret slot inside for storage), stuck it into my laptop, clicked the connect button on the bottom of the mouse, and I was in action. Didn't understand why it had a piece of plastic because I suck at reading directions, but it is intentionally there to make it easier to pull out the batteries. Also do not understand why people complain about the nano receiver breaking, but this little fellow is so tiny one must be gentle with handling. The mouse is nice though, and I'm happy with my purchase.
 very nice mouse. works well. i like the size
 i carried this in my briefcase for a couple of months as a back-up and once I needed to use it, it did not work.  i guess it is not eligible to return or exchange
 It's slippery and doesn't fit my hand quite right. But the clicker and wheel work perfect, and you gotta love the price!
 Not inpressed at all.  The cover for the batteries constantly comes off and the batteries fall put.
 The bottom on/off switch constantly turns off after sliding around the mouse a few times. Poor quality design over all. Amazon needs to stick to shipping business, not product design. Leave that to Apple!
 It does what it's supposed to do. It's a wireless mouse. It works. No problems. What else is there to say?
 This mouse will be a workhorse on the road. Good basic wireless mouse. Motion is smooth and the mouse fits comfortably in my hand. Fills the bill at a good price.
 Pretty decent.  It is great for a laptop because it is small, but it is just a tad bit small. My hands aren't huge, but I feel it is just a bit too small.
 love this mouse, simple and works perfectl. I like how small the usb is because it just sits in my laptop port and i turn on my mouse whenever needed.
 For a basic, no fuss, wireless mouse, it's great.
 I use this in my college classroom.  It works fine from anywhere in the room, and does everything I need a mouse to do.  The little USB part stores inside.  Very nice basic wireless mouse.
 A very quality mouse by Amazon and priced lower than the so-called high end ones. You'll not be wasting your money on this quality piece !! As always, Amazon delivers, FAST !!
 love this little mouse its small I love  it just what I needed
 I usually like the Amazon products but this one wasn't very good.  I could never get it to track properly.  Ended up buying a different mouse.
 Works great
 I'm enjoying this little wireless mouse.  It's replacing something that I had for about a month.  I've had this one for three months and no problems.
 Easy to use, compact, and oh so useful! I use mine daily, and it has th he range to use it for advancing slides remotely. Wish I had gotten one sooner.
 No matter how much I tried it wouldn't work with my Mac Book Pro. However, worked with my IMac, but didn't allow for any set up options. I'd not buy one again
 Wonderful,  it's a great addition to the laptop case that I previously purchased. Not only was the mouse affordable, but also when I actually use it it fits my hand very ergonomically. Great product great value definite buy.
 had this product for years.  still works great.  great value!
 Does not work well with the wheel.
 easy on the hand
 worked on my acer chrome book
 Great mouse. A little smaller than a full size mouse.
 Inexpensive and works great.
 using it now for the first time. hooked it up to my laptop which is an acer running windows 7. works great, really good price. remember to change your settings to be able to use a mouse, very easy setup
 Great wireless mouse that has outperformed my previous expensive brand. Use it every day!
 Very reliable mouse. Maybe the batteries don't last as long as I'd like.<br/><br/>This mouse beats the Logitech M185 but the M317 still reigns quite high.
 Worked great for a couple of month, then started acting up where my computers (any one I tried) could not recognize the device. Pure crap!
 I have to turn this mouse off when i close the lid of my laptop. Otherwise the laptop stays on.
 My wife loves the freedom-from-wires.
 It was good for a couple of weeks, but it stopped working
 Lasted about a year before it stopped connecting to the usb widget. Nice size for my smaller hands. I probably will spend the extra 4 bucks for the small Logitech mouse, as my other one has lasted me several years now.
 It's wayyy too small and has horrible accuracy. This mouse isn't responsive at all taking up to 2 seconds to register movement. I get that his is an "Amazon Basics" product but it isn't even usable.
 Perfect sized mouse for a petite hand - liked it so much that I bought a second on for work. Unfortunately, the battery cover did come loose and kept falling off - wound up having to tape the cover on...
 I personally don't like the way this felt in my hands but I like the Amazon Basic Wired mouse much more!
 Never doubted it wouldn't arrive in a timely manner and that it wouldn't work properly  - and haven't been disappointed.
 Love the mouse! Very inexpensive but the quality is on par with name brands. Battery life is great too.
 Much better than I expected. A damn good buy and good quality and performance.
 Got for my work laptop. Works fine for that purpose. Tried to use on a PC that I travel with...and found that that this mouse has terrible range. Maybe 3 ft? Anything beyond is unusable.
 Nice mouse, use it on Dell laptop and Mac Book Pro laptop. Just plug in and it works. No drivers to hunt for...<br/>It's a little smaller then I thought but overall great buy for the price.
 The mouse would be sitting still on my wife's desk and her cursor would start quivering on the screen. Buy something higher quality if you can afford it.
 Bought it for a Chromebook because I don't like using the pad. Works perfectly and speeds things up considerably. Just $12 - Amazon does it again!
 Our daughter's favorite mouse. Great for left-handed user. Solid, no frills all-around great mouse.
 Simple to set up and works great.
 i give a 4 star because of the pieces in the back where you take out the battery there is a little line, becareful with it cause it's easy to break.
 great mouse, nothing fancy just good solid and cheap, iv had mine well over two years now, hasn't done anything weird
 I love the compact size of this mouse. The wireless connection has been flawless and the mouse works great. The batteries that come with the mouse die quickly, but my first set of replacement batteries have been going strong for months.
 the nano chip was missing so I could not use,,  please repair or replace-- I included it in the package you received.
 I'm so glad I invested in these. Very handy. Totally worth the price. It does its job well. I haven't had any problems with them at all since receiving them.
 The Amazon product works very well my only complaint is the battery doesn't last long in addition you must manually turn off the mouse every time you don't want to use it if you want to save battery
 Neat little mouse, a little smaller than standard size.  Works great!
 Love the mouse but the USB piece cam apart and is stuck in my computers USB port.  I will have to break it to take it out so I am just leaving it.  Mouse works great.
 I constantly have to turn it on and off for the mouse to function. The mouse keeps going dormant. And sometimes turning it on and off doesn't work. I am returning it. Don't buy it!!!
 you can not do better
 Great mouse for the price! Only drawback is the adapter takes up a usb slot. However, it works perfectly and has a great range.
 For two weeks I would have given this a 5 star rating.  Dropped it to 2 when it broke.  ( right click pad became inoperable)
 Great for the price. Basic wireless mouse.
 This is an excellent mouse, if you're looking for a good cheap yet quality mouse. I have a Macbook Pro and it fits very well with it. The handle is great, too.
 The first one wouldn't hold one of the batteries in it.  Sent it back.  Got a new one.  After a month and a half it keeps shutting off.  Changed the batteries and it still keeps shutting off.
 This mouse is at a very good price.<br/>Well built.<br/>Just the right size.
 Disappointed with this mouse. Only 3 months into its use, it started eating my batteries. Cannot recommend.
 These seems to only last about 6 months. Even though it has batteries and is USB is connected to the computer, the mouse just doesn't move after 6 months. I never had this kind of problem when I was using logitech, which was about 2~3 years old.
 Great product for the price
 Works fine.
 Nice size. Quick to get going and seems to work on most surfaces.
 Mice are mice, but this is a really nice one.
 Works terrific with my old Toshiba laptop! These Amazon Basics products are proving to be very good!
 Perfect!!
 Works great...feels good to the touch.  Being able to store the little USB connector inside the mouse is a big advantage.  I also found this size to be just right.
 The range and battery life don't blow you away, but they're completely adequate. In fact we use ours pretty far from the receiver. And for this price, are you kidding me? Completely adequate gets five stars.
 Perfect little mouse for basic computer needs. The wireless function works well and no issues with scrolling, clicking, etc.<br/>Interestingly comes with no-name batteries, rather than Amazon Basics. Hmmmm...
 Love it, love it, love it.  Never realized the cord was such a bother!
 Really nice buy for the money!
 Excellent product and service!
 honestly, this mouse works really well compare to those name brand kind. I have bought these several time, not because the mouse but because my baby looks for it and breaks it.
 This product arrived fast and works great it has a  good weight and good sensitivity.
 Great product.  This is my second since my puppy ate my last one.
 I used these around the office... for the money they are hard to beat!<br/><br/>Similar enough to Logitech to make me happy.... the price... it's simply hard to beat!
 So far so good. Quite light and ergonomic. Batteries included!!!.<br/><br/> It is not too small, something I had an issue with other models I have purchased before.
 This mouse does what it is supposed to, but overall just not very good.  It lacks the ergonomic features of many competing mice.  It just doesn't feel good in your hand.  The mouse is lighter (in a cheap, flimsy-feeling way) than other mice I've used.  I've had great luck with other AmazonBasics products, but in this case stick to the name brands.
 Works great
 works great on my macbook pro!
 Nice mouse...if it worked.  Has to be restarted regularly, and still is jumpy and unpredictable.  I gave up and went back to using the laptop trackpad...at least now I'm thankful that it works :-)  This product is a waste of money.
 Terrific mouse. Work great, decent price, and wireless. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a replacement mouse.
 does great
 First one I received had problems connecting, it would lose connection spontaneously and not connect at all other times. Amazon made good on it though by sending a new one at no cost.
 Inexpensive but does its job! Small, so it's easy to transport - fits in the cell phone pocket in my backpack. You can store the dongle inside the mouse which is convenient for transport. I accidentally WASHED AND DRIED the dongle and it still works! You basically can't go wrong with buying this mouse if you just want something basic.
 YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, STANDARD SIZE MOUSE, FITS BOTH HANDS-COMES READY TO GO, JUST ADD BATTERIES-NO NEED FOR SOFTWARE TO SET UP-WORKS RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. REAL PLUG AND PLAY.
 Does not always have a good connection with the computer if the batteries are not fresh.
 Great for a laptop as an extra mouse! Works perfect
 my 10-year old son loves it, says it's very comfortable
 Bought 2 of these as back ups for my family's laptops. As soon as I inserted the batteries, the mouse lit up once and then never worked again, even after trying different batteries. I tried troubleshooting multiple times and they are completely useless and a waste of money.
 Easy to use, works like it should, good quality and would purchase it again.  I work alot on the road and although using a mouse in a car is a pain I like it better than trying to use the mouse pad on the laptop.
 Replaced a bluetooth mouse with this one, and I am very happy. Good connectivity and works wonderfully.
 This is my 2nd Amazon mouse.  I got this one when my name brand one died.  I have headfirst one for 4 years and haven't had a problem.  Highly recommended.
 I love the AmazonBasics brand.  Their products are quality and when I needed a wireless mouse, I immediately searched for one of these.  The mouse works great, connectivity is great, and it is a perfect size.  The wireless receiver goes inside the mouse when I'm not using it so I cannot lose it! Overall great product.
 excelente
 very good
 Yep buy it
 Still using it...just have to change the batteries regularly
 works great!
 I've been using Logitech wireless products for years and decided to save a few and go with this AmazonBasics mouse. So far so good, I've only had it for a day but it works the same as my Logitechs. No complaints.
 Not good as known brand mouses, but still a lifesaver to keep in your drawer
 Working great so far (about 2 months post purchase). I like that the wireless USB transmitter is small.
 works great...NO more cords!
 Easy to use and install
 Easy to install, great price and even comes with the batteries
 I love this mouse!  I've used it with 2 different Lenovo laptops at work, with my MacBook Air, and now it's found a permanent home on my new Mac Mini!!
 Amazon products are the best! I just love this little mouse. Does the job and you can't beat the price! I use it for my MacBook Pro and it works perfectly.
 The mouse is great but after a month my kids lost the battery cover and now the battery keeps falling out. Why don't they build a better batter cover...!!
 I'm glad I purchased this Wirelessly mouse, it works exceptionally well with my Laptop.
 This mouse works really well. No glitching. We have a few in our office and one for home.
 it works like nothing else I could ask for.
 simple and efficient. works without hassle. i take it to other computers, plug it in, and use it. no fuss.
 I snagged a couple of these for Christmas gifts and now I want one for myself. The nano receiver is great because it won't get snagged on things like my old-school flashdrive style one does. Having said that, I recommend this product and will probably be getting one for myself very soon.
 I am very pleased with this mouse.  It was very inexpensive, and it works fine.  It was easy to install, and my computer had no trouble recognizing it.  I have used it daily over the course of the last several weeks without any problems.
 Can't believe I never got a wireless mouse before.  It's so great not to have to a restrictive wire to get in the way.
 I don't know how this mouse has so many stars. Don't believe the range of 25 feet if I get mor than 6 feet away the mouse responds choppy. If I'm nine or more feet away forget about it. Unless you plan to use on your desktop right next to you computer forget about it. I know it's inexpensive but don't waste your money.
 After six months of use, I love the performance of the mouse. I hate the way it goes through batteries.
 I have tried numerous mouses (if that is the correct word) and this one is the most reliable.  It is a basic mouse which is ll I need.  Long battery life and no issues with the wireless transmitter/receiver.  Very happy
 Good build and met all my needs for about 12 months. I have had other wireless mice that lasted much longer. The mouse was working fine for about a year and then started having problems. It now won't connect at all these days.
 works great!
 Feels good and works good
 Replaced my more expensive brand. No reason to spend more. Excellent mouse.
 it worked immediately ,and i have few skills in this area! nothing to do , it just worked fine, amd i doubt that a more expensive one would work any better!
 Works very well.  My Son kept borrowing mine, so he got this one for Christmas. :)
 I'm on my third one of these in less than a year. The nana receiver keep breaking down. And recently, the covering on the mouse itself which I thought was a removable plastic film when I saw it start to come off, is actually a low-quality covering that was just deteriorating (in a very unappealing fashion).<br/><br/>Amazon: Please upgrade
 Good solid wireless mouse. Worked flawlessly on Mac and PC.
 works
 Good quality and the internal storage for the USB receiver is nice so you can keep them together when not using the mouse.  I am now, however, wishing I had bought one that automatically turns itself off after a period of inactivity.
 I have ordered 4 of these for people in my office with no complaints. Basic wireless mouse as described.
 Stop working after 3 months!
 Love this little guy. It can burn through batteries pretty quickly - so be sure to turn it off when not using.
 Great price for something I really needed.  I have a mac laptop, the scrolling hurts my fingers.  The apple store sells mouses for expensive and I actually don't like the design of them (too slippery).  I like the texture of this black, matte mouse.
 Works!
 I bought it for my sister and till now she hasn't told me any complaints about the product. So, for me it was a good purchase.
 Works great. Feels solid in your hand. Connects instantly and never drops. If it were Bluetooth it would be perfect, but the dongle (adapter) is tiny enough.
 using it right now,  I game with it also.
 Great mouse. It works well and its plug and play. It's held up so far and for the price, I'm very satisfied. I'd buy it again if I needed another one.
 Love this mouse!
 It worked right out of the box with either my Dell laptop using Linux or my MacBook Pro.
 Great connection.... no regrets easy to use, cups to your hand.
 the batterys go in on an angle but they work fine
 Nice mouse. Cheap and easy to use. Especially great for laptops with poorly designed touchpads, due to the tiny unobtrusive receiver. Also works great.
 It just works, and it has sleek details, like a compartment to hold the USB receiver inside the mouse, so that it doesn't get lost.<br/><br/>Good value for the buck.
 Truly an awesome mouse. I play csgo with it and it is very decent. Amazon basics is extremely impressive
 Its a mouse, and it works great
 Great simple wireless Mouse. Fits great in my hand and is very responsive.
 Works as advertised. Can't go wrong for 10 bucks.
 Perfect size for my laptop. Was having trouble with one of my USB ports from using a wired mouse. I guess all the motion in the port loosened the pins, but this worked perfectly in that port.
 Absolutely love this mouse. Very comfortable in hand and easy to put away to take to school. Battery life is outstanding. I love the amazon basics line, amazing quality.
 I returned due to Amazon failed to replace defective JETTech, I went and bought working mouse from Wal-Mart.
 I was happy with this product. I have had it for a year and never had any problems of any kind. Good quality for the money. I would recommend this product and bet it lasts for years even with me beating it up it's still great .
 I love this mouse. It is not expensive, looks nice, functions very well, and the reciever is pretty small so you won't notice it's there. I like the fact that you can store the reciever inside the mouse so you won't lose it but maybe it should have an auto-off feature.
 This mouse is great for a child to use, but it's very small compared to the wireless mouse and wired mouse that I have been using.
 Nice!
 awesome i love it
 If you don't need an ergonomic mouse this works just fine for the price. It's a bit small in my hand though.
 It's cheap and does what you expect from a wireless mouse. I have a rather big hand so the mouse is definitely on the smaller side. However, it has great response when you compare the price point to other "cheap" wireless mouse.
 works perfectly
 I've been using the mouse for a few months and it works as it should.
 works fine i guess. Mine doesn't sleep unless i turn it off. so the batteries seem to run dead quickly. Filled my short term need. Will be switching back to my logitech mouse.
 Purchased this on a whim, I am glad I did. It has been a great mouse so far. The size is good, I also like the rubber texture on top. Batteries seem to be lasting for a long while.<br/><br/>The only negative is storage for the USB adapter is under the battery door, though this is really not a big deal if you don't travel with it much.
 The only mouse I wanted
 Awesome product. This mouse is awesome quality for a low price. Will definitely buy more amazon basic products!
 This my second one (after dropping the first). Durability isn't great, but it's not sold as durable so I can't fault them there. Overall, really happy with the mouse and the price.
 Worked great until it broke after 2 months. New batteries and different computers still didn't work. Have yet to find an Amazon brand product that I like or doesn't break almost immediately.
 The piece to connect together with the batteries is not user friendly but it works well !
 Great product.  Works great and the price is unbeatable.  I love the AmazonBasics brand.
 Using this mouse right now. No nonsense mouse, easy to use, long lasting. Nothing fancy.
 works  so far battery life great so far
 Great Price on a wireless mouse.  Not as many features as higher priced mouse, but does what I need it to do.
 this mouse is OK considering all the other wireless mouses i have used in the past. this mouse cursor is a little slow to respond. so i would not recommend it too much , but it serves the purpose to an extent.
 THANK YOU AMAZON. THIS WAS SIMPLE TO INSTALL (NOTHING TO IT). IT WORKS "SMOOTH"
 works ok
 I have the wireless amazon mouse and the same hard wired version. Both work great but I prefer the wireless one. Keeps the desk clear of clutter and works exactly the same. Price is great too
 Works great on Mac.  Cheap and works.  No gestures on it, but basic mouse functions work. Incredible price
 Economical, functional, feels good in the hand. Excellent wireless mouse.
 I LOVE IT. IS THE SECOND TIME I BY THIS PRODUCT. THANKS  !!!!!!
 My husband got this for me because our son kept stealing ours.  It is a nice little mouse.  I haven't had any issues other than needing to change the batteries.
 Works just as it should!
 This mouse is flimsy.  Returned it.
 just fine for the price, but when using all the time I would find a better one and pay a little more.
 Works perfect with the Chromebook.  I can sit on the couch holding my laptop and roll the mouse on the cushion and still works great!
 Works great, great value. I did drop it and now the cover to the battery doesn't stay on, I have electrical tape to hold it on. Minor issue - I shouldn't have dropped it.
 This worked for less than amonth before not connecting to my computer. WASTE OF MONEY.
 Great mouse - simple easy to use - best one I've used ever.
 The laser on it is too weak. It doesn't work well on many surfaces.
 Works well. It's a little smaller than I would've liked. Size makes it a better travel mouse than a full size, but not ideal for long work sessions. Great product for the price.
 I’ve ordered a red wireless mouse and received a blue mouse smh. Nothing is wrong with the blue but just asked/ordered the red originally. Just saying!
 Not sure what I could possibly say, that others have not.  This is a GREAT mouse for the money.  good size, good feel.  My only minor complaint is it seems to click a bit loud... but for the price, that seems pretty darn minor.  Edit:  Dead after 5 months.
 I had a logitech for a year that just kept dying even though I replaced the batteries with new ones every few weeks. This mouse is great and has lasted a while on the same batteries!
 Nice wireless mouse, inexpensive and works great with mac and windows, can't go wrong with this one.
 My first wireless mouse. I absolutely loved it! Granted the product arrived later than expected due to customs clearing, but boy the product is bang on buck! Absolutely value for money. Works smooth and hassle free and supports both Windows and Linux. I am certainly thrilled to have it. Thanks to Amazon! :)
 Great mouse!!! Great price! My dogs ate my mouse and I am glad they did now because I found this instead!! Highly recommend!
 Had another wireless mouse but it ate my batteries really fast.  This one is easy to turn on and off so is much better.
 Works great and great price if you need a mouse, by this one
 Very pleased with the quality of products AmazonBasics are making for customers! I will continue to check to see if items are available by AmazonBasics  prior to future purchases.
 A decent mouse for the prize, with nice feel and touch, sensitive and with the exact and comfortable weight and size, at least for me
 It's mousey. I plugged it in and worked fine. Controls the cursor on the screen as expected. Cats tried hunting it but were disappointed
 This was just a really great buy.  The mouse works on any surface and makes using our laptop so much more fun.  We would definitely purchase this product over again.
 Seems solid and well made for the price. Works perfectly with Linux(Ubuntu 15.04), but it has a huge problem. Too small.  It's about 2/3 the size of a normal mouse. Such a bummer.
 Great product. Costs slightly more than local box discounts stores, but the quality is decent
 Hey for the price you can't beat it.<br/>Scroll wheel might not be the smoothest around but it is not a deal breaker.
 Perfect size for 160lb male and quality construction. Good job Amazon.
 A bit flimsy, but worth the price. Does what I wanted it for. ( sometimes the touch pad just aggravates )
 I can only imagine it would be comfortable for a woman with small hands or a child.  The attached photo is what it looks like in my hand.
 Great basic mouse. Easy to set up/use. makes using my chromebook easier for my 8 and 5year olds doing home work.
 TOO HEAVY
 I needed to replace my old wireless mouse and I purchased this one. I like it so far. We have been using it for 4 months and we haven't had any problems. I would recommend this product.
 This stopped working after about a month. It loses connection ever  30-60 seconds...
 I bought this mouse to replace my Toshiba wireless mouse (lasted all of 6 months). This one worked perfectly out of the box and it's gentle on battery consumption. The USB receiver stores inside the battery compartment, which is convenient. You can also manually turn it off with the little switch on the bottom.
 Better than most wireless that have worked with.
 This is a great mouse.  It is a little smaller than a standard mouse.
 love the way this handles and feels in my hands.  I'm not having to slam the mouse to make it work anymore!  Using it now, actually!
 Worked instantly. Easy to install. No problems. Great quality.
 Loved the design, and it's comfortable, but I got problems with range, so it has to be close to the nano receiver.  Also I've experienced some strange variations of positioning, I think because it is very sensible to surface. I'd recommend more for notebook users than desktop ones.
 Very happy with. good quality and great service.
 good size and works well
 good!
 Tried several times and ways, the mouse lags too much for me.
 Works great with my laptop.
 Love amazon basics.  Finally able to find a company that makes adapters (car chargers, computer mouse, etc.) that actually work well.
 Normal product. Recommend for people with small hands. NOT for ones with big hands. My child (8 years old) comfortably use the mouse.
 mouse does the job for what I use it for (homework and studying) good battery life and good overall mouse
 Cursor is kinda jumpy, not smooth like other mice I have used.  Good price!
 very few changing of batteries
 Great little mouse , works fine,  fast shipping
 like it -- works great. serves purpose. only thing is with each click its unusually loud. sort of annoying. so if other around i just use finger pad.
 Love it
 Bought for use with my son's new Chromebook and works great!
 Simple enough wireless mouse.  My daughter uses it daily on her PC
 Works but the clicking sound is pretty loud hah
 a great mouse, I loved it
 This is a great basic mouse at a good price. Buttons and wheel feel good, everything works as it should.
 I little small for my large hands but the mouse is classic, feels pretty comfortable and solid. For the price you just can't beat it!
 Great size, fits in your hand comfortably - battery life seems solid so far. There is a switch to turn the mouse off, but I have not used it. I will update this review when the battery dies. been a month so far.
 The cursor gets behind sometimes and needs to catch up with my movements.
 Great price and I highly recommend it.
 very good product
 Great purchase. Great quality.  Easy to set up. Works well.
 works great
 Amazon Basics stuff is great product for the price, this one is a perfect example.<br/><br/>I just wished it ran on 1 AA battery instead of 2 of those pricey AAA's.
 I was diaappointed with this Amazon product.  The mouse was not user friendly to the hand and stuck so that it had to be clicked more than once.  Also the wheel did not move freely.
 Both the mouse and keyboard will randomly stop working. Mouse sensor does not work properly as well as turns off miduse. Keyboard will randomly lag. I would not recommend this product.
 Most regular wireless mouse has an easy battery carrier. But for this, u need two AAA batteries PLUS both batteries are installed like 45 degree tile. The batteries come lose easily when drop on the floor also the battery runs out very fast.
 My work requires travelling from place to place carrying my computer. Wherever I go, this mouse conveniently and efficiently navigates the screen.
 This mouse worked great for almost a year... until I was sitting at my desk and all of a sudden the mouse felt extremely hot. Afraid it would catch fire or something, I tried to take the batteries out (using the plastic strip, not by hand) and one of them was melted / disfigured and almost burned me. I used it earlier the same day so I’m not sure what caused this to happen. This mouse is obviously not safe and I would not buy it again and would recommend others to buy something else.
 works well on various surfaces, but the batter door keeps falling off and doesn't feel very solid. Travel mouse
 This mouse is the best quality mouse I have seen for the price.  The bests thing about it is that the battery life of it is really long.  I don't even remember the last time I changed it.  I own three of these and it's the only mouse I will buy anymore.
 Very nice portable mouse.
 Worked for about a month.<br/>Now it works if I change batteries every two weeks (even if I turn it off when not in use).<br/><br/>I do not recommend this mouse..
 Works great.
 Do not waste your money. I bought two. They lasted about 2 months, and stopped working. piece of junk.
 I brought this to replace a Logitech wireless mouse at work. Plugged the nano receiver in, turned the mouse on and bingo we surfing and working.
 For an Amazon product, of which I buy regularly, this mouse is cheap feeling and the buttons frequently stick. It is not the quality I had come to expect from AMAZON.
 But it doesn't work as well as my Microsoft mouse.  It has a nice feel to it, but the clicking sound isn't as refreshing, and it requires a mouse pad when I use it on the couch and my Microsoft one doesn't.  If you aren't looking for something you can use on any surface without a mouse-pad this is a decent deal.
 Perfect for the price
 I highly recommend this mouse! Love not having the wire. Easy to use and comes with batteries.
 This little mouse has been my laptop's sidekick for the past couple months and I have had no issues. It's very accurate and responsive and light enough to keep in my backpack.
 Good mouse... easy to connect with my laptop.
 The mouse itself works well, but the accentuated bump to the palm really annoys me. Just wondering why it's not the same as the wired one (which I own).
 Very compatible, easy to connect, works well.
 Great mouse but battery doesn't last very long.  I keep forgetting to turn it off at night to extend the life. Batteries last about a month.
 I just got this in the mail today.  It's very mousy.  It does the job, works fine with Linux and the price was wonderful.  I'm a very happy customer.
 Product was as advertised.  Good delivery service.
 Use this with my ASUS transformer laptop/tablet and have no problems. A no frills wireless mouse that works with no problems
 Worked okay for a couple of months. Now it cuts in and out (works for a couple of seconds then doesn't work for a couple of seconds). Really annoying. I quit using it. Don't waste your money.
 In my crowded office the rule is the less wires the better.  my only fuss is the herky jerky that occurs when other wires<br/>get too close to the mouse.  Maybe I need more wireless?
 Perfect for a wireless mouse.  I ended up buying a second one for my son's computer.
 Good cheap mouse.
 AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver... works great
 great size and convenient
 Good no problems.
 I have been using this mouse for several weeks now, and I'm quite glad that I purchased it.  It's super easy to install and easy to use.
 The AmazonBasics wireless mouse was a big disappointment. Although it is well designed ergonomically, it does not function well. The cursor does not move smoothly, but hesitates as it moves across the screen. Most frustrating.
 Great price.  Use it for work and at home.  Definitely will buy more once it breaks.  But hasn't so far.
 This is a great full size mouse with a very small nano transceiver.  Easy to use, does a great job and price is about half of similar mice from big name manufacturers.  Highly recommended.
 Bought this a While back and it stopped working in 3 days, I hope this one last.
 Works great, easy to use
 Worked for about a year then just stopped. When it worked it was good enough for moderate gaming bug seemed to lag on the high end.
 Good basic mouse for laptop I wouldn't recommend for gamers.
 You have to be real close to the tiny receiver or it often doesn't pick up your input.
 I love my Amazon Basics Mouse; especially like being able to store the USB adapter inside the mouse!
 Great little mouse, especially considering the cost. Works well with Windows 10 on my new Dell XPS. Plug and play instantly.
 Opened the box, installed the batteries, inserted the USB antenna, and VIOLA...worked as advertised!  For the $$, if it lasts a year I'll be happy.  It tracks as well as any other optical mouse as is a lot less expensive.
 Works as expected
 Perfect! The best mouse I ever had. It's light, smooth and precised. I'd recommend this mouse to everyone.
 It was plug and play with batteries included. Very portable yet functional. Love it.
 Simple,guality
 Love this mouse works good.
 Works fine long battery life
 good for portability
 Awesome for the price.  Very basic but good quality.  Looking for an inexpensive mouse to throw in your travel bag, here it is!
 This mouse works just as good as any other one I have tried at half the price.
 It did work for a day, smooth and receptive but has not worked since. Checked everything, batteries etc... could just be a fluke, seems quality enough.
 I like it I don't know if I lost the battery cover or if it left out of box. But other than that I really like it works good
 After finally struggling without success to keep the battery cover on I ended up using scotch tape to hold it together. The cover is a poor design.
 I know it's a cheap little mouse but the scroll wheel never worked well and now it doesn't work at all. It always had a very loud clicking sound when scrolling (annoying, but hey, it was a cheap mouse) but now, nothing, and no scrolling.
 I love it. Better than the last one I had.
 Works for me.
 It is small; uses up the batteries because it doesn't shut off when unused; mouse pointer is inconsistent and will show movement when mouse is sitting on the pad.
 The mouse works great.  For the price you can't beat it!  My only complaint is it is very small!  I was expecting a full size mouse and this thing is just barely bigger than a travel mouse!
 This inexpensive little mouse is the best one I've had, a lot nicer than more expensive brands.  It has a soft nubby exterior and is smaller than most mouses, which is good for my hand size.
 The AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse is exactly what it says. Worked right out of the box with no lag or jittery cursor. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles just a left and right click button and scroll wheel. I took off one star because it has an On/Off button underneath that I keep forgetting to switch off when I am done.
 Love it!! It's smooth, easy to use &amp; the batteries last a long time. Works as good or better than one of those pricey brands.<br/>Super happy I bought it..
 Great mouse!  Works well every time!
 Mouse does not work very well. Cursor always moves all over the place and gets disconnected.
 Good mouse. Very accurate, but not full featured like a Logitech.  I would buy another for what I paid. But keep an eye on Amazon's price games. Got mine for $13 and now it's up to $21.  Same with a watch I bought last week at $65. Now it's at $84.  Happy New Year and Good Shopping.  BL
 Mouse is amazing. For such a small price you can get so much. Only downside is that it takes 2 AAA batteries instead of one but it isn't a big deal for me. Works great and as intended.
 Works great.<br/>Only complaint is that it uses 2  AAA batteries, not the std 1 AA.
 Works perfectly for me.  Really like the on/off switch so I can save batteries when my laptop is not in use.
 Best mouse I've ever used &amp; can't beat it for the price. It came with a battery which I didn't expect.
 Works perfectly.  I only wish it used a AA battery rather than 2 x AAA, but that's not a big deal.
 Easy to use, Windows 10 compatible, very beautiful design and of course with the brand amazon basics appears, it's simple an excellent mouse and especially the batteries that come with are very good quality
 Comfortable &amp; durable.
 Works great! Perfect size for grip.
 point and click action
 It's fine.  Wish it worked via regular bluetooth and that you didn't need a dongle to take a usb port, but whatever.
 Using this for my HTPC... signal doesn't seem very strong but it does the job...<br/>Great that it has a power switch for saving battery...<br/>Working fine so far but had to plug in the receiver to the front USB panel of the case to make it work well...
 Cheaply priced and it does the job, but drop it once (as I did) and its garbage.  Spend a little more for a better product or be very careful not to drop it.
 This product requires a mousepad to work.  Most optical mouses I use can be used on a hard surface.  Not this one.  :(
 Have used it 10 hours a day for over 6 months.  Amazing control.  Becomes second nature. Batteries last well.  Used on both a PC and a Mac.  Best deal out there.
 This is my first wireless mouse!  Makes thinks so simple, with less wires to deal with on the desk!
 I like this mouse  its small enough for my small hands works  very good  came with battery's.. worth the buy
 good product for the money.
 Decent while it lasted, already starting to brake on me
 Great mouse for the price.  Easy to use, sleak design, great size, and great scroll ball.  I have purchased this mouse twice now because the first one inexplicably broke.  might have been something with the connection but still not sure.  The price made it easy to buy again though!
 Great plug and play for laptop, my wife hates the touchpad and this is simple, plug the transmitter into a USB port and it self installs with WIN7 onmy THINKPAD T400
 My Apple mouse broke and I didn't want to shell out $70 for a replacement. This probably performs better than the Apple mouse and it's a fraction of the price! Can't beet Amazon Basics!
 Simple directions, easy to use.
 I think the only thing that I would want are the buttons on the side that lets you go back and forth on web pages instead of having to mouse over and click the back arrow. Other than that, this is a good product!
 Not sensitive enough.  Jerky and eratic
 Excellent quality. Comes with batteries. Looks exactly as pictured. Used two day shipping and it arrived in less than 48 hours.
 power keeps turning off even with new batteries.  worthless.  had to buy another mouse to replace this one.
 Works great
 Works perfectly. Even came with batterys. modefi salon in Littleton likes it.
 Works perfectly and just as expected. Only a little under 12 dollars but works like a quality wireless mouse. Amazon Basics never fail to perform.
 I bought this for my boyfriend a while ago, and the other day I noticed that it's incredibly difficult to compress the clicky button. I don't know if he got a defective version of this product, but I don't know how he's been using it all these months.
 It took me more time to open the box than to set this up. It's a no-frills wireless mouse, which happens to be exactly what I wanted. I'm sure you could spend more and get a "better" more elaborate contraption, but I don't need that.
 Bought this for my 14 year.old sister in law to use with her Toshiba laptop. She loves it. Couldn't ask for a better mouse
 Working fine. No issues.
 Cheap, simple, but eats up batteries. Also, the batteries are very difficult to get in and out.
 No issues with this great mouse years later.
 works great...but doesn't work well on uneven surfaces
 Works nice and smooth!
 working fine.
 Mouse quit After 33 days..real disappointment I count on Amazon reviews when making a purchase maybe no so much next time.
 bought this as a bundle with a laptop works great
 Very good mouse. Great quality.
 I bought this mouse and after two days the mouse intermittently turns on and off, I've changed the USB port the batteries and only works for five minutes max then stops again.
 Very good product.  Works just as well as the name brand, but much less expensive.
 Good price and function
 The mouse is too small &amp; I find that when my hand is resting on the mouse, I very often accidentally click on the right-click.  I would look to find another mouse that fits my hand better.
 Works great
 As advertised works well
 Was several dollars cheaper than comparable mouse.  Very pleased with it.
 Jerky, skips, stutters
 The first one stopped working after a few months.  Amazon sent a replacement but I bought something else for my other computer due to lack of trust in it. The feeling and functionality are just ok.
 A great price for a solid mouse! The Amazon Basics line is amazing and you can't go wrong with this mouse.
 Really good mouse. Good size and feel. Smooth tracking speed. Not many complaints.... except for one major one.<br/><br/>As can happen with any wireless mouse, it had a decent about of interference that caused the pointer to jump and lag. I had it plugged in near where I had my external hard drive plugged in on my big Dell desktop and I suspect that is the issue. I know you can get an USB extender cord and move the dongle to the far side of your desk so it can lessen the interference, but then with that wire, why not just get a wired mouse?<br/><br/>So I returned it to get a wired one. Three stars. EXCEPT.<br/><br/>I added a FOURTH star back because... I went through the return process on my Amazon.com account and processed my refund but Amazon said "no need to return the product. Your refund is being processed."<br/><br/>So they let me KEEP the item for free. That's great customer service. They obviously know it isn't worth the postage for me to send it back so why not just let him keep it and get some goodwill? Well it worked. I will now try to use this with my laptop and get a wired (Amazon) mouse for my desktop.
 This is an awesome mouse. It moves smoothly and has a really nice responsive time with no lag at all. In my opinion its much better than the wired mouse I use to have. The size is prefect too. Not too big and not too small. If you're thinking about getting a wireless mouse, definitely give this one a try. You won't be disappointed.
 It's a mouse caught it chasing the cat the other day it works!
 I love the matte finish on the mouse, it is comparable to the back of a kindle, almost rubber like. It fits my hand better but is still a little on the small side.
 Great mouse, immediately recognized by Windows 7 and XP machines. Nice egonomics, smooth and distinct clicks, great value.  Battery compartment is tilted to keep the size down, but it's not too small for an adult male.  Will buy again.  Comparable to other brand name mice I own. Will buy next time I need a wireless mouse.
 For the price it is a great mouse.
 Amazon basics products are great. I've ordered a ton of them. The mouse pad on my laptop decided to stop working and I fixed the problem with this wireless mouse :)
 This mouse is quite good. It has a good range, a good feel to my hand, and is responsive on command. The on/off switch is the right direction for me and has a nice positive engagement. And I like being able to store the USB plug-in inside the battery compartment. (Of course, I haven't dropped it yet.)
 Great quality and the battery lasts a long time when the mouse is turned off when not used.
 Hard to install/replace batteries.  Mouse is a little too small for my hand.
 5 stars for this because I'm still using it today. It has been almost a year and I never have any problems with it.
 I have three of these, my cats knock them in the floor every night and they all still work after months of this, plus they come with batteries!
 Very happy with it for the price.  Even ignoring the $10 price tag, it is a good mouse.
 This mouse is simple to use, is just a basic mouse but it get the job done. Don't be specting a super mouse because is not. This mouse works in windows and mac. For me this mouse is perfect it does what it supposed to do, but if you are looking for something more special you won't find it here.
 Easy setup. Hardest part was figuring out how to put the batteries in because they go in at an angle. Typical size mouse and tiny USB hookup.
 After using this for a few minutes I threw away the  major brand name] mouse I had been using. It is that good. What a great value, as are most Amazon Basics products.
 Thought because there were so many 5 star reviews (over 2000) that this would be a safe bet.  I was wrong.  Cursor has epileptic fits.  Resuming my search for a wifi mouse that works.  sigh.
 I like it, recommend this product
 Was a great mouse until it stopped working for no apparent reason after just a few months (tried using the receiver on multiple USB ports, checked the batteries, turned it off then on - nothing worked). It also went through the batteries in just a few months. From my perspective, it's a good mouse if you're ok with replacing it every few months.
 I'm not usually the harshest critic in the world. This mouse worked greatly however, after some time.. about a year now, it has a hard time connecting to my laptop. I am not sure if it is due to battery or what. But this is kinda annoying.
 Basic mouse that was intermittent, jumpy and definitely not smooth. Yes, it kinda worked but do yourself a favor and don't go cheap on this one. Sorry Amazon; you need to build a better mouse(trap)...
 Plug in two AAA batteries and you are off and running! An Off switch to save the batteries and storage for the receiver under the battery lid makes for nice packaging. Two buttons and a wheel gives you plenty of functionality in a little package; and It is smaller than a typical mouse. This is good for being mobile, but with larger hands I would not want to use this as an all day input device.
 I got 99 problems, but a mouse ain't one.
 best wireless mouse that i have used so far!
 This thing is great. It's small but that really doesn't bother me, I can't strand using the touchpad on my laptop.
 Muy bueno
 quit working properly after 2 months
 This works so well and for the price it does stand up amazingly well to the wear if constant transportation.
 Great mouse.  Inexpensive.  Works as advertised.
 Typical wireless mouse.  Works well. I have had no issues.  I would buy again.
 It works perfectly. Only thing is that the battery goes in slanted, so some people may take a minute to figure that out but otherwise, it works perfectly. I like the texture and feel of it as well.
 Gift for my son - he loves the mouse.
 Mouse shakes way to much on certain areas of screen. Not using it going back to HP wired mouse. Saving it as backup since it was cheap. Not recommended.
 bought them for the office nice low cost no frills mouse perfect!
 Cheap mouse to carry along with my laptop everywhere I go. Serves its purpose well and was easy to link up to the computer.
 I purchased 2 of these and while they work great, the batteries continually pop out opening the batter cover.  One mouse the batter cover popped off and I did not realize so it is no longer usable.  The other I have tape on the cover but the batteries still keep popping it open. Ugh
 The first mouse died in less than 4 months of light use. Amazon replaced it and I am hoping the replacement lasts longer. It is the perfect size for travel.
 Works well, responds well.  I've had this for several months now and only needed to change the batteries once.  I've never had an issue with it disconnecting or jumping around.
 Using this at work, 40 hours a week. Batteries last about three months. Feels almost as good as my logitech g602 at home.
 works well but does use batteries a little more frequently that my old one but still using it
 Very small and compact.  Great price.
 Perfect and so easy to use.
 amazingly great. will start shopping amazon basics from now on.
 Basic mouse, great price!
 Had a corded mouse at work and hated it! Invested in this little rascal and I love it. Easy to install (and I'm a nurd when it comes to computers) and comfy for my hand (what's that called Ergonomics?) I like it so much, I'm going to get another one for home! One thing...remember to shut it off when you go home to extend the life of your batteries...just sayin!
 If i could post of picture of it in the trash, I would.  The casing is shoddy, the usability on putting battery is less than useful (Can't even clearly indicate which direction to put in the battery.  It goes into power-save mode or it has bad battery issues.<br/><br/>This is my first review.  Better of buying Logitech mouse.  They know what they are doing.  Less learned (you get what you pay for).<br/><br/>Hope this helps.
 Like all of the other Amazon Basics products that I have purchased, this wireless mouse works perfectly.  You really can't go wrong with Amazon Basics.
 It works
 very happy
 Connects near instantly and didn't need any sort of software installed. The batteries last a very very long time!
 works okay
 This is a great product for any one looking for a mouse. Had it for a few weeks never had a problem and it works well on all surfaces. The prices is very good and it came fast I would high recommend.
 I liked the design and cost but this product wont last for more than a year! I had to order new one recently.
 everything you want or need in a good mouse for your laptop or desktop .... recommended.
 Plug and play. As soon as I got this I plugged in the USB and went at it. Amazon did an excellent job on this one, feels like it evenly compares to other leading mice such as Microsofts basic mouse.
 I literally had this mouse for 10 minutes and then it stopped working. I don't know whether it's due to the nano receiver or the mouse its self, but the only thing I can use it for now is a paper weight. Overall if you want a reliable mouse I would spend invest in a more reliable product.
 Defective item right out of the box. Cursor jumps around the screen. Buy a better quality mouse.
 I bought this for my son because he kept steeling mine. I was presently surprised by how well I love it. It is well made and just the right size. When my mouse goes out I will definately by this one for me.
 Plug and play goodness.  I use this with my Mac Pro Tower running os x 10.7  you plug in the dongle, add batteries then turn on the mouse.  you can now enjoy smooth sweet wireless mousing goodness.
 Amazing, quick easy set up mouse works for my Windows 8.1 laptop highly recommended, Just need a mouse pad to continue briefing and gaming successfully thanks amazon!
 Used for mac mini server. Seems up to task. OS X was finicky and complained that the keyboard was not recognized but you can get past that warning.
 It does not work over 2 months now. A computer mouse should last longer then that and amazom states past teturn policy.
 The size and functionality of the mouse is fine, but it stopped working approx 3 months after purchase. I changed the batteries multiple times, but it still would not make the mouse work with my PC (Dell) computer.
 Works great. Good distance and is accurate. I play games with it no problem. Battery's seem to  last a long time so far. Good deal.
 Perfect mouse for "throwing it in the bag" and running off! Nano receiver allows me to never worry about unplugging the adapter before I put my laptop away.
 :-)
 Great product---works great and excellent price.  Would purcahse thiw again if needed.
 Works great.I particularly like the built-in place under the cover for the dongle.
 DOES WHAT I EXPECTED
 Great little mouse, heck of a deal.  Comfortable in hand, no connection issues. 100% satisfied.
 Love this mouse. Fast, responsive, light, and connects easily to any computer I plug into. Battery life is great even if I forget to turn it off.
 Works good, and well too.
 The only thing they didn't tell me that it took AAA batteries instead of double AA's... other than that I'm very happy with this item.
 Works perfectly. Good price for a replacement mouse. I will purchase other AmazonBasic product.
 This wireless mouse works great! I bought this for a friend and it works great. No re-do's while using it, no skips, just perfect every time. I received it on time and in excellent condition.
 Excelente todo. 10 puntos
 Uber simple set-up, works as advertised, one less unsightly wire, love it!
 Who knows how it works? Totally useless without the computer plug in Nano receiver that was supposed to be included.
 works great ,great deal
 Plug and Play doesn't work on this mouse.<br/>Amazon should have a place where we can download the latest driver.
 Working beautifully
 Just got this a few days ago. My pc's a toshiba satellite series and runs windows 8. It worked right away, and so far I've had no problems. Will update the review in case of any change.
 Works as expected. I'm happy with this mouse for the price. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Bluetooth mouse.
 Great item, and you can't beat the pricing.  We have 6 register setups in our retail operations, and these were completely compatible with our POS Systems.  Best part is, they really helped clear up the wire clutter on the sales desk!
 Cheap Chinese garbage, it eats batteries and once the batteries get low the mouse goes nuts (cursor jumping all over the place).
 Great little mouse for the price.
 Not well made. Back keeps falling off.  Stopped working after I dropped it once.
 absolutley an amazing mouse, with only 2 slight drawbacsk. 1 The mouse is ever so slighly smaller than your average mouse, but it is a perfect hybrid of dedicated desktop mouse, and portable on the go work mouse. 2 the range of the mouse is not incredibly far, in fact the farthest i have tested it for was 10 feet (at absolute most)
 Great little mouse. I really like the matte coating, and the wheel feels and works well enough. The cartridge for holding the wireless adapter works fine, is easy to open, and secure. Would buy again.
 Great little mouse for laptop mobile users. Has an on/off switch to save the battery when not in use. It does not take up much room in the carry bag either!
 This mouse by Amazon is an absolutely must have. It is sleek, easy to carry, simple to operate and very responsive. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.
 This mouse worked great for about 3 days and then it stopped connecting constantly with my computer. I put a mouse pad down and it would work better for 15 min and stop working again. I had to constantly change surfaces to get the mouse to move on the screen and it would always work for 15 min and stop again. I work at a doctor's office and can't afford to have the patient wait an extra 10 min while i try to get the mouse to move across the screen.
 First one stopped working after a couple of weeks but Amazon replaced it immediately. I haven't had any problems with the replacement one and I love it!
 Functional, wireless, plug-n-play, travel size, inexpensive -- what else do you need?!
 First of all I was looking for a wireless mouse since I had wires all over my desk<br/>When I searched for mice I came upon Amazons  mouse at a price that fit my budget and needs<br/>Worked great right out of the box
 Compact, no delay. The usb receiver can be stored in the mouse (in battery compartment). Comes with batteries. I have wanted to wireless mouse for a while, but never got around to ordering one, if you are in the same situation- get this mouse. Especially if you are on the go, easy to throw in your bag, one less cord to detangle. Would buy again.
 I use this everyday at work.  Works as well as any other mouse.  Will be getting another one for at home
 BASICs - THAT IS WHAT IT IS!  Basic value as well!
 easy to install. love the color
 Works as should, small, and cheap.
 This mouse works well and fits my hand well.
 I bought this mouse for myself after having purchased one previously for my mom to use.  The one I got is a total lemon--it won't connect unless the mouse is within 12" or less of the receiver.  This makes it unusable for me because of the way that I have my desk set up.  The one my mom has seems to work fine so far, but in her case the distance between the usb stick and the mouse is a lot smaller.
 good value for a basic product
 This is a trouble free great mouse.  I have been using it for a while now on a fabric sofa arm. captures without problems.  The battery lasts a long time, I turn it off when not in use.  The battery is easy to change, which is a problem I had with other brands.
 Small and comfortable.  I like the "on/off" feature.  I bought two.
 First shipment was missing the nano receiver. Requested replacement. Second shipment arrived yesterday. Still no nano receiver.<br/><br/>Currently, I have two mice but NO nano receivers. So, basically, I got NOTHING.<br/><br/>Ridiculous!
 It works great, I forgot how much better a mouse is than a touchpad.
 purchased this for my mom so she would stop dragging around a corded mouse with her Windows 7 laptop.<br/>it works really well, has a great feel and texture in the hand and tracks consistently. very pleased, especially for the price.
 The receiver does not have a very wide range. I needed to use one of the USB ports on the front of my desktop instead of the back because of the limited range... otherwise it is has worked well.
 great item
 Excellent mouse! Batteries last a while. I use my mouse at least 3+ hours a day and it's been about 2 months.
 Works as expected.
 Just what I needed for my laptop.  It's just right and I love the small Nano receiver because unlike my other one, it doesn't stick out from the USB port so far that it invites potential damage.  Nice job Amazon.
 Workz great, great price!
 For the money, the Amazon Basics gear is as good as it gets.
 I bought this mouse and after day 2 it was not working. Amazon replaced it and a few month later the replacement one does not work. I will not be buying the AMAZON brand again.
 Worked perfectly out of the box with no configuration needed.  Batteries last a very long time.
 Excellent purchase. For a generic brand mouse....this performs very very well. I see no need to purchase expensive ones like in the past.
 Works perfectly. USB wireless connector fits inside the battery area for easy travel. Not glitchy at all. Great mouse. I bought a second because I loved it. Amazon basic products have proven to be great quality.
 I bought this to control a laptop connected to my TV not as a primary use mouse but i must say for the price this mouse feels premium. Very sturdy and precise. I would recommend this to anyone really.
 Fit's great in the hand.  Worked right out of the box.  Came quickly.  Has good accuracy/resolution for a cheap mouse.  Great price.  This was exactly what I wanted, and all I needed.
 Nice wireless mouse.  I use it for work and so far so good!
 Works great! I only gave 4 stars because the back plastic piece that holds the batteries comes off easy and is very thin. Besides that, it's great.
 Gift that he enjoys with new laptop
 ok
 Works like a charm!!  Inserted the batteries and it took right off.  Didn't hesitate.
 I don't like it because it's too small and the sensitivity just seems to be off a bit.
 works as designed
 Great device
 This mouse is great deal. It's not a gaming mouse, its just a quality basic wireless mouse with a nano receiver. Has a good feel to it. Works exactly as advertised. I have had no issues with it, works well on both my Windows laptop and my Macbook Pro.
 I love the nano receiver, no large objects in USB port.  Mouse is very functional and handy.
 Using it right now. My daily-use mouse for my laptop. Travels with me as well. Zero hassle. Battery life is just fine; by the time I'm replacing it, I don't remember the last replacement.
 good little mouse for the money...very easy to set up.
 Good build quality, feels smooth in hand. Good battery life.
 Worked great. Did have some detection issues on MacOS 10.9. But otherwise great.
 This mouse has great size, a great price, and it works great.  Plug and play and away you go.  Pack it in the briefcase and you always have it along.  I hate touch pads on lap tops, so this is a big thing for me.
 Quit working near the warranty date and I forgot to contact Amazon.  If I buy another wireless, I might try this one again as Amazon has a pretty good warranty if you remember to use it.
 This is a great mouse.  The only drawback is that the scroll wheel is smooth, not ridged, which makes it hard to use sometimes.
 AmazonBasics - their products have held up well. Cords, mice, bags, etc. all good quality.
 What I was looking for.
 I really like this cordless mouse except when I accidentally drop it.  I can't get it  back because it's always out of reach, and my reacher dosen't fit the mouse. I'm confined to a wheelchair.  This mouse doesn't have a cord that I can pull my mouse up.  But this is a very minor problem known only to me.  Otherwise, it is good at scrolling up and down; however, it sometimes gets hung up while scrolling.  Other than that, it's a very good mouse.
 It’s great
 Works great
 This review should be as early as I got it, please forgive my laziness for posting this so late. The mouse is OK when near the laptop. But when several feet away, it responses slow and inaccurate compared to those 30 bucks alike wireless mice. Anyway, before buying, think carefully if satisfy your demand, as you only get what you paid.
 I want to return now.
 Update: After 2-1/2 years, I had to replace this mouse. The wheel became erratic. Also, my experience was that batteries lasted about 6 months.<br/><br/>Works well. I like the nano receiver that I can leave plugged into my laptop.
 the battery door keeps getting lost.
 Works just as reliably and is just as comfortable as Microsoft and Logitech models costing twice as much. Pro user, use 4 to 6 hours per day.
 Converting from 5 star to 2 star. Product worked fine for a year and started giving problems. Now it does not work at all. I like amazon products but this one disappointed me with its life span.
 Great for the price.  Comfortable feel and setup is easy peasy.  Love that I can stash the USB dongle inside the mouse easily when not in use.
 Works as promised.
 Great no fuss packaging, easy to set up, cool matte texture and exactly what we were looking for!
 No regrets.  Great price and great mouse.  I bought two!
 Love it
 As usual, the product arrived quickly &amp; has performed flawlessly since I turned it on.  I am very pleased with the simplicity of this product.  It has met all my expectations.
 This is a good mouse, but I wouldn't buy it for an adult; it's too small for my hands. Maybe for a child.
 I really like this mouse. It's comfortable to hold/use and it works great. I would recommend it.
 Easy to set up. Easy to use (I'm using it right now). Great mouse.
 Have been using this for several weeks now; feels good, good response.  Better than some others I've used that cost a lot more.
 Works good and was a good price. I have had no issues so far and have been using it for a month.
 Good piece offering good value, does exactly what it advertises. It seems well constructed, and professionally designed. I am however not able to testify to its quality over time.
 Works but too small and uncomfortable to use for long periods.  I only use for a few minutes with a laptop I keep in the bedroom to check email and news before I go to sleep.
 Great
 This works great and is a steal for the price. I would very highly recommend it!
 it is a beautiful purple==my favorite color.<br/>it is a bit small for my hand but does work effectively.
 Mouse works fine. Love the ergo magics, fits well in my hand and I have fairly large hands, plug in the chip and it worked immediately..no issues
 We've ordered two of these mice now.  Both were easy to install on both a Mac and Windows 7-based PC.  No special software was downloaded or needed and everything just works.
 Easy to install, comes with battery. light weight and perfect. its worth for money.
 Perfect size for my usage. I prefer the size of this mouse to other large mouses.<br/><br/>I have the USB nano receiver plugged into a USB port on my keyboard so it's completely hidden away and doesn't steal a port on my machine.<br/><br/>Battery lasts at least a couple months without turning the mouse off. That's good enough for me!
 I bought 5 and all of connection problem sooner or later.
 I bought this mouse to replace a "cheapie" bought at a discounter.  After 6 months, the cheapie started to double click when I single clicked, had trouble click and dragging, etc.  This Amazon one, although also not very expensive, feels solid, works on many surfaces, including bed sheets when used in bed with a laptop.<br/><br/>It lost 1 star for a few minor issues.  To save battery power, you need to switch it off with a slide switch on the under surface. Not a problem, but other wireless mice seem to time out the laser.  This did not seem to.<br/><br/>  Another issue was installation.  It installed easily on my Win 7 machine, but the speed of the pointer was way too fast compared to my other mice.  This behavior can be adjusted by going to "control panel", selecting pointing devices, and adjusting the slider to the appropriate speed.  I have never had to do this with other mice, but it is not a big issue.<br/><br/>  Another issue is the clear plastic tab which is designed to help you remove the batteries when they need to be replaced.  It may not be clear to everyone exactly how this piece of plastic needs to be placed.<br/><br/>  Finally, there is a soft button on the underside labeled "connect."  It does not seem to be referenced in the manual which came with the mouse, nor do I see a use for it.<br/><br/>In summary, a great wireless mouse, much less expensive that the "big brands" and does the job well. Would buy again.
 IR connector does not have a lot of range - the receiver USB plug has to be on the same side as the mouse.  Otherwise it's OK for the price.
 I love this mouse. The nano receiver fits into the battery which is nice for storage.
 I got this for my wife . Her laptop had a touchy pad and she loves the new mouse .,
 First wireless mouse I've owned. It works as well as a wired mouse and has no problems.
 Nice size, easy fit in your notebook bag - a great mouse
 Not that great. The contact skips.
 Perfect, small, works great. Exactly what I needed for my chromebook.
 mouse does not make your hands tried. glides easy and on any surface
 Inexpensive, but works well. Just plug in and use. I just it for my laptop daily and it works great. The battery life is also great.
 Nice mouse works well.i use it with my Lenovo Android tablet and on the go cable. Nice setup.
 Nice
 This mouse is not good in quality.  My wife always complains of its malfunctioning.<br/>I have bought some other mouses from Logitech and Microsoft of which are working very fine and smooth.<br/>This mouse freeze and uncontrollable in many cases of which the reason we never know.
 I use this every day for work. I like the look and feel of this mouse. Very good battery life.
 This is a great mouse!! I have been using this for months now - works grat and I am still using the original set of batteries.
 Thanks
 high quality, great price.  Altogether, I've bought 6.
 This mouse works great, tracks accurately and smoothly, and the batteries last a long time. The only time I needed to replace it was when my dog chewed it up.
 I bought this mouse to use with my laptop. This mouse worked for perfectly for one night. The next day I connected it again and it worked fine for about an hour then it disconnected. I tried turning it off and back on and using the connect button. Nothing worked. I do not recommend buying this mouse. Buy a Logitech one instead.
 great product - works very well very happy with the product and performance
 Nice quality and better than most wireless mice. If paired with and external keyboard it would be perfect.
 IT WORKS FINE
 Using it for awhile. Great little mouse at nice price. What more could you ask for?
 Purchased when was just a few bucks more than the wired amazon basics mouse.<br/><br/>Hopefully they'll produce these again, as the feel and operation is great, as is the price/performance ratio when priced as it was.
 Returned item, No opinion!
 Yes, although it's larger than I had in mind. Otherwise it works just fine.
 The best wireless mouse that you can buy in this price range. It works exceptionally well with my Surface 3. The nano receiver is also a nice plus.
 Great wireless mouse. Actually pretty accurate for first persona pc shooters. Although if you are a hardcore gamer it may be lacking.
 Works well! I was able to set it up in 3 seconds and it works perfectly on my Mac with Windows.
 Simple device, works great. Off/on switch very useful.
 Tough little mouse, works great on our black countertop. Excellent price.
 Worked as expected and what a bargain!
 The range on the mouse is very weak. I bought this to work with a computer hooked up to my TV from about 10 feet away but it is unusable at the distance. Only works within 2 feet of the receiver.
 Quick service, works great and the price was unbelievable.
 works great so for
 Great product! Super easy to set up and it works very well. I also love that it is small as I have smaller hands.
 great price and product.
 I bought three of these and they are great. They work perfectly, are easy to use and are affordable. Highly recommend!
 Decent mouse for the price but the main button sticks a lot, which makes it make a very loud click when pressed, which is very annoying.
 Small, but didn't need much only using this mouse in meetings.
 Works even on my TV set. Very good product.
 batteries included and in dongle out which is stored near batteries plug and play good stuff!
 Works fine on the arm of my recliner. Doesn't seem to have an auto shut-off though. First set of batteries died in a little more than a week.
 Comfortable and easy to use. Great quality and design for the price.
 Good size for small hands. Plug and play with no issues.
 Why buy more a more expensive mouse? This one works great and is low cost.  It's a winner.  I will buy another soon for my other computer.
 I am beginning to appreciate the "Basics" line.  This was as advertised...everything you want and nothing you don't need.
 Plug and play, very convenient. Small size with responsive buttons, nice scrolling mechanism. Would buy again.
 Great mouse. Batteries don't need to be replaced often. Thought it might be a little small but it's perfect.
 Thank you Amazon for this amazing mouse! I love it and works great!
 worked well from Sept. until Feb 9th.  I don't think that speaks well at all for this product.
 Perfectly serviceable little mouse.  Seems to hold up fine after the first two months of use.
 Work like it should
 GREAT.  Sleek, responsive and packaging was great.
 Just prefect.
 Nice, simple, and works well.
 Good mouse but I find it a little touchy. Not as good as others I've had. Works better if microreceiver USD  is not in back of desktop.
 Works well. Gifted to my apartment mate. He likes it. Personally, I decided to get a BlueTooth one.
 Absolutely wonderful build quality. The switches in both the left and right mouse buttons have a good amount of resistance, as does the switch below the scroll wheel. The battery compartment is angled and includes a plastic battery removal tab, making it easier to install and remove the batteries.<br/><br/>As far as weight is concerned, this is one of only a few wireless mice that I've used (in this class, at least) that doesn't feel cheap. With the batteries and USB receiver onboard, the mouse comes in at roughly 91.6 grams. In terms of ergonomics, the shape and size of the mouse will be relatively accommodating for a variety of hand sizes and grips, making this mouse a safe purchase at this price range.<br/><br/>I'd also like to comment on the texture/material that's used on the top exterior of the mouse. It's a smooth, almost velvety plastic that works very well on this type of device. I'd imagine that it would work quite well for people who have a hard time gripping smaller mice for long periods of time.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm very pleased with AmazonBasics approach to the wireless mouse.
 It gets the job done.  I recommend it without reservation
 Perfect! Fast shipping and perfect for my notebook!
 Works perfect. Not too small for a large hand.
 This is what you would expect. A basic wireless mouse. It works well, installs without a problem and is relatively comfortable. I also like how the wheel doesn't click like some others I have used.
 Great oruce
 It was great while it worked. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my son. He loved for a little over a month. but it is no longer working. The right click button no is working.
 This products connection is spotty at best. If anything is in front or between it works poorly
 This is a great wireless mouse for the price.  I have now purchased 3 of them - for work, home &amp; laptop.  Great product.
 Well made and installed with no work. Just plugged in the USB adapter and the mouse worked immediately. Very responsive and has a nice little compartment to stow the little USB adapter when not hooked up. Great price!
 The mouse works well. Battery life seems fairly good. Time will tell how durable the mouse will be. So far so good.
 This is a great mouse and the nano receiver works great as it has a slot built into the mouse if your need to take the receiver with you for another device. highly recommnd great price
 I love this mouse. It's super easy to use. Just insert the USB stick into my MacBook, and there it goes. No software to download.
 Came very quickly and has been working great.
 Works great!
 I owned it for about a month and it seems to work as well as much higher priced brands.  In general, I've had good experiences with these Amazon Basic products.
 Bought for my 12 year old grandson. He was happy that clip adapter had storage in mouse
 Excellet product for the price.  I like buying "Amazon" brand items......always good quality.
 Cut and dry amazon basics don't need much more comes with Bluetooth USB and batteries
 Mouse failed after around a year of usage. Standard Chinese white labelled product with poor durability,
 Love this. Plug &amp; play, no issues at all. Great buy!
 It did not work on Swann DVR. But it work on andriod tv box.
 Utterly useless. It lasted exactly 14 months before it died - and left the cover for the USB stuck in the USB port in my computer. I use Amazon a lot, but their actual products are really crappy. This mouse, for example, and their "rechargeable" batteries that don't recharge and, if they do, only hold a charge for about a day and a half. I'll keep buying stuff from Amazon but I'm done with their brand products.
 This mouse is similar in size to my Logitech M215 (which I find to be a normal size). Plugged it into my Acer Chromebooks (CB3-111-C8UB &amp; CB3-111-C670) and had INSTANT connectivity. The USB felt snug when I plugged it in, but it works great! Highly recommend this low-cost, high-quality item.
 Easy to use and batteries come from amazon. Which is much better than others.<br/>Scrolls working slimly, no any issue.<br/>Not much small and not big...fits for my hand and fingers.<br/>Doesn't matter on which place mouse handed...works for all type materials and colors...
 Love Amazon basics because it works and is inexpensive! It is great not having another wire to get in the way and it works perfectly!
 Bought this about a year ago now and it's still working great! This is a real good mouse for on the Go. Gaming wise, I haven't tried it. Anyway I do recommend this to everyone. The battery life is great.
 Great mouse....but wish it was bluetooth enabled.  You have to use the USB dongle.  I'd given it 5 stars if it had.
 Not much to add to this review. It works exactly how a wireless mouse should world. Very comfortable to use. (Not sure if this is relevant, but I have small hands and it's not an issue).
 Great wireless mouse.  Seems to last forever on a single set of batteries.
 Good Service, I recommend it 100% Thank and good luck...
 Extremely disappointed with this mouse. It lasted only 2 months before it stopped working entirely. Tried changing the battery, but it was absolutely dead. Went back to Logitech.
 I like this better than full size mice. Very comfortable and responsive.
 So far, a month or so after purchase, all aspects of its performance have been very good.  Bought a second one.
 The battery compartment is not designed well. It  is hard to get them in and out. The mouse is slow too.
 Works great!
 Simple, effective better than the more expensive Macally mouse that way over-scrolled. I just threw the Macally out.This was just what I wanted. Worked out of the box for may Mac with Mountain Lion 10.8.5
 Plug and play operation. Very ergonomic. Good feel and comfortable to use. Great value.
 worked great until it fell off my desk. Trash now.
 it really should turn itself off once its been idle for a while; i forget to turn it off so it goes through batteries. compact size would acutally like if it was a touch smaller
 This mouse is great!! Just what I was looking for. Not too big, not too small. Works every time i turn it on.
 Good price, very small transmitter, does what it should.  No nonsense device that is just what I was looking for.  I run two of them next to each other on my desk and have no problems.
 Perfect!
 With only two AAA batteries, this mouse works as well as the wireless mouse I have on my desktop. Cost far less than the use I receive.
 Outstanding value.
 Easy set up appears to work great...... will update review if problems crop up .......... but for the present ITS GREAT..!!
 works great and has an on/off switch to save the battery
 Trust Amazon quality and prices.
 Works and looks great!
 the pointer can be somewhat off but for the money its ok!
 I first purchased this AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse a year and a half ago. The mouse is great, but the nano receiver it terrible. I have had to have this mouse replace three times because the nano receiver failed and the the third one just failed as well. I can get the mouse to work if I jiggle the nano receiver a bit, but I can't keep it working once I let go. The first one I had lasted about a year, the second one lasted about three months and my third one failed after a month. Not really sure what is going on with these. I'm not hard on my stuff, so I don't know why these are not standing up.<br/><br/>The mouse is otherwise a good design. It's a little smaller than a typical mouse, which is great for travel and smaller working spaces. Up until each receiver failed, they mice were really responsive, the click wheel was good and the amount of pressure it took to click was perfect. I love the mouse, just wish i could actually use it.
 it's a mouse and it's cheap.  3 buttons (middle also scrolls)
 I don't know if I just got a lemon or what, but this mouse works...sometimes. Most of the time the mouse doesn't work at all. Then when it sorta works, it doesn't work in a way that's helpful (super laggy, not actually moving across the screen, just jittering in place). It's by far the worst mouse I've ever used.
 I am very satisfied with the Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver. I love it. Works wonderfully. Was exactly what I hoped it would be. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
 I have bought two so far. Been very impressed. No issues at all. Highly recommend.
 Mouse is good and works great. But the mouse adapter stopped working within 2 years. Need to by new mouse all togather.
 works well. I like it
 I rarely leave reviews but this mouse is so frustrating that I need to spare all potential buyers. I bought this in March (6 1/2 months ago) and have since had to change batteries 3 times. Somehow, it eats up the battery charge in just a few weeks. So I've spent as much on batteries as on the mouse. Do yourself a favor and buy another one.
 Great product at a great price.
 The only thing I do not like is having to take the battery door off to put the reciever in. Otherwise, clicks nicely, scrolls nicely, moves smoothly.
 Simple, inexpensive and works great!
 It's totally functional as any other mouse you can get at a seriously low price!! Just as responsive and comfy to use. Love it!!!!
 Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver...works just fine right out of the box. It get 5 stars because it is plug and play and it works.
 Piece of junk it lasted about 4 months!
 Awful, don't waste your time with this. I've tried two of these and both suffered from the same issue. Within a few weeks of purchase the mouse cursor becomes jittery. It becomes so severe that it's unusable.
 I loved this mouse, but it stopped working after a few months.  Amazon sent a replacement that I've had for a couple months and the same issue happened again.  Tried multiple replacement batteries, but that was not the issue.  After 2 defective mice I am moving on.
 Exactly what I needed for my Chromebook!
 Stopped working way too soon, even after replacing with new battery
 Very solid little wireless mouse, especially for the price. Comfortable, perfect weight. Original battery still going strong.
 Wow. Was i surprised by how great this works. I had purchased a name brand mouse to go w/ my new laptop and that died. thought, what they hey, i'll try this one, it's not that much. Love it! (Do wish it had the scroll left-right option on the wheel) but, hey, at this price. Love it!
 Reliable and use as a second mouse
 Works very well.
 I purchased this mouse to replace a corded ASUS mouse that came with my computer. This is my first experience with a wireless mouse and I am not impressed with the performance. The mouse pointer will move on it's own while it is just sitting there on my mousepad without anyone touching it. It also lags and skips a lot. The batteries are brand new. I wish I had just gone with another corded mouse.
 Mouse was great until it died after barely a year. Reading other reviews, I am not the only one
 It is eating up batteries as fast as I can replace them.  I don't use it much at all.  Would like one that works.
 Excellent delivery timing and product!
 I've got to keep turning it off and then back on to get it to sync up otherwise its very laggy. This mouse is junk
 Piece of junk. Do not trust the wonderful reviews. It stopped working after few times of use, and surprise surprise can't be returned.
 Does not work with Mac. Had one that was having connect issues with 2 macs. Sent back for return. New one didn't work either.
 This product performs as advertised. I will purchase again if needed.
 it is great. I bought another. One for home and the other for work.
 No problems. Works as well as any wireless mouse I've ever had
 Works Great. I use it from across the room about 10 feet, and don't even have to point at receiver (tiny USB plug). Can point it practically anywhere and it works! It's much better that the MS mouse that came with the computer! Highly Recommended!!!
 worked for  few weeks and now it keeps losing sync every minute. I tried changing batteries and resetting but it works well then a see the red light flashing and it goes dead.
 The mouse worked okay, however the left click you really have to push hard, could be a little smoother. Otherwise it's just fine.
 No comment
 Not sure if I'm being to harsh only giving 4 stars because this Mouse works great. Just was replacing a logitech mouse I lost and that one would go months without needing to be turned off or change the batteries. This one doesn't last quite as long.
 Worked and compatible.
 Works great!
 Works just as well as Logitech mouse.
 I'm always impressed with Amazon product quality, and this is not exception. It arrived quickly, works perfectly, and is priced competitively. Very fast, no drag or delay.
 The mouse is not precise. The pointer moves erratically from time to time, at around 5 pixels of diameter. No mouse I've ever owned did this. I don't think I'll get used to it.
 Great mouse, works very well.
 A bit small for my man hand but this one was for the kids mostly and it works very well.
 I ordered this mouse by accident (I need a bluetooth one) but now my mom and brother use it, and they both really like it.
 VERY AFFORDABLE AND NICE TO USE.
 Batteries way too difficult to install/remove
 good product
 Works great.
 I expected the mouse to be a little more responsive. It is somewhat delayed and slower than other wireless mouses I've used. I would recommend another brand over this one. Just based on the speed and responsiveness, especially if you are using with multiple screens.
 so far so good
 It's big and clunky, but dependable.
 It's become my daily use mouse, but I don't like that the scroll wheel, when depressed, switches into the annoying "screen scroll" mode.
 stopped working about a month after I got it
 This mouse is great for anyone who is operating a laptop and is looking for more control of their pointing and clicking. I am a man with a relatively large hand, so you can know that this mouse will fit most hands. Overall a good purchase.
 They just work.  Can't beat the price .  Very handy and fit in portable bags very easy.
 for autodesk Maya app. which require 3  button mouse
 Bought this for my son's laptop. It works great for what he uses it for (games and Internet). Awesome price.
 Work just as good as my other Microsoft wireless mice, and a lot cheaper.
 Works great.
 Great price great product. I bought this for my surface pro 3 and it's worked great. g2g buy it
 Smaller than it looks. Had hoped I was getting a full sized mouse but this one is more like a portable mouse size. Works well though.
 worked perfectly, right out of the box.  Even came with batteries, fits my hand well. (6"4", 275 lbs)
 Love Amazon Basics! Cheap but not tacky-lasts longer but won't breakdown anytime soon and goes for ever or till you buy a new one!
 Great mouse. Works great. Highly recommend.
 Works great, easy on my hand and good value.  I travel with this mouse so I really like that I can put the fob inside the mouse for safe keeping
 Compact, easy to use, works great.
 I need a mouse that can function 5 ft away from the case and this fit the bill perfectly.
 Nicer than expected.
 Been using this for about a month.  Works well &amp; price was great.
 The package arrived on schedule.  I plugged it in to my Dell Computer, and it works perfectly.  What more can I say?  Great price too.
 Good value, nice looking, and good tracking and scrolling... It's not as comfortable as a full sized mouse. It might work well for smaller hands (I have medium sized man hands).
 Tiny. Never managed to install the driver on any of three machines. A cute paperweight and prank device.
 Great &amp; inexpensive mouse. An extra perk is that it's durable. This mouse has fell SO MANY times and it still works.
 Perfection, Easy to use, directions are simple, perfect for me!
 use it with our laptop all day
 Its a mouse, works well.  Fits my hand well. As expected for Amazon Basics.
 Very Good quality at affordable price. awesome product, fits perfectly in your hand. Must have for laptops, makes working so much easier.
 Great product for the price and considering it's Amazon branded.  Easy to set up.  Buttons and middle roller-ball work with ease.  No problems with the red sensor.  Fits great in my hand but might be a bit small for very large hands.
 best mouse on the market
 Very nice, cheap mouse. Plug and play, and basic. Can't ask for much more from an 8 dollar wireless mouse.
 Works great. Like the smaller size. Bought a second for my wife. Both working flawlessly.
 Great little mouse, works awesome, and like that you can store the usb plug inside the mouse.
 easy to set up! works great with my mac, i ordered two
 Perfect little mouse. Does the job, thanks for the great product Amazon! And great price. I have a Microsoft surface and it is a nice addition.
 Needed driver to get working, but its a decent mouse for the super low price.
 Works perfect, never falters
 A little smaller than I expected but I've since gotten used to it.
 Work as expected.  I picked up a couple of these for my kids to use with my laptops when they are playing Minecraft.  They install simply on both PC and Mac - just plug them in and they work.
 Garbage mouse.. after about a month it would randomly cut out/ loose connection with the nano receiver.  A month and a half in it completely died.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Spend the couple extra bucks and get a real brand.
 Convenient and easy to use.  However, when used with the HP laptop with touch pad active causes problems with typing errors.  Deactivating the touch pad is an exercise requiring much trial and error.
 Great mouse for basic funtionality.  The battery life is good, connects quickly.<br/><br/>Great for the price.
 perfect
 This does NOT work with PlayStation 4 despite information listed elsewhere.
 Wonderful!
 Love it.  Fits my hand very nicely.
 Very inexpensive, easy to "install", and works great!
 I use this as a travel mouse and carry in my laptop bag.  Works as promised and the batteries last forever.  I would highly recommend and purchase again.
 Bought it for my MacBook Pro 6 months ago. Purchased it again for my iMac
 Exactly what I needed. Good for price!
 At first I loved this wireless mouse, but after just 2 months, it just stopped working and my laptop just says, " unrecognized USB device." This mouse never left my desk side table and was hardly used, let alone any travel or hard weta and tear. I'm very upset that a product from Amazon was such poor quality.
 working very good
 Do not purchase.  13 months old and have to constantly jiggle the nano receiver to maintain communication with mouse.  Just not what i expected from an Amazon endorsed product.  Buying Logitech this time.
 Good mouse except pressure on the scroll wheel changes the mouse function to rapid scroll, and I cannot find any documentation to show how to change this.
 Works as expected.  No issues.
 Love this mouse. Use if all the time and have had no issues with it! Runs smooth.
 Awesome. 100% recomendable
 it didnt last long
 Perfect!
 Mouse is ok, had to replace the batteries after 3 months.
 Using it right now-really like it
 I've tried several different types of wireless mice. This one has worked far longer than any other I have tried. I think I have three of them now.
 Mistakenly ordered this - needed bluetooth instead of USB.
 Great Little Mouse!!!  Love the range and response!!
 Far and away the most comfortable mouse to my hand that I've ever had.  And it is responsive and worked right away, unlike some other ones I tried.Great product.  I love the Amazon Basics line.
 I love this mouse. Everything you could ask for at a great price.
 Works well on Window xp
 Good quality mouse at good price!
 It is working better than expected.  I expect a lot....Yes I was surprised that this item worked so well right out of the Gate.<br/><br/>Don't look at price you may not buy because it is worth every penney..........SO Far...So Great
 Just don't drop it (duh) - batteries will fly out.<br/>It's a solid performer - need nothing beyond this/
 This mouse works great.  No software to load.  And it even works on my smart tv. If you are looking for an inexpensive mouse this should be your first choice.
 Unfortunately, this mouse has a very poorly designed battery compartment, requiring batteries to be slid down into the casing at a strange angle, making it extremely awkward to manage positioning them properly. Moreover, the mouse only lasted a few months before failing completely and having to be replaced. Would absolutely not recommend to anyone.
 Great product works well and as advertised I have used one of mine for over a year without changing batteries-- well done.
 Good price fast shipp Comes with batteries and ready to roll
 Very good, basic mouse. No issues at all after a year.
 This mouse works perfect!  It's a super easy plug and go model.  I love the scroll wheel too.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to a friend.
 WOrks great but the buttons squeak when I click...weird.  But...it's not like it was expensive. I'm living with it.
 Had this product for a while now and works great for a great price
 gotta love amazonBasics
 I 'm loving all Amazon products . my experience with them has always been the best . if you really need to save space and get comfortable to work in any space, this is the mouse you want. I recommend it
 I love most of what Amazon has to order, but this product is a bit of a disappointment. I've ordered two of these and both times, the cover on the back has broken. There is a small piece that holds the cover in place and it easily breaks.
 Best kind of "mouse in the house"!
 Works great, replaced a 10 year old Logitech mouse that I really liked and no longer available.  No issues on install.  I really like Amazon's no frills packaging.  All is recyclable!
 Works with Boss DVR
 This mouse was lightly used but broke anyway - the battery cover broke and kept kept falling off rendering it unusable.
 Was a gift to my son<br/>He really like it<br/>Thanks<br/>Minton
 works like a mouse good battery life, I know because I keep forgetting to turn it off.
 We buy these wireless mice in bulk for our nursing home for employee and resident use.
 Great value, great feel, works great. It's just a great basic mouse. Great.
 Does not work after 9 months of moderate use. Going back to a Logitech mouse
 Easy to use, reliable, and no at all expensive.  Recommend this mouse for anyone looking for a new, or replacement, mouse.
 I bought another on for my work laptop!
 good quality
 Stopped working right about when the warranty expired!
 First one acted like the “brand new” batteries needed to be changed. Returned it and got another one. Same issue.
 Seemed like a good price, but not really as the USB insert stopped working before the batteries had even run out.
 Great size, great value, great performance.
 Great mouse.  It's not too big or too small and very comfortable.  It feels substantial.
 Easy to set up and use. Best investment ever!<br/>:)<br/>Thank you for a superior product at such an amazingly good price!!!!!<br/>&lt;3  &lt;3  &lt;3
 Bulletproof. Never fails. Battery lasts forever.
 just s backup wireless mouse
 Solid little mouse. I like how you can insert the receiver in to the battery port, nifty way how not to lose the thing.
 As expressed by another reviewer, the latch on one of the battery slots wouldn't hold the battery, preventing me from inserting a fresh one, making the mouse unusable 4 months after purchase.
 best for the price
 Did not work properly, returned.
 Great mouse. Would by 100x again.
 This mouse is easy to use. I also like that I can turn it off and on when not in use.
 Great price &amp; great product :)
 Easy to use.
 I would not have bought it it is a waste of money wouldn’t ever recomend
 I had this about a month before I used it; it lasted through less than two weeks of use. I am very disappointed. This is not usually the case with Amazon products.
 My device stopped working after 3 months. Have not been able to contact the manufacturer to get it replaced. I have purchases another device that is name brand. I guess you do get what you pay for.
 I really dont think you can get a better mouse for this price point. Very well made with a nice feel to it for your fingers.
 Very good value. One issue is battery life, I try to be "religious" about turning it off when not in use. It does all the mouse things you would expect well.
 I lose these things all the time . Right now using a Logitech 10 dollar mini that I prefer to this, but I do meets like mate finish.<br/><br/>If you have the money get one of the Logitech that meets your needs.
 Actually I really do love this mouse in every way except a very important one...it crashes my Dell Laptop...over...and...over...again.  I just bought a Logitech Mouse and my laptop is doing fine.  Other than that I love the design, feel and performance of the Amazon mouse.  This is probably just a problem unique to my system, so I do not want to discourage others from buying it.
 Works well and takes up little space on my crowded desk.
 Wow what a great value. I have used this mouse for 6 months with no problem. These Amazon Basics things like mouse and keyboard work well and are such a good deal for the price.
 I have put it to good use!
 Battery compartment cover won't stay on. Very annoying. Good functionality
 Works like a charm and we didn't have to pay twice as much for a brand name.  I always love good value for the dollar.
 Works great.
 The only reason for removing a star, is because the mouse feels too small in your hand (I have average sized hands, nothing big). Other than that, works as advertised.
 Can't believe how good this inexpensive mouse works!/Responsive and doesn't interfere with programs or devices! Love it!
 Very nice little mouse to have around. Very handy
 Nice for price
 Increases my productivity during work. Very light and comfortable to use. Would recommend it to everyone.
 Worst quality.. batteries fall out, battery door does not stay on... not good
 I bought my last mouse from an electronics store and this one is much better!  Glides smoothly, super ergonomic.
 Works like a charm! It even came with batteries, which I didn't expect. It's nice to not have any drivers to install too.
 Does its job, no more no less
 WONDERFUL PURCHASE....OF LITTLE COST...GREAT PERFORMANCE,,,THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS FOR THE CONSUMER, LIKE ME, WHO APPRECIATES AMAZON'S DEPENDABIILITY AND GUARANTEES.
 Works perfectly with my Chromebook right out of the box. Just installed the batteries, plugged the low-form-factor receiver into a USB port, and turned the mouse on. I have smallish hands so the mouse fits my hand perfectly -- someone with large hands might find it a bit too small.
 I like this mouse so much I've replaced two others with it.  Does exactly as the more expensive brands do, might even be a bit easier on  batteries.
 I have used similar products in the past but this one exceeded my expectations beyond words. Works great and don't have any issues!
 versatile mouse with basic functions. it's very lightweight with no connectivity issues. the usb connector is easy to lose, so just make sure you don't take it out of the computer or make sure you leave it in the slot by the battery inserts,
 Great quality. I posted an earlier review but it was meant for another item.
 This mouse has made me so happy! I hated the mousepad on my laptop. The damn cursor was always jumping somewhere unpredictably.<br/>Then, I finally got around to ordering this mouse.<br/>It's the little things. Right out of the box, stuck the batteries in and inserted the USB/Bluetooth transceiver.<br/>It has worked like a charm instantly, and ever since. I've left it turned on overnight a few times, and the original batteries continue to work,<br/>going on two months and still strong....recent update; the original batteries lasted seven months, until just last week.<br/>The mouse has dropped off the table several times, and survived with no problems, other than the battery cover popping out when it bounced.<br/>The mouse operates consistently, with predictable precision. I had forgotten how convenient a scroll wheel/button was. This mouse is a delight.<br/>The pets are thankful for paucity of swear words that formerly punctuated the relative silence of our kitchen.<br/>My hands are thankful.<br/>Thanks you AmazonBasics!
 Mouse arrived but no "nano receiver" that was supposed to be "stored between the two batteries". Without the receiver it's just several ounces of plastic junk.
 Works well with my MacBook Air.
 Great mouse.  Cheap price.  Love Amazon Basics.
 Perfect for what I need
 Good quality
 Good mouse. Just missing Back/Forward on middle button
 It lasted 13 months, one month past the warranty date. Can't return it. If I knew it was a disposable mouse I would have tried another. Worked great while it was functional.
 The USB drive got broke and got stuck in my laptop after a month of use.  Very poor quality.<br/>.
 basic product, good price
 As advertised - works very well.
 For such and inexpensive mouse it works great!
 Easy to set up.  Works great!
 I use this for work, so for business purposes, this is a great no-frills wireless mouse. I've had no trouble with it. Works on all surfaces I've tried, and the battery hasn't given out in the 9 months or so that I've used it.
 Love this Red Hot mouse! I love everthing Red, red car, red shoes, and now a red mouse.  I no long lose my mouse the red color makes it easy to find in all the clutter that ends up on my desk. And it work great too!!
 Very easy to use.. love the color
 Worked well for 3-4 months then stopped all of the sudden.  I've tried everything.  I have been a heavy user and throwing it in my bag a bunch.  Good mouse, but treat it nicely - a little less durable I think than other wireless mice.
 While I am satisfied with the quality of the product, but the reason I am giving it only 3 stars is because of the poor battery life the mouse manages. This mouse is an optical mouse, not a laser mouse. That is, it uses bright red light for movement tracking which leads to poor battery life (300 hrs on 2 AA batteries as mentioned on the paperwork). In the long run, I think the advantages of low product price will be overcome by cost towards batteries.
 I bought this not realizing that it was a travel size mouse.  Shame on me.  I like it all the same though and for the price it's a great buy.  Works well and didn't need any drivers to use.
 The item works great just as described and connected to the computer right away. Makes me regret using a mouse with a cable for so many years.
 great price
 Went caput in less than 2 months.  Beware of low priced items, there is a reason
 Functions well but has terrible battery life. I'm replacing batteries  every couple weeks. This is significantly worse than other mouses. Given the pricing this is an acceptable trade off.
 hate it, bought first one, stop working within 3 months, i thought i got a bad one so i purchased a second, and it is not only two months, the mouse pointer started flashing in the screen already, sometimes you cant even find your mouse on screen
 Good value
 Great product and supper buy. Thanks
 Again. Great product from amazon
 Just like their 9-volt batteries, simple box, easy to open and excellent quality!<br/><br/>Keep it up Amazon
 This one is for my friends birthday gift and its an nice gift to anyone. I have no idea about how does it works . I hope it will do its job as described.
 Works beautifully, smooth operation.
 its the perfect little mouse
 Great product shipped fast would recommend to a friend
 Range Limited, does not work well when dongle plunged into back of computer.
 Functions like a "Microsoft" mouse, at half the price. Hopefully it will last longer. I bought two; won't hesitate to buy again should the need arise.
 Easy to use and works extremely well.
 Connects in little to no time at all. Kind of touchy compared to my old mouse, but I'm sure I will get used to it.
 These are budget friendly and easy to set up in a matter of seconds. Bonus...batteries included!
 This mouse is the best.  Just turn on your mouse and your Bluetooth and away you go, great with my new Acer Chrome!!
 Nice easy way to get a new mouse.  No complaints.
 Wonderful mouse. Right feel, right size, right price...
 Very easy to use. Fits the hand well.
 Great! Couldn't be happier!
 Works well.
 This mouse is not good at all , it disconnects every few minutes
 Great response, compact yet ergonomic, great battery life, good range.
 This thing is great! I have it at work. Love that it came with batteries and no installation required.
 Functional Wireless mouse only problem is thatwhen my lenovo goes into sleep mode I have to remove the USB and plug it back n for the mouse to work.  Not sure if its the mouse or the lenovo.
 Precise, responsive and comfortable; why pay more than you have to?
 Good battery life, works, zero issues.<br/><br/>I wish it had an auto shut off, but the battery life is so good, I'm not complaining.
 This mouse is great, uses very little battery power and is super easy to set up.
 This mouse didn't work properly on any of my devices. I don't know why.
 This mouse is far superior to the one that I was replacing---it is very easy to download the driver, and it is so much more responsive!  I am really pleased with this purchase.
 Works as expected.  Good price.  Tiny USB receiver that doesn't get caught on anything.  Nothing special, just something that does exactly what it is supposed to do at a good price.  That's enough.
 Have been using it for over a month with no problems. Still on original batteries and I never turn it off. Was truly plug-n-play on a MacBook Air.
 liked so much bought one for work
 Absolutely love this mouse.  Works really well, fits nicely in my hand, easy to install.  Love it.
 nice mouse
 Love it!
 works great and is easy on batteries...
 for a few bucks this mouse does the job wonderfully. I wouldn't buy anything more expensive for something that works so well.
 Works fantastic and has a long wireless range
 Average
 Great mouse, the only reason for not giving 5 stars was the lack of batteries in the box. Batteries not included.
 Smaller than expected but works great
 Perfect!
 excelente producto
 Works as advertised.
 Comfortable. Packs away quick and fits in my bag with computer easily
 the mouse itself works just fine (you have to be careful with the plastic inside the battery compartment, and its cover) but the receiver didn't have the metal "clasps" pushed in on the metal part. so the shield always got stuck in a usb port until i pressed them in by myeslf
 The texture is awesome first and foremost, feels expensive. It's nice and light. Basic functions of a wireless mouse, it just feels really good. I just wish they would've used one AA battery instead of two AAA, but other than that it's pretty nice for the price. *BARS*
 Great product. Surprised at how well it compared to more expensive alternatives.
 Easy set up, works great no issues. No point in spending $$$ on a mouse, just get this one. It gets the job done!
 Works great with zero trouble right out of the box. Been dropped/thrown multiple times by my two year old and its still working great. Can't beat this price.
 slightly smaller than I expected, but still fits comfortably in hand... the subtle texturing helps keep it from slipping around or feeling too small
 It went through batteries super fast then quit altogether after about two months
 Love this mouse. Very comfortable to use. I took it to work and use it daily.
 Easy !
 I wanted a small mouse and I this (Amazon) basic one does the job. Comes with a set of batteries.
 It works well with my laptop. I mean, it's a cheap mouse, I got my money's worth.
 not as i expected, works but small range, only my personal opinion , im sure it would be better for someone else.
 This mouse works perfect. It is a smaller mouse but since I have smaller hands it is totally fine by me. For the price it is totally worth it.
 Just got it. Arrived in a timely manner and works great. Will update if I run into any issues.
 This works as advertised.  It's smooth and tracking is good.<br/>The USB receiver is a little larger than my previous Microsoft mouse but that's the only minor issue.
 One hundred percent satisfied.
 It wobbles, but I guess you get what you pay for
 Sometimes signal is gone
 I did not get this product free for this unbias review but it works like a champ!!!  I wish I got it free!
 Awesome product.
 Easy to use, the battery is lasting me way longer than I expected.
 I purchased this mouse about 7 months ago.  the size is perfect for me and it worked great.  The left button stopped working recently.  I contacted Amazon and they replaced it, no questions asked.  Great service and I was back in business with free one day shipping.  Works best for people with medium to small sized hands.
 Not a bad mouse.  It's a little awkward in the way the two AAA batteries fit into the case, but it works fine.
 It is AWESOME-- it may be the perfect mouse. Connects easily and automatically, battery lasts a long time. Easy 5 stars.
 Among Amazon products that I have used so far, this is the best. I have been using this mouse for over a year, and never had any issue. Very convenient to hold, and responsive.
 The clicking action is not as nice as my logitech mouse. Still, for half the price, it is hard to beat.
 Works well with Chromebook.
 Excellent little mouse for an insanely reasonable price.
 Perfect gift for grandson who has little hands!
 ok
 Bought it for my boyfriend as an add on gift. He needed something simple and efficient. Great for at home use or on the go and the price is great!
 Great quality for such a cheap device, fits nicely in the palm. It includes a small USB receiver, that is concealable, and 2 AAA batteries (Amazon Brand).
 Most of the time the pointer flows smoothly across the screen, but there have been occasions when it was jerky.<br/>No indication that the batteries are low, so I'm not sure what is causing the occasional flaw.<br/>Overall, it does the job at a reasonable price.
 I purchased two of these for my husband and daughter and they work perfectly.  The cost was so much lower than the one I purchased for my work laptop.  Wish I had thought to look on Amazon before I made my purchase.
 good basic mouse
 Solid and reliable, medium-to-smaller mouse that cleverly allows the owner to hide the USB micro connection chip in with the batteries.  Haven't had a problem yet - and don't expect one!
 Works well for the price, convenient, just plug the USB in a PC and use..
 I love this mouse. Works perfectly with my Ideapad. Very Portable.
 Simple, affordable mouse that works as you'd expect. Hard to go wrong here.
 The is at a good price, it works fine and looks good. You don't need anything more expensive than this one.
 It works very well so far.  I am glad I bought this instead of another apple mouse.  I hope it will last a few years.
 still use this mouse, fundamentally it is a good mouse. I recommend
 Second one I have bought. It last about 2 years which is good for the price.
 The mouse does not turn off after no use, runs thru batteries
 Just works. Period.
 Very good for price
 I like it. It is solid and a great buy for the price.  I like that you can store the usb thing inside the battery compartment.
 I bought this for my aunt since there was jealousy over wireless mice in my house. She's had it for months and it still works fine; she loves it.
 A great little wireless mouse for mobile situations.  I ordered four of these for my computers and all are working flawlessly so far.
 Works great. I've even had my 5 month old throw it on the floor a few times. Other than the battery popping out it still works. Easy to use. Would purchase again.
 I bought this mouse for my girlfriend and she fell in love with it. Functions well and the fact that it has a dongle slot with in it helps keep the recover receiver protected
 Did not work. Not worth the hassle of returning.
 love it
 Mouse has a mind of it's own and worse can't seem to make up it's mind.  Willy-nilly it stops moving, zooms around and likes to hide out where I can'f find it.  I trusted Amazon and although I am usually happy with them, this is so bad.  Don't bother.  I have to buy another one right now before I damage my computer from frustration.  Bad bad bad.
 I have no complaints about its function up to that time, but a mouse is supposed to last more than a year.  So I certainly would not buy it again.
 Worked seamlessly with my laptop. Was up and running within a minute.
 This wireless mouse works very well for my laptop.  I have had it for several months and had no issues with it.
 Held up well traveling in laptop bag loose and dropping a couple times. Good size. Small plug in laptop that doesn't get caught.
 Great product!
 Works great
 seems to get the job done.
 The mouse is exactly as expected. It arrived quickly and worked right out of the box. I liked that it included batteries.
 Works great---love this. Installs fast and easy
 just a basic mouse but it does the job well. not too big, not too small.
 The mouse didn't work at all, no matter what I did. I'm definitely not satisfied with this electronic purchase.
 Works well but is a HUGE battery drainer.  I went back to corded model after I got tired of changing/charging/replacing batteries.
 It moves the cursor a little faster than I care for but otherwise works great.
 For its price its perfect for my laptop.
 perfect size and everything!!
 Love this mouse! Good price and nice soft feel. Works perfectly with my Mac.
 As advertised.  Good price.
 Love my new wireless mouse!!! Can't wait to start using it. Like the size of the mouse. Will be buying more Amazon Basics.
 For all that I use my laptop which is positioned in the kitchen, this mouse is a real deal for the price.  The only problem I have with it is that it sticks when trying to move up or down a page.
 Amazingly well built mouse for such a price. Works flawlessly on all platforms. Mainly use it with my Linux laptop and works out of the box.
 This is a very good Mouse.  I like the storage compartment of the Nano Receive when it is not in use.  I would recommend this product anytime.
 Good mouse for cheap price.  Can probably find something similar for cheaper.  Works like a standard USB optical mouse.  Nice wheel.
 Great to easy laptop use. One suggestiin..internal battery with USB charger.
 It works. But you get what you pay for.  The wheel is scroll only with no forward/back function; which can be found on similar priced units.
 very good
 Bought this for my boyfriend because he was complaining about having to use his mouse pad to game.  It was totally worth the price and he has had no complaints about it!
 Product as advertised. Would deal with again.
 Love this! The Nano Receiver is always plugged into my 2in1 ultraportable. I with I had bought it sooner! Very comfortable. Very smooth tracking. Love it!
 Very dependable. I haven't had any trouble with it. Works well on most surfaces.
 So far so good. I've had it for almost a week and it does the trick. Got if for my carpel tunnel and I've seen some improvement (although it's not 100% better but it's a start). Not too shabby for the price and works right away when you plug it in.
 Takes a little getting used to but you get what you want for your money.  Sometimes connectivity is a bit delayed but just turn it off and turn it back on will fix it.
 Great price.  So far, so good.
 Great mouse, beyond easy setup! I love that the USB portion is very small, and doesn't stick far out of the laptop.
 Can't complain, especially for the price. Functions the way I want.
 I still can't believe that this much performance, features and ease of use cost so little.
 good
 It works well, with no drama or fanfare on my 2009 Macbook Pro. I wish I had gotten this years ago!
 It's a simple, relatively small, comfortable mouse with a fantastic battery life. Can't complain about anything - product is exactly as described. I've had it for over a year, and have only had to change the batteries three times!
 Great price, easy to set up, and so convenient that it came with a battery already.  My laptop had no problem recognizing it right away.
 As an Autocad drafting student, I need a mouse that is smooth and responds well to any movement. This mouse is that. I can't really say anything bad about this mouse. The price is great and the mouse is great. Great Job  Amazon Basics
 This mouse is awesome! I use it at home and at work.  If you move around at work a lot with a laptop, this thing is priceless!
 great value
 Developed connectivity issues six months later.
 Does what it needs to do, no connectivity issues, cheap alternative to a Mac mouse.
 Great
 Just what I needed.
 Works just fine. Reasonably priced and comfortable in my hand.
 Excellent! Then I can use it wireless and save a lot of space. And also I can click it on the bed easily.
 as described, fast shipping A+
 Love this mouse!  It has a great feel and works great with my ASUS laptop.  I also love the price!
 Works great. Not too big or too small.
 The nano receiver stopped responding and now I can't use it anymore.
 Great mouse at a great price. Recommend getting some rechargable triple AAAs if you don't switch your mouse off regularly like me. Thing seems to eat batteries like candy.
 AWESOME!
 works well
 Well made, soft touch, lots of good details.<br/><br/>On my desktop, the connection is finicky after going past the keyboard, through the desk and to the back of the tower. When it connects, it's awesome!
 LOVE this little mouse! Use it for grad school and recently for work. It's lightweight, tucks into a pocket, and does what I need it to do. Also, the batteries last AGES. Highly recommend.
 Meets our business needs
 Great price for a wireless mouse that just plugs and plays.  Comes with AAA batteries.  Inserted the batteries and the usb dongle in the pc and boom, it was ready to go.  No issues and tracks just fine.
 I own three of these.  I like amazon basics because they work.  This mouse has a great look and it feels solid.  I also appreciate the battery life.
 Not a big fan of this mouse. I feel like it did not communicate very well with it's usb dongle.
 Needed a mouse and jumped the gun with this thing. No regrets so far. And for the price, what more could I have asked for?
 Great price and gets the job done
 It worked great for a while but the wheel surface is too smooth so it slips when you try to scroll sometimes. They need to add ribs to the wheel or select a different wheel material.
 It has been wonderful so far! I use it with my asus laptop, no issues!
 Awesome! So glad I bought this mouse. Easy to connect. I travel and need to take mouse with me. USB stores inside the mouse so everything is together. Super easy to use right out of the box. Great scroll wheel. Glad I caught the Daily Deal the other day.
 Delivered on time and as promised
 Works as it should<br/>Great battery life
 It's great.  Very easy to install.  Thank you.
 Works with my notebook.  Good design and value from Amazon.
 Too small for even my petite wife's hands but works ok.
 So smooth! I love it because it glides easily, is accurate and has a little secret compartment within the mouse for USB storage.
 Feels good, works well, durable
 Perfect
 Have to say this is one of the best mouse I used and it came very quickly I would recommend it
 Didn’t work. Need to return it but not worth paying the return shipping cost.
 I love this mouse. It feels perfect, it's extremely responsive, and the battery lasts a good amount of time. Easy and simple and looks and feels nice as well.
 Great value for the price!  I utilize this mouse both at home and at work.  Storage of the USB dongle within the battery compartment is a nice touch and makes for easy travel.
 I just, got it. and Love it it tracks great.  thank You Amazon.
 Is as advertised.
 Great little mouse for the price. Smaller size great for kids little hands.
 It a little "jumpy" but works decent.  Was a good price.  If I had to buy another one would probably go ahead and spend the little extra for a higher quality mouse.
 Amazon with another perfect cost efficient product
 It worked for a week. I've no idea what happened, but I noticed a tickling noise inside the bluetooth usb.  I have two of these and the one that was connected to the notebook the whole time stoped working.  The other one works fine, so it has nothing to do with the notebook.
 The product died after 7 months.  I thought it was the battery but nothing I did helped fit the problem.
 Excellent control of your curser! Seems will made, no cords to get tangled.
 This mouse has a very small range.  Too small for what we need it for.
 Mouse will not reconnect after Dell laptop goes into sleep mode 50% of the time.  I have to unplug the bluetooth dongle and plug back in for it to work when it doesn't.  Pain.
 Works great and even on surfaces that my old mouse would not... I have a black table.. this mouse worked great on it.  Glad I picked this mouse.
 Great mouse for price!  Works just as well as the day I bought it a year later.  I bit large and the palm portion is kind of high if you are not used to it.
 Broke after dropping it one time—on carpet! Would’ve liked it to be a tiny bit more resilient. Maybe surviving 4-5 drops before kicking it.
 Not too bad for the price.
 Love this mouse.  Good value.  Bought two so I don't have to pack it in my bag.
 works well, and is good for the price but I still prefer the Microsoft version which is a little more ergonomic and has a better overall design and precision
 For the price, I mean what can I say? It does what it is supposed to, and I have had no issues with connection. It works just as well as more expensive standard wireless mouses so why pay more?
 A tad small for me, and I have smaller hands. Will be uncomfortable for someone with larger hands. Otherwise clicks, scrolls, and tracks nicely.
 works great
 Okay product however I have a few gripes listed below in the Pro/Con list.<br/><br/>Pros - Good price, comfortable to hold, good scrolling feedback.<br/><br/>Cons - Tracking/movement not as smooth as other mice, feels a bid cheap when clicking,
 Husband likes it a lot
 Stopped working after 45 days and Amazon does not replace them.
 Works great!
 Excellent wireless mouse with many unique design features.
 Great build quality, ridiculously low price, works with no setup. Super light, even with batteries. Perfect for on-the-go users.
 This product is OK. Seems to float a little. Not my favorite mouse.
 AWFUL. I went through two of these and they both broke within about 2 months. Literally just stopped working out of the blue. Not worth even the $10...come on, Amazon. You should be able to stand behind products with your name on them.
 Love it. Super easy to set up and use. I can move this from one PC to the other in seconds. Even my work computer which usually does not like anything new was ok with it. Why didn't I get this sooner!?
 Mice works. Good price
 Great deal for the price.
 This mouse just like other AmazonBasics products gets the job done. Easy to use and setup.
 If you are into mice, this is the one to beat.
 easy to use, just the right size and great dead during thanksgiving. aaa batteries and dongle storage inside. battery cover can be a pain to remove.
 good product does the job don't over think it just get one.
 Great mouse. It is quite and respond to commands quickly. It uses 2 AAA batteries that comes with the mouse and connects through a small USB port. Great buy!!!
 Great product for the money. Works perfectly. Worth every penny.
 Works great!
 Great item. Don't know why I waited so long to get one. If you don't have one of these for your machine, get one now.
 Works great and is wonderful accessory to laptop, like it better than built in mouse features on laptop.
 The wireless mouse that we bought from Amazon Basics is just what we were looking for. It gives us more room to move around on the mouse pad without the bulky wire that was attached to our old mouse, and the service that we get from amazon is remarkable and we will always order from amazon. Delivery was outstanding and we couldn't have asked for more. Thank You Amazon.
 Great design in every way.
 Works great. I also bought the Amazon Basic Keyboard and it works great too. The keyboard has lasted without a problem for at least 6 months so I think the mouse will last.
 Not good, very cheap. For the price of $1.29 it's very good
 Overall it functions just fine, but it definitely feels cheap.
 Best mouse ever, completely connected with my new HP Laptop Notebook Computer, love it to death
 Fantastic; feels good in the hand, firm and moves smoothly and such a good price.
 Fits nicely in the hand, and is easy to use. No issues with responsiveness.  I have had it for months now, and still on the first set of batteries.  My other mouse was eating them like crazy before it died.
 Works great.
 Amazing little mouse! Fits my hand well and is great for travel and home use. The battery has lasted for a while. Great price! I'm very happy!
 Perfect mouse to use for my work computer. Love the Amazon Basics brand.
 Out of box failure. Did not turn on.
 Love the move to this cordless mouse. This is a sturdy contraption. Meshes perfectly with a new mouse pad and the umbilical is a thing of the past on my aging Dell desktop.
 Good quality, good range,
 Ordered purple for my daughter and received black
 This thing is amazing for the whopping 7 dollars I paid for it. It works perfect on my windows laptop and 2 batteries lasts a long time.
 Pointer started jumping all over the screen after a few weeks. Shoddy mouse, but what do you expect for an $8?
 Gift.  Recipient more than happy.
 First one worked for a few weeks, shame on you, 2nd lasted 2 weeks, shame on me.  YEH IM STUPED AND BOUGHT A THIRD ONE! It lasted 6 weeks or so. I try to be a faithful customer and give you the benefit of the doubt. But, cannot hit thebuy button again. Will try another brand.<br/><br/>CWMONDAY
 Great product for the price. The scroll wheel went bad in less the 2 years of use.
 This is a great little mouse.  It works just the same as the Microsoft mouse but for a lot less.  Just as another reviewer stated.
 awesome mouse, good feel, silent clicks, don't need a mouse pad. design overall is very nice./
 Works flawlessly.
 The price can't be beat, and it's a perfectly good mouse. It does the job, I've never had any issues with it, and the battery life is surprisingly long.
 Just as good as more exspensive ones. Battery lasts long.
 I like this mouse. Its a little slow at times but overall it works great. It's a replacement for my HP Mouse that came with my computer.
 i wanted a plain, basic, plastic mouse ... this is perfect.
 This Mouse seemed fine at first, but it's small size causes cramps in my hand.
 Was not happy because the mouse had to be within a foot of usb dongle to work and my pc setup was not configured to support that.
 I love this mouse so much! I have used it everyday and it makes my life so much easier! I have also dropped it at least 4x. VERY sturdy and has survived my clumsiness.
 Great!!!!!
 There are sharp edges on the sides that irritate the skin on my finger.  I tried filing the edge but only got a larger rough area.
 An exactly great accesory for your computer
 Works just fine and is a nice size - not real large
 It is a fine mouse and works great.  I'm happy and the price was right.
 A friend of mine had one, and I liked it.  I ordered one, and it's working great.
 Broke already.  The left click button doesn't work.
 While not as cool as some of the folding mouses out there, this mouse is a war horse and has made many trips after being thrown into my backpack - keeps on going.
 Works great
 I freaking love this damn mouse! Why buy anything else? Maybe a corded Amazonbasics, or this?
 Great value and as expected. Minimal battery usage, one has lasted me several months!
 No issues here. Awesome wireless mouse! Popped right in and it was ready to go.
 works great
 Great product!  I especially like the fact that it runs on AAA's and I can use rechargeable batteries to keep the cost down.
 We replaced a misbehaving wireless mouse with this one and it seems to work fine.
 This mouse was very easy to install...came with batteries...and was up and running in no time.<br/>Very Good Deal!  I bought 2 of them...<br/>Thanks,<br/>Fred H.
 This is sooo much better than my old one. The receiver is nice and small. The on/off button is really great so you don't have to unplug the receiver. The response is much faster as well.
 Stopped connecting to computer after it took a tumble onto the floor, which it were a little sturdier from Amazon.
 Cheap alternative to other brands - and works just fine.
 Has a range of about 6 inches, waste of money and not even worth the trouble to return it.
 Bought this AmazonBasics mouse to take on a 6 month trip.  Used rechargeable AAA batteries in it.  Batteries lasted a long time, mouse was just the right size for traveling.
 A bit small in the hands (male with smaller hands) but a great deal for a wireless mouse.
 Great price and high quality!  Works great with our new Mac Pro PC.
 Sluggish, inconsistent and imprecise. Worst mouse I've ever used, by miles. If it wasn't so cheap, I'd send it back, but it just isn't worth the trouble. Based on other reviews, I guess I just got a lemon, but this one is almost unusable. I'm going back to my 10 year old Logitech, which has developed problems of its own, until I can order something else to replace this disaster.
 I bought 2 of these and they lasted about 6 months. Don't waste your money.
 No need for a lengthy review. This is a mouse. It's wireless. Easy to use/install. Works great.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something life-changing, this isn't the mouse for you. But as mice go, this one is a good one.
 simple, feels like good quality and works as it should.
 It died in less than three weeks.  you get what you pay for-sometimes.  Not this time.
 lovely and nice .Thanks
 Works well
 Works as described,  Internal dongle storage and battery install/removal a bit tight.  Good BASIC mouse for the price.  Like the size.  Good for portable use w/ laptop.
 Easy set up...just plug in and go<br/>Worth every penny, no bugs, works without losing detection<br/>Perfect and the size is just right<br/>I use it daily at work and think it was well worth it
 convenient to use
 Works great, no complaints
 drop this on any floor...and you will at some point and it will fall all apart. It is an ok mouse but it does come apart pretty easy
 We love Amazon Basics. They make great products. This is our favorite mouse and the only brand we use.
 My husband loves it.  Several others he had, didn't work.  When he set this mouse it worked right off.
 Best bang for your buck. This mouse is a little small. Perfect for a laptop mouse. It moves nicely and the scroll wheel feels amazing. For the price, this is the best mouse you can get (not for gaming).
 Product was usable for approximately one month before it stopped working.  Changed batteries and tried resetting, but stopped working entirely.  Doesn't matter how cheap it is, it should last more than one month.
 NOT compatible with Win 10
 Lasted 3 weeks.  Thought maybe the batteries were needing to be replaced but that didn't fix the problem.  Don't waste your money buy the Logitech instead
 very nice, we're using these on both laptops
 Simple to install (it is actually easier than simple but I don't know what that word is), works perfectly. I may buy more of these.
 great product, great prices and great shipping
 Seems to get a bit jumpy at times and will not track properly on different surfaces.
 Great item.  Compliments my new lap top.  Easy to turn on and use.
 I carry this thing with me daily to school.  It takes a beating from my 20lbs of textbooks in my backpack and still works like the day I got it.  Battery life is impressive
 Perfect for my Laptop
 Love it! I am using it now.
 This works like it is supposed to.  The only caution is the on off switch is on the underside and it's easy to forget to turn it off and drain the battery.
 Extremely easy to setup and use.  I may have missed this in the description, but, this is a small mouse, it's not the size of a regular sized mouse that you would get with a desktop for instance, it's slightly smaller, probably a little bit longer than your middle finger if you have average size hands.  The mouse works great and I would recommend it to anyone.
 NO WIRES, IT WORKS GREAT
 Nice mouse for the money.
 Great travel mouse for my work laptop!
 I bought 4 total so far all good ,but last one battery last maybe a few days . Didn't have time to go buy new ones ???
 Companion gift
 Good buy.
 Literally using it right now.
 This wireless mouse works as expected and I have observed no glitches in its functionality.
 Extremely easy to set up. Works perfectly. I'm ok with technology but not great, and I had it set up and working within 3 minutes from when I opened the box. Excellent
 I purchased this mouse to use with my laptop as I got tired of connecting &amp; re-connecting the wired mouse.  This mouse is smaller than a standard mouse and very comfortable to use.  It works great and I have not had any issues or problems with connectivity.  I would recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a basic, wireless mouse.
 It works.<br/>I like my logitech and microsoft ones better<br/>Make the kids suffer with this one
 Works fine. The mouse has a very small wireless range. You cannot have this mouse more than a few feet from the computer - one wonders why we need a wireless mouse.
 Batteries last quite a while when it is on 24/7.  You can turn off the mouse to save battery life.  Great response time.
 Excellent wireless mouse for the price. It's simple and is exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it.
 I Bought this few months back and it worked well for a while. One day it got damaged automatically. Looks like some internal short circuit.<br/>This is not durable. Don't waste your money on this.
 Cheap and functional , worth the money
 Bought this to use with my mac book pro. Works perfectly. The batteries have lasted great and haven't had to replace the ones if came with. Great price and would repurchase!
 This worked for about 5 months and no longer works. Keep getting an error msg "Device has mal-functioned"
 replacement for the one I was using.  A little smaller, but that's ok.
 I use it for schoolwork and I have to say it's one of the best office mice I've used. Not the best for gaming or anything, but I don't think you'd want to use this for that anyway.
 no issues
 Works very well for those of us who need a mouse because we are touch-pad inept.
 Wife's daily driver for work. She loves it.
 how could you go wrong with an inexpensive mouse...and the Amazon name helps.
 basic mouse. nice rubber grip
 Works great. Well made
 Been knocked on the hard floor more than once, no ill effects.
 Works really well! Amazing product for the price - I'm really digging Amazon Basics.
 Nice for the price
 Good working mouse, plug n play, works really well!
 Imposable to beat for the price
 Wow, it didn't take long before I could use it.  Once plug in, bam, it is running already.  Highly recommended to buy it.
 Does what a mouse should. Works well. I've bought a few of these, with equally good results.
 had some problems getting it to link. but not a bad mouse for the price. i would probably spend a few more dollars next time to make things work easier, but there really isn't anything wrong with this.
 Very nice wireless mouse. It has a good feel to it. I got it for my children to use on their laptop.
 Absolutely love it.. One of the best Wireless mouses I've held<br/>I just got the Microsoft 1850 and it was so disappointing.. This mouse is affordable and works perfectly good. It even comes with batteries.<br/>Thanks a million
 The receiver will not work most of the time. It will sometimes work if you jiggle it, try plugging in over and over again, or use one hand to hold it in place. Sometimes it will work for a little while and then stop again. I am replacing with a bluetooth mouse.
 Bought this for my daughter to use with a tablet. Feels a bit small and fragile to my hand. But it works great for her.
 Excellent mouse.  Good tracking.  Like the on off switch on the bottom to conserve the battery when not using it.
 Does it's job well.  All you have to do is basically turn it on.  The price was right too.
 Mouse has a bad 'feel' - too much of a high curve causes the hand to cramp. - Definitely not comfortable to use.<br/>also - prefer power by one AA battery rather than two AAA.
 Simple. Responsive.  Great price.  Use this regularly and it works great!  This is a great value purchase.  Comfortable in my hand.  Very pleased!
 GOOD
 Have been using this for ~2 months. Great, small comfortable, no noticeable wake-up / response time. Small USB connector. Really good product.
 excellent product!!!
 Just what you'd expect...
 Great for almost a year but stopped working right before a full year. Mouse keeps going on and off even after putting in new batteries.
 Best mouse ever! better than an imac wireless mouse.
 Works great with hp Lenox
 Very happy. Good quality. Even came with batteries.
 works like a charm
 Didn't get the Bluetooth, and its too much of a pain to return.
 Darn. My mistake. I was looking through a list of Bluetooth mice, which I searched for and this one fooled me. It isn't Bluetooth. No use to me. Not worth returning.
 So far so good! Batter compartment is poorly designed. Hard to get batteries out.
 Seems to go through batteries a little faster than my MS mouse, but not horribly.
 love it
 It's a good product and a good price but nothing outstanding.
 Easy set-up. Purchased for my 9-year old to use with his Samsung Chrome Book. He really like it and put it to immediate use.
 Awesome for the price - easy to carry around, sturdy, and very reliable. I've had this for a few months, and has worked like a charm. Highly recommended (like I do for all Amazon basics products)
 Great price and it works flawlessly.  Battery last forever even if you forget to turn off ( which I usually do) and not one glitch in months of using
 bought it in Oct.  It quit working on Dec. 5  Return was no good after Nov. 17th  really disapointed
 Had this for a month, may a tad longer and it already broke. I can't return it either. Not happy
 Product works great and was shipped super quick.
 Palm Perfect.<br/>It's very ergonomic. There is a battery saver off switch.<br/>Great range and signal fidelity.
 Works great. Good value.
 Only bad thing I've found about this mouse is that it tends to go through batteries fairly fast.  Other than that, it's accurate, smooth moving and reliable.
 This item worked as advertised also very good quality. Shipping was fast and on time.
 I bought this mouse in 2016, still work perfectly. I even bought two additional for my friends. So convenient and comfortable when you use it.
 He loves it.
 Great mouse and very good price.
 Works as advertised.  Good price and it works.  What's to complain about?
 After my dogs ate my other wireless mouse, I decided to buy a little cheaper one and to my surprise this was a nice little mouse.  Works great.
 I loved this mouse - while it lasted. I got it in July and it stopped working in October :( I tried all suggested troubleshooting tips listed in the instruction manual, but wasn't able to revive the mouse. Not going to reorder this for sure.
 Awesome little mouse at the perfect price! Nice to not have to use the track pad mouse on my laptop.
 Good basic mouse.  Works well.  Good battery life.  Good price
 Met the job and exceeded.
 I bought this product because it was not expensive and had good reviews. This mouse has lived up to the good reviews. It was easy to install and easy to use.
 We liked this enough that when we lost the receiver for our last one, we bought the same one.
 Works awesome. Batteries last a long time and it just seems to do all that is needed of a mouse for simple use. Not a gaming mouse.
 It's a nice product with a good price. Bought it for my mom and she hasn't have any complaint so far.
 Comfortable, convenient, and gets the job done. Good, clean aesthetics and matte construction that doesn't attract dirt. The battery life is decent; I'm still on stock batteries after about 50 hours continual use. Great mouse.
 Great little mouse, work perfectly and feels good in  my hand.
 Does what it needs to.  I have two side-by-side running two different computers.  Love it so far.
 It was good until it stopped working within 2 months. Battery is fine and my USB ports work for everything else. The computer can't detect the mouse anymore.
 Works great! It comes with batteries (AAA) and the nano receiver fits into the same place as the batteries. My husband's nano receiver he has for a different wireless mouse clips to the bottom of his mouse, so it sticks out and is more likely to get lost. I like how this nano receiver has a special compartment where the batteries are located.
 Cheap and works
 works great on my asus chromebox. plug in the nano receiver, turn the switch to on and go. looks perfectly fine and works fine. 5 stars for it working great and costing so little.
 click click rolly rolly
 Garbage mouse that does not work , no indication clear on how to insert the batteries or dead ,
 It's a good Mouse, is basic, simple, and reliable. If anything I would like them to feature an Auto Off feature so it can save battery. Other than that it's very good.
 Died after a couple weeks' use.
 Great Product, fair price.
 Awesome, though sometimes in CSGO it will spaz out and shoot randomly
 Great mouse, but it chewed through the first set of batteries so quickly! Remember to turn it off when you aren't using it.
 Has worked fine from day one.  Was looking for a simple, reliable wireless mouse.  This is it.
 very reliable mouse.. thus far
 So loud with clicking but it does work perfectly. Thank you
 Love it!
 Works perfectly and great price!
 My college student is very happy!
 Perfect.. Works great. Connected right away. If you need a mouse, buy this one.
 works great!
 Happy day! Super easy installation, and works perfectly. I'm a happy camper!
 Thank you, this was an excellent purchase.
 Didn't work well with Office 2010 and Win7/64.  Probably a driver issue.<br/><br/>Ended up tossing this in the trash and going back to a regular mouse.
 Works great.  It is carried with me all the time.
 Good buy bought two both work great Thinking of ordering again
 This mouse uses seemingly outdated technology which results in the mouse dying within a couple hours. If you forget to turn the mouse off manually, it will be dead the next time you try to use it. I ended up having to buy a new mouse to avoid this annoyance. Overall, one of the worst purchases I have made from Amazon.
 As expected! Great simple wireless mouse.
 Not entirely happy with the mouse.  It seems to stick when I push it, unless I push it on the very top.  Think I will try something else next time.
 This item came quickly, feels like a quality product, and worked effortlessly. All you have to do it put the included batteries in, plug in the receiver into a open SB port and off you go. Super easy and I would recommend this item in a heart beat!!
 Not a blue optical. Not a long reach without a lot of lag. Standard use is good. Comfortable in hand. Nice quality for the price.
 This mouse has worked fantastically for me. I love it so much. I've had it for several months and it hasn't died on me yet so let's see how it goes.
 Works as expected and great deal for price.
 Works great!  Makes using computer from far away easy (computer hooked up to TV).
 Just what I wanted and on time.
 I like it but seems to have a mind of it's own sometimes where the pointer won't stay settled
 great mouse for the price.
 works just like it's supposed to.
 good product. solid
 Works very well. Easy to set up.
 Good mouse for the price, came with batteries. I jazzed mine up with some glitter polish and my mouse is a big hit.
 its hard to put in batterys
 Good Mouse
 great, practical, no issues at all!
 It is so nice not to have another wire to get in the way.  I just have to remember to turn it off and save the battery when I'm not using it.
 Good mouse that works as advertised.
 Lightweight, effective, it does what it needs to do.  It doesn't have any grips on the side, if that matters to you.  The clicker can be a tad loud as well.  Nothing too major - overall, solid product, and worth the value.  Comes with batteries!
 BEWARE.....Doesn't have back-button, but does work ok
 I have repeatedly beaten this mouse up for months, by dropping it far distances and having it smushed by a mound of textbooks at the bottom of my backpack every day. I am shocked that it has held up &amp; still works just as good as ever! Great product!
 great mouse.... but batteries didnt last long, about two months.....
 Excellent product and so easy to use.
 Arrived on time. I bought it for my little Chrome Notebook and it works great.
 Works great and fits perfectly in the hand, exactly what I wanted
 It's working great and the USB piece is small enough that I can pack away my laptop without taking it out if I don't feel like it. I like it better than the blue tooth mouse I used to have because it never disconnects randomly.
 Haven't had any problems. I use it for my Acer laptop.
 Great price, product leaves a lot to be desired.  I had this mouse for more than a year, and couldn't keep the battery door on.  It falls off at the slightest jostle, when you set it down or bump it gently.  Tonight the door fell off for the zillionth time and I was not able to find it, so I am going back to logitech.
 No frills mouse, tracks well, but it eats through its two AAA batteries in about a month. I always switch it off when it's not in use.
 Cheaper than all the others,  and works just as well!
 Excellent wireless mouse.  Arrived on time, easy to get up and running, and no problems.
 Horrid mouse... moves on its own... autoscrolls... never again.. returning..
 Arrived sooner than expected in a very secure package.  Plugged the nano receiver into my new Toshiba laptop and it worked immediately.  Very good buy.
 Great product for a great price
 basic and practical, yet very handy and always availabale
 Stopped working in a couple of weeks.  Don't waste your money on this one..
 Love it.
 I got this little guy on account of my trackpad was becoming less and less responsive, and it's JUST the thing. Right size, right price, and the cordless-ness gives me a freedom I've only dreamed of!
 Portable &amp; functional
 It works until the date. The best I've had.
 Been working great for months now
 Works as expected with a Surface pro 3. Easy to pair, no sudden excessive movements
 I did not like the feel of this mouse. I do have small hands and went back to my Logitech. Nothing personal-- I love all my AmazonBasics purchases....this did not work out for me.
 Great quality as described
 Does what it says on the tin.
 Sleek, easy to use, and exactly what I needed.
 Great mouse and for the price it's a steal. The only thing I was used to on my old mouse was the scroll wheel would move left and right to scroll left and right which this mouse does not have. It took a little getting used to that at first but now I'm fine and like I said can't beat that price for a great working mouse. I useally use it on my bed sheets and I never have any problems with tracking.
 Great product!!
 it works, what else is there to say?
 Lost some time thinking I had received a mouse with no Nano receiver.  Instructions said not a word about it.<br/>Purpose of the plastic piece that goes under the batteries is not immediately obvious.  It would be well for instructions to mention that also.<br/>After getting all parts where they belong, mouse works fine.
 It works well.
 this mouse is easy to use, connect and portable that it goes everywhere. Awesome college tool
 Going on three of these, very satisfied with price, quality, and performance. Battery compartment provides storage space for USB dongle.
 Great product and so much better that the mouse on my laptop
 good battery life and I leave it on 24/7.
 I needed a mouse for a second laptop in my house, and this works perfectly. It doesn't have a cheap feel, and functions like it should.
 Mouse works great. Easy to use and great price.
 very good
 I liked this mouse.  It is small, but that was actually a plus for me as it didn't take up much space in a bag.  I've only owned it for a litte over a year and the scroll wheel isn't working.  I don't see any way to repair it, so it looks like I will have to replace this mouse.
 Works great every time! Small enough to easily travel with but not so small I can't grip it in my hand.
 No software installation required! Just add the included batteries, plug the USB in to your computer, switch the mouse on, and you're good to go. It's easily small enough to add to your backpack or bag for working at coffeeshops as well. I am using mine without a mousepad of any kind and it still works with no problem.
 Perfect size and works well. The on-off button is handy as well.
 Have been using this wireless mouse for last 2 weeks, extremely happy. Very smooth and swift, far better than lenovo wired mouse which was given from my company.<br/>Since this product is out of stock for most of the time,people need to wait for it.
 Nice mouse
 Very accurate mouse and they are inexpensive.  Great job Amazon!
 easy to set up
 Using it now. Works well.
 couldn't run my computer without it it's great
 Its a mouse, it works like a mouse, it is wireless, and it is inexpensive. I see no difference between this mouse and others that are 4 times the price.
 Can't beat it for a cheap entry model wireless mouse.  I've had it for a month and it works perfectly.  I had a Logitech before this that cost 3x as much and honestly I don't see any difference.
 Works great and has a little storage under it.
 Works fantastically! And it works with the Mac. It takes a battery, but I've had it for a couple of months now and I've yet to need to change it. Great deal!
 works well
 I have not been able to get the batteries in!  They just won't slide in, so I am going to return it.
 Works great. Great price.
 Great mouse.  Wife was complaining about her wired mouse; this one makes her happy.  She's happy; I'm happy.
 reception could be better but it still works so not bad for price
 Very good quality for a few dollars. Work great !
 This mouse is so easy to use and works great. I was slightly skeptical because it was so inexpensive, but I've had nothing but good experience with it. I love the USB plug, it is so tiny I barely notice it is there.
 I use Photoshop &amp; Illustrator on my Macbook which is almost impossible with just a trackpad. Decided to try this out and it works flawlessly. Plug it in and it's ready to roll. No lag, feels good in the hand, and looks pretty good too. Definitely recommend.
 A great mouse that is just the right size and the right feel.  I absolutely love the soft click making it ideal for gaming.
 Works great, actually does better on surfaces than more expensive Logitech models.
 Create Mouse that connects with ease and has a compartment in the mouse to put the small Bluetooth piece.
 Product arrived promptly and works beautifully
 Worked great...  until it broke the USB port it was attached to.  Very unhappy.
 very happy with this after 2 months.  love storing the usb inside the mouse--it does not get lost.  Clicks perfectly every time and rolls on any surface.
 This mouse has a very easy-to-hold grip that makes use comfortable and easy.  I haven't has any problems using it without a mousepad and it is very transportable so I can bring it with wherever I bring my laptop!
 Bought this when I got my Acer 720 Chromebook.  Built-in is fine; however, when I want a lot faster and less touchy interface, use this.
 I received the mouse today and it works great so far! Went for the Amazon mouse even though it was more expensive than the others. How's that for customer loyalty?
 Works well.  Battery seems to wear out quickly.
 It is perfect
 So far I am satisfied with my orders
 So easy to use.
 Great mouse but the batteries always seem to die quickly.  I try to remember to turn it off if I can.  Otherwise, great product.
 So far so good.  No problems.  Easy to operate.
 Ok little mouse. Nice size for travel stows so perfectly in my laptop bag. Optic is responsive and buttons are stiff.
 This works great.  I have no complaints, and you wont either.  Recommended.
 Great mouse. It is compact and easy to use. I can even fit it
 really liked !  easy to install an use, works great with my mac or pc, laptop or desktop, just plug the USB and turn it on !
 I came back to review this mouse. This is one of the best wireless mouse's I have ever used. Great quality and the original batteries are still working, almost 8 months later! Get this mouse!
 Works great and I like how the usb connection turn fits in the mouse. Still on the original battery too. Thanks
 no complaints
 This is a great mouse!  Feels great in the hand and is very accurate.  Can be used with either hand and connects very quickly.
 works great
 mouse works
 I love this mouse. I have several brands including Microsoft, LG etc but this just feels right. Not too soft on the click and sensitivity is just right.
 Works great! Super easy set up and love the cute color.
 The mouse stop working after just one year of using. I was expecting it to last at least 2 to 3 years.
 I go through a lot of mice and this has lasted the longest
 Thanks
 It works well but doesn't auto shutdown.  You need to turn off the switch on the bottom!
 Excellent cordless mouse for the small laptop.  Uses one USB port for the transmitter.
 Simple and effective.
 seems o be keeping up with me...so far. I do prefer the mouse that has a slot for the usb chip.
 I originally bought this mouse an year ago, it stopped working in 6 months, Amazon honored the warranty terms and sent a replacement mouse again it stopped working in 6 months.
 Have several now.  Best product for the money.
 Ordered two of these and pretty pleased. Comes with little USB reciever that you can stick right into your computer. Only downfall is that sometimes when not touching the mouse, the "hand" is not steady and tends to shake.
 Lost the damn thing after a month due to its size. Worked really well though.
 had to get it replaced because the first one was defective/malfunctioning
 Good product.  Works very well.
 Perfect for the price, works well, as advertised.<br/><br/>It's not full size, great for laptop/portability.<br/><br/>No reason to spend more.
 Soo far best and fastest  computer I ever bought and just paid $169!
 Very good quality mouse. Amazon Basics keeps delivering on the quality and functionality of their products. Definitely give this one a try, no need to pay double for a mouse that will do the same thing.
 Use it for my laptop. It fits my hand very well.  I like the wireless mouse even though I do need to change the battery now and then.
 Works great for my netbook.
 Lasted a year and a half. Dropped it today and now does not work. Battery life is pretty short, better be using rechargeable batteries.
 i love this mouse..
 Good mouse.
 i have enjoyed this wireless mouse, It works well with my Notebook. It helps work with Windows applications. Would recommend
 Solid.
 worked good
 love it, good quality, the batteries are included  and has a good size for any hand size
 good portable size, can be used from across the room if you are using it in the classroom .
 Works fine.
 Its smaller than a regular wired mouse so it easily fits in my backpack. The package also comes with batteries which is always a great thing!
 Works great!  Compact and durable.
 Works well for smaller hands!
 Plugged in and it works great! So far so good. Thanks!
 My daughter loves it.
 fun to use. nice construction
 great, i use it with my chrome book instead of the touch pad
 Love this, works very well. Use it with my laptop and tablet.
 My wife loves it
 Perfectly described and packaged. It is small enough for my hands and I've been using it since I took it out of the box. No problems. Will buy another if this one dies.
 Broke already. Buy something better!!!!
 Works well
 I am surprised to receive my order quickly in Canada. It works perfectly so far. Love it.
 Good mouse, but it hates cheese.
 This is a basic mouse. No special gaming feature. It suits my needs well has good speed and smooth action..
 Using wireless mouse right now and have had no problems with it.  Computer recognized it first time.
 Cheap and perfect. Easy to assemble and easy to use. Totally recommend. I literally can't think of anything negative to write about it except that I wish it came in more colors.
 Cheap, but works better then most mouses I’ve ever come across. I bought this twice after losing my first one and I don’t regret buying it again.
 exactly as promised very easy to use  luv that you can store the usb connector right in the mouse
 Got me spending too much on battery.
 Didn't realize it used a USB aND not Bluetooth.  Battery compartment keeps popping open
 'Gone through two in less than a year, with the second one crapping out in a little over six weeks.<br/>I'm a fan of AmazonBasics, but this one is a clear miss.
 Ok for the price
 Great mouse for the money! Just plug and play. No issues! A little smaller than I would have guessed, but not tiny.
 Amazing mouse. Super cheap; good build quality; good tracking speed... Not much else to say haha. Highly recommend.
 Works ok on some surfaces. Skips, lags, or doesn't work at all on some. Left click button sticks on the one I received. Still usable but I wish I had spent the extra dollar or two and bought a better one.
 not suitable for some surfaces
 no frills, does the trick. So far after a month its still kicking.. Great buy for the price
 Great price for level of quality.  Not sure how it is profitable.
 I wasn't sure about this mouse bc it was so cheap, but it works like a charm! I even forget to turn it off but the battery doesn't run out! great purchase!
 Great exchange policy if u break your first one (if of course you buy the insurance). Simple wireless mouse that gets the work done. Five stars!
 works fine
 Great product, good quality and good cost.
 Works flawlessly. Why spend more?
 nice unit works well
 Love it, I have been turning the switch off when not in use, but battery has lasted, i like it
 Kills the battery fast unlike Logitech. Not reliable at all.
 This is an excellent wireless mouse, it's cheap, reliable and works!
 Worked great, the quality is good. No problems at all with Win 10.
 great mouse- totally worth the money for it.  I use it wit my work laptop and throw is in my bad when I take it to and from work- no problem, tracks on almost anything (okay it didn't like my glass coffee table but it tracks on my wood table, desk, and even on my couch).  I highly recommend it for the price.  I'm a women with "medium" sized hands and have no problems with its size.
 Thank you it is a good item
 A cheap mouse, however i would have expected it to last for more than six months.  Not good enough. Not recommended.
 use it daily.  Compact, fit my big hand well.  Respond well.  Don't waste money on more expensive mice
 My hand is on the smaller side and this mouse is the perfect size. It's really easy to use, but probably a little overly sensitive. I don't know much about electronics, but this mouse is comfortable in my hand and feels like it's made of very solid materials.
 Great mouse as expected of an AmazonBasics product. The mouse is responsive and works well with how I use it. One slight issue I have is the on/off button, which is rather hard to switch back and forth. Otherwise this product is great. c:
 Bought it back in 2014 and just recently lost it, but it worked flawlessly the whole time. I used it with my work laptop pretty much every day, and changed the battery maybe twice in the 2.5 years I had it.
 Ok
 ONE WORD.. DURABLE! and works great too!
 Can't beat it for the price.<br/><br/>I work from home 2-3 days a week so I use this mouse intensively.  Only complaint and that's being picky is the size but what can you expect for the price.  Highly recommend its a mouse that does its job.
 I LOVE Amazon basics. So simple, and cheap - yet still retains quality.<br/><br/>This has a nice matte finish as well. It feels really nice to hold.<br/><br/>The nano-receiver fits nicely into an insert in the mouse in between the batteries. Very convenient.
 the mouse is quite small, I would have liked to have a larger version of this. but it was cheap, and works fine. I'm happy with the purchase
 If you get one that works....my second just died out on me. Had for three months and now wont work.  The first one wouldnt work from day one.
 Tried changing batteries, wiping off bottom, bought a mouse pad.  Never did work right.
 Good basic no frills mouse ... just plug'n play ....
 No frills, just works....  Thanks.
 Put batteries in, plug in small usb receiver and it works. Great so far.
 Works just fine.
 Love this mouse bought it for my Toshiba Laptop works well n its very smooth on my wrist.
 Bought this six months ago and it has gone through a dozen batteries in that time.  This is ridiculous given the small amount of power usage.  Would not buy this again.
 Bought to replace an Apple mouse.  This works fantastic.
 Great mouse for the price, and it came with batteries. Well done amazon.
 It works and was priced fairly. This is my second purchase since the first one quit working after 2 years.
 Needed to get away from the tangled cords.  It's just fine.  I can't tell the difference from the wired mouse.
 It is great to be wireless and the size is comfortable.
 does the job
 I love it, it is so smooth and glides so easily. I like the sensitive finger tab and it rolls so easily on my hardwood table without a glitch..
 Works very well, no issues.
 Light weight and easy to use. It is easy on my hands. I have arthritis and appreciate the way it handles.
 I am an elementary teacher and I use this at school while moving around the room.
 Got this for my dad. He's not very computer smart but he can use this and lasts forever on batteries. Durable and easy for him to use, wasn't sure sense he is used to mice with cords but he loved it .
 The cover for the batteries is constantly popping off.
 As long as I'm close enough to my laptop it is fine, get too far way and it doesn't work very well, otherwise not bad.
 Basic mouse.  The matted-black is cool.  Works great.  Was nicely priced.  Shipping was not a problem.  I would buy again.
 fast shipping, exactly what I wanted, great transaction, work perfectly, thanks
 works
 Nice compact and smooth operating mouse. Very surprised at the high quality and low price. Would recommend for anyone looking for a compact mouse to throw in the laptop bag.
 This is the best basic mouse at the price that I have used.  Love that Prime Shipment... Thanks Amazon
 Bought this a while ago. Awesome mouse. Buy it, can't find any were else.Bought this one for the wife.She loves it.
