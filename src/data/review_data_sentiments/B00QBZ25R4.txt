 Final review - I’m updating my review to 5 stars from 4.  The customer service is amazing. I emailed to discuss the firmness and they sent me a topper at no charge.  I have used that for a month now and I wake up feeling good.  The topper has relieved the pain In my hips I was getting.<br/><br/>2nd - So I have had the mattress now for 2 months and I have noticed more pressure on my hips. So I contacted the company because I was debating on whether I should return and to inquire on a topper they offer for just this problem.  People must complain of some pressure issues in hips and shoulders. I received an email promptly offering to send me the topper for free! I have yet to sleep on it and see if it makes a difference and I will update with that later but I wanted to comment on the exceptional customer service they have.  I heard their customer service is great but I can say first hand that they are.<br/><br/>1st - I have been waiting to write this review. I wanted to give myself a few weeks of sleeping on it.  So I’ve had this mattress for almost 30days. From the beginning this mattress was easy to set up. Just cut the plastic and unroll. The smell was minimal and it inflated to full size within hours or less. I personally love the mattress. My husband does not because he feels he gets too hot. I wake up feeling no pain. The only thing I do not like is that I will get a small amount of hip pressure pain by laying on my side which I’ve gotten with every mattress and I’m primarily a back sleeper so for me it’s not a big deal.  This is a medium firm mattress in my opinion.  What I LOVE most about the mattress is there is no motion transfer. I do not fell my husband move at all which is something that use to keep me up at night.<br/><br/>Overall I would say if you are a back sleeper and enjoy a firmer mattress looking for no motion transfer then this would be it. The price is awesome too.
 We bought this mattress for our 15 year old super athletic son.  We looked at a lot of mattresses and read online reviews from consumer reports before deciding to give this mattress a try.  Our son absolutely LOVES it!  The first night he slept on his new mattress, he did not want to get up! When asked if he liked it, his response was " I did not want to get out my bed this morning!"<br/><br/>The mattress arrived a day later than we were told, no problem.  The box was rather big and heavy, however, rolling out the mattress was a breeze.  When the mattress is completely released from the plastic wrapping, you could see it inflating.  I read in some reviews, there was a chemical smell from their mattresses, there was no smell from our package at all and the mattress expanded within a matter of minutes.  We all have laid on his bed and love the feel of the mattress, I fell asleep on his bed unfortunately our son woke me up and asked me to please get off his bed; now we are thinking of buying this mattress for  the other bedrooms!<br/><br/>I definitely recommend you giving Tuft &amp; Needles a try, and if you don't like it, hey at least you get 100 free nights!  With that being said, I believe you will enjoy your sleep and will not return this item.
 (UPDATE SIX MONTHS LATER: I still have this mattress, but it has gotten substantially softer. It required a T&amp;N topper for the first few weeks as it softened up, but somewhere around 150 nights in, I noticed it was heading toward plush status--not quite as supportive as it once was. Also, I wrote this review while the temperatures were colder. Now that it's summer, I do note that this mattress is warmer than my previous innerspring mattresses. But, for the money, it's still a good mattress. It's just not as ideal as I hoped.)<br/><br/>About a year ago, I asked my friends on social media for mattress recommendations. The leading recommendation was for the Tuft and Needle mattress, which I should have heeded. Nearly a year and eight mattresses later, I finally bought that Tuft &amp; Needle. It's #9 and I love it. I love it even more because it was by FAR the cheapest option, too. But at the time I was skeptical of a bed-in-a-box. I shouldn't have been. It fit my requirement to have good support with a comfort layer on top. And for the record, I sleep in all positions. Apparently I’m a rotisserie chicken, going from side to stomach to back all night. That makes me a tough customer to please and I know it.<br/><br/>But for anyone else doing mattress research, here's what I've learned from my year of testing. First, I received excellent service from both internet and traditional mattress companies. I tried three mattresses from Saatva Mattress, three Beautyrest mattresses from Mattress Firm, and a brand-new variation of the Purple mattress that's exclusive to Mattress Firm. I started the year on my old Sleep Number. So I have run the gamut of air, foam, innerspring, hybrid foam/innerspring and the new hybrid from Purple, which I guess would be called a Purple/innerspring variation, but "bouncy house" would be equally as descriptive. My asthma is triggered by chemicals in foam, so I made sure all the mattresses I bought were Certi-Pur. (This, sadly, is the only complaint I have about my Tuft &amp; Needle -- though it claims to have more rigorous standards about foam and off-gassing, it's been the smelliest. It's faint but it's there even weeks later. But it has not made me wheeze, so I'm trusting I'm not being harmed.)<br/><br/>The first thing I learned is that mattress companies really DO honor their customer service policies. In fact, Mattress Firm was actually the best about it. In all cases, I received excellent service when I wanted to exchange. Second, I had been sleeping on air for nearly a decade and that made it hard to figure out what would work for me. I loved the lack of pressure points on a Sleep Number, but not the lack of support. My first mattress was an all foam from Saatva (the Loom &amp; Leaf) and it was hard as a rock (to me). They explained that foam would soften and that I should crawl around on it to soften it up. It did soften up after a week, but not enough for my taste. It also smelled vaguely like stale coffee, which never dissipated. So thus, the exchanges began. I was very pleased with Saatva's design, the fact they delivered a full mattress and not one in a box, and their use of organic cotton. But their mattresses missed the middle firmness range -- most were very firm and one was very plush (the industry term for soft). If they could have nailed that medium range, I would have been happy to stay with them.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, I circled through several mattress designs before coming back to all foam again with the Tuft &amp; Needle. But it was significantly less firm out of the box than the Loom &amp; Leaf. Its adaptive foam is much more of a medium firmness from the start. But it got even more comfortable when Tuft &amp; Needle sent a two-inch topper. For free. (Pro tip: The Internet mattress companies I dealt with were happy to send a topper for free if you requested it. I now have two.) I don't know how long a mattress like this will hold up, but at a $575 price point from Amazon, it's half the cost of a Saatva mattress and a quarter of the price of most of the Beautyrest mattresses. So I'm willing to gamble.<br/><br/>I know that comfort is largely subjective, but my Fitbit Alta has the hard data to back up my love of the Tuft &amp; Needle. I cut my tossing and turning time in half with their mattress and topper. Bottom line: All the mattress companies I dealt with provided a great service and backed up their exchange promises, even going above and beyond. Tuft &amp; Needle was the best value for the money and the most comfortable to sleep on. It was also the most work to haul a heavy box up to my bedroom and set up the mattress, which is the reason I avoided it in the beginning. But in the end, that effort was worth it.<br/><br/>Tuft &amp; Needle, if you are reading this review, please consider manufacturing a mattress with four inches of your adaptive foam on top of your support layer, instead of just two inches. I'm very glad to have your free topper, but it makes the bed look lumpy and it doesn't stay in place. From all the reviews I've read, the topper was key to customer satisfaction for many people. You should seriously consider this option. I would have chosen that and paid a bit more for it, too, had it been available.
 I received this "bed in a box" on March 23, opened it up, and put it on my frame as directed, to cut off the restrictive plastic. The mattress took exactly 72 hours to "puff up" to 10 inches deep after it was released from the plastic wrapping. I intended to use it "as directed" and so I kept my old mattress and slept on the floor in the LR for three nights." The first night I slept on the T&amp;N mattress (on March 26, three days after I bought it), I was shocked by the extremely soft (what some people call "cloud-like" sinking of my body) because this is my third memory foam + foam mattress and the others were firm and supportive.  I bought the T&amp;N because Consumer Reports said it was 'firm." I got rid of my other two mattresses after only 1/2 their "warranty life" because of the "sinking" that created deep imprints around me, what I called "craters." I should add that I am normal weight, even considered "slender." That first night I was also surprised by the "crinkling sound" as if I were sleeping on paper. I can say that I have not experienced back pain, although I do not feel supported by this mattress that I have slept on for only for six nights so far. I will definitely keep you posted.<br/><br/>Update May 6: The mattress still feels more like a water bed than a foam mattress, but I'm getting used to it, am sleeping well, and still have not suffered any "lack of support' issues like "sore lower back." And so, I  bumped my rating up a star.
 When we purchased this mattress in August of last year, we loved it! Now that we have been sleeping on it for 9 months, our thoughts have changed. I have been waking up with back pains for about 3 weeks. I did not say anything to my husband thinking that perhaps I needed to do some stretching. To my surprise, the hubby also complained that his back has been hurting upon waking for about 3 weeks as well. These are the pains we experienced when we realized it was time to change our last conventional mattress that lasted us nearly 10 years. Upon inspection, the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress has no lumps or divots so there does not appear to be a manufacturer flaw to the naked eye. Things I did love about the mattress are the convenient packing and shipping, the price, and that there were no smells after unpacking. It was very comfortable for the first 8 months, but now I think that I will need to purchase a conventional mattress that will last for a few years instead of a few months. Please take note that all of the excellent reviews were within the first few months of owning.<br/><br/>Update: I called Tuft and Needle directly (5/30/2018) and spoke with Gerilynn (not sure of spelling) and was told that there was nothing they could do for me at this point. Looks like I wasted very good money on a very bad mattress. Before purchasing, please be sure to look at reviews from those who have owned the mattress for 6 months or more.
 Wow! What a mattress!<br/>I have been sleeping on the mattress since the first night it arrived (early June, I think?)-- so for about a month now.<br/><br/>I had been a stomach sleeper most of my life, but after a back injury, I was forced to be a side sleeper. With this mattress, I can lay on my stomach--for chilling, reading, playing on laptop/tablet-- and sometimes even sleeping! My weight (currently about 230 pounds; big hips, large breasts, broader-than-normal woman-shoulders) is evenly distributed and supported! I have fibromyalgia, along with several other health conditions, all of which contribute to me having sleep issues &amp; "getting comfortable" is a struggle. . . but this mattress has made a positive difference! Right now I'm sitting on it, with my feet and part of my legs hanging over the bed (which I've done before)-- this position typically puts my legs and feet asleep fairly quickly, but not with this mattress! The pressure on my calf muscles doesn't cause me pain! Even sitting without leaning against anything, I feel supported and my butt doesn't hurt!<br/><br/>The mattress was easy for me to unpack. Initially the mattress was just on the floor, as my bed frame hadn't arrived yet (had just moved), and even then was pretty comfortable. I was anxious to see how it would do on one of the frames I bought here on Amazon (<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-14-Inch-SmartBase-Mattress-Foundation-Platform-Bed-Frame-Box-Spring-Replacement-Quiet-Noise-Free-Maximum-Under-bed-Storage-Queen/dp/B006MIUM20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation / Platform Bed Frame / Box Spring Replacement / Quiet Noise-Free / Maximum Under-bed Storage, Queen</a>). It's perfect! I have been sleeping fairly well, in spite of having moved to a new climate &amp; medication adjustments, and I know without any doubt Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress is part of me getting restful sleep.<br/><br/>I will happily recommend this mattress, because, Wow, What a Mattress!<br/><br/>If anything changes, I will update/edit this review.
 We tried out the mattress for a while. I am a lighter weight while my partner is heavier. The mattress was too firm for us--and we did read online after purchasing that this mattress is apparently more suitable for people at lighter weights. After using it for the recommended allotted time by Tuft and Needle to break it in, we decided to return it. I am giving this review four stars based solely on the excellent customer service from UPS, Tuft and Needle, and Amazon.<br/><br/>I would like to be transparent that the mattress appears to be a good mattress and will probably work well for certain people, such as lighter weights and/or stomach sleepers due to its firmness. So, the quality isn't terrible. It just didn't work for us personally. However, when we decided to return it, we contacted UPS about shipping returns. Then we called Tuft and Needle about the 100 Day Trial, although we saw on their website that Tuft and Needle would NOT pick up the mattress and refund it if bought through a third party distributor like Amazon. However, Tuft and Needle did confirm the 100 Day Trial was still valid even through Amazon and they gave me the number for the Special Handling Department through Amazon (the number is 866-423-5353, by the way). When I called the Special Handling Department, they gave me a full refund after I explained it just wasn't working for us. Amazon does not accept returns on memory foam mattresses, so I was impressed that they gave me a full refund and trusted my word. Again, excellent customer service.<br/><br/>I would like to add that I have never returned a product to Amazon in all my years of shopping on their site, so that may be why they were nice enough to give me a full refund as I am a regular customer without return history. Tuft and Needle also states that ONE mattress per household may be returned ONCE per year, so there is that.<br/><br/>Four stars for the great customer service, but I would not recommend this mattress for heavier people or side sleepers/rotators. Oh, and it doesn't appear to sleep hot. But not too cool, either. Somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Thanks, Tuft and Needle, Amazon, and UPS!
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3H8PW4RY61I93"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1vLGXFDCRS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61copzy012S.png"/> After reading countless reviews and watching a lot of video reviews, I really really wanted to like this mattress, but I genuinely understand now why some mattress makers have the transition layer between the soft and the hard part of the bed. I am 5'8 and I weigh around 175 lbs and the mattress sits on top of a bunkie board. The top layer is great and does what it claims. You really feel the support layer when you lay down, even a 1/2 inch transition layer would be a great addition.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- price is great compared to the competition<br/>- setting it up was super easy<br/>- doesn't get too hot<br/>- As a side/stomach sleeper, this was comfortable<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- wish it had a transition layer<br/>- I'm being picky, but for anyone out there who's picky about their sleep, this is mattress is about 7.5/10 on the firmness scale with my weight/height/use of bunkie board.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't think I would buy this mattress again. I was looking for a 6.5/7 out of 10 from a firmness standpoint, it's a bit more firm than I would like. I would spend the extra dollars to get a mattress with a transition layer. It's a shame because I really think the top layer is great.
 So I did a lot of research before I bought this mattress. I prefer and need a firmer mattress and I bought this one because most of the negative reviews I saw described it being too firm. Unfortunately, it was not firm enough for me. HOWEVER, I think it’s well made and I really wanted to like it. The biggest plus though is the amazing return policy. I called Amazon to find out how to take advantage of the 100 day return no questions asked and after speaking to someone who didn’t know what they were talking about, (though very polite), I was transferred to another department where they refunded my money immediately and said I could just donate the mattress wherever I wanted. INCREDIBLE! I know this is because of Tuft and Needle’s policy, which is amazing and they should be commended for it. Thank you Tuft and Needle and thanks you Amazon. If you made a firmer mattress I would buy it.
 This bed is wonderful. I'm 6'2" and 270 pounds. When I wake up I feel drunk because I sleep so darn hard on this thing. lol<br/>It kinda feels like memory foam but it's way more supportive. It's not hot either. Memory foam beds used to burn me up but I'm perfectly cool in this bed. You'll also notice that it feels like it'll never wear out. Whatever it's made out of will last for a very long time. The quality that I got with this bed for the money that I spent is simply remarkable. It's the best bed I've ever purchased and oddly also the least expensive.
 When I first purchased this Tuft and Needle mattress I got it for the spare bedroom.  However I had to try it out myself :-) and abosolutely fell in love with it ... I mean it was amazing like sleeping on a cloud. I loved it so much that I started just to sleep in the spare bedroom.  Fast forward 2 months and like other reviewers I have back pain that I have not had before.  I am going to have to go back to my Stearms &amp; Foster mattress becoase this one hurts my back.  I guess I am glad I got it just for the spare bedroom but I feel bad even having guests sleep on it now. I would not recommend.  I am not a big girl ... about 145 lbs.  Like I said it slept heavenly at first but awful now! Spend your money on something that offers a 365 day sleep return policy because I would very much be returning this if I could.
 This was definitely not a long term investment.  Our new mattress (by another company) comes today after a year having this one.  It was fine in the beginning, but nothing that would prompt me to recommend it.  After a few months, it was stiff and had no give.  For the last several months, my husband and I have been waking up with back pain, if we slept at all.  If you like a very firm bed, this may be good for you, but be warned, it's very, very firm.
 This bed is of surprisingly good quality. Using all "eco" material in the crafting is what coaxed me to try it. I had never heard of Tuft &amp; Needle -- the name caught my eye (I knew what it stood for) and that was what caused me to look at the ad. I've only had ONE foam mattress in the past 20 years that was stellar and I'd sleep like a log. The company quit making that version -- nothing else from them came close. I've had several high end innerspring mattresses, some custom. I've either had tons of pressure point issues or they caused physical problem that almost paralyzed me.<br/><br/>So, I needed a bed to replace one that was high end latex and coils, but was impossible for me to move -- it had no skeleton. When I saw that T&amp;N was available on Amazon, I came here to research how people liked it, whether it had any chemical smell, etc. I LOVED that it is made in the USA -- just like my last 3 bed purchases. I loved all the highly positive reviews. I like the cover choice. And...I like that I could get a frame from Amazon to go with the bed. So...I had it arrive via expedited shipping, set up the frame and uncoiled the bed. It raised in less than 60 seconds. There was a little sweet smell, but nothing like outgassing. I was easy to adjust on the bed and I put my Cuddle Ewe wool topper on it. Now I was concerned that this would not be firm enough but I'll tell you that not only was it firm enough for my back, it was soft enough to keep pressure off my knees, hips and ankles. I'm shocked and pleasantly surprised. I got a queen to be cautious. The next purchase will be a king. Thank you, T&amp;N, for delivering a high quality product that didn't have sticker shock...and thank you, Amazon, for getting one to me so fast. I'm a happy camper for sure.
 When I bought my first Tuft and Needle mattress, it was a little hard to get used to. But after a week it was great. And the thought of going to a mattress store and spending hundreds more was very unappealing. Now I love it so much I bought a second one for a guest bed. As usual it was perfect right out of the box. I do notice that mattress #2 is just a little more firm that #1 that I've been sleeping on for 6 months. So give it some time if it feels weird at first. I'll never buy a traditional mattress again. So grateful for this alternative!
 After a year of owning the Tuft &amp; Needle King Mattress, we are also throwing in the towel. When we first got this mattress, we loved it, but after about 6 months, we are experiencing pretty significant back pain.<br/><br/>From another reviewer: "Before bed, I'd give myself a number from 1-10 of how sore I am, usually a 0-2, but I'd wake up in the morning and be at a 8. I did this every so often, and it's official. The mattress is the problem. I believe we sink to much into it, keep in mind i'm only 5'7 160 lbs, so not these huge guy! Wife also wakes up with soreness/pain just like me."<br/><br/>We completely agree. I'm 5'9, 130 lbs, my husband is 6' and 190lbs, and we both wake up feeling worse than we did before we went to sleep. It does feel like we sink into it, and there isn't enough support. We bought this mattress with recommendations from a family member, but for whatever reason, it just doesn't work for us. It's to the point where I would rather sleep on the floor.<br/><br/>So, we're on the search for a new mattress...
 I moved apartments and got this Mattress mid June, it came with high recommendation from a friend. They suggested buying directly from Tuft &amp; Needle but since I'm a regular on Amazon, I ordered it here without second thoughts. That was my mistake. I noted the 100 day return policy while ordering. The mattress didn't work for me and my husband as we were constantly having back aches. After giving it a month, we decided that this is not for us and initiated a return. The UPS guy game to our apartment for pick up, I had everything ready but had to stick tape on it. I hadn't done it before for ventilation, it would have taken 30 seconds but he said he couldn't wait and gave us the label and left. We booked a uHaul later for this and took the mattress to the nearest UPS store. We wrapped the mattress in the cover it came in plus another cover that we got from Home depot. The people at the UPS store said that it has to be put in the box that it came it. It is impossible for us to compress the mattress and put it in the same box, hence I called Amazon. It was the worst customer representative ever, he first denied the 100 day return policy and then transferred my call to UPS saying its not Amazon's problem and asked me to schedule another pick up. I did so, paid more money for the pick up and had the mattress right next to the door this time. I also let them know that I'm not able to put it in a box and confirmed that it is ok for pick up. UPS guy came again and said he can't take it unless its in a box.<br/><br/>We have gone through so much pain to return this mattress, spent over $100 in this process with the Uhaul and everything but have no idea how to compress the mattress, hence not able to return. We got another mattress, from the same brand we had before and this one is laying around all wrapped up as a waste. The 100 day return policy is a total eye wash as it is impossible to return this mattress.
 Wow! Let me start off by saying, I purchased a T&amp;N 5" mattress almost two years ago exactly. We recently picked up bed bugs somewhere and chose, very sadly, to part with our T&amp;N mattress even though it looks like the protective covering on T&amp;N mattresses prevented bed bugs from making a home there. T&amp;N no longer sells the 5" mattress, which was devastating news because both me and my boyfriend had been sleeping soundly and waking up without any back pain since we first purchased the 5" mattress.<br/><br/>I contacted T&amp;N and explained our situation and asked if they could somehow let us purchase another 5" mattress. Who knows? I thought they would have some left in inventory or could work with me to get another 5" mattress. Instead, I sent an email at around 5am on a Saturday and received an incredibly personable and thoughtful response back around noon! They responded to my concerns and offered me a new 10" mattress FOR FREE. I haven't had many blow-me-away service experiences lately (as in the last few years, really) and even if T&amp;N hadn't offered me a free mattress to replace our original 5" mattress, I would have been delighted by the response. You won't find better service than T&amp;N. We had our new mattress by the end of the week!<br/><br/>Okay, now for the mattress details. The 5" mattress was excellent, no doubt, and that's why I was going right back to T&amp;N to get another. The 10" mattress is like sleeping on a cloud that is the perfect level of firmness no matter what your perfect level of firmness is. It's hard to believe that a mattress can be designed in a seemingly simple way, but provide more comfort and support than any other mattress on which I've slept. The 10" mattress is superior to every mattress I can remember sleeping on in my 30 years. I suffer from lower back pain that only regular yoga helps. Since I started sleeping on the T&amp;N 5" mattress two years ago, I have not experienced much, if any, back pain. It does not matter what size you are, firmness/softness preference, or if you are a hot sleeper - this mattress will have you sleeping through the night and waking up refreshed. Give T&amp;N a chance and I don't think you will be disappointed. Even if you are disappointed for whatever reason you might be,T&amp;N will work with you through their excellent customer service. You seriously have nothing to lose with this mattress, unless you are looking to miss out on a good night of sleep. In that case, stay away from T&amp;N because you will sleep well once you have one of their mattresses!
 This product is awful. I've had the bed about a year and it is already hollowed out where I sleep and I wake up each day with an achey back. They say there is a "warranty" but the "warranty" has been useless. Basically, you have to show that the bed is indented. The problem is that the bed does not indent, it just becomes incredibly soft, so when you get in, you sink into where there is no support. Since you can't show an indent, you can't use the "warranty". I spent a good amount of money on this bed and expected it to last; but one year out and I'm going to have to buy a new bed.
 I upgraded to this after having the same old spring mattress for 13 years (waaaay too long). I've had it for around a month. I'm not a mattress expert, but I saw a lot of conflicting info in the reviews about the feel and firmness of the mattress so I'll provide my take on this.<br/><br/>The top layer of the mattress contains a cooling foam material. When you touch the mattress directly, you can definitely feel the heat being pulled away from your skin. This is awesome for people like me who can't sleep when a mattress is too warm.<br/><br/>As far as firmness goes, I would describe this mattress as soft, yet "supportive." In case this is not clear, that is a compliment, not a dig, and I don't think it should deter those looking for a firm mattress. I have chronic lower back issues and was afraid it might be too soft. That is not the case. This mattress is incredibly soft and comfortable on the top layer which is great for back or side sleeping. The lower foam layer is more dense and supportive which creates a nice supportive feel that allows the curvature of your body to sink into the mattress slightly while not putting your back and joints into uncomfortable positions. This is not a memory foam mattress so it bounces right back when you push against it. In my mind this helps it keep its form and support your back nicely.<br/><br/>I got the Queen for around $450 during Black Friday sales, and would absolutely buy it again. I would even pay full price for it knowing what I know now.<br/><br/>Note: Some people complain about gross chemical smells with these bed-in-a-box mattresses so I was very mindful of that. This mattress is of amazing quality, and there was absolutely no smell from the moment I opened it.
 NOTE: This review was written by my husband Thomas MacEntee<br/><br/>Sleep Wanted: Why I Chose the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress<br/><br/>So you may be wondering . . . what does sleep and a new mattress have to do with genealogy? Well, let me tell you, this genealogist has suffered through years of sleep deprivation and issues due to various causes. Over the past few years I’ve worked on tackling many of these causes (such as losing over 110 lbs) and recently in June 2017, I tackled another: getting a better mattress. I had heard friends and family talk about different online mattress vendors and I didn’t believe that making a major bedding purchase this way would work. But it did and I opted to get a Tuft &amp; Needle mattress via Amazon. Here’s my experience:<br/><br/>Death to the Mattress Store<br/><br/>I HATE shopping for a mattress and as I get older, I just hate shopping in-person. Period.  Insert “cranky old man, get off my front lawn” comment]. My husband George and I purchase almost everything we need on Amazon (cereal, tea, coffee, shampoo, and clothing). We get so many deliveries from Amazon via UPS that one week when we had nothing delivered the UPS man did a “wellness check” on us. For realz.<br/><br/>Mattress stores seem to spawn overnight on every street corner here in Chicago. To me, they are just one step above used car lots. The process of making a purchase is a nightmare and I’ve always felt “dirty” just walking in the showroom.<br/><br/>And what about those prices and so-called “deals” you see in the paper or during television commercials? It seems that the model in the ad is never available or that each store seems to have its own special model of a known mattress brand so it isn’t easy to compare.<br/><br/>And finally, one of the shady practices is not accepting returns very easily. If you read the contract that a mattress store has you sign, there are many hoops you need to jump through: you have to have a certain type of frame and forget it if you try to just get the mattress and use your own box spring. The mattress stores have set themselves up to never fail at the expense of the consumer.<br/><br/>A Better Mattress Buying Process<br/><br/>Over the past few years, one of the industries that have gone through major “disruption” is the mattress industry. I was very hesitant when I started seeing ads online for basically “mail order” bedding. And we’re not talking a process where you buy a mattress at say Costco and then have it delivered with “white glove service” at an extra charge. We are talking ordering a mattress – sight unseen – on Amazon and having it delivered via UPS or Fedex.<br/><br/>Could this really work? What if I didn’t like the mattress? Why didn’t I need a box spring? Would the mattress work with my current bed frame? I had lots of questions and I was able to get all the answers I needed at Tuft &amp; Needle.<br/><br/>Well, imagine ordering the mattress you want, having it delivered for FREE (thanks to Amazon Prime) in just two days, and getting a great night’s sleep within another two days?<br/><br/>Here’s How My Tuft &amp; Needle Experience Unfolded<br/><br/>It literally unfolded. The package with my Tuft &amp; Needle Full mattress was delivered via Fedex to my doorstep and it weighed 57 pounds. After I dragged it up two flights of stairs, it was removed from the packaging. I followed the instructions to let the mattress “come alive” once the vacuum package was opened. The recommendation is to wait 48 hours before using the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress so that it can fully come into its own form. After that, it was easily to lift and place into my new bed frame/foundation.<br/><br/>And My Sleep Results with Tuft &amp; Needle?<br/><br/>I couldn’t be happier with this amazing mattress. It is firm in all the right places. It is comfortable and fully supportive. While I know it won’t cure my arthritis, I am not in as much pain when I get out of bed each morning. And no more “coil noise” with this memory foam mattress.<br/><br/>I’m now looking at purchasing another Tuft &amp; Needle mattress for the other bedroom and even for the condo in Palm Springs.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Zinus SmartBase Mattress Foundation<br/><br/>As part of the ordering process via Amazon, I determined that my current bed frame – while it would have accommodated my new Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, was too low to the ground. Without a conventional bed spring I would have had difficulty getting out of bed (due to severe osteo-arthritis). I shopped around at Amazon and I purchased the Zinus SmartBase Mattress Foundation for $79 and had it also delivered for free via Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>The frame was so easy to set up (it folds – nothing to screw together!) and it sits 14 inches off the ground. This means I get to store more crap under the bed! It is the perfect companion to the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress and I highly recommend making this purchase along with the mattress.<br/><br/>Why I am Impressed with Tuft &amp; Needle<br/><br/>I’m very impressed with Tuft &amp; Needle as a company and with their product. And check out this recent review at Consumer Reports. This was the first mention of Tuft &amp; Needle when I was researching online and the information led me to do some more research and ultimately make my Tuft &amp; Needle purchase via Amazon.<br/><br/>Other things that impressed me about Tuft &amp; Needle:<br/><br/>Returns were easy and guaranteed via Amazon for the first 100 nights’ sleep.<br/><br/>The company has ethics and provides great customer service: one woman recounted via an Amazon review how she needed more time to test the mattress (she and her husband traveled a lot) and ultimately they were not happy with it. Tuft &amp; Needle said, “no problem” and had the woman donate the mattress to the local Salvation Army. Once she sent Tuft &amp; Needle the receipt for the donation, she got a full refund. Now how’s that for customer service?<br/><br/>All Tuft &amp; Needle products are made in the United States<br/>They even offer an 18% discount at Amazon if you feel comfortable purchasing returned Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses. Click here for more information.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>For someone in the late Baby Boomer generation (born in 1962), I tend to be torn between traditional methods of doing something and taking a chance on a new process. I’m glad I was willing to try out the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress on Amazon and I will NEVER go back to purchasing a mattress through a furniture store or one of those horrid mattress stores.<br/><br/>Now if there were only an online solution to getting rid of an old mattress and box spring. Perhaps the folks at Tuft &amp; Needle can come up with a solution?
 I waited a little while before writing this review to give us time to adjust to the bed.  I loved it when I first laid on it, my husband was iffy.  I now have mixed feelings about it.  There are days it feels great, but I find I’m a little more achy some days, especially my low back.  My husband and I do roll into each other some, more so than on our old mattress, this was his biggest fear.  It sleeps hotter than I expected, but it’s not terrible.  I really wanted to be completely in love with this mattress, but I’m just not there.  It’s better than our 30yr old spring mattress....but it’s not the miracle sleep I was dreaming of.<br/><br/>**Update June 2018**<br/>We tried, we really tried, but ultimately we returned the mattress and brought our old mattress back.  My husband and I were both unsatisfied, and after he ended up with a CSF leak (not because of the mattress), he couldn’t handle sleeping on it at all.  He started sleeping in the guest room.  So, because I prefer to sleep in the same bed as my husband, we returned the mattress.  I will give Amazon and Tuft&amp;Needle props on this.  The 100 night sleep guarantee was great.  No hassle with the return at all.
 After 2 year of owning Tuft &amp; Needle King Mattress, we are throwing in the towel. I don't want to believe it because we fell in love with the mattress in the beginning like so many others, but most reviews are less than 3 months of owning the mattress. The pain didn't start until after a 1 year of laying on it.<br/>Before bed, I'd give myself a number from 1-10 of how sore I am, usually a 0-2, but I'd wake up in the morning and be at  a 8. I did this every so often, and it's official. The mattress is the problem. I believe we sink to much into it, keep in mind i'm only 5'7 160 lbs, so not these huge guy! Wife also wakes up with soreness/pain just like me.<br/><br/>I notice if I lay flat on my back, the pain would be much worse in the mornings than when we slept on our side. Extremely disappointed, really had high expectations, but the pain is too much.
 I really wanted to like this mattress. My wife has been badgeing me get a new bed. I had been researching options other than $2000 king bed options from standard brick and mortar stores, then I found Tuft and Needle. The price seemed too good to me true and unfortunately it was.<br/><br/>Heat: My wife is a bit of a warm sleeper. She is usually warm in general. This mattress is way hotter than our old standard spring mattress. She wakes up in a pool of sweat constantly.<br/><br/>Comfort level: I like a firm mattress in general, my wife is indifferent in this category. I’m a bigger guy so I like a firmer mattress with support. For me the mattress is just not comfortable. I wake up with back pains no matter which way I sleep.<br/><br/>Settling: we have only been using the mattress for 60 days and the mattress is already developing grooves for both of us. This does not bode well for long term reliability. I expect a mattress to last 7-8 years and I really don’t think this would last.
 I've written a review before, but ft some reason it was not posted. This is the worst mattress I've ever bought. We purchased three mattresses in the last 6 months. Only one from Tuft &amp; Needle - which resulted depressions formed within 4 months. My wife is a very small person, 128 lbs, I am larger, but both sides have holes that we don't into and can't roll out of. Initially the mattress is firm and it takes time to break in. We had a good month of wonderful sleep, until we started noticing it was harder and harder to roll from side to side. Last time I took pictures of my level showing just how deep these go. About an inch and a half. Our last mattress took 15 years to get half this wear. We still have it in our guest bedroom and prefer it over T&amp;N.
 We ordered this mattress based on all the good reviews on it. First off, we received it later than expected. There were shipping errors, which resulted in us having to sleep on the floor until it was delivered. Not a problem with the product though, just an unfortunate circumstance.<br/><br/>The mattress was easy to unbox with one person and expanded immediately. There was an immediate very strong chemical smell, that smelled like nail polish remover. It was bad enough to give me a headache and lasted several days. We gave it a week of sleeping on it, but it is way firmer than expected. Woke up every morning, stiff and with back pain. My arms and legs would ache too, as my wife and I are both side sleepers. For a side sleeper, there is absolutely no support. I know there is a breaking in point for the mattress, but were not willing to wait it out with the amount of pain we're in. There is also no edge support. If you sleep near the edge of the mattress, you feel as if you will roll right off of it. Also, something else to note is the size of the mattress. It never expanded to it's full potential, and if you're used to a larger mattress, you may have the same problem we did, where we kept kicking our foot board, due to it being so thin. Again, this was our hind site on it, but if it had expanded to its full 10 in description, I don't think we would have had as big of a problem with this as we did. The mattress also sleeps very hot in my opinion. And there is a lot of bounce to it. Absolutely no sinking in to the mattress at all, making it feel like you're sleeping on the floor.<br/><br/>I do have to say, that the Amazon return process was amazing. We called the special handling department 866-423-5353 and they refunded us without a problem and directed us to donate it to a local shelter, which we will be doing. We returned this within a week of us having it. I don't know how the process would have worked had we waited 30 days or the 100 day tuft and needle trial period.<br/><br/>I give the product one star for not accurately describing the firmness.
 We have been sleeping on this mattress for 2 months now and can already feel how it is sunk in on the sides and higher in the middle just as we experienced with our last pillow top. The big difference is it took our pillow top years to get that way, not months. We believed after reading so many reviews of alleviating the aches and pains that come from sleeping on a bad mattress that we were finally on track to blissful sleep. Now after 2 months, my husband's back pain is actually worse! He has to spend his first 2 hours every morning stretching before getting any relief. He has been begging me to get rid of this mattress and move to the next option whatever that will be. Now to top it off, we got the shipping return label from Amazon and UPS says that will not cover it and we need pay for return packaging and freight because of its size. Ugh!!!!!!!!!
 I read reviews talking about the T&amp;N mattress being too firm for some people.  I ordered it anyway, figuring I had 100 nights to give it a try.  I do not know what people who claim this is too firm want to sleep on, but T&amp;N is so far from firm I could not believe it.  When you try to sit on the edge of it, it is so soft you almost fall on the floor.  I weigh 172 pounds and am 6'2", by the way.  When I tried to sleep on it, I felt like I was being swallowed in a marshmallow.  I woke up day after day with a pinched nerve in my shoulder and pain radiating down my arm.  It didn't matter if I tried to sleep on my back or side, it was awful.  After four visits to the chiropractor induced by this man-eating marshmallow, I gave up.  I will never adjust to being eaten by a marshmallow.  This mattress is gone!
 tl;dr: Great mattress, after some hurdles that were deftly cleared by stellar customer service. The entire saga, beginning with my original (unfavorable) review is below:<br/><br/>It hurts me to write this review for such a beloved product. Literally...  I first became aware of this company when a blogger friend of mine wrote a sponsored post. I don't usually pay too much attention to the kind of endorsements  you see on sponsored blogs ("they gave this to us for free, naturally we LOVE it"), but I know these people &amp; trust their integrity. So when, several months after the initial post, they wrote a follow up reiterating their praises, I was intrigued. I'd been looking for a new mattress for awhile and this company's origin story was so relatable. I loved their mission, their philosophy, their business model. When I ordered my mattress directly from their site in January, I loved their efficient, friendly, but unobtrusive service. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the product.<br/><br/>I want to be clear that I'm not disputing the raves others have had. My blogger friends are 20-something skinny-hipsters while I'm a more ample Gen-X type. But three months in, it's become impossible to sleep on. The center of the mattress, while no visible indentation is present, has softened so much that it compresses significantly and quickly under my hips as soon as I lie down. By contrast, the pressure on my shoulders is beyond firm - which, as I'm a side sleeper, can be pretty uncomfortable. It's not possible to lie on this mattress for more than 2 minutes and maintain a neutral body posture. It's a pain in the neck. Literally! Again!<br/><br/>As I said, the mattress snows no visible indentation, so I don't think my problems fall under warranty or defective product. But I wanted to put this out there &amp; let you know that if you're a chubby side-sleeper, this probably isn't the mattress for you. Pity.<br/><br/>Update: Upgrading from two stars to four. You've got to give a company props for working so hard to make their customers happy. I heard from customer service shortly after posting this review and was assured that the uneven firmness I've experienced is "definitely not normal" and offered a replacement at no charge. My new mattress arrives tomorrow and I'm comfortable saying that, even if this doesn't turn out to be the perfect mattress for me, Tuft &amp; Needle as a company gets my recommendation. They're willing to stand behind their product and that's impressive these days.<br/><br/>Second Update: Have now been using the replacement mattress for a couple of months and am happy to report that it remains very comfortable. It seemed slightly less dense than the first mattress from the beginning, but has provided a very pleasant balance of soft &amp; supportive. I'm officially a fan and also very grateful to the fine folks at Tuft &amp; Needle for taking the initiative to fix this...they have my utmost respect. It took awhile -- but they've earned all 5 stars.<br/><br/>Final Update:  Hi people! I didn't realize there had been so much interest in this review - sorry if I left your questions hanging. I've been sleeping on the replacement mattress for over a year now, and am happy to report that it remains one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever owned. I'm even happier about getting a consistent, comfortable night's sleep.  In my opinion T&amp;N service AND product have earned every one of the five stars in this rating.
 This mattress gave me back pain. I enjoyed laying in it (I thought) but after a full night's rest I had severe back pain. I gave myself several months to adjust but the pain wouldn't go away.<br/><br/>I got my refund within 100 days contrary to what some one star reviews say. It is not impossible. You do not return the mattress, and must contact someone at amazon specifically. I got bounced around between a few people in chat, but once I got to the right person it was very easy.
 I have two other "bed-in-a-box" mattresses and this would be my third. I'm strange in the way that I am not typically brand agnostic. I like to try new things and try other brands. So in this case, the bed I currently sleep on (a Casper which I purchased about a year ago) is awesome and honestly I couldn't be more happy with it! The second mattress we have is a cheaper one I purchased on Amazon from Zinus (I honestly haven't slept on this one but my guests seem to like it). However when we recently moved and needed a third mattress I figured I would try something new just for fun. After a bit of poking around, I landed on Tuft and Needle, with the tremendous review count I thought I'd give it a shot... bad idea!<br/><br/>This mattress is so uncomfortable and so hot! First, I understand the recommendation to "give it time" so I did. I slept on this thing for almost three weeks and I just couldn't handle it any longer! It was rock hard at first and then as it "broke in" it became softer but also even more "dead" feeling. The mattress has no bounce or support as they claim.<br/><br/>After my poor experience I did some more research on their reviews to figure out why so many people apparently love this bed. I was amazed to see that there are articles supporting the claim that Tuft and Needle Amazon reviews are primarily false or skewed in some way. It really became clear to me when I searched their product on fakespot and they rated the Tuft and Needle product as an F!! I can't believe Amazon has let this go on and it certainly makes me questions all of Amazon's products.<br/><br/>Anyway, buyer beware and shop with care!
 I purchased this mattress July 16th,2016 with high hopes! It was a great mattress for the first 7-8 months. Then we started having severe back trouble and called T&amp;F on July 20th to warranty the mattress. That process was easy and smooth. They sent a new one and took our old one for free. Fast forward to today, July 20th,2017...Here we are again with severe back trouble, causing my wife not to be able to pick up our daughter and me having to take off work. Now needed to warranty yet another time, and crazy thing! EXACTLY at one year intervals. Would ONLY recommend this mattress to a college student or to be used as a guest bed.<br/><br/>To note, we are healthy individuals who are not overweight causing the problems.
 Okay Mattress for the price and customer service. Free delivery and free trial at home.<br/><br/>My first "memory foam or similar" mattress.<br/><br/>Different people have very different mattress needs and that's what makes buying a mattress complicated. Trying to satisfy everyone with one type is not realistic.<br/><br/>This mattress has good price and free delivery and trial free period as u r unable to test it otherwise... but even trying any mattress out at a store for 5 minutes won't be enough and most stores don't offer any returns.. So 5 starts for their policy.<br/><br/>Mattress is softer than expected and what's described and what many reviewers claimed to be too firm! It does sink slightly and the edges have poor support.<br/><br/>No odor.<br/>Inflated well and quick to size.<br/>No handles to grab on if u want to move.<br/>Soft to firm as more pressure sets on it.. which might be good for large percentage of people and hence the good reviews.<br/>Hard to judge on warmth/cool aspect.<br/><br/>So returned through Amazon within 30 days (convenient UPS home pickup) and was initially charged $27 return shipping that was refunded after a quick chat with them. So 👍 Amazon customer service-what we r used to getting.
 There is no such a thing as “one size fits all” when it comes to mattresses, since some will find a mattress too hard and others too soft, so I was skeptical about my first purchase of this mattress at the end of May. However, it was great! The right balance of cushion and support; a very comfortable sleep. So three months later I decided to buy a second mattress to fit both into my king sized bed frame. To my great disappointment, the second mattress was garbage. It was significantly softer and seemed used. When placing each mattress next to each other and taking turns laying on each one, my husband could tell the difference right away, with the “new” mattress significantly softer, causing a “sinking” effect. Tried to sleep on it for a few nights and it just led to back pain and my sciatica acting up.<br/><br/>I wish the company would offer different models based on firmness to allow its customers to choose based on needs. If it decides to change its product firmness based on customer feedback, it should have launched this product variation under a different series. Offering a different product under the same name is misleading. Wish I could get my hands on a mattress exactly like my first purchase :(
 If anybody is like me and suffers from lower back pain-this mattress is most definitely not for you. After reading the upwards of 25,000 4 and 5 star reviews, I decided to give the queen Tuft and Needle a try.  I love Amazon, and the price was super affordable, $595 for a queen. I figured what the hell, if I hate it I’ll just return it.<br/><br/>Well, I hated it.  It didn’t alleviate my back pain at all, in fact it made it worse.  On top of that, my neck started to get a kink in it (you know how sometimes you wake up and you can’t move your neck a certain way because it’s so painful? That was happening to me daily, it was literally torture).  I wasn’t sleeping, I was in pain all day every day. I ultimately bought an air mattress to sleep on my living room floor because I couldn’t take sleeping in my bed anymore.  The mattress was so soft, and it literally was forming to my body after 60 days. And I’m not a big person, 5’6, 165lbs.  The only reason this review got two stars is because Amazon gave me a full refund and helped me donate my mattress to a local shelter, which was awesome.  I’m glad they would rather put it to good use than add more to land fills.<br/><br/>Do not skim through all the good reviews like I did and say, “eh, I’ll give it a shot, what the hell.  I can just return it if I don’t like it”.  You will regret your decision, and suffer the entire duration of the trial period.
 I honestly don't get the thousands of 5 Star reviews.  We've had this bed for three nights, and I can't wait to get rid of it.  I was previously sleeping on a pillow-top inner spring mattress that had formed dents where our bodies slept, so we knew it was time for a new mattress - but whenever I laid my head to sleep I was out instantly and woke up eight hours later.  Not with this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress.  My sleep has been interrupted every night and I toss and turn endlessly as I can't get comfortable.  I'm a side sleeper and my shoulders, hips, and shins feel like they are getting crushed.  I am not large, only weigh 140 lbs.  My husband likes it, but when I'm miserable, nobody's happy..
 This mattress is a big chunk of foam rubber.  It lacks any side support, so do not sit on the edge of the bed, as you will slide off and fall on the floor.  Good for kids who just want to sleep on the floor.<br/>After sleeping on it for 2 nights I have severe back pain and I am now wearing a back brace.  Today I changed  back to my ten year old Ortho inner spring mattress that has real back support and excellent side support.  Had to rest on my old mattress today for several hours and my back is feeling better, so I am returning the Tuft and Needle for a refund, as it lacks proper spine support.
 This mattress is incredibly hard, uncomfortable, and you feel like you're going to roll off it if you get within 12" of the edge. I'm clueless how anyone ever gave this thing better than one star!. If it was easy to return, we would get rid of it. I can't believe anyone would ever like this mattress &amp; question all the positive reviews - fake? Paid? I don't know, just know it's horrible.
 Too "spongy" for me.  Maybe it is because I've used conventional inner spring mattresses all my life, but I can't get used to the spongy feeling of this mattress.  It is also very soft and my body tends to "sink in."  As usual, Amazon was awesome and issued a full refund!<br/><br/>P.S.  When the mattress arrived, the box was tattered, ripped, and covered with dirt.  This may be due to the shipping method used but it wasn't very impressive looking.
 We really wanted to like this mattress but it is just too hard, we regret not returning when we had the chance. We just wanted to give time to get used to it but it's actually causing us back pain. We also hoped it would soften over time but it didn't happen. If you like extra extra firm then this is for you otherwise maybe look into other options
 I was so excited for a new bed and the reviews were promising, but after the first night I woke up over and over in so much pain. I tried it for a few weeks, and every night I woke up with pain down my spine and in my shoulders. My husband woke up in pain every morning as well. Returning.
 I must start this review by saying; my husband and I are normal type sizes.<br/>He’s 6’ tall weighs 190, I’m 5’6” tall and weigh 148.  We typically sleep 6 to 7 hours each night.  My husband sits up (for about 45 mins) in the bed to read the newspaper every morning on his iPad.  We’ve had 5 beds in the last 8 years.  Almost every bed was super comfortable for the first month.  4 out of the 5 beds evolved to junk in less than 90 days.<br/>For those of us who desperately need a decent nights sleep this was extremely disappointing!  Bought this bed exactly one year ago received and set it up on November 14, 2017.  With each bed we purchased, we researched and asked others and tried several out in bed stores.  The only two we couldn’t try were the novaform memory foam (from Costco) and the T&amp;N I’m writing about.  The novaform was really good for about 6 months. However, we both starting waking up with lower back pain.  We turned the mattress numerous times but nothing solved the problem.  Called novaform they said take it back to Costco.  Called Costco they said bring it back.  Ordered the T&amp;N king mattress, set it up on our heavy duty slatted platform and took the novaform back to Costco.  The T&amp;N was amazing! I remember thinking, holy moly this is incredible! Why did we wait so long to get this mattress.  Waking up every morning without back pain was such a relief.  I felt invinceable! I could tackle any challenge thrown my way.  Seriously!<br/>This feeling lasted approximately 5 months.<br/>Then I started noticing the part of the bed where my butt lands was beginning to sink. Grrr! Not again! This can’t be happening. Well it did and the last few months feel like Groundhog Day.  Same situation as before.  A fabulous nights sleep turned into months of tossing, turning, repositioning, moving to the bottom of the bed, you name it we’ve tried it.<br/>The T&amp;N bed has left me feeling defeated.<br/>Our bed will be exactly one year old in two days and I’m sad to say it has to go. I’m planning to contact the customer service department tomorrow 11/12/18 and will update this review with their response.<br/>All we want is a restful nights sleep on a bed that remains comfortable for at least two years.  Is that too much to ask for?<br/>Anyone?
 I wanted to love this mattress...more than anything.  It hurts my back so bad that i had to start sleeping in my kids beds.  Now, onto the hassle free returns.  Today, UPS refused to pick up my mattress as its not in a box.  How exactly am i supposed to fit this king size mattress back in the tiny box it came in?  Now, UPS also gave me my tag and said i need to bring it to the facility.  What a disaster.  My suggestion is to only buy one of these mattresses if you know you surely won't be returning it.
 Like many other hundreds of reviews I read when choosing a new mattress, I considered myself one of those that would do my research so thoroughly that I would for sure make the right choice when deciding my new mattress! I spent weeks reading reviews, and doing my best to weigh up the 'pros' and 'cons' of all of the various options out there at the moment. Would the T&amp;N be worth the extra $$'s of the Lucid, or should I pay a little more for the Nectar or Casper. In the end I settled on the T&amp;N, partly as it was US made, and largely because it was sold directly through Amazon. I was really looking forward to the delivery of my mattress.....and when it arrived, I was VERY underwhelmed. No box. No logo. Just wrapped tightly in plastic (as can be seen in the picture attached). None the less, I decided to unpack it and let it expand. I had decided I would let it expand for 48hrs before sleeping on it, and I immediately looked for any defects or stains on the mattress as I had a pressing concern that this was a 'returned' mattress due to packaging on arrival. I let the mattress expand for 12hrs before deciding to measure it's depth, it was meant to be 10", but the hightest point I found was 9" and in some places, it was closer to 8".....not ideal. When moving the mattress to my bed, I also noticed a small dark stain on the underside of the mattress....but at this point I didn't care too much. It is at this point I got onto 'chat' with Amazon and I explained to the customer service rep that my mattress had arrived without a box. The lady immediately asked me if I would accept a 10% discount on the mattress, and by the fact that the mattress seemed completely undamaged, except for the small stain/mark and the fact it was not fully expanded, I accepted Amazon's offer. Having slept on the mattress for a couple of nights so far, what I can tell you is the mattress is quite firm, which suits me. But it does not feel firm in a 'cloud' way, it just feels FIRM in a solid way...if that makes any sense! Another factor that I find odd is that if I sit at the edge of my bed, the mattress does dip a lot on the outer edges of it....not sure if this is common in these types of mattresses. But my final thought on my experience so far while laying on the mattress this morning and feeling comfortable, yet a little underwhelmed is that for $750, would I have been better off trying one of the more inexpensive brands like a Lucid or a Classic Brands mattress and saved myself around $350 to $400? I really don't have the answer to that, but I would love to find out based on my experience to date if there is any huge difference in these mattresses besides branding and most importantly, cost? I will give my T&amp;N mattress a few more weeks to win me over, otherwise I may consider returning it and going for the Lucid or Classic Brands. To be continued......<br/><br/>UPDATE: After having had the mattress for over a month now, I contacted Amazon to have the mattress returned, which they made seamless, Amazon are awesome that way! I ended up ordering the Zinus 12" mattress which arrived yesterday and I have already unpacked and am letting expand, so I have no slept on it yet, but what I can tell you is that unlike the T&amp;N, so far the Zinus seems to have expanded fully, with no areas that are lagging, but I will know better when it is on my bed after my T&amp;N gets picked up in two days, so I will write another update when I have slept on the Zinus for a few days. Already the Zinus seems firm, but there is a 'plush' to it, not sure if that is as a result of it still expanding, we will find out. But what I am curious to see is how a $370 (after taxes) mattress compares to the $880 mattress (after taxes). I will write an update soon.
 So I bought this mattress with much enthusiasm after seeing the really cool mysterious billboards everywhere (Mattress stores are greedy). I read the product reviews and comments as well before purchasing. But sadly it is just not a comfortable mattress and I am returning it. I write this review as I lay here yet another night tossing and turning on what feels like a slab of concrete. If you like sleeping on concrete, then this mattress is for you.
 Purchased in 2016, reviewing in 2018<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>inexpensive<br/>light/easy to move<br/>a couple of years of great sleep<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Short term purchase<br/><br/>My husband and I have been waking up sore for the past few months, and decided to rotate the mattress to see if that would help. We immediately noticed a difference (not visibly) in that night’s quality of sleep. That means we had to rotate after a little under 2 years. Assuming this happens again, it looks like we’ll be replacing this mattress in another year and a half. Purchase this mattress if it won’t be used daily, or if you need a short term solution, but I wouldn’t recommend otherwise.
 we decided to try this mattress based on ratings on consumer reports and amazon reviews. Don;t know if we got a dud or if other people just like really hard beds. We tried this for several miserable nights of sleep. Then i put or old topper no it...it made it tolerable. we gave it 2 more week thinking maybe it just needed to break in or something. Tried it again with out the topper. woke up in sever pain....i don't have back problems. My wife  and i weigh 150 and 165 lbs and we didn't sink into the mattress at all, just floated on top. It was cooling, didn't get hot at all. Maybe this bed is intended for heavier people, don't know. just be aware that this bed is very very firm. oh...and it never did fully decompress maybe 9-10 in the middle but only around 8 on the sides, which means your sleeping on a dome.
 Too firm that lacks back support for back sleepers. It's literally a pain in the back. It's s Slow sneaky problem as the back discomfort doesn't come on immediately but after 1-2 weeks the you cannot make it through the night until you wake up with lower back pain.  Going back to my softer latex mattress alleviated the issue immediately in one night. That mattress has its own issue. It lower and mid back pain isn't one of them.  If your a back sleeper avoid.
 This was great initially, super comfortable!  Very easy to unpack and setup and I didn't notice much of an odor.<br/><br/>However, I'm noticing now that my back HURTS so bad when I wake up in the morning now, and I know it's because of this mattress.  Nothing changed with my exercise routine or lifestyle that would explain the soreness.  I'm not a person that is prone to back problems either.<br/><br/>Definitely not recommending.
 We wanted to like it, we really did.  It was our first bed-in-a-box purchase and we were excited.  The box arrived quickly and wasn't too much of a pain for the two of us to haul it up the stairs.  Unfolding the bed was kind of cool--seeing the expansion and all--so we were excited as we let it do it's thing for the required time.<br/><br/>The bed and cover are very well made and there wasn't much of a smell at all so we were very excited for that first night's sleep.  And this is where the problem arose.  Neither of us had a good night's sleep and we actually woke up stiff and sore.  We had read from some reviewers that we needed to give the mattress a chance so we soldiered through for 2 weeks.  I even walked on the mattress a couple of times as I read that someone else did that in an attempt to make it softer.  But it was all to no avail.<br/><br/>We finally gave up.  We were dragging around our respective work offices, sleepy and with sore shoulders, hips and backs so we decided to find another mattress.  We called the Amazon large item return number and they were very nice about everything.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, for us anyway, if you're a side-sleeper this may not be the mattress for you.  It's quite firm and in almost 3 weeks time it hasn't gotten much better for us.  We've ordered a softer mattress which should be delivered in a few days.<br/><br/>Now, if you're a back sleeper or like firm mattresses then I would heartily recommend the T &amp; N bed.  It really is a well-made mattress--just too firm for us.
 Very hard...literally not much different than sleeping on a carpeted floor. I am 220 lbs and barely make a dent in the mattress. I bought this because of the very good reviews. My experience does not match those reviews at all.  I had tried several foam mattresses in furniture stores before I purchased this one. Everyone was very comfortable to lay on, even the firm ones had a soft surface. I assumed this one would be the same. This had a great price and was on sale for $100 off .... plus a lot of company hype from their website about what a fantastic mattress they make.  After a week or two, I was in Costco and a cool foam topper was on sale for $100. I purchased one to put on the new mattress. At least with the topper, I can sleep on it now. Bottom line.. I saved S100 because it was on sale then had to purchase a topper for $100 to make it comfortable enough to sleep on. I learned my lesson ... I will never buy a mattress online again.
 This was the worst mattress I’ve ever had. I kept it for 20 days to give it a fair chance, but my back and shoulders were giving me so much pain when I woke up every morning that I couldn’t handle another night. If you have a bad back I highly recommend you do not purchase this bed. It’s suppose to be soft and comfortable- I guess if you like sleeping on a board! I give it a 0 out of 10.
 I do have to admit this is the first time i've ever slept on a foam bed and to be honest I don't really think its for me.<br/><br/>Pros: Price, I purchased the California king for $665 + tax.<br/>  You don't need a box spring.<br/>  You can put it on basically any type of frame or no frame at all.<br/><br/>Cons: There is only 1 firmness available and I'm not sure what they call it, but it's soft.  (I am 6' 195 lbs athletic), My 5'4" 135 lb girl friend likes it.<br/>  It is much warmer than sleeping on a spring mattress.<br/><br/>Overall: If you like soft foam beds than this is a pretty good deal. However for me, Id rather sleep on my 10 year old no-name spring mattress. Since I can't return the frame I might as well keep the bed.
 I have had this mattress for 9 months..<br/>They say 30 days to get use to it..In long term I hate it...I wake up with more back pain than I ever ever did...I waisted my money on it..<br/>I am a petite women an I don't sink in it like most people do.. I can not sleep no longer than 5 hours on it...I would not waist your money...long term it's just not what all the reviews made it out to be..
 I ordered this mattress in Aug and it is now Dec. initially I was pleased as the mattress is comfy at first. Now, 4 months later, the mattress has completely sunk in the middle. Don't waste your money. Spend the extra and get a better quality mattress.
 It's a little firm for my tastes (I'm a side-sleeper).  If I don't move much during the night, I will wake up a little sore.  But for the price and ease of ordering/delivery, I'm super-satisfied.
 Update: we have have had the mattress for 7 months now and it is most certainly losing its firmness. It is not terrible yet but, I would not recommend it for anyone looking for good support that lasts longer than 3 or 4 months.<br/><br/>We have been sleeping on this mattress for 3 months. I would recommend it to anyone. I deal with periodic inflammation issues which had previously  resulted in some achy nights. I have not had one single achy night on this mattress. My daughter needs a new mattress and we are planning on buying her a Tuft and Needle twin size. Unless the company changes the quality negatively or starts charging too much we will not buy anything else.
 This is the least comfortable mattress ever. Both my husband and I agree this mattress is horrible. We wake up daily with back and joint aches. It is firm, but without providing any support for your joints.  We tried to give this mattress the benefit of the doubt, we really did. We were hoping the mattress would get more comfortable over time...Nope. There is no help for it. If you want the worst sleep of your life, this mattress is for you.<br/><br/>We tried this mattress because we were on a budget and didn't want to spend a thousand dollars on a bed we couldn't resell. It's a "sunk cost" because now we have to buy our 2nd mattress in 2 years. He and I are counting the minutes until our new mattress arrives, and we can throw away this awful piece of foam.
 We loved our king size mattress so much when we bought in almost four years ago, that we wound up buying twins for the kids. We thought we’d get many years of comfortable sleep out of them. At the time of purchase, there were many positive reviews from people suffering chronic pain. As someone with chronic pain, I was convinced. We got probably two good years out of this mattress. My husband and I finally realized that the cause of my increased pain levels and his new chronic shoulder pain may be attributed to our mattress. How could we be so sure? We recently got away from home and kept remarking how well we slept, how refreshed we felt. Thinking back the last couple of years, any other bed  has felt like a cloudy comfortable dream compared to our bed. The kids’ mattresses seem to be timing out as well. This is not just a bummer, this has actually impacted our family negatively because of chronic poor sleep and bodily pain. I can’t believe it took us so long to figure out the root cause, but maybe because our sleep quality has been so poor? (!!) Also, it’s worth noting that most sheets do not fit this beast of a mattress properly and it is extremely hard to change the sheets as a result because it has to be jammed into standard bed frames. It is slightly easier to change sheets on a platform bed that only sits about an inch into the frame, but even still you’ll be straining your wrists and neck to get the last corner of a fitted sheet on.
 Did not like.  For my back, needing stabilization, this was soft and unsupportive.  Return policy sounds good- but how can you get a vacuum packed mattress back into a relatively small box? (I gave it away).  Expensive experiment..
 I really wanted to like this product. The company's culture and stance on keeping costs low through efficiency was very appealing, and there seemed to be overwhelmingly good reviews. I was a little nervous about ordering a mattress without being able to lay on it first, but the previously mentioned remarks made me want to give it a shot. Overall, I don't have a lot of negatives. I'm not sure if I'm the type of person who would be blown away by the best mattress in the world anyway, and I'm not typically someone who needs to return any sort of purchase. I've slept on this mattress for about three weeks, but have decided to return it within the 30-day window.<br/><br/>To the point: the mattress was comfortable--not too soft, not too hard. My issue was the heat-retention of the mattress. On a few occasions over a few weeks I would wake up and feel like I was almost stuck to the sheets with sweat. I know that may sound like a personal problem, but I can confidently say that this never occurred with my old spring mattress that I had for 10+ years before this one. This was especially noticeable because my room has been slightly colder than the rest of the house since cooler weather rolled-in, so I can rule-out the possibility that where I was sleeping was generally too hot. The heat/sweat was only on the side of me that was in contact with the mattress.<br/><br/>I don't want to dissuade everyone from buying this mattress because I still think this is (probably) a solid company with good intention. I'm glad that so many others enjoy this mattress; it is just not the one for me.
 I bought this in May, 2017 after suffering with the worst case of sciatica.  I felt I needed to replace my old mattress.  So I chose the Tuft &amp; Needle after reading the reviews.  The mattress is too soft and doesn't give me enough support for my lower back.  Because the mattress is on the soft side, the sides are very soft.  Sitting on the edge causes me to slip right off.  Very disappointed.
 I wanted to love this mattress. Comfort wise I give it a B+. No pain issues or anything while sleeping on it, easy to get comfortable and fall asleep. My only issue with this mattress is that I get so so so incredibly hot when I sleep on it. I have never been a person to sweat profusely when I sleep (unless I have the flu, lol). Ever since I have had this mattress I wake up DRENCHED in sweat on the side of my body that is facing the mattress. Then I flip over, kick off the covers to cool down, and get incredibly cold because my clothes are soaked. Repeat this pattern all night long and it equates to waking up several times a night. I've never had this happen with any other mattress. It's really too bad because this mattress is super convenient and comfortable from a firmness perspective. I will be returning it.
 We switched from a 7 year old pillow-top to this mattress, and at first I was happy (she was not).  Delivery was quick, and we opened the box the day it arrived.  The mattress expanded to full size in just a few minutes, and we left it overnight in the basement to dissipate the off-gassing.  It was softer on the top 2 inches, firmer below.  Compared to the old inner-spring pillow top, the bouncy give was gone, this had more consistent support.  It was nice to be rid of the W shaped depressions.  Edge support was less, but still fine (I could sit on the side to put on shoes, etc).  The best feature was that we could not feel each other moving during the night, so were not disturbed by that.  But neither my wife nor I noticed any reduction in back pain. In fact it seemed worse as the weeks went on.  My wife's main complaint was that it was too hot. She was waking up feeling hot and trapped/sunk/smashed into the mattress several times each night.  We sleep with the A/C turned down to ~70F.  So after 60 days of complaining, we switched back to the old inner-spring pillow top as a test (still had it in the basement).  I honestly expected her to say the T&amp;N mattress was better.  But for the next week we were sleeping though the night, back pain gone on the old mattress.  So we're working on return processing now.  FYI, we're both 49. I'm 6'1" 170lb. Wife is 5'8" and heavier than me.  5 stars for Tuft&amp;Needle/Amazon's 100 day trial policy.  Less for the mattress, which was made well but didn't suit us.
 Really nice value in a bed.  As the others have stated, comes in a relatively (for a mattress) small box packed in a plastic bag under vacuum.  The box will easily fit through most doorways, so aside from the weight (I think a little under 70 lbs. for a queen), it's much easier to get through the house than a conventional mattress.  The UPS guy carried it up to the house without a dolly and I was able to get it into the bedroom and set up by myself, but for many people might be more comfortably a two-person job. I put mine on top of my old box spring for now, and the mattress expanded perfectly and is a perfect shape and size.<br/><br/>There was a very mild smell when first opening which dissipated quickly.  I bought a memory foam topper once which took days and the smell was very strong, but fortunately this has none of that.<br/><br/>This mattress to me has just the right amount of cushion and nicely bouncy.  You won't sink in it like in a traditional memory foam bed, and it has just the right amount of compromise between softness and firmness.  I find I sleep a lot more soundly and wake up less than in my old bed.  I bought a very expensive hybrid foam/coil mattress a few years ago and absolutely hate it as there's no support and I woke up with body aches.<br/><br/>Only one negative - this bed can get kind of warm if you're a hot sleeper.  Not nearly as bad as traditional memory foam, but as a side sleeper I sometimes wake up and my side and especially hips are a little uncomfortably warm.  I am about 170 # but if you're bigger where you night sink in more and if you tend to sleep hot, this bed might be a problem for you.  Not enough of a problem I'd send it back, but something I hope the manufacturer looks to improve.
 First the good - it is solid and supports amazingly well for a mattress only 10 inches thick. The fit and finish looks good and I detected little to no off-gassing. Also, it does not sleep hot which some do. The bad - it is FIRM. I mean, like laying on a board with a foam topper over it firm. I prefer a more firm mattress, but this is even too firm for me. I will give it a bit to see if it breaks in, but may have to resort to a eggshell foam topper or something similar.
 This was my second mattress from Tuft &amp; Needle. This review is for my second purchase of their queen size mattress. I purchased the mattress more than 100 days ago (April) and now realize that this second mattress is defective as I am a small framed person (130lbs) and can't understand why there are already indentations in the mattress and I basically sink with no support whether sleeping on my side or my back and it's only myself sleeping on the mattress. I did notice that when I received the mattress it never expanded to 10" but thought perhaps over time it would expand to the correct size.  I can't help wonder if there is a layer of product missing from the mattress, manufactured differently, etc.  The first mattress which my son still enjoys at his place is nothing like this one. After two years it has no indentations and is both firm and comfortable (he is 6'2" 180lbs).  I have had excruciating lower back pain now realizing it's because of my new Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. I recently slept elseware for a few days and woke up with no back pain at all. I was confident in my choice of choosing Tuft &amp; Needle for a second time but now know that may have not been the best decision.  I wish I could have given my second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress a 5 star review☹️
 It's seem like it's good quality, but it's a good bit too firm for me as a 170lb side sleeper. It's not super firm, but I would say it's a bit more firm than a medium-firm hotel bed like they tend to advertise this as. Firm is a fair classification. I tried 2 different toppers on it, and it only seemed to make matters worse. Toppers on too firm foam mattresses don't seem to really work well like they do on too firm spring mattresses.<br/><br/>Inflated quickly and uniformly unlike one of those cheap Zinus mattresses where all the corners are different heights. Cover isn't super thick, but it feels very nice to the touch and looks nice.<br/><br/>T&amp;N support said it takes two weeks to "break-in". I slept on it 2 weeks and the break in is very slight. If you like it the 1st night or 2, that's good. If you don't, you're probably not gonna like it 2 weeks later.
 Not as nice as I hoped.  Very firm, which I prefer, but I do not sleep well on this even after about 2 months.  I wake up with a HURTING back every morning.<br/><br/>I have ordered a foam topper and hope this might help but as for the mattress, it is a fail for me but what do you do?  It is not so easy to get rid of a mattress!
 This is a great mattress at a great price with amazing customer support. It didn't work for me only because it didn't really fit us. Mattresses are a lot like clothing. It's impossible to know if something is going to fit until you try it on. In this case, not a great fit for me. My back didn't hurt, I just didn't find it unusually comfortable. That said, the top later of foam is some neat stuff. It's one of the most satisfying feeling things I've ever touched. I would frequently play with it before bed.<br/><br/>Everything about the mattress is well made and the cover is soft and pleasant feeling. The layers are precisely cut and well fit together.<br/><br/>Now, the customer support. Just amazing.<br/><br/>The return policy is easy and painless. Just call Amazon and they walk you right through it. No fuss, no arguing, no haggling. Just a three minute conversation.<br/><br/>That's why I'm still giving it five stars. I can't fault it for not fitting me and everything objective about it is great.<br/><br/>Give it a shot. It will work for a lot more people than it doesn't work for and is absolutely worth your time.
 This mattress was very easy to order, set up and is very comfortable.<br/><br/>It was way past the time to replace my mattress, and I had seen this mattress with great reviews. I dreaded my last purchase experience with salesman at furniture stores! They follow you around, and sometimes do not know exactly what they're talking about. Since I usually shop after reading and researching products before I shop I know what I'm ready to purchase. Salesmen often try to up-sell you at stores too, and I didn't care to shop around all day from store to store and deal with them.<br/><br/>Buying this mattress via Amazon was simple, and the reviews are very helpful. As stated, this mattress is comfortable and is more on the firm side even though it is made of foam. It has great support, retains its shape, and stays pretty cool since I live in South Florida.
 We started mattress shopping last week and almost sold a child to buy a temperpedic adaptpro ($4500) it seemed like it was the only and best option for us since my hubby is 6’7 280# and I’m 5’4 130# and every mattress  we’ve had gets ruined with his body indentations and i end up sleeping in the hole 😂 we soon realized mattress shopping is a nightmare, SO many options! I did a fb poll on 2 big groups I’m in and this mattress was suggested highly. I checked it out on amazon, read a ton of reviews and it just happened to be the deal of the day! Being so over the mattress talk I went for it!!<br/>We just got our mattress delivered this afternoon and set up! Delivery was very fast, I ordered on Tuesday, it arrived Thur (2 days!!) the box is heavy as expected but easy to move because the box has handles. Easy to unwrap and boom it’s on our bed in less than 10 Min!! I read a few reviews regarding a smell, there is a smell when you put your nose to the mattress, but nothing overbearing and I imagine it’ll be gone in a day or so. The mattress cover is SO soft and the firmness of the mattress is a 3-4 outta 10, 1 being the softest 10 being a brick.  I’m so excited to sleep on it tonight!<br/> I’ll update after a few nights of sleep 😴<br/>**update after (attempting to) sleep on mattress a few nights but ended up in the guest room due to how firm this mattress is! I have not been able to fall asleep to date on the mattress, we even bought a 4” gel foam mattress topper to help w the firmness, no dice. In original review i guesses w/o sleeping on mattress a 3-4 for firmness, it’s definitely a 8-9. My hubby doesn’t mind it, but he could sleep in a bathtub so that’s doesn’t say much 😂<br/> For reference I’m 5’4 130# and my hubby is 6’7 285#. We are returning mattress, sadly.
 The mattress finally expanded to its advertised parameters.<br/><br/>I bought a Zinus mattress during the same time to compare... The Zinus had a pretty nasty chemical odor for the first few days. The Tuft and needle had absolutely no odor.<br/><br/>In short, the Zinus mattress is a better product. It's significantly more comfortable and I paid only $131 for it. While the T&amp;N cost me $250.00...  The T&amp;N isn't firm enough for me. It feels cheap and spongy on top, and if I am not completely in the center of the mattress, I feel like I am sliding off.<br/><br/>I'll give it a few more nights but I think i'll have to end up returning this and buying a larger Zinus.
 I'm not going to write a full review since thats been done many times over. Overall we really like the mattress. First off, It is firmer than expected. If I were to walk into a mattress store I likely would choose a softer mattress over this. However, I've had back pain in the morning for years and that's likely due to a softer mattress that doesn't offer enough support. Mind you I weigh about 160 lbs, my wife even less. I imagine if you weigh more, it may feel softer. Mattress is definitely slippery but nothing a little non slip material can't fix <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Under-Rug-Non-Slip-Pad-Rug-Mat-4x6-Rug-Gripper-For-Hard-Floors-Securing-Carpet-On-Hardwood-Floor-Non-Slip-Pad-For-Mattress/dp/B0778Q8ZDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Under Rug Non Slip Pad, Rug Mat 4x6, Rug Gripper For Hard Floors,Securing Carpet On Hardwood Floor, Non Slip Pad For Mattress</a> We really like our metal bed frame as well after adding thin plywood <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Olee-Sleep-14-Inch-T-3000-Heavy-Duty-Steel-Slat-Non-slip-Support-Bed-Frame-14BF04Q-QUEEN/dp/B01C8PIVKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Olee Sleep 14 Inch T-3000 Heavy Duty Steel Slat / Non-slip Support Bed Frame 14BF04Q (QUEEN)</a> (See other review).
 Note - I usually don't write detailed product reviews but I am happy with this purchase and am finally getting a good night sleep.  If I can help someone with this review, not waste money on mattresses that are not comfortable and get a better night sleep it is worth the time I spent writing it.<br/><br/>My wife and I have gone through four mattresses in our 18 years of marriage.  We have purchased inexpensive and very expensive mattresses without finding a comfortable one.  We have had sagging and giant humps in the middle.<br/><br/>Finally, we found one that worked and is comfortable for each of us.  **We have slept on the mattress for about 4 months when I am writing this review.<br/><br/>Our problem with our King sized mattresses in the past is that they sag heavily and have a giant hump in the middle.  To try to prevent this sagging/hump issue we purchased two twin XL mattresses and put them next to each each other vs. buying one King size mattress.  Our thoughts is that this would help with the large span/needed support for a king size bed which may have been a contributing factor to our mattress issues.  Our existing sheets fit fine with no issues.  The butted against each other without any gap in the middle.<br/><br/>This helped with the sagging/hump in the middle issue.  Finally.<br/><br/>One problem that we had is that my wife's side was a bit too hard for her given her natural curves and pressure points.  I called the Tuft and Needle customer support line for ideas.  They promptly send out a free mattress topper at no charge for her to try.  This took care of my wife's pressure point issues and she is now comfortable when she sleeps.  There is a slight difference in height between her side and mine, but has not been a problem for cuddling and other related bedroom activities--worth it for a good nice sleep.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the T&amp;N customer support and responsiveness for helping with this issue--no problems and no hassles.  I feel comfortable if there are issues with the mattress in the 100 day warranty period they will stand by their guarantee.  Hindsight, it really is a no risk purchase.<br/><br/>I don't view the mattress as a 15 year mattress given the low price point however we will see.  I am just basing on other reviewers.  If I purchase a new mattress every 7-8 years but get a nice nights sleep it is worth it.  $800 mattress purchase price divided by 84 months = $10 per month--well worth it.
 I was a skeptic, but I'm a believer..well basically.  I was pretty concerned about buying a bed in a box online, but the return policy really makes it a no brainer to try.  We pretty quickly decided this thing was staying.<br/>I am a back sleeper who suffers from low back pain and needs a firm mattress.  My wife is a side sleeper who hates the sinking feeling of a memory foam and demands I not steel her covers.<br/>This mattress is firm and feels firmer than maybe you would like at first. Give it a week and you may experience what we now describe as the best mattress we've ever owned.<br/>I did however make a slight adjustment.  I added a cheap thin egg crate to the top.  Another reviewer suggested this exact thing because of his weight (250+) and he was right.  It adds just enough softness to help with the hip support.<br/>There was no smell and it was pretty easy to "install" .  The only problem now is getting rid of the old mattress.
 I read most of the 10,000 reviews. I bought our last bed here on amazon, and it was great. This bed is better than great. Smell was gone in about 3 hours. It expanded in about 20 minutes to near full size, and by bedtime was full form. It has firm edges that are very sharp and well shaped! Sleeping on it as a 270lb 6' tall man I was sleeping on a cloud. I have 3 bad disks, and it has been hard to sleep on my side. This bed allowed me to sleep on my side! There are not hard spots, or pressure points at all for me. I am amazed! Totally worth the money, this bed is the right size. All our california king size sheets fit perfectly on the bed, and the mattress fit perfect on our frame. So thank Tuft &amp; Needle for the superior bed, made in America! Worth every penny!
 It has been 20 (Twenty) days since I began using my bed. I know I have 100 night free trial, and so I will probably update once more, of course. But I will get to the comfort of those twenty days first since I found something that made the bed even more extraordinarily comfortable for me instead of using it just by itself.<br/><br/>Now, using it by itself allowed me to sleep great!, but not like a baby. The mattress itself is firm (squishy firm). I noticed after a week of using it that the initial firmness is not the firmness you'll get after a week. Meaning, give it a little time and it will definitely firm up more.<br/>This was a big step-up from my old (almost no support) spring mattress that was topped with a 3in memory foam from Costco. Really, I would get back pain from it. Not unbearable, but it would not be a comfortable sleep or morning let me tell ya. Using the mattress by itself, I initially noticed more pain...WEIRD RIGHT? but as I got more and more use to it, I began to get more use to the bed and the pain began to diminish. Next thing you know, I am waking up in a river of drool lol. I knew then that my old mattress really REALLY SUCKED!<br/><br/>If I drooled, then why didn't I felt like I slept like a baby? For me, I felt there was something missing. I would get into bed and it would be comfortable...but I didn't feel secure. And so, it took me a while to sleep. (I am a weird one, I know). Kind of like how some people (children) can't sleep without therir stuff animal, no matter the comfort of the mattress.<br/><br/>THEN! after having gotten rid of my mattress, I still kept my MEMORY FOAM TOPPER. I was cleaning and thought to myself, "my mattress is comfortable, but before I throw you (memory topper) out, let me give you a try, it'll make my bed WAY high, but it doesn't hurt to experiment lol" so I did. BEST DECISION EVER!!!!<br/><br/>---First let me say that, I personally, find no real benefit to a memory foam topper, especially on a spring mattress which was unsupportive and hard like the floor. It will be soft at first, but then by the middle of the night, be flatten down to the point it felt like I was just sleeping on the mattress (aka the floor bed teehee). But I did enjoy that it gave me a nice SNUGLY feeling. And thats the feeling I have been missing, that SNUG feel.<br/><br/>I did not care much for its added benefits, but that snugness it provided, I loved! I am one of those people (having just recently learned about it myself) that enjoys that SUNKEN feel, where the bed just wraps around you like its giving you a HUG haha. Adding that memory foam topper made a big difference for me and my comfort, especially it already being on a mattress that has GREAT SUPPORT. All I needed to SLEEP LIKE A BABY was that snuggle feel the topper provided.<br/>---Nights of using the memory foam topper---<br/>I slept so quickly, drooled an ocean, and did not even wake up to my alarm...and when I did, I did not even want to get off my bed. Work? whats that? Do I need to go? haha<br/>It made my bed kind of high, I mean 3inches on top the 10in?? thats 13in!!! But I was fine with it, felt like the princess and the pea, sleeping up high on all the mattresses, but unlike her, there was no "pea" of discomfort, just a nice RESTFUL sleep.
 Sorry ... couldn't handle it ... we tried this in during winter time ... each of the 4 days we slept on this mattress i was up at like 4 am my torso and legs sweaty ... my wife found this mattress too hard and refused to sleep after 3 days due to back aches ... both of us became like zombies ... sleepy achy beings within 3 days ... had to bring back out old mattress and squeeze/pack this mattress for return to Amazon ... lets see if the return goes smoothly
 Although I was skeptical at a rolled up mattress that arrived in a neat little box, this mattress lives up to the support promised. We converted from an old traditional spring mattress that has become painfully worn out. Unfortunately, my husband sleeps very hot and I was waking up pretty sweaty though I usually sleep at a pretty average temp. We'll be returning the mattress as it seems the memory foam, though promising to sleep cooler than others, just doesn't breathe enough. We sleep with the AC cranked (usually thermostat at 71), and hubby had to get up and sleep on the couch. I can only give this product two stars at this point as I want to test whether the return process and 100 day money back guarantee is as good as it sounds. Meanwhile, we will be looking for a regular firm spring coil mattress as it seems the memory foam just isn't for us.******UPDATE: I added another 2 stars for the way our return was handled. Very satisfied that Amazon lived up to the guarantee, but keep in mind we did not push it to even 30 days before initiating the return. Customer Service was very easy to deal with, we didn't have to deal with figuring out how to get the mattress back in the box, and the money was refunded as promised in 3-5 days.
 I've slept on this mattress 3-nights and love it.  Three great nights of sleep so far.  I bought it to replace a 5-yr old Tempur-Pedic, which cost and arm and a leg.  I regretted buying that mattress after about 1 -year, but figured I'd have to suck it up because I wasn't going to spend another fortune so soon.  Then I found this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress on Amazon.  I could not believe a Twin XL was only $375.  I researched the T&amp;N product and company for about a week, and it soon became a no-brainer to try it out.  So glad I did.<br/><br/>I'm a side sleeper and the memory foam mattress would make me feel "stuck" in my own impression.  It was a chore to roll over from one side to the other, which I do a lot before I fall asleep, though not so much that last few nights.  It was hot, and not very supportive, which is probably why my back starting hurting.  Anyway, all those issues were gone the first night.  I had to make sure it wasn't a fluke so I waited two more nights before I wrote this review.  I will update in month, but unless something drastic happens, this is an easy 5-star review.<br/><br/>I do have one minor problem with the 10" height.  My wife and I have two Twin XL's on an adjustable King frame, so we can both raise/lower our mattresses independently.  But, her mattress is 12", so there's a bit of ridge in the middle.  I may have to look into the T&amp;N topper, but for now I am very satisfied with this purchase. I highly recommend this mattress to anyone and everyone who isn't comfortable in their own bed.
 I did my research before buying another memory foam bed. And, for the most part this mattress came back with great reviews for a decent price. Last night was the first night we slept on it and i must say i was pretty disappointed. the firmness is too much for me, but my husband seems to be fine with it.<br/>Also, I think I got hotter in this mattress than I did our 5 year old cheap memory foam mattress. I actually got up and slept on the couch as I couldn't get comfortable in it- which is rare from me.<br/>Put aside all the negativeness, I am willing to try it for a few more nights... hoping I will like it cause at this point I am assuming I will be returning it- which i can't even fathom trying to return this and get it back into the small box it arrived in.<br/><br/>Update: going to return it. its so firm and I feel like i am sleeping on a hard hotel bed.
 I needed a new bed because I was in so much pain from my $2500 name brand mattress! I Woke every day and had to fly out of bed because of the pain .Anyway, We bought the Tuft &amp; Needle and we both sleep pretty good.No more numb limbs or pain.I LOVE This bed. This is my third bed in the last 2 years. I sleep very well now, I had another bed before this one that I sent back from a tv shopping channel. I have severe neck and back issues and my husband has had back surgery and we are finally comfortable! What I find hard to believe is the price, I really thought this bed would be returned.No way can a bed that cost less than $800 be better than my $2500 bed.It is and I am so Thankful.Sleep is so important, I had bags and dark circles under my eyes, now I look refreshed and the dark circles are gone!! We have our twin adjustable bed frames connected for our king size mattress.This time, just in case we needed to buy different mattresses we bought 2 twin xl.I prefer a softer bed and hubby prefers a firmer mattress.Tuft &amp; Needle does it for both of us.
 I cannot recommend this mattress. The cover is nice, so the mattress looks nice, but it is as hard as a rock. The bottom 3/4 foam layer is so hard that it completely wipes out the softer top 1/4. We have had it for almost three months now and I wake up every morning with sore muscles and a kink in my neck. I am a belly/back/side sleeper and this bed has made me toss and turn worse than I used to. I will be returning the mattress soon.
 So far so good.  Delivered to the door.  Great packaging, not overkill, but just enough to protect the product.  I pulled the mattress out of the box and it was wrapped in an outer wrap and then in a sealed plastic, like those storage bags with the vacuum on TV.  I removed the outer wrap and carefully cut the sealed bag and "WHOOSH" the mattress sprang to life.  It took all of a minute.  I let it be for an hour before I got on it.  There was ZERO smell.  I think I lasted five minutes and fell asleep.  No sag.  It gives to your body and supports you.  Amazing.  It's been about three days now sleeping on it and all is well.  I'll update the review as necessary if anything changes.  Right now I'm a happy camper.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  It's been four days sleeping on it and now I'm waking up tired and with back ache.  I'll give it a few more days and see if I am maybe in an adjustment period to the style of bed as this is my first foam mattress.  We'll see.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  It's been several months and I've only managed to sleep on it a handful of times throughout the night.  I missed the window to return it or I would have.  I wake up with shoulder pain because it doesn't give yet at your center of gravity it gives too much and I get low back pain from my spine getting out of alignment.  This isn't the answer for me.  Waste of money.
 The biggest problem is that it is not at all suitable for side sleepers as it is too firm. My arm/hand go numb when I fall asleep.<br/>We previously had a lattex mattress and this did not happen.<br/>The bed is also extremely "hot" so if you hate having heat trapped as you sleep this is not for you.<br/>I actually am really disappointed that the bed is just a glorified hard foam mattress.<br/>Layers of 'this and that' which they describe do not mean a thing. It is a foam mattress.<br/>We spent nearly $700 on this and were expecting a really special product.<br/>The marketing hype made me buy it and now I wish I could return it.<br/>But trying to return it sounds impossible !! Getting it re-sealed and lifting the mattress out of the room first.<br/>I do not agree with T&amp;N policy that Amazon customers do not get access to their pick up service.<br/>This is second rate customer service and we pay the same price on T&amp;N website as Amazon.
 1 YEAR LATER. We ordered our mattress last December (it is now November); I wanted to wait to leave my review. This mattress has given us the most excruciating back pain of our lives! I sleep better on our couch! Amazon/Tuft and Needle should refund due to horrific bs reviews, not to mention the pain we now sleep with because we’re stuck with this mattress until we can afford a new one.
 I bought two of these mattresses in June. I wanted a firm mattress because I have had back issues in the past. One of the reviews I read before buying said that over time my back pain would improve. I have had the mattress a little over six months and my back pain has persisted. I recently went on vacation for a week. Within a few days of sleeping in the hotel bed my back felt a lot better. I have been back home for two nights now and my back has been killing me all day. I wish I would have stuck with my Beautyrest.
 Well, it's a great mattress which seems to cover the spectrum of comfort needs. One thing to watch out for is that it is very light weight and will shift on a box spring foundation; which requires periodic pushing back into position. Also, I would recommend not trying to set on the edge of the bed as there is no edge so to speak. I tired to sit on the edge to get dressed and nearly ended up on the floor.
 I've been sleeping on this for a little over three months and wake up with the worst back ache I've ever had.  It took me months to pick out a mattress and obviously made a bad purchase and will now have find another mattress to buy - spending double the money.  I contacted Amazon today about a return and was told that after 30 days there is no returns.  However, I see other reviews were people were actually helped and refunded their money or where Amazon came up with a solution to helping the costumer instead of blowing them off.  30 days isn't enough to know whether a mattress is going to work out for someone or not.  I am very unsatisfied with this product and with the service amazon has provided.
 Very disappointed to have paid a premium price for a mattress based on an inaccurate description.  We had tested in stores "Medium" firmness mattresses and felt that would be a good compromise for my husband and I.  This mattress is much firmer than other "Medium" mattresses and more expensive.  For my husband and I both, if we are in bed longer than 6 hours it starts to hurt at the pressure points, shoulders and hips.  We have had the bed for about 45 days and it is not softening up.  Also, it doesn't get softer during the night as older memory foam mattresses that got warm and soft.<br/>Also, the customer service was terrible.  Tuft &amp; Needle has a chat option on their website so I expressed my concern that it was too firm and am considering returning it.  The agent asked where I purchased it - when I answered "Amazon" the reply came back that T&amp;N cannot access my purchase information and she abruptly ended the chat.  I later saw that T&amp;N sells a topper for the mattress that will make it "softer".  Customer service never even mentioned it as an option.
 So my husband and I have tried a bunch of these beds. I’m average sized, my husband is built like a retired NFL lineman. We hope this can steer you in the right direction.<br/><br/>The Tuft and Needle is really great for people 250lbs and under and still ok for bigger folks. We have tried a Casper and own a Nectar and a Saatva mattress in addition to our Tuft and Needle. Our master bedroom has a Stearns  and Foster hybrid from a brick and mortar store.<br/><br/>The Nectar is firmer and better for larger folks but may be a bit firm for lighter individuals. Not much sinkage If your under 150lbs but has a ton of support for bigger folks. This bed has more of the a “wet sand” feel of traditional memory foam beds.<br/><br/>We found the original Casper had too much sinkage for our tastes - especially for heavier people. We returned it within 2 weeks.<br/><br/>The Saatva markets itself as luxe but actually feels like a mid level spring mattress. We ordered the plush model and still found it to be too firm with little cushion before you felt the springs. Still a decent spring mattress.<br/><br/>The Tuft and Needle is a good mix of softness and support. Perfect for normal sized folks. Our first order had an defect that wouldn’t air out. Amazon was kind enough to send a replacement. This bed doesn’t sleep hot - though it’s not especially cool. If your under 250 ish pounds, the materials allow for some sinkage while still providing moderate support. It’s not “bouncy” but also is more responsive than a true memory foam bed. I was comfortable in most positions however my larger husband found he had to sleep on his side to be comfortable with the amount of sinkage that occurred. All in all this bed is great for average sized couples. For the price it is an exceptional value as a daily sleeper or guest bed.
 I was hesitant because of the bad reviews but boy were they wrong. I can’t speak for long term since my mattress was delivered yesterday but short term - the mattress is fantastic. I opened it up and it expanded with no problem. It’s lighter than my lousy 10+ year old spring matress and is super comfortable. I was concerned about the firmness so I hopped right on and immediately fell in love. It was the perfect amount of firmness and soft. No chemical smell AT ALL. I was so excited about how it turned out that I’m leaving a review. Will update if anything changes.<br/><br/>Update: 7 months later and still amazing. I didn’t realize how wonderful my sleep would be. For the price, it was totally worth it. No sinking, no soreness. Firm enough for support but soft for comfort.
 I have severe back problems that require several more surgeries.  My Nuerosurgeon recommended the expensive adjustable name brand beds which range from $3-5k for king beds (lift separately).  Consurmer Reports said those were unnecessary, says this mattress was all you need for spine problems, so I decided to give it a try.<br/>After letting it expand for 24 hours, I slept on it for the first time &amp; have loved it ever since.  I saved a TON of money and despite having 2 broken ribs, can’t even feel the pressure points on my broken bones.  I love this mattress.  Couldn’t decide if I needed the 12”, but glad I saved the extra $ and went with the 10”.  I’ve slept better on this mattress than I have in years.  It’s cheaper than a pillow top, doesn’t need to be turned &amp; lasts longer than regular mattresses.<br/>Although it’s not as hot as a foam topper, I wouldn’t exactly call this mattress “cool”, but it is better than any other foam I’ve slept on.  Well worth the money!
 Although Firm bed in a box type mattresses exist, unfortunately T&amp;N is not one of them. We ordered a Firm but it is far from Firm.  It would appear to me that the numerous good reviews are from folks under 40, who can use a less firm mattress.  Medical pro's will tell you the under 40 crowd can tolerate much softer mattresses (not terribly healthy, but tolerable) but the over 40 crowd soft is a definite no-no.  We have a truly Firm bed in box mattress at another home and it has a softer 2" or 3" top with good firmness just below. Takes a few minutes to sink in fully and adjust to your body. Had it for years. We spin it annually. Magnificent to sleep on.  Naturally any time you switch beds there will be a learning curve for your body, but the T&amp;N will not work no matter how much acclimation is done.  Company has a great story, mattress not so much.
 T&amp;N customer service and Amazon customer service were champs in dealing with this toxic VOC mess. I'm not sure what Certipur actually guarantees: this mattress stunk up the whole house, causing headaches, dry nostrils; it off-gassed like a champ! I thought this mattress would be a thrifty way to get a safe mattress. I was wrong; it's just toxic in some ways and not others.<br/><br/>The potent stench of chemicals did not subside and after two weeks I contacted customer service to get a refund. They were friendly and easy to deal with!
 WORST BED EVER!!! I’ve had this bed for a year now so you can trust that I’ve given this enough of a chance. I learned a hard lesson. You get what you pay for with a mattress. Maybe for a kid this would be a good option but for two fully grown adults it’s absolutely dreadful. My gf and I have been getting the worst sleep of our lives. I’m a side sleeper and this is just god awful for side sleepers. My shoulder is sore every morning. My back has been having the worst pains of my life. The material creates pressure points like you wouldn’t believe. The bed also gets very warm so I’m constantly adjusting throughout the night. It’s bad enough that I just dropped $1700 on a new beauty rest mattress and I couldn’t be more thankful to have my sleep back. AVOID THIS AND ALL MATRESSES IN A BOX! ITS PURELY A GIMMICK AND YOU WILL REGRET IT!
 Just got it in the mail yesterday (kinda cool how much air they can squish out of it for shipping). I was amazed at how quickly it fully expands after you puncture the plastic wrap. The 4 main concerns for me regarding this purchase was balancing Cost, Heat, Comfort, and Fumes (lol).  Anyway, as far as fumes go, I didn't think it was bad at all regarding what you smell walking around the room even after just pulling it out of the plastic wrap. But when you lay down on it, and your face is next to it, you're definitely more aware of it - but still wasn't an overwhelming smell or anything. They tell you to wait 72 hours to let the fumes dissipate -- more on that later...<br/>But first, a bit of background info... I bought this for our guest room - I didn't want to spend $1000+ on a mattress that wouldn't be used very often, so I'm rolling the dice on this one. I have a Temperpedic mattress that is probably 5 years old and it's getting to the age to where it's not working like it did (hey, I expected that, everything wears out no matter what sales people tell you), and it's at the point where my back is started to get sore in the morning again. My other main complaint with my Temperpedic is heat - and I don't want my guests burning up either; this Tuft &amp; Needle was advertised as being better in dealing with that, so that's another reason I decided to give this a try.<br/>Ok, so, I know the product description suggests waiting 72 hours before using, to let the fumes dissipate, but I was too curious about how it would do with heat and also how it would do with my back, and had to try it out last night. I knew I would and yes, woke up with a minor headache from the fumes (yes, my fault, I did it willingly) - but I have to say the mattress was pretty comfortable. It has a softer layer on the top, but is firm under. My back wasn't noticeably sore, and I didn't get hot like I do on my Temperpedic. I did get a *little* warm by morning, but I wasn't hot, which was nice. I think I'll wait a few days to try it out again (to avoid another self-inflicted headache). I'm still curious if it's going to do well handling heat, particularly since we're in cooler months now (BTW, my thermostat was at 66 last night), and if it will do as well during summer months. Anyway, keep in mind this is just a first impressions review -- not sure how much weight I'd put on a review for a mattress that was used for 1 night. I may come back in a few months and post an update this summer. BTW, one last note: the overall construction quality (the way it was put together) appears to be pretty decent.
 I shopped around a lot for a new mattress because my husband wanted memory foam, we had a tight budget, and I'm also committed to keeping our house chemical/toxin free as much as possible. That's a pretty tall order in the grand scheme of things - however when I came across Tuft&amp;Needle I was really excited. While they're not made with organic materials, they are CertiPUR-US certified as well as GREENGUARD certified and STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX certified. Basically all these certifications help me to know that this mattress is not made with chemical flame retardants and other additives that we really shouldn't be exposing our bodies to. Combine that with the amazing price tag and I was sold. I almost upgraded to their Mint mattress but we are really really happy with their standard mattress having slept on it for almost 6 months now. My husband and I both sleep incredibly well. And if needed you can always buy one of their mattress toppers for additional cushion.
 This is actually a pretty comfortable bed.  I usually prefer hard beds, but as I have gotten older and gained some weight, this bed is much better on my back and joints.  I have not determined if I get hotter in the bed due to the bed, or the weight I have gained.  Also, I have not noticed any falling off due to the edge of the bed being all foam.  I never feel like it is sliding down like I thought I would.<br/><br/>Two dislikes, it is about one inch too short on the length and 2 inches width as I would have liked.  Additionally, it is much shorter than our previous mattress, and with the platform bed I  have currently, it makes it somewhat difficult to get out of.  We are looking for a box spring to raise it up, but we are concerned about it not fitting properly on the box spring due to the shorter size.<br/><br/>While I would not say this is the absolute perfect bed for me, it is definitely a great bed for the cost.
 This Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is simply superb, wonderful to sleep on, let’s me get an awesome night’s sleep, and is a far better value than ANY other similarly priced mattress.<br/><br/>My wife had given me the task of finding and choosing a replacement for our last foam mattress, made more difficult by a price limit. I spent about 9-10 hours over the course of 4 days researching and comparing mattresses from dozens of manufacturers... and through Consumer Reports.<br/><br/>One name—Tuft &amp; Needle—kept popping up in various searches and multiple reviews. I had originally not considered them as their mattress was above our price-range by about 15%. But after I did more research into the Tuft &amp; Needle company, philosophy and customer service, I knew this would be a choice we wouldn’t regret.<br/><br/>We bought the Tuft &amp; Needle queen mattress and have been sleeping on it for a month. I’m sleeping through the entire night in comfort, waking genuinely refreshed, and without stiffness or soreness. I don’t know how they manage to make a mattress that’s gently supportive, returns to it’s original form after we get up, doesn’t have that awful gassing that most foam mattresses have, and that we actually welcome sleeping on. It truly is superb, wonderful and awesome... and (dare I say it, don’t want them to raise the price) is a far higher quality and better value mattress than others costing hundreds more.<br/><br/> NOTICE: I don’t work for Tuft &amp; Needle and was in no way compensated for my review. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.]
 UPDATE: After taking the extra padding that Tuft &amp; Needle sent out of its own cover and cramming it into the cover with the original Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, I really like this mattress. If you do find the mattress too firm and T&amp;N sends you an extra layer of padding to soften it up, I recommend taking that extra charcoal layer out of its separate cover and cramming it into the original cover your mattress is in. Works great!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been sleeping on this mattress for a few weeks now. I really wanted to like it as I like the company's ethos a ton. But it was way too firm for me. I'm not a huge guy (5'10" 185 lbs), so I don't think my weight is just pushing through the charcoal layer.<br/><br/>That said, the company lives up to their customer service. They sent me a 2" topper of more charcoal foam, and that helped enough that the bed's now sleep-able. It's definitely nowhere near the most comfortable sleep ever, but it's workable. So I'll stick with it.<br/><br/>If I had the shopping to do again, I'd probably go either higher or lower in price. I have a feeling a Casper or a Purple would sleep better and so would be worth the money. Or if I'm going to be saving money, then I might as well go down a hundred or two more and get a cheap memory foam.<br/><br/>I see that Tuft &amp; Needle has a new "Mint" mattress. I'm curious what that one's like. I love the company, so I really want to love their products.
 I'm not as happy with this bed as I thought I would be.<br/>It's only been a month, and already I'm sinking into the bed far enough for it to be uncomfortable, as my hips and shoulders are hitting the harder support foam underneath.  It shouldn't cave in this quickly.  I don't feel like this bed will last very long, and it was very expensive.  The bed that we bought at Costco 2 years ago was more comfortable at this point, and was $200 less expensive.<br/><br/>If you weigh more than 200 lbs, I would not recommend this bed for you.  You will be uncomfortable very quickly.
 We decided to order a Tuft &amp; Needle King Mattress because of the reviews, price,  and was said to have good support and return policy. I like the mattress by itself because it was firmer however my wife thought it was to firm so I asked for a FREE topper from Tuft &amp; Needle to make it softer. It arrived very fast and now my wife and I both like the mattress. The topper slides a little but nothing to worry about. The Tuft &amp; Needle King Mattress is probably not as good as a tempur-pedic mattress but it is still a good mattress. It cuts out around 90% of feeling each other move to get in and out of bed. It does not eliminate 100% of feeling movement. For the price it is a really good mattress. Support is AWESOME!!! when we asked for the topper to make the mattress softer it was sent FREE of charge very quickly.
 My wife and I bought this to replace our 20+ yo air mattress. It was very heavy but setup was a breeze: removed from box, laid out on frame, started removing plastic covers. Once the inner plastic bag was removed it expanded within minutes. No obnoxious odors and we slept on it about 8 hours after unrolling.<br/>She absolutely loves it and says she hasn't slept this well in years.  Sadly it doesn't offer quite enough support for my injured back. I have old injuries in both my C and L spine areas. Usually I wake with lumbar pain. Surprisingly, and happily, my injured lumbar did not hurt at all after sleeping on the mattress. My upper back, however, was just too sore and achy every morning.<br/>We decided to get a refund on this, a totally painless experience thanks to both T&amp;N and Amazon, and make a king bed the old-fashion way, with two twin-XL mattresses. We bought another of this bed, only smaller, for her and I am trying to find a mattress for me.<br/>Tuft &amp; Needle makes a very nice mattress and I really wanted to love it as much as my wife, it just didn't work out for me. I would still recommend with confidence.
 I love this mattress! Not too soft, not too hard. I got it for my little one to transition out of my bed to her own. So as I'm "supervising" the transition I fall asleep with her a lot. I'm not a napper, but this mattress is like a time warp. I wake up an hour later without even realizing I've fallen asleep. I would have to pull an allnighter for me to fall asleep in my own bed during the day.<br/>It's not perfect in every aspect, but for me it is very comfortable.<br/><br/>- It does sleep much cooler than my memory foam. I also added a Sherpa pad for my little one to feel more like she's with someone. It's still not as hot as my memory "sauna" mattress.<br/><br/>- It has a bit of a bounce closer to a spring mattress than my memory foam.<br/><br/>- Edge support was surprisingly weak, but I'll take that as long as it sleeps well.<br/><br/>- It inflated to full size within seconds of opening a sealed package; I didn't even have it out of plastic, just cut a starter hole and the whole thing poofed to full size. Make sure your mattress is in place before opening.<br/><br/>- There was a bit of a smell to it, but not bad at all. I'm very sensitive to smells so I did notice it, and had I waited 72hrs before using it as suggested, it would have been fine. The first night (just couple hours out of the box) it did bother me a bit. It aired out within a few days.<br/><br/>- The Sherpa pad adds just a bit more softness to it, so it's perfect right now. I would likely want something as a top layer as well if it was for me.<br/><br/>- I've slept on it on a side, back and stomach, and it does great for all positions for me. I'm 5'10" about 170lbs female.<br/><br/>- It comes off as a hard mattress at first coming from a memory foam bed that would make me sink in and bow out my back. But it sleeps so well, nothing hurts, no pressure on the body, even my posture got better.<br/><br/>I'm currently lobbying for another one for the master bed.<br/><br/>I've only had it for a month so I can't speak of durability, but it comes with 10 year warranty so that should be covered.
 We recently moved and I really wanted to upgrade our queen to a king size since we'd have more room for it.  I researched the all latex mattresses here to find one that I thought would be a good fit, since they don't offer our current brand. (a European one-which I LOVE)  T &amp; N seemed like a great choice because it wasn't layered with memory foam or gel, which I'm not into.  I like just the latex foam with a firm feeling and this is exactly what our is.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of spring mattresses and pretty much never have problems sleeping unless I have to sleep on one in a hotel or as a guest somewhere.  The T &amp; N mattress is a dream and we've had absolutely no problems with it.  It's smooth, firm, and definitely gives the support you need to get a good night's rest.  Most nights I can't wait to go to bed because I know it's waiting for us! :)<br/><br/>It came in a large box, which was pretty beat up upon receiving it-but the inner plastic was not punctured or torn.  Once we unboxed it on our platform frame, we let it sit for a couple of days to air out.  It really didn't have much of a smell, but we wanted to give it time to air out.  I put a kind of fluffy, Egyptian cotton mattress pad on and the rest is history.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend trying T &amp; N.  There were lots of good things said about the mattress from reviewers and about its construction/materials online.  I really like knowing the foam is good quality and that it was made in America.  That helps me sleep even better, so thank you Tuft &amp; Needle!!  We love your mattress!
 I purchased this mattress about 7 months ago and it has changed from comfortable to painful! Waking up in the morning when I first purchased it was beautiful and then as the months progressed my back started to hurt upon getting out of this bed every time I used it. We have two beds in our house and I tested to see if there was a difference in morning back pain and there definitely was! My other bed doesn’t leave me in pain when I wake up. I was thinking of buying this brand again for my extra bedroom but now I have to find another brand that has better support and quality. I’m sad this purchase didn’t work out and I’m out of the return period. Back health is way more important to me than settling for a mattress that causes pain...I will now be searching for a new mattress in less than a year of having this one sadly.
 Didn't inflatable as promised. Uneven and looks weird because edges are lifted. Piece of junk. Can't believe they charged 750 for this.
 I need to start this with, I do not sleep well...never have. I am a restless sleeper and wake frequently. I also have trouble with becoming sore when sleeping on my side if the mattress is too firm. Historically I have preferred a super soft mattress that cocoons me when I sleep. However, progressively I have been waking in the morning with worse and worse back pain. Our old mattress was well past its prime and there were huge valleys in it (which of course was most of the problem). After extensive research on mattresses in general, specifically for different body types (I'm 5'6" 140 and hubs is 5'11" 210), my husband and I decided to try the Tuft &amp; Needle. I was extremely hopeful and it has not disappointed. The mattress is firm (which typically doesn't suit me) but it's not hard...it's soft and supportive. The most exciting part for me is that I no longer ache if I sleep on my side and since owning this I have slept through the night most nights (dry winter air aside). I feel so well supported and am so comfortable on this mattress it has actually changed my sleeping habits. I now sleep on my back most often and wake rested without pain. It did take about a week for my prior pains to go away but I immediately felt them shifting and not getting worse. So far I love this mattress!!!!!! I can't speak for you but hopefully have given enough information so that if you have similar needs you will find this helpful.<br/>I won't mention my husband because he can sleep anywhere on anything at the drop of a dime (literally falls asleep in less than a minute, very annoying) The big test will be to see if over time we get any valleys.<br/>NOTE: I have only been sleeping on this for 2 weeks but will update this review if anything changes.
 SECOND UPDATE: The topper described in the first update was helpful, and added additional comfort and cushion. We're very thankful for the extraordinary customer service- truly the best we've ever experienced. The comfort level is much better, and we're keeping the mattress. It does sleep hot for me, but has been a solid, comfortable update to our old foam mattress. It's definitely worth a try, and if it's not for you, the customer support is unbelievable- they'll help make it better or gladly help with a return.<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW: I received a helpful message from Tuft and Needle, and contacted them directly. Every single person I corresponded with was helpful, polite, and genuinely concerned about my satisfaction. T&amp;N offered to send me, free of charge, a mattress topper to hopefully assist with our subpar experience with the amount of comfort. The topper is on its way, and this update (adding one star) is for outstanding customer service and genuine assistance in a day when that just doesn't happen anymore. I'll update again after trying the topper with the mattress.<br/><br/>TLDR: So-so comfort, too hot for us. Just okay.<br/><br/>Like many folks, I did my fair share of research prior to purchasing a new mattress. The thousands of positive reviews convinced us to give this mattress a try, plus I was impressed by the reported excellent customer service and ability to return it if it didn't work for us. Well, we're about six weeks in and I am going to contact them to pick it back up.<br/><br/>First, one issue with our older memory foam mattress was the constant hot feeling we both experienced when sleeping. Despite the many reports to the contrary, this sleeps very hot for me no matter what I do. I keep our room around 68 degrees max, and during the last weeks when it has been so cold outside that it was even cooler in our room- I would still kick off the thin comforter and sheet on the bed I was so hot.<br/><br/>Next, it's just a little too firm for us. To the mattress' credit, our hips have felt a little better and more in line, but it's not comfortable enough (soft) to keep long term. In other words, I can't imagine paying $600 for anything that I'm only partially satisfied with in the end. Don't get me wrong, everything appears to be high quality, the set up was as expected, and it was well packed and quickly delivered. It just needs a little extra padding in our opinion.<br/><br/>Our old mattress, bought at Costco, was excellent for a few years but then began to crater in the middle which led us here. The old one had a lot more bulk, but also a lot more cushion. The T&amp;N might mitigate the breaking down and cratering (we can't confirm), but it just doesn't quite measure up to the comfort level we expected. If it was just a little more padded, we would try and make it work!<br/><br/>I'll post further if we have any issues with the return.
 It's hard to pick how many stars I would give this product, for a few reasons. First I will say that the quality of the product is 5 stars. The reason for 3 stars is the comfort factor. I suffer from lower back issues and we finally decided to buy a new mattress as waking up is when my back hurt the most. The mattress came exactly as described and was actually super firm for a bed in a box. We were actually very shocked at how firm it really was. We hoped in a week or so it would get softer and it seemed to a bit. At first I had nights my back felt better and other nights it was the same or worse than our last mattress. By the time we figured out that not only was my back hurting and now my ladies back is also now hurting we were a few days past the 100 day trial. Now we're stuck with a mattress that leaves the two of us in pain in the morning and some nights sleeping on the couch. If you have back problems I would look elsewhere for a mattress. The sad part is we were overly excited to get this mattress
 Unfortunately, I've just returned this mattress. I'm sure it's great for a vast number of people - as evidenced by its stellar reviews both here and directly on the Tuft &amp; Needle website! So I don't *not* recommend it. I just join the voices that were not pleased with it.<br/><br/>This mattress worked fine when I slept on my side (which I do 50% of the time) but if I slept on my back or stomach (the other 50% of the time), I always woke up very sore. I couldn't tell if it was too hard or too soft or what. It really felt quite comfortable when I laid down on it but it was not comfortable for a full night of sleep.<br/><br/>I gave this mattress about 45 days and then put my old mattress back - just to see if it was an issue with the T&amp;N mattress itself or an issue with my body being sore apart from the T&amp;N mattress. The soreness improved as soon as I started sleeping on my old mattress again. Unfortunately, this indicates that the T&amp;N mattress just isn't for me.<br/><br/>It's a shame because my existing mattress is REALLY old and I was hoping to finally be a mature adult and replace the old one! Oh well...back to my favorite-but-very-old-mattress-with-questionable-origins.<br/><br/>One note is Amazon's stellar return service. They gave me a full refund and let me keep the old mattress to use, donate, or dispose of. I was shocked!<br/><br/>It was hard to come up with the right number of stars for this review. I'd give the mattress two stars instead of one because at least it was comfortable when I slept on my side and it appears to be made really well. I'd give T&amp;N's customer service (which I used before purchasing) and Amazon's return customer service five stars each. Both are top notch.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm mixed on whether or not to recommend this. Given their 90 day return policy, I'd say try it if you're considering it! Worst case scenario: you don't like it and you return it and get a full refund. I have no regrets with my purchase even though it didn't work out for me.
 I ordered this matress on Amazon because I have Prime so I kew I would receive within 2 days. When I recieved it and extended the mattress out it didn't expand the way my first T&amp;N did. The corners were completely floppy and the bottom of the mattress was really hard. The only part that expanded corectly was the center of the mattress. I thought it was strange but left it alone over night hoping it just needed extra time. The next morning it was still the same. I called T&amp;N, the apologized and asked for pictures and my order # from Amazon. I sent it over and immidiately heard back from them. They ruled the mattress a defective one and added that sometimes Amazon stores them for a little longer than they should (the norm being 2-3 weeks). I checked the tag which gives you the manufactured date and it was from June. The rep then informed me she would send me a replacement and expedite they delivery free of charge. I received my mattress that same day! Needless to say, the new mattress worked like a charm and I’m so happy with it. I checked the manufacture date on the new mattress and it was November, so brand new. I’m still giving the mattress 5 stars deapite my little issue because it was resolved quickly. I would just recommend ordering directly from T&amp;N.
 We received the mattress and this is our second night sleeping on it. It is like sleeping on a board. The price is great but unfortunately it is very uncomfortable. We are considering returning it. Perhaps a topper of some sort might help but right now it is killing us. I convinced my wife to give it at least a week or two before we decide to return it but I don't know if we can go that long without getting rest. I will update this review later if it improves or if I decide to return it. Right now I would not recommend it. It is killing our backs because it doesn't seem to give at all. My wife is 110 lbs and a side sleeper and it is bothering her the most. I'm about 200 lbs and sleep on both side and back.<br/><br/>Update 2 weeks later: the mattress did improve. It is still a little firm for our liking so we ordered a topper. But, our backs are SO MUCH BETTER. This is a quality mattress and I feel good with the purchase now. Just give it a week or two.
 These are a good value I think for people of modest weight.  If you are heavy however, (I am 5’10”, 290) when you sit on the mattress you tend to tip outward. As it turned out I needed a mattress that was a little softer than this for my arthritic shoulders, so I got a 4 inch memory foam topper and that made the problem even worse. If I sit on the side of the bed to put my shoes on or something I literally slide off onto the floor. I think the edges of the mattress need to be made firmer for sitting on the edge of the bed.  As it stands, I have to jump up and sit far into the middle of the mattress in order to keep from rolling out of it when I try to get into bed at night. And I am ordering a assist bar to hold onto for pulling myself out of the bed. However I have to say that this mattress together with the 4 inch memory foam topper have stopped, totally stopped my shoulder pain and I think it’s worth the extra trouble.<br/><br/>We got two extra long twin mattresses  for our split king adjustable bed . My husband who is a lightweight loves his. I think they are about 4 inches too short for extra long and wished that I had got an extra extra long but I don’t think they make them.
 We were so excited to get the bed! We've heard great things, but the experience hasn't been the same as other people we know. The bed seemed comfy but each night, after a few hours, feels really firm and both my husband and I, are side and belly sleepers and cannot find a comfortable sleeping position. We've had the bed in use since early May and have been trying to find ways to sleep better. We understand there is a breaking in period for all beds. Now that it is warmer, we are waking up sweating from the mattress. We just purchased a mattress pad that should help with the firmness and heat issue.
 While there were things to like about this mattress and their process, the major drawback was it was NOT comfortable, for me.<br/>I sleep on my sides about 85% of the time. Why? Because it is the most (and only) comfortable position for me.  But with this mattress, after a few nights, my hips were very sore! VERY, VERY sore! To the point were I simply could not take it any more after 60 nights. At first I thought i would get used to the bed but that just did not happen.<br/><br/>I looked at a memory foam topper but at $400 for a single size, yeah, why not just get a mattress that works! Ive had a topper before and it was a constant struggle keeping it on and in place. So i bought 5 soft bed pillows and put them under the fitted sheet. While that gave me pain relief they were also a major struggle to keep in place each night. Again, what a hassle!<br/>So it all had to go.<br/><br/>I called amazon, they said a refund would be issued to my card within x number of days. Simple enough.<br/><br/>And so now a pillow top mattress is in my future once again.  Which is soft, comfortable and supportive all at the same time. I can't wait to return to the good old days of a regular mattress.
 I purchased this mattress wanting something a bit softer than the Nectar mattress. Our new mattress also needed to be able to be on the cool side since my fiance is a hot sleeper. The mattress itself is super soft (to me). My fiance liked it but asked for the topper. Once the topper was on he was in heaven. I will give it to the T&amp;N service team, they were very friendly and prompt when I reached out for the topper. The main reason I'm returning this is because it was just too hot. I don't normally get hot but I was with this mattress. My fiance was fine in the beginning but as time went on it was too  much for him and kept getting up and changing position. A word of caution if you decide to order via Amazon. They will not pick-up the mattress if it's been open. I don't get that considering how else are you going to know if you want it or not? They will refund the money but it's up to you to dispose or donate. I'm sure if I had bought from T&amp;N direct I wouldn't have this problem.
 I really really wanted to love this mattress. It's soooo comfortable, just the right amount of firm and soft, and getting the bed in a box and watching it expand in a few seconds was legit the best entertainment I've had all year. I really loved it when I received it and there was no heat in my apartment in February. It was so warm and cozy. But the minute it stopped being 26 degrees I started sweating like crazy. I wake over and over at night drenched with sweat. I am NOT a hot sleeper. I have never had hot sleeping problems. I am an electric blanket in the winter and down blanket all year type of person.  But being so hot I started sleeping without blankets, just a sheet, and it was telling because I would be freezing on top but the part of me touching the mattress would still be so hot and sweaty. It's like you could slice me in half lengthwise and I would be two totally different temperatures. I bought an expensive wool mattress topper that promised to make things cooler and it helped a teeny bit, but still waking half on fire multiple times all night. But kudos to Amazon for a super easy return process. I'm returning both the mattress and the topper and there was almost no hassle. Well, other than having to go find another (non-foam) mattress. Sigh. I hate the process. But going in store for my next one to see if I can gauge better how hot it will feel.
 I have been researching mattresses for a long while, trying to find the best company not just ethics-wise, but product-wise as well, based on customer reviews. I’ve had the mattress since July, but have only been sleeping on it since November. In the two months I’ve been using it, I have already put a depression in the mattress low enough to where my hip and shoulders are touching the box spring. If I lay on my side long enough, my body slowly sinks all the way through the mattress. This is extremely disappointing for a two-month old mattress. I’m 6’4” and 240 (muscle not fat), so I’m pretty big compared to the average person, but I wouldn’t say I’m so big that a mattress can only last me two months. The short lived relief in the lower back was nice, but now it’s back because the mattress has already sunken in. I will unfortunately be taking my business elsewhere very soon to buy another mattress.
 I was looking for a new mattress after an expensive "hybrid" foam and coil one I bought at a furniture store gave up the ghost after less than 2 years. I went home for a visit and my family, who had just bought and furnished a new house, had this mattress. I fell in love and ordered one when I got home. I've slept on it for 8 months and it still looks and feels like it did on night one. I'll never go back to coils and if this mattress does wear out in a decade or two, I will buy another just like it.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm a heavy 310lbs on a short 5' 5" body and I have not seen any "ruts" like other reviewers. I also tend to lay in one spot, so I would definitely notice. I haven't even rotated it yet.
 We were super excited about this mattress--buying online, saving money, getting a king bed!  We also liked that we could try it out for a few months and see if we both liked it before committing to the online order.  The first 3 months on a new mattress seemed good, but as time went on my husband started getting excruciating back pain (about 4 months in).  We thought maybe it was from other things, but then about a month later I started getting pain in my shoulders.  I sleep on my side and my husband is a stomach sleeper.  This mattress has been awful for both of us!  We have been taking turns sleeping in our old mattress in the spare bedroom and wishing we did not spend the $800 on this mattress :-( ...wishing we could return now!
 My husband I have slept on waterbeds for 40 years. After he had back surgery, it was time for a change but it still took me 7 years to make a decision what to buy. After reading the reviews of mattresses in a leading consumer magazine I decided to buy T &amp; N. I had never heard of the company before but the reviews were great and I like the idea of a smaller company with the product made in the USA. (and the price was good!) It was delivered 3 weeks ago but I was still hesitant to "make the change". Turns out-- no worries. It was easy and fun to watch expand. The video explains the setup, which is simple. (The hard part was getting rid of the old waterbed mattress) We've slept on it for 4 nights now and my husband felt his back was better after the first night. It is well-made and comfortable. It does not  make you feel hot and sweaty and stuck in the bed if you need to change position. If I ever need another mattress for any other bed it will be a Tuft &amp; Needle.
 After a week, we can tell that this king tuft and needles is just too firm, so I reached out to Tuft and Needles for a solution since we do not want the hassle of a return. They said buy our topper at another 180.00. That is a considerable amount to spend to correct a problem that should not be our problem. Should warn if you are a side sleeper this mattress is firm and may be you should buy our topper if you want comfort. Not impressed with their customer service solutions. I forgot to add that the service rep recommended that I shop at Kohl's to find a less expensive topper to try and help. Very surprised that was their best advice to make their product better for us.
 I figured I'd wait until my 90 days was up, as reviewing before would be less impactful. I could have always sent it back within 90 days, so it only makes sense to review after the point of no return. This feels like a less biased review in this, so here it goes...<br/><br/>I got the mattress and it was boxed up tight. We all expect this, so it was no surprise. I cracked it open, carefully removed the plastic wrap, and watched it expand to its full size. It took minutes to fully expand, and within 10 minutes of opening the box, I had it sheeted and I was laying on it, wrestling with my kids.<br/><br/>The first couple weeks, my body definitely felt it and I was a bit sore. I had previously been sleeping on a crappy, little, rather firm, single bed, as I recently had given my king size bed to someone who needed it more than I did.<br/><br/>After that first few weeks, I started really enjoying the mattress. Like all foam-style mattresses, if you lay in one spot without moving for several hours, you start to sink in a little. I doubt any foam-style mattress could really hold you up perfectly flat. I read several reviews that said this was a deal-breaker and that they sunk in. I didn't experience this. Even though while getting used to it, I did notice slight indentations, I developed a solution that worked nicely for me.<br/><br/>Some statistics: I'm 5'10", 160 lb. I usually sleep on my back and both sides, so I quickly adopted a system where I not only rotated my body, but I also moved laterally throughout the night (fortunately, I get to sleep on this bed alone). This works beautifully for me. I beat my body up pretty good several times a week with a good workout, and I'm almost always super sore after, and that night's sleep is usually still pretty good. The off nights the sleep is even better.<br/><br/>I think my favorite part about the Tuft and Needle mattress, however, is that it is very cool. I heard some reviewers mention this, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I keep very cool in this bed and it's nice. I like a cool mattress, especially in the summer. I'm in Portland, Oregon, and the summers get pretty hot: 80-100F for many weeks through July and August. Of course, we keep our house at around 75F in the summer, but even so, the bed stays nice and cool.
 Hello, this product probably deserves 5 starts, because it was just as described and is a fine mattress. However, my experience with the mattress is probably atypical. Purchased-mattress delivered. It was a pleasure to set up. I was able to bring mattress upstairs alone. unpacking took maybe 3 minutes. no offensive smell. materials feel like the are very good quality. Now the sleeping experience. The minute I laid on it it felt too soft, but not too soft. I thought maybe it needs some time and went to sleep anyway. Woke up multiple times. I did feel pressure point and woke up each time with more and more aches and pains. (now I am 5,11" and 231lbs so perhaps I need a thicker mattress) I have owned a tempurpedic cloud supreme, which I also found soft and HOT. My current mattress was loom/leaf, which I like but feel it too is not firm enough, but now I realize it is firmer. However as I just bought a house and agreed to give the LandL mattress to my mother and buy myself the T&amp;N. Simultaneously I received a Zinus mattress for my quest room which costs 189. and I gave it a try and although the mattress does not seem to be made from as high quality materials, I prefer the Zinus because it is firm and allows me to sleep on my belly as I am a back and belly sleeper.  So on and all this mattress is not bad at all, it's just not for me.
 I purchased this mattress on Prime day, as I had been waiting to see if it would go on sale. I thought paying $600 was a great deal for a high rated mattress, but could not have been more wrong. The mattress is very firm (I typically like a firmer mattress) and has no give to it. Some nights were better than others but after a month I found I was actually missing my old worn out mattress. In short, this mattress is a piece of junk. I would rather sleep on the floor than on this. Amazon customer service rocked and refunded me my money, and didn’t even want the mattress back. What’s that tell you?!
 PURCHASED: JUNE 11, 2017<br/><br/>This is really around 3.5 stars. I think I really bought into the hype when I purchased this back in 2017 - T&amp;N was pretty new and fresh, and even though I did TONS of research, I still went with this mattress. The first few months were a dream, as I loved the firm feel of the mattress. However, 20 months later I've been having some issues with the quality of my sleep.<br/><br/>The mattress has gotten considerably softer, to the point where I'm rotating it every couple months. I'm 6'2" 240 lbs, but I'm experiencing the dreaded "sinking" into the foam. My girlfriend is considerably smaller at 5'6" 130 lbs, so she's still in love with the bed and doesn't mind rotating it every now and then to avoid my larger than life imprint becoming permanent.<br/><br/>I'm not going to write some massively long review and am trying to keep this short and sweet. I like the bed, but like I said, I'm not sure it's the best option out there and I think I probably jumped on the hype train at first. It's certainly better than the IKEA futon I slept on for years in college and after, but I would not describe it as perfect. Maybe I just need something a bit more firm. Do your research and try to experience as many different mattresses as you can so you don't find yourself waking up throughout the night or developing a sore lower back. I will say the bed stays cool, even through hot summer nights.
 My husband has chronic back pain, he researched beds and finally decided on a T&amp;F. We have never bought a mattress that was over 500.00, so to buy one online, in a box was tough for me to wrap my head around. When we first decided to buy the mattress, it was 600.00 by the time we had saved the money to buy it; they raised their prices :( I was not happy about that.<br/><br/>Comfort wise - This bed was a beast! I tossed and turned and did NOT sleep well for the first 4 nights! However, by the 5th night, I was starting to get used to how 'firm" the mattress is. My husband, on the other hand, slept "Beautifully" from the very first night.<br/><br/>Note: If you do not have a good pillow that counters the firmness of the mattress, this bed WILL be miserable! Once I bought new pillows, I noticed a big change on how I slept. Is it my favorite bed? No. Is it growing on me, Yes. Do I think it was worth 750.00 for a queen, time will tell.....<br/><br/>Give yourself at least two weeks to adjust to this bed! The bed is so firm that my husband could not feel me rolling around the first couple of nights! You cannot feel much movement (rolling over, adjusting blankets) ​on this bed, unlike my spring mattress, so that is a bonus :)
 I'm loving my Tuft &amp; Needle so far. I had slept on one at an airbnb and was a fan, so I decided to replace my aging queen pillowtop with a king Tuft &amp; Needle. The box was pretty heavy and I kinda felt like a football player trying to move the tractor thing down the field as I shoved it into my bedroom, but in a good way :) if I was patient I could have waited for my husband to get home.<br/><br/>I got it out of the packaging and onto a slatted bed frame without much trouble and slept on it 4 hours later. I slept well the first night, but as I've gotten more used to the mattress I've slept even better. The support is really good and the lack of motion transfer is great.  My husband or I can get into bed without waking the other, which never used to be possible. The dog sleeps in the bed, and he doesn't wake me up as often, which I think is about the lack of motion transfer as much as the bigger bed. I don't find the foam to be warmer than my old pillow top, in fact it feels quite cool when I get in and warms up very gradually. Overall I'm very satisfied with the purchase and at way less than my pillow top cost nine years ago. I will update if the Louisiana summer changes my opinion of the foam's thermal properties.
 This thing killed my back. After allowing it to expand my first night 'sleep' took two days to recover from. We went back to the old mattress in the spare room which was a linus purchased from Walmart a year ago (I now love this product). Few days later we tried a 2" foam topper on this mattress with the same result though not as sever. Everyone has their own tastes but this thing was a long way away from working for us. I will donate or cut up into dog beds and give them away as gifts.
 A little while back, I started doing some online research into various memory foam mattresses. I have a regular Serta firm spring mattress and for a few years now have been waking up with aches and pains, mainly in my back and shoulders (I'm a side sleeper). As a result, I started seeing numerous "matress in a box" ads popping up on Facebook. So I started looking at those too. Eventually, I became overwhelmed by all of the differences, similarities, "improved technology", hype, price and everything else as it pertains to memory foam and "foam but not memory foam" options out there.<br/><br/>After giving it a rest for a while (and continuing to sleep miserably), I finally decided to go with my gut and try one of the first "bed in a box" options I saw on Facebook. I was apprehensive about buying something like this because I couldn't touch it and feel it first. But I decided to trust the consumer ratings and feedback I saw for this company and product (I read through everything on their website to learn as much as possible about the product). I had it saved on my Amazon wish list and had gotten into a conversation about mattresses with some friends of mine. I showed them this one that I was interested in and noticed the price had dropped by $200 since I added it. So I decided it was the right time to give it a go.<br/><br/>It was delivered yesterday. Setup was easy. It's not memory foam but what they call an "adaptive foam". After just 1 night on it so far, all I can say is it was money well spent (and much cheaper than most memory foam options). I was able to sleep on my sides without the feeling of pressure on my joints or my back being out of alignment. I woke up today not feeling tired. To put it simply...I LOVE this bed already. I hope that love relationship only gets better as I realize my review is only based on 1 night so far.<br/><br/>And it's made in the USA!
 Well, we have slept on it for four days and so far we are sleeping the best we have in a long time. We have purchased so many mattresses over the last few years and I always end up sleeping on the couch because of pain from the pressure of the mattress. This was our final try to compromise and it worked. I will review again at 6 months and update.
 Unfortunately, both my wife and I have experienced increasing back pain during the first few weeks of owning our new Tuft &amp; Needle mattress.  I had read that it takes a few "days" of use to break in, or get used to the new mattress, but the back pain just got worse.  We really wanted to like this, so we gave it a full three weeks of sleep before calling it quits.  Now I have seen other reviews that said they had a similar problem and received a replacement that was very comfortable.  This  might be an option, but Amazon only gives me "return/replace" links that don't allow for a replacement conversation.  So sorry to have to return this mattress, as otherwise, it is a great and attractive product, just need to have a good nights sleep as well!<br/>Have moved it to the kids room for now and will see if we can contact Tuft &amp; Needle to discuss the problem.
 I bought this bed because of the reviews and the fact it is supposed to be the least offensive with unfriendly chemicals and gasses. I will give it this - it didn't smell at all. I bought another brand a while back and It smelled for weeks, and never really stopped smelling. This Tuft and Needle bed had no smell.<br/><br/>My problem is first, it only comes in 10 inches and not 12. Then it came, and I have left it "Puff up" for a week. My mattress is only 8 inches thick. Unacceptable for me. Comfortable yes, but none of my linens or sheets fit well on an 8" mattress.<br/><br/>I reached out to T&amp;N and they said they would be happy to replace it, or I have the 100 days to decide I don't like it. I have not decided if I want them to send me another - and then if it isn't a full 10 inches have to do this all again. I will likely have them give me a refund. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE so far.<br/><br/>It is a shame because this is by far the best company for a bed in the box as far as being made well, not poisoning you with gasses and chemicals (Warning - the ones made in China are really bad for you!) but I won't be happy with a thin mattress like this.<br/><br/>T&amp;N please make a 12 inch mattress at this price point.
 My husband and I are so upset, we spent quite a bit of time researching mattresses and finally decided to spend the money on the tuft and needle. We slept on it last night, and neither one of us got any sleep. This mattress is too firm, it felt like we were sleeping on concrete.. I have heard that I should try a topper, but don’t Really want to spend anymore money than we already have. So disappointed.  I guess now we have to go  through the process of trying to figure out how to return it.
 Very comfortable, quality product.  I've had a lot of issues with a sore back, this bed has provided some relief for me and has great support.  It's surprisingly supportive for how soft it feels, it was a big concern of mine as I was in a car accident a while back and still have many aches and pains from it.<br/> I'm a large guy at about 280 lbs and it seems to be holding up fine after 6 months, giving my wife many solid nights sleep, and my sleeping seems to be of a much better quality considering my circumstances.  Very happy with it.  As many people have noted, it was very smelly initially as it off-gassed.  I've got a very sensitive nose, we had to leave it in another part of the house for nearly a week until it was more bearable and we chose to sleep on it.  I recommend anyone thinking of buying this to plan to keep your other bed around for a week until the off-gassing is alright for you, but then enjoy, it's a great feeling bed!
 This mattress was very disappointing. Not only did the mattress not inflate fully and the edges and corners lack any full inflation it sunk in a lot and I am a tiny person of 100 pounds. With two people on this mattress I experienced more sinkage to the point where it caused pain. The one big thing that made this horrible for me was the SMELL it has a potent smell to it that it made me ill. I was experiencing headaches from the strong smell that would not go away even after weeks. I tried amazon chat to figure out how to go about handling this and they wanted me to fit it back into the box and return it and i made it clear to them that I was small and it was nearly impossible for me to do that but he did not seem to care so i was unpleased with amazon chat services.<br/>So after going through the reviews i found another customer post about the special handling number for amazon and i called it and told them my situation they told me they could not take returns and that i would be issued a refund. I was baffled that i received incorrect information and lack of great customer service via amazon chat but Erika from the amazon special handling number made me happy with how she handled it and took care of the situation. I was told to Donate the mattress to a local shelter and i would be refunded in 3-5 business days. 866-423-5353 call the number if you are having any issues with this mattress and donate the mattress to a shelter as i have!
 I received my mattress and slept on it for just over 2 weeks, and loved it, but then I started having some pressure point problems with my hips which had gone away when I first got the mattress.  I called Tuft &amp; Needle and spoke with Kaitlyn in customer service and explained the problem to her.  She told me that I could return the mattress but I told her that even with the new complaint both my wife and I agreed that it was so much better than what we had replaced that we would keep it anyway.  Kaitlyn then suggested that we might like to try a 2" topper, which to my surprise she said they would ship it for TOTALLY FREE.  After sending Tuft &amp; Needle some copies of paperwork via the computer the topper was on it's way.  I will say it cleared up 90% of my problem, or more.  If you want to deal with a complany that works overtime to keep the customer happy then you can't deal with a better organization.  I would and have recommended this mattress to anyone and everyone.
 Honestly, this wasn't the right mattress for me, simply because I have a princess back and it was just way too firm for me. However, I am giving it a 5 star rating anyway because the quality and customer service were just so darn good. Wish they had the same mattress in a softer version because I would love to have kept this mattress. When I did return it, I called the actual company and they walked me through exactly what I would need to do to get the return through Amazon and it was so easy. I have since been recommending to all my friends looking for a medium to firm mattress. My sister in law just got per my recommendation one and absolutely LOVES it. Love your company Tuft &amp; Needle and the gimmick-free service, bummed it wasn't the right fit for me.
 I  purchased this mattress based on the positive reviews and great guarantee.<br/>It seemed like no risk and the price was great.  I had never purchased a mattress before without trying it first. Last mattress was purchased.from Sleepys. I had to return the first one as it was sagging badly and they charged me $150 to do so.  Horrible warranty and lousy company to buy from. Now they have changed the name. But they are still the same store with the same lousy customer service.  My 2nd mattress from them is not much better. At $1700, I had higher expectations.  So, when the tuft and needle arrived in a nice sealed box, it seemed impossible a queen size mattress was inside.<br/>It rolled out easy once unpacked on the box spring.  Inflated to full size in a short time.  Besides the mattress not being as deep as I would have liked, it is extremely comfortable and firm which is great for my back.  Have it around 2 months now and i sleep great.
 Stay far away from this mattress if you have hip or shoulder pain....or even if you don't. It is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept on. During the 100 day period I was told to try a different foundation (which cost extra money). Then I was told to give it time and it will soften up. Wasn't u til out of the trial period that we realized it was the cause of many aches and pains. The company now recommends buying a topper for $190. No thanks. I'll donate the piece of garbage and find a bed that is less firm and with a company that backs up their products. I have owned it for a year and a half but only slept on it a year before I gave up and switched back to my old 10 year old mattress ...it's better than this. If you have trouble out of the 100 day window they will only try to sell you other products.... This mattress AND company were a big day mistake.
 This is the second mattress I've purchased from Amazon. First one was a Brentwood with great ratings and lots of "speak" about being green and perfect. I reviewed it with 1 Star and went back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>Tuft and Needle is a win! I would actually rate it 4.5.<br/><br/>Pros: Finally! A truly firm mattress in a box. This bed really is firm and comfortable. I don't know what they did but it works. I'd say their descriptions are completely accurate. No off-gassing when I opened the box, and it shaped up very quickly. I immediately felt the firmness when I sat on it, and enjoyed my first night's sleep on it. I've owned it for several months and could not be more pleased.<br/><br/>Cons: My only unresolved issue is that I still get hot during sleep, but I can easily turn in this bed (a feature of a good firm mattress), and my sleep is much less disturbed and interrupted. So, 1/2 a star because the rest of my issues are finally resolved after years!
 My Tuft &amp; Needle Queen Size Mattress arrived a few days ago. I am posting this review now rather than after using it for a longer period to give first impressions that might be useful to someone trying to pick between other offerings in the same price range.<br/><br/>Before ordering the Tuft &amp; Needle, I struggled between this mattress and the Casper, or another Purple. Our primary mattress is a Purple, but I wasn't sure I wanted to spend quite that much on a guest for a guest room that would get occasional use. Amazon was running a sale on Casper, and I very nearly ordered one for that reason. Looking at the reviews however, there are numerous positive and negative reviews across all three of these mattresses. Ultimately, looking at the Tuft &amp; Needle's reviews I was impressed with the high number of positive reviews and the lower cost as compared to the other two front-runners.<br/><br/>Now having the mattress for a couple of days, I'm glad I went with the Tuft &amp; Needle. Upon unpacking it and letting it expand over the course of about 2 minutes, I noticed the Tuft &amp; Needle was firmer than I thought it would be for a "bed in a box" option. There was also next to zero smell, which was surprising. My impression over the first few days is that the bed is very comfortable, and true to the approximate 6 or 7 middle to slightly firm range others have suggested was the case with this bed.<br/><br/>The box the queen size bed arrives in is listed at 70 pounds and says that it "takes two" to move it.  I was able to move it around just fine myself, but I can see where it would be easier to move around for two people. I'm not sure how much more the king weighs, that would have been a real chore to move by myself.  I happened to have one of those hidden-blade letter openers from a previous bed purchase :-) and it made unwrapping the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress easy.<br/><br/>I am not sleeping on this mattress every night, so I can't offer that experience. From my experience so far however, I would recommend this mattress and suggest if you are struggling between this and a similar mattress that's selling for 100's more I wouldn't hesitate to go with the Tuft &amp; Needle.
 After spending weeks shopping for a mattress, and not wanting another bad experience with the major mattress manufacturers (Sealy, Serta, Simmons, etc), I did a LOT of research into the 'bed-in-a-box' brands. I wanted one with a Certi-Pur and Green Guard rating, along with verified reviews. I decided to go with Tuft and Needle and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. I am a side sleeper, and had a recent hip replacement, and needed a firm, but forgiving, mattress. I have not slept better since I received this 3 days ago. Opened it upon receiving, let it air out for the day (there is an odor, but not strong, and dissipates within a couple days), and I slept on it that night. I didn't want to get out of bed! I've had no issues at all with uniformity in expanding, and it has a soft, high quality cover on it. Highly recommend, so glad the search is over!
 I waited many months to post this review. The mattress was initially way to firm for my taste, although my boyfriend with chronic back pain loved it. I simply couldn't stand it. I called Tuft and Needle and they sent out a topper which arrived to me in about two days. They have great customer service. The topper made all the difference in the world and I can say now after many months that I do enjoy this mattress very much. Intact, we let all of our guests sleep in the master bedroom to experience the bed. They all love it as well. I personally would not recommend purchasing it through amazon. Just go directly to the source, tuft and needle. I say this simply incase you want to return the mattress entirely. It will be a million times easier to do so if you purchase direct from the manufacturer. I am an avid prime fan and user, so I didn't think about purchasing this bed any other way. But when I was contemplating returning it I quickly saw that buying it from amazon wasn't the best idea.
 My husband can smell sugar in a cup of coffee, so we were quite concerned by the number of reviews complaining of a strong latex smell.  We tentatively unwrapped the bed and wallah,  NO SMELL!  This was a huge deal for us.  We were also a little concerned that there were no directions with the bed (several reviews had referred to following the directions).  Again, no problems.  Once you unroll it from it's outer plastic wrap it pretty much takes care of itself!  We put the manufacturer's tag at the bottom of the bed and sure enough the T&amp;F embossing was right side up!  It inflated so quickly....within 15 minutes of opening it, my husband was taking a nap!  Since it's been on the bed less than an hour I can't speak to it's performance, but I will update my review when I have more useful information.  So far we are very pleased with our T&amp;F and would not hesitate to recommend it.
 Had a comfort grande queen (Costco) before deciding to upgrade to tuft and needle.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>Cooling - it really does stay cool compared to any other memory foam mattresses I’ve tried!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Too soft - Mattress is definitely on the softer side, not firm at!! If you are looking for firm, this is not the mattress to buy.<br/>Edges collapse - don’t sit on the edge of the bed , you will sink. I have a slated bed and I might reinforce by adding more wood to the edges. Not so sure if this will help though bc the edge just seems like it has no support.<br/><br/>Overall -<br/>Still comfortable and will keep for now. Will prob go back to the Costco one next time I’m in the market for a new mattress.
 I own two of these and love them.  On a work assignment, I had to furnish an apartment quickly.  I originally chose this mattress because it was easy to get delivered and relatively inexpensive.  It quickly became my preferred mattress, even over a very expensive name-brand department store bed I had at my home.  Sleeping sometimes on this one and other times on the department store mattress really gave me a unique chance to compare, and the Tuft &amp; Needle won hands down (it’s not even close).  It’s just comfortable and I sleep better.  What more can I say?  The department store mattress is really good, but this is much, much better, so I bought another one to have at my home. Mattress comfort is a very personal choice and hard to do online, I know.  If you’re on the fence, take a chance and get this.  I think you’ll be really glad you did.
 I slept like a baby for the first time in YEARS the first night, last night. On a very stained mattress. Arrived in plastic, NOT a box.  Plastic was ripped to pieces.  I give it 5 stars for comfort. I was waking up with terrible pressure point issues, shoulders falling asleep, etc. This truly is the answer to my lower back issues too. I have no lower back pain. But, I really hate the stains!
 I was thoroughly surprised at how slim the package was for our new bed. The bed came in a vacuum sealed container folded into a quarter and rolled nice and neatly. Once we had the bed unfolded and ready, we cut the seal.<br/><br/>WARNING! Place the bed exactly where you want to put it before you 'inflate' your new bed. This thing doubles or triples in size in comparison to how small it comes inside the box, do not let the package fool you!<br/><br/>We cut the seal and let the bed rest for 24 hours (unintentionally) to fully puff up and be ready to sleep on. The first night I had on the mattress and OMG WHAT THE HECK WAS I MISSING OUT ON?! I had no clue that my old box spring was old tech! My god, my life has changed! I get a full eight ours of sleep and I feel amazing. The mattress is perfectly firm/soft. When my wife wakes up in the morning, I cant even feel her get out of bed. CLOUDS. I SLEEP IN THE CLOUDS EVERYNIGHT. With the help of tuft and needle and some darn good sheets/pillows. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER.
 I was having several issues with my back and needed a new mattress, so while looking around the net I found the Tuft &amp; Needle Queen size mattress.<br/><br/>I bought this back in 2016 and I still LOVE this mattress!!!!!  My wife and I use it with an adjustable bed frame (that we also bought here at Amazon) and we have "zero"  complaints about it.<br/><br/>All I can offer is my own personal experience with it, but without a doubt I WILL order another one from them in the future  when needed and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a quality mattress for a more than reasonable price  (actually, I THINK the price for them is lower  now than when I ordered, but no complaint here).
 I am very upset. I purchased Twin XL as a gift and it arrived a few weeks before i needed it as planned. I opened it on the day off the occasion and it turns out that even though the box clearly says it is size twin XL, the actual mattress size is twin 39x75x10. I measured it 4 times since it didn't fit the base and the sheets.<br/>I don't know if someone made a mistake or it is done on purpose, but I'm annoyed that I have to deal with the whole return process and it can't even be used in the mean time.<br/>ugh, i was very excited and now I'm only annoyed
 Purchasing a mattress online was a new experience.  I carefully read all the reviews, both here and on other sites and narrowed my choices down to two, the Tuft &amp; Needle and one other.  The white box (well, it was white before the carrier dragged it through what looked like a freshly plowed field) arrived a day earlier than expected and a full five days before the bed frame I ordered with it.  Here are some of the elements I was looking for:<br/><br/>Odor -  One of the key things I was concerned about was odor.  I had tried a foam mattress topper and foam pillows in the past but could not use either due to the persistent off-gassing.  I unrolled this mattress, removed the plastic and gave it an hour or so to expand.  I then buried my nose in it and took a good sniff.  Faint, non-objectionable odor.  Several days later, when the bed frame arrived, I could detect absolutely no odor.<br/><br/>Sleep - The title says it all, My Back Thanks You!  I had been having issues with lower back pain in the mornings.  The first night I slept on this, I sat up on the edge of the bed, and stood up with absolutely zero pain.  Three nights later, and still none of the stiffness I was experiencing.<br/><br/>Firmness - For me at least, this mattress hits the sweet spot between soft comfort and firm support.  As someone who is mostly a side sleeper, it seems to align my spine correctly and provide just the support I need.<br/><br/>Edge - Some have commented on the edge support, saying that it is difficult to get off the mattress or to sleep near the edge.  While I have noticed that the edge does depress significantly when sitting on the edge, I have had no issues with it.  This may have to do with the fact that I have the bed at the correct height for me.  I have noticed little or no issue with sleeping near the edge.<br/><br/>Cool Sleep - I have noticed no issues with overheating.  If anything, the bed feels cool to the touch.  Of course, it's still late winter here in the south and I tend to keep my bedroom cool.<br/><br/>Durability - Since I've only had this for a few days, we will have to wait and see.<br/><br/>Unpacking and Setup - I unpacked the mattress by myself and placed it on top of our king-size (my mattress is a queen) guest bed to expand.  When it came time to move the mattress to my new bed frame, I did require a bit of help, since the fully expanded mattress tends to be a bit "floppy".<br/><br/>Overall - A VERY pleased customer.
 So let me say tuft and needle customer service is awesome, they helped me find a bed frame that fit for my bed and responded promptly. However, I thought that the mattress would get softer over time but it is pretty firm and kind of hurts a little.. I’m only 22 and have bad back issues (scoliosis) so beds are a big deal for my health. Everyone said in the reviews that their mattress topper from t&amp;n helps to make it comfortable but that’s frustrating that I paid $800 for a memory foam mattress and have to cash out Another $150 to make it comfortable? It should be fine on it’s own.. I was hoping it would get softer as time went on because I’ve had it for a few months now but it’s really not making a difference :( I had researched for months which bed to purchase and over 20 friends recommended tuft and needle and I’m just disappointed.
 All in all, it's a good mattress. Firm for support but also has just a bit of cushion for comfort.<br/><br/>Have not had any temperature issues. It's quiet and absorbs movement well.<br/><br/>Be sure to use a supportive bed frame, as it will greatly improve the firmness and contour of the mattress. I noticed a big difference when switching to a better frame.<br/><br/>Note: there was some initial off gassing that was strong after unboxing. It was enough to make sleeping in the room during the first night uncomfortable. However, it cleared up within a few weeks and is now completely gone (more than a year later).<br/><br/>The mattress is now a little cheaper than it was a couple years ago.
 We had been talking about a new bed for a long time.  Our old mattress was worn out, sweaty, lumpy, and sagging which exacerbated my trouble sleeping anyway.  I, like probably most of you was skeptical of all the new mail-order mattresses in a box, but kept coming back here checking out Amazon's offerings.  Finally, with the assurance of what we all know is great post-sale support on Amazon, I figured there wasn't much to loose.  We ordered this mattress, new sheets, new pillows, and a new frame.  Just like the videos you see everywhere, you dump the box, open the bag, and the mattress puffs up like a marshmallow in the microwave.  Just like everyone says, it smells a little at first, but dissipated quickly.  And best of all, just like everyone says, it's the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on.  I cannot believe we waited so long for this.  It's been a month, we both sleep better, we both love it, no sags, no lumps, no bumps.  Just amazing support and great restful nights.  Stop reading and buy one.
 EDIT: I've also now talked to a few of my friends and looked through the reviews and it turns out that this is a common problem - people like the mattress when they first get it and then a little down the road it all goes to hell and starts causing immense backpain (that's what prompted me to look into the whole topper situation and how I found out about this disaster of a policy). I guess this explains why they reneged on their original policy of providing unhappy clients with free toppers - they probably had to do this for literally *everyone* and couldn't afford to keep going.<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>original review:<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>I've purchased several tuft &amp; needle products over the years, including the mattress, pillows and some of the linens and have been reasonably happy, but just found out that people buying directly via their site get preferential treatment, such as a free topper if you find your mattress too firm (other things too, I’m sure), that people buying elsewhere - such as on amazon - don’t.<br/><br/> Here’s what’s grinding my gears here:<br/><br/>1. This didn't used to be the case. Every customer was treated the same regardless of the forum they purchased their products through,<br/>2. having a policy like this is actually maybe understandable F you clearly disclose it instead of leaving people hanging.<br/><br/>Super disappointed in tuft &amp; needle as a company and really don’t feel great about all the people I’ve encouraged to go ahead and buy their products - via amazon. This experience left a pretty sour taste in my mouth and I’ll be talking my business elsewhere.
 This mattress gave me lower back pain so badly I missed work. To be frank I am a larger woman so that may have something to do with it but no more than 3 days of sleeping on the mattress had me practically paralyzed. I was in too much pain to walk comfortably. I like a firm mattress but this feels more like sleeping on the floor with a thin yoga mat and maybe a blanket underneath me.<br/>Mattresses are subjective though. It's got good edge support for a memory foam and I never got that "I'm rolling off the bed-this is how I die" feeling. And even though its thin I couldnt feel the frame underneath digging through.<br/><br/>I've "returned" it already and purchased a different mattress. Refunding and returning was a simple process and kudos to Amazon for that.<br/>Just because I didnt find success with it doesn't mean it's a bad mattress per se. Return was easy so... no risk
 Update 4/7/19:<br/><br/> So right now it's a 3.5 star. It started as a 5. It may go back up if things get better.  Note: this is a rating for me, your sleep characteristics could be different and you may be fine with this mattress.  One important point: it is NOT "junk" nor poorly made, it just might not work well for me in the end...we'll see.]<br/><br/>It's been just about a month with my T&amp;N. As it stands (lays?? LOL) right now I'm a bit undecided if the mattress is going to work out for me. I'm finding myself waking up with some sore shoulders and lower back/hip area. This is a bit odd as it has never really been a problem for me before, especially the shoulder area. When initially laying down to go to bed, or just hopping on and lying down, I find it feels fine with no issues. It's not particularly "super comfy" but it's most definitely not uncomfortable. My friend and I came to call it "neutral" in that it's not super soft nor firm, which we kind of think is probably what a mattress should be, you really shouldn't notice it. Unfortunately for me, this doesn't seem to work out throughout the night, it seems like it ends up being too firm or too much pressure points or something that keeps me from getting comfortable.<br/><br/>I even set up a camera in my room a few days ago to see how I've been sleeping and I'm amazed how much I toss and turn and even briefly wake up throughout the night. Now I've only been watching this a few nights and I don't have a comparison to my previous mattress, and I'm sure some turning is expected, but this seems like a bit too much and may explain things.<br/><br/>So I know it can take a while to get used to things and the mattress can take a few weeks to really break in, so I'm going to give it another week or two to decide what my next step is. I'm really hoping for this to work out, but am just not sure right now, it may have to go back.<br/><br/>I contacted T&amp;N directly and they were very pleasant. They said I could get their mattress topper and that might resolve the problems, but it seems kinda silly to have to buy a $180 topper for a brand new mattress, I could have done that with my old one. I'm having a major cardiac surgery in a month and will be pretty laid up for about 2 months so want to have my bed sorted out by then, I can't literally can't be tossing and turning all night during that recovery time.<br/><br/>I'll update again in a few weeks if things change and/or I make a decision.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Previous Review (3/19)<br/><br/>It's early days with the new Tuft &amp; needle, only about a week, but so far I'm rather satisfied with no significant complaints yet. It's a tad towards the firm side but I generally favor that direction, we'll see how it goes over the next couple weeks. I've also read that they say it softens just a bit over the first month or so too. General support seems good overall. Delivered fast (via Prime of course) and packaging was easy. Unrolled and it seemed to get to full height pretty quick. There was absolutely ZERO smell at all to the mattress right out of the plastic wrap...completely neutral to my nose in my very small bedroom.<br/><br/>Probably the best mattress you can get in the sub $900 price range right now. Not sure if the upgrade to the Mint or a Casper would really be worth it.<br/><br/>More update over the next couple weeks...
 I moved from Texas to Anchorage, AK to be closer to family.  The bed I was sleeping on in Texas would wake me up in the middle of the night with pain in my hips.  So, I ordered the Tuft &amp; Needle Queen size to be delivered to my new Apartment.<br/>I had done a lot of research over several months among all the different mattresses and the Tuft &amp; Needle cheap knockoffs.  So I was anxious to try it out.<br/>Iʻve been sleeping on this since the beginning of November 2017 till present: (Feb 2018), and can say with all honesty, this is the BEST bed I have ever slept on.  Nearly every night, once I turn out the lights lay my head down, Iʻm fast asleep and no more hip pain!!!  No back pain.  I sleep in a cool bedroom and its nice and warm if I have to get up in the night for a bathroom break.  Getting back into bed is such a pleasure.<br/>I highly recommend this bed.<br/>A year and a half later...<br/>EVERY single night, I snuggle down into bed and sigh and say to myself: "I LOVE my bed".<br/>I have NEVER felt that way about any other bed Iʻve ever had.<br/>If I have to get up in the night, when I come back, there is this nice WARM area where I had been sleeping, and I am back to sleep almost before my head hits the pillow.<br/>I canʻt say enough for Tuft &amp; Needle.  It is a GREAT bed.<br/>Thanks, Guys.
 Let me start off this review with a little backstory. I lived my whole college career with roommates and sleeping on lumpy twin mattresses. When I graduated and got a decent job I bought myself an amazingly soft fluffy king bed all for myself in my own place. I slept like a baby every night. Then I got married to a husband with a bad back. My mattress at the time irritated his back, so for 7 years of marriage he periodically slept on the floor because my mattress was just too soft for him. Recently, after injuring his back playing basketball he couldn’t sleep comfortably in our bed so he started sleeping on the floor. It had been months since we slept in the same bed so I swallowed my pride and gave up my most amazing mattress to buy this mattress from Tuft and Needle. We set it up in a matter of seconds and it looked great. My husband slept on it and he loved it! After months of him sleeping on the floor he was finally sleeping next to me! Yay!! While my husband loves the mattress and has nothing at all bad to say, I on the other hand, do not share the same affection. This bed is firm. I miss my soft fluffy mattress so much. We have had the mattress nearly three months now and I have maybe slept through the night a handful of times. It feels like I’m sleeping on the ground. I toss and turn and wake up with daily back pain which I never had before with my old mattress. I’m giving this mattress 4 stars because my husband seriously loves it so much. His back pain is almost completely gone. So for that I am so happy and thankful. But as for me I kinda hate it. I wish it were softer and I didn’t constantly wake up with sharp back pains, but the hubs is loving it. So if you are used to something softer be aware this is a much firmer feel.
 While this mattress seems reasonably well made and didn't have an off odor, it's too firm for my liking. When laying on my side I need a second pillow to elevate my head as my shoulders don't really sink in. On my back, my butt doesn't sink in enough for me to get much (if any) support on my lower back.<br/><br/>For reference, I'm 30, moderately active, a more muscular build with a little extra weight around the midsection. I used to prefer somewhat firmer mattresses, but it's possible my last mattress spoiled me (it was a queen-sized Dunlopillo latex mattress that was around $1,600).
 I really wanted to like this mattress, but the comfort level just wasn't where we needed it to be.  My wife and I never had a good night's sleep on this mattress.  She was uncomfortable and I woke up every few hours with bad back pain which I never experienced with any other mattress.  We slept on it for 18 nights and eventually started sleeping on the couches until we replaced it.<br/><br/>I callled Amazon to pick it up and after 3 screw ups on their end they just gave our money back and told us to keep the mattress.  That turned into its own headache to get rid of.
 I wanted to make sure that we'd had this mattress for a while before leaving a review. We've been sleeping on this mattress for about eight months now. I was hesitant at first about buying a 'mattress in a box' online. However, the reviews of this product were overall very good, and also indicated that the company had good customer service if there were issues and that was important to me.<br/>As for the mattress itself, it is both soft and firm. When I read reviews that said that, I thought 'how is that possible?'. But, the top portion of the mattress has that traditional memory foam type feel that seems to sink in and conform to your body shape. But under that is has a much firmer layer. Now, I'm all about a soft, cushy mattress so this was a big adjustment for me. It took some getting used to, but I love it now. And it definitely improved the lower back pain I was experiencing from our old traditional innerspring mattress.<br/>Some reviews I read talked about the stability of the sides of the mattress, and yes it is unlike a traditional innerspring mattress and the sides will sink down some when you sit on them. I sit on this bed every morning and put my shoes on, and at first, it was weird because I was used to a traditional mattress, but now I don't notice that it sinks down at all. I saw on the company's website that they have a newer, more expensive model that addresses that issue, but for me, that issue was not at all a deal breaker.<br/> Something else I was concerned about, was a chemical smell that some memory foam products have. I am very sensitive to smells. VERY sensitive. This mattress gave off a very faint odor for the first couple of nights, but not enough that it caused me to have a headache or to be unable to sleep on it. It had no discernable odor after that first couple of nights.<br/>I bought a waterproof mattress protector from Amazon when I bought the mattress. Unfortunately, it tends to move around a bit and one of my dogs threw up a little on the corner just right where there was no protective layer. That sucks because it basically voids the warranty, but thankfully it cleaned up super easy and you can't tell there was anything there at all. So if you have any accidents happen, clean up shouldn't be too bad.<br/>Overall I would definitely recommend this mattress as the quality is great and you can't beat the price.
 I'm starting with a "First Impressions" review because we're talking about a mattress here. I'll have to update this review after one month, three months, and a year.<br/><br/> 1ST MONTH UPDATE] It's been a bit over a month, and the mattress is still working well. I'd say by the 4th night, the mattress felt like it was going to keep feeling, so the 2-week break-in period was more like four nights for me. Everything else I posted in my initial impressions still stands.  END OF 1ST UPDATE]<br/><br/>The Unboxing<br/>I received my mattress Friday (12/14) afternoon, so I've only slept on it for two nights. But first impressions have been good. Unboxing the mattress was about as easy as T&amp;N shows you in their video. I did not notice any funky smell when unpacking the mattress, still I let it expand for about three hours with the window open just in case. I was smart enough to not remove the zipper cover, so no worries about fiberglass particles getting all on my bedroom and clothing. By the way, that cover the mattress comes in is not machine-washable and should NEVER be removed. Even though the mattress seemed fully expanded after only five minutes, I still waited 3.5 hours before I dropped my body on it. Tuft &amp; Needle says their mattress can last 10 years. That's a bold claim for a mattress that cannot be flipped (as in sleeping on Side B instead of Side A) because there are three different types of foam inside it.<br/><br/>The Feels<br/>This is the first mattress I buy that isn't inner spring based. As such, it felt weird at first but I got used to it after a few minutes. I'm not going to tell you that the mattress improved my sleep to the point I reached the coveted eight hours, or that I wake up fully rested and fresh to start the day. On Night 1, I slept 15 minutes less than on my old mattress. On Night 2, I did make it to 8 hours 18 minutes. Still in both cases, I woke up as sluggish and cranky as usual - the need for morning coffee is real. Things may improve in the next few weeks, hopefully. But one improvement that was present right from Night 1... NO MORE BACK PAIN! That's something worth noting.<br/><br/>The only (minor) disappointment<br/>There I was, sinking in my old, non-flippable inner spring Serta mattress, already showing a small rip after only three years of use. It was the third mattress I had bought in my life, and the second that had met the same fate. So I said to myself, "I'm done with traditional mattress companies. I'm done with Serta, Simmons, and Sealy." But I don't have the money to buy a Tempur-pedic or a Sleep Number. I wanted to try something *different* by getting one of those bed-in-a-box mattresses so popular on the Internet. Little did I know that Tuft &amp; Needle was acquired by the company owning Serta and Simmons mattresses... So much for trying something different. T&amp;N is now basically the Instagram to Serta's Facebook. Had I found out about that merger sooner, I probably would've skipped T&amp;N and given some other mattress-in-a-box company a try. I guess that's the "Startup life", either fail miserably or have enough success to be bought off by the big guys. Whatever. But what's done is done and that is no reason for me to return the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. Let's see how it holds up over time.
 I really really wanted to LOVE this mattress. I spent a long time looking up reviews and reading consumer reports before selecting the King size mattress for my husband and I (and sometimes an extra kiddo or 2). We have had this mattress for about 2 1/2 weeks. My husband loves it, but he also didn't have any problems with our rather old pillow top mattress that we used previously.<br/><br/>The mattress feels very hard to me and I have ended up tossing and turning and changing positions every night while I sleep. I have a lot of back pain every morning when I wake up. I'm hoping that it just needs to be broken in more or something but I'm not sure how much longer my back can take it. I know that some reviews say that for women who are 130lbs or less the mattress can prove to be uncomfortable but I'm 5'7 and 135, so I'm wondering if that is the problem or not?
 We were in the market for a new mattress as we had been sleeping on an old fashioned sprung one for a long, long time. We went into one of the big furniture stores on a whim and were given the hard sell by one of the salespeople who was trying to get us to spend $1500 on one of the name brand ones. This was more than we were really willing to spend so I started researching some alternatives. I decided on the Tuft &amp; Needle because it seemed to offer the best value and the customer service looks to be excellent.<br/>Delivery and set-up of the T&amp;N was completely hassle free. The box was left at our property and we had the mattress set up in about 30 minutes (including removing the old mattress and fitting the the sheets etc). It was fun to watch this thing expand to size!<br/>Obviously, one of the issues with buying a mattress online is that you can't try it out, but the 100 night sleep trial gave me the confidence to order this one and give it a go.<br/>We have been very happy with our purchase so far. It feels quite firm (actually a little firmer than I was expecting after reading some of the feedback here), but that suits me just fine.The adaptive foam allows just enough "give" to make you comfortable but not to sink into it too much that it becomes uncomfortable. I'm a back sleeper mainly and I've had no issue getting comfortable on this mattress. It doesn't seem to get hot at all as far as I can tell, it seems pretty temperature neutral. It's very nice not to have a creaky overly bouncy and springy mattress too - it just feels better made and like it will last for a long time. It's relaxing.<br/>I think we made a very good choice with this. I don't know why you would spend two or three times the money on a "traditional name" mattress anymore when T&amp;N offer great value and service like this.
 Where do I begin? The bed is wonderful. Initially my husband wanted to return it as it was too firm for him. Amazon lists the return policy as 30 days and Tufts &amp; Needles lists it as 90 days buying directly from them. I did not contact Amazon first, I contacted Tufts &amp; Needles since we were about 33 or 34 days since receipt of the Queen Mattress. I have never experienced such consistent thorough, friendly, super prompt help as I did w them - and I've had plenty of excellent customer service experiences among the not so stellar ones throughout a few decades. They offered a Queen topper for free to try prior to returning if we wanted. We decided not to do that. Both my husband and I were in and out of town in different directions throughout this process and Tufts &amp; Needles agreed it was fine not to return the bed for a couple of more weeks. It was all at our convenience as far as they were concerned. Tufts &amp; Needles help you locate the Salvation Army near you that will come pick it up and send step by step directions that are quick and easy to follow, etc. Two weeks after the first contact w them we changed our minds and decided to try the topper, which ultimately worked for us and the bed is a dream in my opinion - pun intended. They sent it right away. If the topper did not work out for us, we would not have had to pay for it and could have still returned the bed for a full refund. Returning the bed is simply getting Salvation Army to pick it up and getting a receipt from them. This is a long story I know, but I was just so taken aback by the cheerfulness and helpfulness at every step of the way by each person that responded to whatever emails went back and forth. We had previously done a lot of research for mattresses and finally settled on checking this one out. I am so glad we did. These folks are simply amazing. They make a great product, stand behind it, don't pressure you in the least if you want to return it and help you get your refund and the bed out of your home if that's ultimately what you want, and in our case came up w a solution (topper at no charge even) that made the "comfy-ness" just right. In my experience they either have excellent training for their staff or just hire wonderful customer service folks right out of the gate. Thank you Tufts &amp; Needles!!
 Bed stayed in it's box for nearly a week before I released it from it's prison. Even so, decompression was perfect; it came to life like a loaf rising in fast-forward; almost instantly transformed into a fully formed, properly shaped queen-sized mattress. Latex smell was strong at first, but cleared out after a couple days.<br/>Overall, the mattress is beautiful and comfy. When I lie on it, I feel NOTHING, which is great; no hardness, no sinking, no discomfort. I fall asleep in no time. I have chronic upper back pain, and don't always wake up pain-free, but that was the case before I got this mattress. I've found that back-sleeping on this mattress seems to alleviate the back pain more than side-sleeping.<br/>Size is accurate. My queen-sized fitted sheets fit the mattress perfectly.<br/>Can a mattress be both soft and firm? This one feels soft on contact, but it's really quite firm once you lie on it. I've seen reviews saying its too soft while others claim it's rock hard. Well it can't be both, and I must say it's neither of those two extremes. Seems just right. Goldilocks bed. Since my bed is a high platform, I don't tumble into bed and can't comment on how this mattress responds to that. I also don't have "night-time play," so can't assess the bounciness for regular play or rough-housing; but I did jump on it once and yes, there's some bounce to it.<br/>Be prepared to have a helper to man-handle the HEAVY box and get the mattress out of it. I had to lay the box on its side, crawl in at one end and push the mattress out of the other end. It comes folded and shrink wrapped, looking like a super-tight giant dumpling, with several layers of binding plastic sheet tightly wound around it. Once we unwound the plastic sheets, we could hear the mattress sighing. Then we hoisted it onto the platform, carefully cut a slit in the shrink wrap and watched the mattress take a deep breath and rise up. Wish I had video-taped it; it was simply spectacular!
 I bought in November 2018 and am mattress-shopping again in July 2019. I bought a full-size, and sleep on it alone, and I am a larger-than-medium sized person. This mattress did NOT hold up.  At first it was Perfect! Then.....not so much. And now....not good AT ALL. I sleep on one side of the mattress (because exiting the other side is obstructed). The side I sleep on is now Collapsed.  So even if I move over to the other side to sleep, it feeeels like I am rolling downhill to the original side.  I am gonna turn it lengthwise to try to get a couple more months out of it.   Note: the mattress is not 'flippable', so as to put the bottom-side-up.] But besides the collapsing issue ::: it is making my back hurt. Don't get me wrong, the FOAM feels GREAT.  And the price is fine. But it is not giving me **SUPPORT**...Probably this mattress would be fine for someone weighing, say, 125 lbs or less.  Or for a guest room that does not get much use, hmm.
 My wife and I have been contemplating replacing our queen size IKEA mattress for a while. We decided to go down the route of ‘mattress in a box’. We tried out a mattress in a showroom environment but found the price point of T&amp;N really appealing. Plus the 100 night trial and the glowing reviews truly caught our attention.<br/><br/>Our primary complaint with the IKEA mattress was lower back pain - I pretty much was forced I become a side sleeper. I travel a lot and spend many nights in hotels and never have back pain issues (typically the hotels have former beds). I was really hoping that T&amp;N would address that problem. Upon setting up the mattress, we both really liked the look and feel. It fitted perfectly on our existing slatted base. I did feel it was a bit too soft but could feel adequate support when I lay on my sides. It’s been 20 nights since we set it up and I am largely happy when sleeping on my sides. When I end up on my back I do get the lower back pain which inevitably wakes me up - rolling over to the side typically fixes that issue. My wife on the other hand is largely happy with it - she is a bit skeptical though about the beds longevity (largely because of its softness) but only time will answer that.
 I developed acute back pain after some use. I called amazon after 1 month use and i was told since its new i need to give time for my body to adjust and now its ao bad i want to write a review. U fortunately i cant return this nor keep the mattress to use. I wish i did not purchase this product or had used my first call to initiate a return.
 Best mattress! Recommend unpacking and letting it rise overnight and to air it out. During the rising, usually takes 8-10 hours, do not lay on it as it dissipates the air within the mattress material and it'll end up being flatter than what it's intended. Once it's fully raised, highly recommend getting a cover for it. Then layer your usual bed sheet cover over that to help mattress last without unnecessary stains and such. It's soft and firm at same time. Absolutely love it. This mattress fills lll the beds in the house.
 Okay, It's not so much I did not like it, but my wife did not like it. (I did not really like or dislike - pretty neutral on this product).<br/><br/>We replaced a conventional matress that we thought was getting worn out.  Mattress comes in a small box that weighs about 70 lbs. and is an 18 in square about 4 feet long.  Mattress was easy to unwrap and inflate.  With both of us in bed the mattress slumped toward the middle, a bit like a hammock.  We both gave ourselves some time to get used to the feel of the mattress.  After about 80 days, we gave up and decided it wasn't for us.  We had saved our old mattress, and I must admit after going back to our old mattress, it slept better than the Tuft and Needle, even being worn out.<br/><br/>Sending the mattress back to Amazon was like putting a genie back in a bottle.  We bough a Mattress bag and plenty of shrink wrap, and tried to revacuum seal like the videos on the web.  We were able to get the mattress rolled up to a dimension of about 26" x 5.5 ft. We then patched together several boxes of cardboard and duct tape to send it back on its way to get a refund.  Had we bought from Tuft and Needle directly, they would have had a charity come pick up the mattress and refunded us the money - if I had it to do over, would have gone the route, but as always, Amazon honored the 100 day sleep warranty with a full refund, and I now have a story to tell.<br/><br/>The mattress was not for us, but I'm sure some folks would find it sleeps just fine, based on the positive reviews.  I would recommend if at all possible to go lay on this type of mattress prior to purchasing to see if it is for you.
 There is an overwhelming number of mattress-in-a-box companies out there.  I'd heard of a few of them before, but never any so highly reviewed as T&amp;N.  Ultimately, what tipped the needle in their favor for me was their company approach: dedication to a quality product.  They don't have 10 different product lines or try to sell their mattress as anything more than what it is, and they openly list all the certifications they've earned right on the website.  It was important to me to know the foams used are all Certi-PUR certified and that the cover for the original T&amp;N mattress meets Oek-Tek standards.  The only negative feedback I could find was that some people tend to find their mattress a little on the firm side.  Coming from a Japanese-style futon which is harder than most average mattresses out there, I did not find this to be the case.  Foam cradles the body a little differently from an innerspring, but I immediately fell in love with the feeling.  Unlike a previous foam topper that I had used college, the T&amp;N does not make me feel sunk in or stuck.  It's the perfect amount of support and bounce that I didn't know a foam mattress could have.  I hope to be enjoying this mattress for many nights to come.
 Came well packaged. It was heavy (queen size) and needed two people to lift it (awkward). It definitely outgassed at the beginning, so I purchased an Allerease mattress cover. I didn't smell anything and two months later when I took the mattress cover off I continued not to smell anything.<br/><br/>As other reviewers mentioned, the mattress is firm - especially when compared with my old Serta memory foam mattress. I purchased a mattress topper (2" cotton) to give me a little cush. I don't notice body parts falling asleep (arms were a culprit before) and my back doesn't hurt when I sleep on my stomach (which used to happen frequently). It does sleep a little warm (I have no thyroid, so that doesn't bother me, but others should know). A very good investment in my daily health and comfort.
 Had this bed almost a year now and can say it's the best bed I've ever owned. Its comfortable and does well at dispersing heat when it's hot but still can have me over heating in those hot CA summers. In the winter the parts you arnt sleeping ok can get very cold, but that's a plus for me since I run hot.
 We needed a new mattress. We debated mattresses for months and months. The 4-inch foam topper really seem to save the last spring mattress we had bought so going to a foam mattress was a high consideration this time. We've had the mattress for a couple of months now and we're both extremely pleased. The price point is fabulous and the construction is great. I can't think of a single complaint for this mattress and the way we talked about it to friends and family sounds like we get a kick back from the company. We don't. We just really love the mattress. I would easily replace all the mattresses in the house with if I could.
 It was pretty dirty when I received it. I'm no expert but it kind of looks like black mold, which is gross. You can see part of it in the pic but there's more (I'm using the app to submit this and apparently I can only attach one pic? But you get the point). I started the process of replacing it through Amazon, and they make you agree to ship it back (???) upon receiving the new item, so I didn't complete the process. I will contact the manufacturer, who I expect to be super great and I will update this review after I do. I haven't even slept on it yet. I just want this documented ASAP for future reference and this was the first idea I had on how to do that. This is probably just a fluke, probably the fault of whatever vendor they use... but, you know, they're the ones using this dirty vendor. Point is, you guys may have better luck than me!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I raised this from 1 to 4 stars because Amazon &amp; Tuft &amp; Needle were both great about this, the mattress is absolutely fantastic, but you can't give something 5 stars when it comes dirty. Tuft &amp; Needle's website actually had some good advice on which number use when you call Amazon to handle this sort of thing. They were also awesome about looking at the pics I took of the mattress and going back and forth with me on whether or not it was mold (we don't think it was).  So that's great.<br/><br/>The mattress itself is incredibly comfortable!! I'd definitely recommend it for people who like a firmer mattress, but I sleep in all positions and haven't found one that doesn't work.  It's pretty great for literally anything you do in a bed.  Like, we're huge fans of hit here at my place.
 I really wanted to make this mattress work...loved the concept of affordable mattresses without the cheesy mattress salesmen.  Unfortunately, the bed was too firm for me.  I tried adding a memory foam topper but it still was too uncomfortable for me.  My husband liked it initially, but it became too firm for him as well.  If you need a firm mattress, this is the one for you.  Fast, simple delivery and setup.  A fair return program is really important when buying mattresses online.  Will follow-up and report how it goes for me.
 I bought this around Christmas 2017, and just got around to using it. I could not pass up the sale here on Amazon, as I was able to get it for $375. I have never seen it go that low again, I guess I was just lucky, as I recall it was only on sale a few hours. Anyway, it has been sitting in the box until 3 weeks ago, around 08-01-18. It was awesome to see it come out of the box and take shape, make sure to look at how this is supposed to be un-boxed, because it could really get screwed up, if you're not careful. I let it sit for 24 hours before putting the sheets and everything else on it. I used it the next night.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed is that it was nice and firm, but not rock hard firm, which is perfect for me. I have been on disability a couple of years, and have nerve damage (sciatica), neck, and spine problems. Believe it or not I use the $20 a pair Serta Huggable Comfort Memory Foam Pillows from Big lots, and they are an amazing deal. They really compliment the mattress. In the 3 weeks I have been using it I have not woken up in pain yet, or even had pressure point pain. I am a side sleeper, and usually my hips are killing me most mornings, but not anymore. I have not noticed the bed getting any indentations yet from weight, like some of the cheaper made mattresses. Even some of the more expensive ones have this problem, but after 3 weeks, this one is still perfect. Also I am a big boy at 6'0ft tall, and 220lbs, but it is having NO ill effects on the mattress, so far.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a soft mattress, look elsewhere, this is not for you. If you like a semi-firm type of mattress this is it, IMO. Be aware it is not rock hard firm, but firm enough with just a little give. In my eyes the perfect balance. If you can catch it on sale again for $375 (queen-size), it's an absolute steal, and at the current price it's a great deal and a no brainer.
 This is the third bed-in-a-box mattress I've purchased. The first two were Spa Sensations from Walmart, and I was perfectly happy with them. I only got rid of the first one because I moved 900 miles and it was cheaper and easier to sell and replace the mattress than it was to rent a truck to move it. When I moved in with my boyfriend, we had a serious debate about which mattress we would use. Mine was too soft for him, and his was too firm for me. We also didn't really have the cash to make a large investment. So, after some significant research on my end, I decided this was the mattress I was going to purchase. It happened to be a great deal on Prime Day, so I actually bought it earlier than I had planned. We've been sleeping on it for 6 weeks now, and neither of us have a single complaint about it. It's soft enough for me, firm enough for him, and neither of us toss and turn like we used to. Fingers crossed that it holds up!
 I just don’t get why people love this bed.  Mine took forever to arrive, it was the bed in a box experience everyone knows of. The cover is cheaply made. It’s not especially comfortable. I’m generally a side sleeper and find this bed too firm for my shoulders and hips, it’s not as uncomfortable when i sleep on my back, but there is just nothing special about this bed. I debated on returning it during, didn’t,  and now I really wish I would have.  I just don’t think this is worth the price, hype, etc.
 I have had my mattress for one week now and it is amazing! It's soft and very comfortable. I purchased a Sealy brand in box mattress about 8 months ago and immediately had back and body pain. I kept it for about a month before returning it. I had been looking at this Mattress for a few months and wasn't sure but every time I read the reviews even if they were bad the one positive thing everyone had said was, how great the customer service is. I figured even if it wasn't the best bed they would at least help me find the best bed for me. I finally gave in because on Prime Day a California king was going for $560!!! What a steal so I bought it right way. I'm so happy that I did, not to mention how awesome Amazon is as well. I ordered my bed Tuesday and they said it would arrive the next Monday but my bed was on my doorstep on Friday. My experience with Amazon and Tuft &amp; Needle has been wonderful I hope you decide to purchase this bed as well because you won't be disappointed.
 This is a great mattress, such an improvement over what I had! I was using a traditional box spring/spring mattress before purchasing this one, one that had been passed down to me and had been used for many years. I had no idea the impact a new mattress could make! With the old one, I frequently had trouble sleeping, and would usually wake up feeling stiff or sore, with back pain. I branded myself a chronic insomniac and carried on with my life, not ever thinking to blame the mattress. While going through a long move, I ran out of space and had to leave the old mattress and box spring behind, so I went shopping for a new one. I was dubious about ordering online, and about buying a mattress without springs, but I'm glad I did!<br/><br/>My last mattress was a Full size, and this one is a California King, so of course I was thrilled from the beginning. I was going to order a Queen size, but honestly, considering it's only a $125 price difference, I wanted the max experience. I'm a big guy - 6'4", 250 pounds - so having a big, long bed is a game-changer. It also helps when I have company over--considering how much space I took up by myself on the Full size bed, having someone stay over was inevitably uncomfortable, which is no longer a problem with the bigger bed. The bed itself is very comfortable. After reading the reviews on here, I didn't even try it on its own, so I can't comment on sleeping on just the mattress--I bought a 3" memory foam mattress topper and never looked back. If you sit down on the mattress, there's a fair amount of sink-down, and it isn't the most comfortable. Once you lie down, and your weight is distributed, though, the sink-down is reduced and it just feels soft and supportive. My "chronic insomnia" problem seems to be solved. I still don't drink coffee within 4 hours of bedtime, but when I lie down I'm usually asleep within a half hour, which is much better than what I was experiencing. I've been sleeping on the bed for about a month now, and haven't noticed the foam losing any of its elasticity or creating a "rut" where I sleep. I always sleep on the same side of the bed, so I've been putting that area through its paces, but haven't noticed any issues. I still don't want to get out of bed in the morning, but I don't think there's a mattress on the planet that will make me feel well-rested by 6:30 a.m. I don't wake up sore or with back pain anymore. I still get back pain occasionally, but I'm willing to bet that's more due to my bad posture and sedentary lifestyle than anything else. When sleeping with a partner, there isn't any significant disturbance when she rolls around, and the mattress easily accommodates both our weight.<br/><br/>The only issue I've been having with the mattress is one that isn't necessarily the fault of the mattress. It tends to slide around on the frame, so sometimes in the morning, the mattress is far enough from the wall that my pillow and neck have fallen into the gap, which obviously gives me some neck pain. The sliding might be exacerbated by the composition of the material, which is a bit slick/slippery. On the other hand, my bed frame doesn't have raised edges around the outside, and as a big guy, I can put some real pressure on the bed when I shift around. If you're buying the mattress, I would advise getting some kind of sticky something that will hold the mattress in place, or a frame with raised edges so that it can't shift around when you do. Otherwise, great stuff!
 I waited nearly 4 months to see this bad before I decided to review it .  As stated in many other reviews it comes packaged in a way that you have to open it up and let it air out .  Go to my sensitivity to most smells are allowed this mattress to air for 4 days .  I’ve been sleeping soundly ever since.<br/> When it comes to bigger purchases I do a lot of research before buying anything .  I’m delighted that I took the time and settled on this mattress .  I would have given it five stars except that it is a little bit too soft for me .  I prefer my mattresses to be on the firm side and I would consider this to be medium firm  In spite of that I sleep soundly and comfortably every single night .
 It’s always easy for a company to look good when everything goes right, but it’s when something goes wrong that a company’s true character will be revealed, and Tuft &amp; Needle’s character proved to be everything that a customer could possibly hope for.<br/><br/>Due to an injury, and being on disability, I require a mattress that gives great support and pressure relief, at an affordable price without sacrificing quality; something I had been having a hard time finding. Then on Amazon’s Prime Day, I saw that Tuft &amp; Needle’s mattress was on a good sale price. I had already researched it, as well as some other mattresses, and since it was already on my short list, I decided to get it. And I’m glad I did.<br/><br/>The mattress arrived the next day and that night we were sleeping on it. However, there was a problem with the mattress, which refers back to the comment back at the beginning of this review. I called T&amp;N and talked to an awesome customer service rep named Kaitlyn. She took care of everything quickly without making me jump through any hoops like some other companies do, and then  went far beyond what I expected. An A+for Kaitlyn and the whole customer service dept.<br/><br/>So now 100 nights later, my wife and I are sleeping great every night. We never wake up stiff or in pain, and I can easily say that this is one of the best bang for the buck purchases that I’ve ever made.<br/>The mattress has a medium-firm feel, with pretty good pressure relief.<br/>One trick I learned long ago to help the mattress break-in faster is after setting it up and giving it a few hours to expand, put on some clean socks and walk on it for a few minutes. That will help it break-in much faster.
 I was skeptical about buying a memory foam mattress until we purchased one for our son a few months ago. We decided to take the plunge and purchase one for ourselves as well. This mattress is everything they say it is. It expands almost immediately when removed from the box. The 72 hours is more for the smell (not bad at all) when it first expands. We have the king size 12" bed and are using our original box spring base from our old bed which works just fine. We've only had this bed a short time but we've been able to sleep through the night for a change. We are side sleepers and this bed is more than comfortable. There was no temperature variation between this and our original beauty rest mattress that we replaced.
 It is a very comfortable sleeping mattress (ours is Full Size).  We've had ours for four months.  Took it out of the packaging, let it fluff itself up for a couple of days (note:  take it out of the packaging in a location big enough for the mattress).  It is thicker than the mattress it replaced, and our standard thickness sheets had to be replaced.<br/><br/>My side of the bed, which only gets occasional use (I have my own bed), is holding up very well.  My wife's side, which gets full-time use is beginning to "remember" she sleeps there, and is not returning to normal.  An indentation is forming.  Not sure, if after we rotated the mattress, if when we get back to the original rotation, if the indent will still be there.  For being four months of use, I was surprised that it's already showing signs of degradation.
 I was looking for a medium mattress, not too hard and not too soft. Did a TON of research and read just about every review out there on all bed-in-box brand mattresses as well as comparing to Tempurpedic. I bit the bullet and went with T&amp;F.<br/><br/>Night one: could not get comfortable and woke up with a sore neck and back. was realllllly disappointed that this was not going to work out and i'd have to send it back.<br/><br/>Night two: tossed and turned just about all night - same concerns as stated above.<br/><br/>Night 3 and on: never slept better, don't wake up in the middle of the night anymore and my body was thanking me!<br/><br/>I believe the first two nights of discomfort was due to adjusting from the old mattress to this one. For price and comfort comparing to big name brands, this purchase is a no-brainer. You wont be disappointed
 I bought two (2) of these twin XL mattresses to replace the split king sleep number mattresses I previously had. After awhile, the sleep number started leaking and got wore out. My daughter had bought one of these about 9 months prior and when she noticed that it was on sale, she called me. I love this mattress. And it works well with the adjustable base that we already had. They came in two boxes and were compressed really well. Open the box, unroll the plastic covering and give it some space. It bounces in to shape pretty quick. I waited about an hour before putting them on my bed.  I had a question, so I called the mattress customer service. Someone picked up the phone and answered all of my questions. No waiting, no foreigners, no phone systems, an actual person. The lady answered all of my questions. And what I really liked was that if I wasn't satisfied, they donate the used mattress to charity. Amazon doesn't something different, but i'm not sure what they do.
 We were so nervous to order a mattress online, but after Looking at mattresses in person and seeing the unbelievably high price tags.. we decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>The mattress came in a box which made it super easy to take upstairs. It inflated itself within minutes and we slept on it the first night. As other people have pointed out, it does have a smell to it initially (ours disappeared within couple of days) - kind of like the smell of a freshly painted room. We woke up sore the first morning. Of course we were extremely worried, but looking back I think our body was simply adjusting to the new mattress. We decided to stick with it for at least another week and haven't had any complaints since then. In fact, this is the best mattress we have ever owned and it cost a fraction of what mattresses cost in our local stores.<br/><br/>For a reference - we purchased a king size mattress.
 We purchased our mattress less than a year ago. Our initial reaction was wow, pretty firm. We agreed to keep it and try it for what we thought was a 100 night trial period. As we neared what we thought was the end of the trial period we decided to return it. My wife and I were waking up every morning with bad back and shoulder aches. When checking on the return, Amazon informed us that it was not a 100 night trial and it was no longer able to be returned. We’re still sleeping on it for now, we’ll be in the market for another mattress soon though. So if you like a firm mattress this may be a good option, seems to be made of quality material and good craftsmanship. Only two stars because I’m lying in bed and my back hurts again.😕
 This is our second mattress purchase from Tuft &amp; Needle.  We upgraded to a king-size bed when we moved into our new home.  We couldn't be more pleased with our purchases from Tuft &amp; Needle.  Delivery is compact and easy.  Set-up is quick (unpack mattress and let it "breathe" for a day).  We've never had the need to return either product.  Our queen-size mattress purchase a few years ago is still going strong!  Mattresses don't have a strong chemical odor, nor do they break-down in certain spots, due to good construction and good materials. We would highly recommend Tuft &amp; Needle for value, quality and customer service. We did our homework and compared to four other foam mattress manufacturers (Casper, Purple, Saatva and Leesa).  You simply can't beat Tuft &amp; Needle!
 Wife and I had a much more expensive (than the T&amp;N) 3 year old Cal. King memory foam mattress that was (for me, not the wife) too soft, with matching 3 y.o. box springs below that were in very bad condition (did not find that out until swapping for the T&amp;N).  Felt an immediate difference after one night's sleep - no comparison with our previous mattress.  My wife likes a very soft mattress, while experience has shown me that firmer is more comfortable when you wake up.  Either way, both of us love our new T&amp;N mattress.  It seems to be the perfect compromise between too soft and too firm.  Unlike the old one, I don't sink in halfway (a slight exaggeration), I sink in just a bit, and unlike the old one I can roll around and not have to dig myself out of a crater formed by my body shape.  This is our 4th mattress in the last 16 years we've been married, and it is nothing like the others right off the bat!  The mattress now sits without any box spring below and on top of the bed frame I made, which means plywood over 2x6 framing (if you can't break it, you won't need to fix it).  Since it's too low now (can't reach the bedside lamp, tough to reach the bedside table and forget about the top of the headboard), I have a perfect excuse to make an eight-drawer bed cabinet below the mattress to bring us up another foot - nice.  Just don't tell the wife, I should be done by next Christmas and I want it to be a surprise!
 So I replaced a 7 yr old Sealy foam bed where it was sagging and not giving support. Cost me about 2.5k. After reading reviews I made the jump to try this bed. Only problem was I tried to do everything myself. It’s a bit too big for one person, you really need two people. Had to get a friend to help out.  But setup was easy. I let it breath for a full 36 hours before I put weight on it. And wow! This is the best bed I have ever owned!! Thank you!!<br/><br/>I haven’t slept this good for the last 5 years!! I sleep hard throughout the night now, instead of waking up to switch positions.<br/><br/>Also, I even bought the pillows and I’m not kidding, best pillows I’ve ever owned! It has greatly improved my sleeping neck pain. Now I just have normal waking pain. Lol
 Like sleeping on a cloud!  We had a generic foam mattress for a few years and it felt worn out so, after some research we decided on the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress.  It arrived in a narrow box. After opening it and reading the instructions, we removed the old mattress, put the box on top of our box spring foundation, pulled out the rolled up vacuum sealed new mattress from the box, and carefully sliced open the plastic wrapper. It was coiled up like a cobra ready to strike!  We stood back and watched as the air slowly started to inflate the mattress. We watched it as it started to take shape, heaving and twitching like it was coming alive!  After about 2 minutes, there it was...our new mattress! We let it "breathe" for about an hour or so, and then we dressed it in a brand new set of sheets.<br/>Now, after enjoying it for the last 5 months, both of us can honestly say that we LOVE IT!  It is firm but not hard, it does not get hot, and best of all, we wake up feeling GREAT!  No regrets here. Would highly recommend.
 It’s comfortable but not as comfortable as I thought it would be based on the reviews. I don’t not like it, I sleep through the night comfortably, it does it’s job, It was a great price considering the convience as well, and I don’t wake up with any pain though and I’m very suprised because i get back pain pretty easily. I was between 3 and 4 stars but went with 4 for those reasons. When I wake up I’m not like wow that was the best sleep of my life but I’m also pretty well rested. It’s Definetly a firm mattress more than anything else. I would say 7/10 on the firm scale...I sink in just barely and I prefer a more medium mattress. I’m honestly suprised at how good these reviews are based on the firmness...I guess the majority of people like firm mattresses? Simply put, If It wasn’t impossible to put back in the box I would probably return it but I don’t hate it and I opted to buy a mattress topper to make it softer instead.
 I wanted to wait a while to give this mattress a true shake down test before reviewing. After over a month of sleeping on, sitting on, eating on, and other things that won't be mentioned, I believe this to be one of the best mattresses on the market. The comfort level is superb, it may be a little firm for some, but its was perfect for me. The top Adaptive Foam layer really does feel cool as you sleep, and the bottom layer is very supportive in all sleeping positions. I am a person that moves around at night, so I need multiple types of support, and this has it. The packaging was simple, easy to open, and the mattress inflated almost immediately. It is a bit heavy (about 70ish pounds) so have help or take your time setting up. If I have a criticism, and this is just my personal quirk, the cover fabric is very soft and very smooth, and the design has soft almost rounded edges. That means for me, some of my sheets slip right off. But that's not the mattresses fault. I'll just get new sheets. Quality. Comfort. Value. This has it all.
 Its a firm bed and getts somewhat softer overtime, it isnt like sleeping like a cloud and it isnt memory foam so you do not sink in like crazy my husband is 240 and 5’11 loves it! I am 150 5’5 and love it as well. i do not wake up with any back pain, infact i go to bed with an achy back and it disappears when i wake up, i do not toss and turn to adjust much. I have tried purple, nectar, temperpedic and tuft and dynasty and this. Tuft and needle and then purple is the best! NECTAT SUCKS , do not buy tht quick sand pieve of garbage. U will cry of pain!
 We have been through 4 mattresses in the past 2 years and have finally found THE mattress. This mattress is durable, well made and comfortable. We swapped a newer mattress with one of our teenagers, then we ordered another boxed mattress from Nectar and hated it, returned that within 2 weeks. My husband's back has been killing him for the past year due to the inconsistencies and lack of support in our mattresses. We tried just about everything. We researched Tuft and Needle for awhile and read multiple reviews over a few months period until we finally made our decision. We did purchase a topper (Cheer Collection Ultra Plush Eco-Friendly Hypoallergenic Bamboo Fitted Mattress Topper) separately, after reading the reviews of course, and are using that in conjunction. The mattress and the topper together are truly the perfect balance and 1/4 of the cost of what we would pay for the same feel and durability in another mattress. We have had no issues thus far, we have owned it for about 3 months now. My husband's back felt better within just a few days of sleeping on this mattress and we couldn't be happier!! We are extremely pleased with this mattress and definitely recommend!
 I bought my queen size one year ago. Best purchase I ever made. I needed a hip replacement and had hurt a shoulder. Sleeping was miserable for a year and a half. I tried several mattress toppers on my spring mattress(a good quality one). Changing positions every five minutes meant no real sleep. Bought the tuft and needle December 2016. Big relief. Shoulder got better, slept better. Still had to get a hip replacement in June. That's all healed now and this mattress made recovery so comfortable. I will never own another brand. Do yourself the best favor and get one, plus a beautiful new duvet, cover and big new pillows. Without sleep you can't live your best life. Ahh, finally. See you on the cloud. :)
 I had a good few weeks with the Tuft and Needle mattress. Initially, it seemed very comfortable and cradled without being too firm.<br/><br/>However, about 4 months later — now outside of the return period — the mattress has developed uneven spots and I can’t get a comfortable nights sleep out of it.<br/><br/>I wake up with a dead arm, a sore neck, or just a pain in the back. I’ve had to get a standing desk at work because of the lower back pain developed from the T&amp;N mattress.<br/><br/>I simply can’t recommend this for side sleepers.
 I read reviews of mattresses for a months before deciding to buy T&amp;N.  I am 6 months pregnant, and want to get a king before baby arrives. I have never written an Amazon review in my life.  This is the first review I have ever done.  I felt compelled, because it was the worst experience both because it feels like you are sleeping on the floor, and it is impossible to actually return if you don't like it.  I am not picky or complain very little about products in general.<br/><br/>The T&amp;N mattress if you don't like firm, is NOT for you.  It feels like you are sleeping on the floor.  The very first night we got it, I had to sleep on the couch, because my hips and shoulder hurt so bad from sleeping on my side. Every night since, I have had the worst night sleep ever.  And not because i'm pregnant.  My partner is having same exact issues.  It doesn't matter if you are a stomach or side sleeper.  We were both extremely sore.  In addition, it smelled so strong, we had to air it out for 3 days.  I spent around $800 + taxes, and we decided to buy a $180 pillow topper.  In the end, it cost exact same amount as a generic $1,000 + king mattress price.  It is not worth it to buy it online, GO TO THE MATTRESS STORE and try out the mattress.  You can get a good mattress for the same price, and not have to buy a pillow topper.<br/><br/>The Return was a nightmare with Amazon.  You have to get it back into the T&amp;N box if you order through Amazon. It came folded and vacuum sealed into a small box.  There is NO WAY to get it back into the box to have UPS pick it up.  I called Amazon and UPS, and said I could not fold and get a King mattress vacuum sealed and sent back, being pregnant and not having a vacuum sealer.  They said tough luck.  So, i have to pay someone from Task Rabbit $100 to bring a bag, vacuum sealer and box, just to ship it back.  I found a good mattress at a mattress store, and NEVER doing a mattress-in-a-box again!
 My husband and I bought two twin xl mattresses, to fit a king bed, about 6.5 months ago. Both my husband and find the mattress too firm. I had high expectations as the product description lists that the mattress is "just the right mix of “not too soft, and not too hard”.  I'm 5'9" and weigh 130 lbs.  and my husband is 6'0" and weighs 156 lbs so our weight is average. I bought a mattress topper but the mattress is still too firm and I can not get a good night's rest. I'm a side-sleeper and my shoulders and hips always feel squashed on the side that I'm sleeping on. My husband prefers a 13-year-old mattress that we have in our guest bedroom instead of the new one. Since we got the new mattresses we have slept a couple of times in a hotel and noticed that we sleep much better on the hotel mattresses. Needless to say, we are disappointed and both looking for another mattress.
 I bought this almost 6 months ago and finally feel like I have enough nights on this mattress to provide a decent review. Upon arrival, the mattress was squished real small and the box was not unwieldy. Upon removing the mattress from box and unrolling I was unsure it would actually be as thick as advertised, but once it was exposed to air, it fluffed right up. I gave the mattress 24 hours to fluff, though the directions said it needed less I believe. Once at full depth, I placed it on my bed, which has wood slats with no foundation. I also purchased a waterproof cover for it as well as we do have small children, and accidents, either food or biological, happen. The first couple of weeks the mattress was very firm, but this is normal for the break in period. I did notice the mattress sleeps hot, retaining heat and I am a furnace according to my wife. I cool gel topper is a necessity if you sleep hot as well. After the break in period, this mattress is great. Not to hard not to soft. There is a softer spot where I sleep as I am 6ft, and weigh in at 215lbs. I don't think any mattress can take that kind of weight without compressing a bit. We had a Tempurpedic prior to this and it also had a soft spot where I sleep. I just could not fathom spending that kind of money again, which is why we went with the Tuft &amp; Needle. We will see how the next 6 months go and I will update then.
 After checking out several online mattresses we decided to give Tuft &amp; Needle a try. It arrived right on schedule and I'm amazed at how the company fit this queen sized mattress inside a Christmas tree sized box. They must use so heavy duty machinery to perform this small miracle. My husband and I decided to rate the mattress individually and then try it together so we set it up in our guest room. I took the first night trial. It seemed too firm but from what I had read it takes time to break in.  However, I woke up around 3 am with sharp pains shooting from the middle of my back and into my neck. Needless to say, I missed work that day having to ice and heat my back and neck. My husband took trial night two. Two hours after going to bed I heard him stumbling into our bedroom complaining of back pain which he's never had a problem with. Trial night three. We thought maybe the combined weight of both of us (350 lbs) would help soften the mattress. We gave it a try and gave up after 3 hours. The mattress is just too firm. I have had a better night sleep on an air mattress and that's saying a lot. I think if my husband and I were able to withstand the pain for a few weeks the mattress may have eventually softened up with time but I didn't have that much vacation time to provide for the cause. No way could I work after waking up in that much pain every morning. However, I will say my 15 year old son took a nap and had no problems what so ever. So for someone who is younger than their mid 40's and no major back or hip issues,  I think this mattress would work for them.  I gave three stars for delivery and customer service. We have yet to ship it back due to the need of finding a box big enough to pack it in. I read an earlier review from a customer who used cardboard to wrap around the mattress and lots of packing tape. I think we will have to use that method since we don't own a handy dandy shrinking device. I highly recommend to those of you looking to purchase this mattress to purchase it directly from Tuft &amp; Needle in case you need to ship it back. I think they just have it picked up without needing to be packed back up in a box but I would inquire from them directly.
 This is my second T&amp;N purchase. My first was a King size, four years ago. That bed is still as magically amazing as the first day it was opened. In my line of work I move twice a year so lugging my prized king-size mattress around just wasn't practical but my sleep suffers *immensely* without it. This product literally changed my life. I have suffered from nerve damage, various lingering issues from a car accident in my youth and carpal tunnel in both wrists. A few weeks in this bed and I honestly felt like a new woman. I was absolutely aware of how bad my sleep was but I never imagined it could be *so* improved.<br/><br/>On a couple long term practical notes: my king is on a platform style slatted frame which really helps with the cooling/airflow factor. The edges have maintained perfect integrity and there have been zero sagging issues (and I'm larger - over 200 lbs). The mattress is very firm when brand new but it definitely gets a nice "broken in" feeling after a few weeks. I would still describe it as firm - the most supportive, comfortable, plush firm ever! I have recommended this mattress to every friend who will listen and I'm always glad for the opportunity to sing it's praises. I am happy to support a company with such a positive mission and appreciate the guarantee that it offers for my investment. You literally have nothing to lose by trying this.
 Best sleep I've ever had.  We have had this mattress for about 6 months now and it is still just as great as the day we bought it.  3 friends have bought one based on our recommendation and all of them are loving it too.<br/><br/>-----Update after ~2 Years-----<br/>STILL THE BEST SLEEP I'VE EVER HAD!!!  This mattress is amazing and has held up so well.  Its just as comfortable 2 years later than it was when we broke it in.  Get one of these, you won't regret it!
 We've had it 3 weeks and so far we love it. Coming from our old spring mattress (which was a top-of-the-line Sealy model, though 15 years old), it is much better with minimizing what you can feel of your bedmate's movements. This mattress is for people who like a FIRM mattress - it is quite firm but the memory foam provides enough softness for comfort. It did have *the smell* others talk about but everything I've read online has said it is pretty much unavoidable for memory foam, and they all to go through "off-gassing" for a couple of days. We left ours by an open window for a couple of days and at that point the smell was undetectable unless you really buried your nose into it and took a huge inhale, and even then there was barely a trace of smell. It is odorless in normal use.
 I won't lie, it made me little nervous when I first thought about buying a mattress online. But man, do I hate mattress stores and the pushy mattress salesmen. Multiply that by 10 million to get how much my partner hates mattress stores... there was no way I was dragging him into one of those places again.<br/><br/>I started to wonder, how much does laying on the thing for 5 minutes in the store actually help? I've wondered the same thing about test driving a new car. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't give a crap how a car "drives" or "handles" or "feels". I want a thing with 4 wheels and seatbelts to get me from Point A to Point B. That's it. Certainly a mattress' "feel" matters a bit more, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I hadn't slept on any bad mattresses that I could think of. Not new ones, anyway. The 10 year old, super saggy, completely-molded-to-our-body-shape mattress we were currently sleeping on was horrible. But new mattresses... sure, the pillow tops feel fluffy when you first plop on them. The memory foam ones feel squishing. but they all seem about the same when it comes to actually sleeping on them for 8 hours. Maybe I'm just not picky, but I kind of think all the firmness stuff and pillow top/memory foam bells and whistles are a bunch of gimmicks to try to get you to pony up even MORE money.<br/><br/>When I read that Sleep Like The Dead surveyed over 18,000 mattress owners and found very little difference between those that had bought mattresses online and those that had bought in-store in terms of satisfaction with the mattress, I was sold on buying a mattress online.<br/><br/>The main reasons I chose this mattress:<br/>Free shipping!<br/>It's a screaming deal, price-wise, even if I had needed to pay shipping.<br/>Made in the USA! Huge bonus.<br/><br/>The mattress came very quickly, as usual for Amazon. Unpacking was pretty easy, and it was fun to watch the foam expand. And my cats LOVED the box. Heh.<br/>The mattress does feel very firm for the first few days. Moreso if you have it on the floor like we did while we waited for our new bed frame (upgraded to a larger size, so my partner's feet finally don't dangle off the end of the bed! Yay!).<br/>Once it was on the frame, it was quite comfy, but I have noticed that now, 2 months later, it has definitely softened up a bit and is pretty much perfect comfort-wise.<br/><br/>The biggest bonus is that the chronic shoulder pain I've had for the last 3 years is GONE. I've always been a side-sleeper, favoring my right side. But it hurt so bad to lay on that side on our old mattress that I'd pretty much started sleeping on my left side 100% of the time. If I'd know I could solve it with a new mattress, I would have done this three years ago.
 I kept waking up so sore it was hard to get out of bed and even after several hours of moving around the pain still lingered. I went on vacation for about a week and noticed I felt better after sleeping on the hotel mattress. I did a lot of research online about mattress and age. I see as you get older firmer mattresses can be better for most. My current mattress was very soft offering no support. I didnt like the idea of a firm mattress, which this one very much is. My husband sleeps on a firm mattress and he even commented how my new mattress in a box was VERY FIRM. I thought it would be something I had to get used to, after one nights sleep I was fine, nothing to 'work out' or get used to. I really doubted the quality of a squished up mattress in a box, no way can it hold my weight! I am about 280 lbs. I read some reviews some people noticed a funny 'plastic' type smell off the mattress. It does smell a bit weird, but I turned a fan on and opened the windows. I have bad migraines and was still ok with the smell that quickly went away.
 Due to bad timing , I initially thought that this mattress was causing me to have an extremely sore back. Turns out that it was a back muscle that had either pulled badly or tore a bit.  Now that the back issue is on its way out, this has become a very comfortable mattress. It's not a memory foam mattress, incidentally.  It's a proprietary foam that Tuft &amp; Needle developed that give you the comfort of memory foam without the adaptive indentations that you get with the memory foam, which allows those of you who toss &amp; turn a lot (as I do) to easily reposition themselves at will without having to wait for memory foam to re-adapt to your body. The only actual issue I had with it was that all four edges of the mattress were sitting higher than the center of the mattress.  After stripping the bed to change the sheets, I looked closely and discovered that it was caused when the mattress was inflating after unpacking and not being properly centered in the outside cover. It's actually easy to see if you look at the corners of the outside cover and notice that they're not squarely positioned on the foam mattress itself.  After a bit of pushing and shoving to get it closer than it was inside the cover, it sits a whole lot closer to level. Now as far as pricing, all I can say is compare it to the others. Some are similarly priced, but do they offer a 10 year warranty and have a no hassle/$0 return policy? And then look at the prices of the big names. Why on earth would anyone in their right mind spend $5000 one a Tempur Pedic foam mattress?  Or even half that, for that matter. There's absolutely no way  that there's that much difference between this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress and their overpriced offering.
 The bed is pretty firm (which I like) and it doesn't get very hot.  I am using it with a bamboo mattress protector.  I've been using this mattress for about two months now and I think I'm sleeping pretty comfortably.<br/><br/>I sleep on my back because if I sleep on my side, I get really bad neck and shoulder pain.  This bed does not change that.  Sometimes I wake up on my side and the neck and shoulder pain returns.  It was the same on my previous mattress (box spring).<br/><br/>If I sleep through the night on my back (presumably) on this mattress, some days I feel very slight tension in my lower back, almost unnoticeable.  This could have been there before the mattress or it could be in my head due to a review that I read here, prior to buying this mattress.  It could also be because I've been sitting with really poor posture at my new job.  If the tension becomes more pronounced or turns into pain, I will update this review.<br/><br/>It's quite heavy (78 lbs for queen) so I feel like it's probably decent quality (albeit this could just as easily be just a marketing ploy and filled with denser garbage).  I don't have any issues with it and my girlfriend seems to really like it, so I assume it's a decent mattress.  Would say not to expect any sort of 'wow' reaction.
 I purchased one of these for myself and my daughter. My previous mattress was a tempurpedic cloud that I paid $3500 for. In comparison, this is way better in terms of cost, spine support and it stays cool. The tempurpedic is very heavy, gets hot when you body sinks into it and for all those layers, doesn't give enough back support. Would wake up feeling sore and like back was going to go out. I have none of these issues with the Tuft and Needle mattress. So worth it for the money.
 I bought this for an extra bed when I was having migraines and sleeping with someone was making for a long night for us both.  I gota say I am really happy with this bed.  I actually think I like it better than my far more expensive bed LOL.  It's firm but not too firm and it's supportive while not being a brick.  It's also NOT HOT.  I had a Tempropedic and I'm so glad I bought it at a place you could return the bed, that thing was like sleeping on black top on a 100 degree day.  I now have a Comfortpedic with a gel top which when it was brand new was cooler than black top but after a few years I don't think it's really held up it's end of the bargin about being cool.  This bed may be less dense which is allowing for better airflow thus it's not hot to sleep on.  It might break down faster due to it's density but the price would easily allow me to replace it a couple times for the same price as my other bed so really it's well worth the risk.  I've slept on this bed for 2 months and I dare say it's perfect.  We're concidering replacing our primary bed with one of these now.
 This is a very comfortable mattress. I have been sleeping on the T&amp;N mattress for about 4 months. I will never go back to a traditional mattress and would highly recommend this to others. It replaced a very firm inner spring + 3" memory foam topper.<br/><br/>When I initially sat on the edge of the bed, I was worried that it was going to be marshmallow squishy. Once you lie down on the mattress, the support is great and very uniform. It is actually firmer than I expected, but the padding uniformly supports your whole body. Some people complain that the mattress is too firm. It is NOT a pillow top, but if you like that, an easy solution is to buy an extra soft or quilted topper or mattress pad(s). It is still cheaper than a "plush" or "luxury" mattress and has the added benefit of being washable/replaceable. I bought a pretty thick quilted mattress pad with 'cooling' features because I think the mattress sleeps hot ($30 at Costco). Now it is so comfortable, I never want to get out of bed!<br/><br/>Set up was easy and it was fascinating watching the mattress expand. I have a queen mattress and got it in the house and set it up by myself. I did not sleep on the new bed for a few days, because I am typically sensitive to odors and wanted to err on the side of caution. I did notice a "new" smell for a few weeks, but it was never strong enough to bother me.
 Perfect medium firmness. No weird chemical smell like other mattresses in a box I've experienced. Simply unroll for a perfect night of slumber. I've only spent a few nights on it, and so far I have slept better than I have in years. My previous mattress was expensive, 9 months old and from Costco. Hated it after a couple months, it developed a bowl shape at the hips/low back. And on one side of the bed both my husband and I would wake up with migraines. Before that we had a $5k fancy state of the art waterbed.<br/>My only sort of complaint; shipping was faster than expected. Only because I anticpated the new one show up on Monday, instead it arrived on Friday, I had to scramble to get rid of my old mattress before unboxing my T&amp;N.<br/>just buy it, you'll love it!
 My husband and I have had three memory foam mattresses that we have absolutely loved! We purchased them off the Internet, slept on them comfortably, have never gotten hot like some people comment on and are both believers in the memory foam technology and comfort. When it came time for a new mattress, my husband researched ALL options. We could not wrap our heads around the expense of temprpedic but did not want to go the cheap route we had been. Enter in Tuft and Needle. The company received favorable reviews, people liked their mattresses, Dave Ramsey talks about them all the time and let's face it 100 night free trial seemed like a no brainer. The mattress arrived in early August...little longer delay from order to arrival than planned, but not horrible. We opened it immediately and began sleeping on it the first night. We did notice the mattress was firm,however, we do not like really soft mattresses and knew our previous mattresses 'broke down' sooner than we cared for, so we thought maybe this was good. Fast forward a couple of months,  take out a weeks vacation and now we are entering the end of Nov. We both began noticing walking up with our shoulders hurting. At first this was not a daily occurrence,  and I think honestly we both had been noticing it longer than we cared to acknowledge, but did not want to attribute it to the mattress. Had we slept different,  blamed it on stress,  working out, etc. Reality was,  the mattress is too firm and it was causing us physical pain.  I contacted the company,  was upfront that we were past our 100 days window,  and expressed our physical discomfort that had gradually been building and asked if anything could be done.  I received a quick response but was told it seemed odd that pain did not come right away and they would be happy to sell me the 180.00 foam topper if I wanted to try that.  I guess I look at it similar to other things... say a running shoe... maybe the pain from the wrong shoes does not set in instantly but after repeated use something little builds into something big. Feeling frustrated having spent the additional money to get a better mattress to find out need to spend another almost 200 to hopefully fix it.
 This mattress is such an improvement over the 7-year-old Sleep Number bed it replaced! We are sleeping better than we have in years with less back pain. At the time of writing, we've been sleeping on the mattress for just over a month.<br/><br/>Shortly after purchase, my wife injured her hamstring and had surgery, so she's been laying in bed every day for the last 2 weeks recovering and says the bed is incredibly comfortable, doesn't cause any pressure points and is generally not something she thinks about during the day.<br/><br/>There's honestly nothing to complain about - comfortable mattress, doesn't sleep too hot, zero problems with setting it up. Buy one - you won't regret it.
 We received our mattress quickly and were so excited to open it! Unfortunately, the mattress had a section where the foam didn't relax after removing the plastic. It was rock hard and dipped in about 3 inches.<br/>I contacted Tuft &amp; Needle the next day. I received EXEMPLARY customer service. After providing a few photos and description of what had occurred a new mattress was shipped immediately. The replacement mattress was perfect and is the most comfortable mattress my husband and I have ever slept on. The company left it up to us what to do with the defective mattress - we were not required to return it which would have been a huge pain.<br/><br/>* Extremely comfortable to sleep on<br/>* Does not sleep hot<br/>*AMAZING customer service<br/><br/>I would recommend this mattress to anyone looking to replace their existing mattress.
 Buying was a breeze! FOR ONCE!! Was happy not to find, at checkout, no annoying surprises, or "upcharges" to get the mattress I wanted. It was, as advertised, no bait and switch or anything shady.<br/><br/>Shipped quickly and even though Fed-Ex had some issues, it made it to our place in just a few days! Believe it or not, they brought it up to our apt, which was up a BIG hill and a LONG staircase... So, in the end, I was OK that it took a couple days longer! ;)<br/><br/>It was a little harder to stay ahead of the expanding (while cutting it open), the way it looks in the setup video is a bit different than it behaved for us, but there were no issues, we managed quite easily and in a few minutes... we were looking at our new (internet) bed! :) We did just what they said, let it air out before sheeting and, of course, covered it with a stain resisting mattress cover, just in case the 100 day sleep test went awry. We opted to go with a foundation (also bought online) rather than a box spring and couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>Now, I am larger and have some pretty severe back issues from several injuries (several herniations, stenosis, arthritis, etc...) and have really had issues with mattresses in the past but all I can say is... SO FAR, SO GOOD!!! I honestly don't wake up in pain anymore and have noticed just feeling better in the morning, although admittedly, I want to snuggle in as long as I can because it IS so comfortable. I have a tendency to get hot when I sleep and so I was a bit afraid, but the mattress feels amazing.. It is hard to explain really... Maybe there is something to this adaptive foam thing to... LOL<br/><br/>There are MANY options these days for buying beds online... But Tuft and Needle seems to be able to do it (while I cannot say better since I have not laid on any of the competitor beds) cheaper and with  AMAZING quality. My wife and I have done mainly latex beds for the last 15 years and while they work better than traditional "spring" mattresses... the last one we got was a floor model and still cost us $800 and managed to last (partially because of bad storage that kind of "broke" it) and the one before that was $1500!! With the prices of everything going UP (especially since we just moved to California), it was nice to be able to buy something for LESS than I did several years ago and find it to be EXACTLY what I was hoping for it to be! :)<br/><br/>Anyway, I am not the kind to go ON AND ON (only ON, usually... LOL) and, of course, time will tell, to be sure; but so far, my back, my wife and I say... THANK YOU TUFT AND NEEDLE!!! You gave us a GREAT mattress, at a GREAT price, and I never had to deal with any creepy salespeople, lay on beds that 1000 (or more) other people have laid on (just EW), only to realize that I cannot afford the mattress I really NEED... I can say that, as of now at least, we are some VERY SATISFIED customers!! :)
 This is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. I had previously ordered a $200 memory foam mattress from Amazon and it was awful. It wouldn't expand and was terrible to try and sleep on...notice I said "try." I contacted Amazon for a return on that one and the return was easy, peazy. I love how comfortable this T&amp;N mattress is BUT, I had to let it off gas for about a week before I tried to use it. (All of the memory foam mattresses have to off gas for quite a bit, apparently.) The smell was still a little strong when it was time to use the mattress so I put a 2 year old memory foam topper on it (to block the smell), and we have been sleeping on it that way for the last 2 weeks. I have gone nose blind to the smell but my grandson walked into my bedroom and said, "What is that smell?" I asked him to be more specific and he started sniffing around and discovered it was our new mattress from T&amp;N. He said it didn't really smell bad, just weird. He got over that as soon as he laid down on it. Ha-ha. He loved it too! The packaging was great and the mattress was very well protected. I was not prepared for the immediate expansion of this mattress when I opened the plastic wrapping! Have it someplace where you can prop it against a wall (outside of your bedroom) when you open the plastic cover. It expanded very quickly and caught me off guard. It trapped my legs against the bed frame and I couldn't budge it. My husband had to pull it away from me. At first, I had it propped up in my bedroom but the smell was so strong that we moved it to the hallway in the middle of the night. It stayed in the hallway for 7 days before we put it on the bed frame. We were sniffing it frequently to see if the smell had diminished. When amazon came to pick up the first mattress, we had to use it or sleep on the floor. That's why we had to use it with the old memory foam topper. I highly recommend this mattress, especially with the very strong company guarantee that backs it up. Best mattress deal anywhere. Happy zzzzzzz's!
 First online mattress purchase so I was uncertain how it would work out, but I love this mattress so far (have had it for 3 months now).  There was a giant heavy box on my porch, but since the mattress had all the air vacuum sucked out and was then rolled up into the box, it was manageable for one person.  The T&amp;N box in the photo is exactly what you get.  It wasn't easy, but I was able to drag it inside and up the stairs alone.  When you take it out of the box it stays compact because it's machine-wrapped so tightly in plastic.  You take off the outer plastic and put it on your bedframe and then cut open the last vacuum seal layer of plastic.  Once you break the vacuum seal the mattress begins to take in air and quickly grows to its full size.  The directions say you should wait a day or two before sleeping on it to allow it to completely air out, even though it appears to be full size within a few minutes.  It also gave off a strong smell of chemicals at first and that day or two to air out allowed the odor to dissipate.<br/><br/>Pros:  Very comfortable for sleeping (the only thing that matters!), good price, DIY installation keeps the price down.<br/>Cons:  1) I think I read the instructions online before purchasing the mattress but I remember thinking it was odd that there were no instructions in the box.  People who don't research what to do might have trouble, especially if they accidentally break the vacuum seal before the mattress is in the right place.  2) DIY installation not for everyone.  3) Traditional mattress delivery from a store often includes haul-away of your old mattress.  This way is best for people adding a mattress to their home, and might not be the best option for people replacing a mattress who need to dispose of the old one.
 So far one week out (will update)<br/>Its really like sleeping on a somewhat firm cloud. I'm normally a side sleeper and I find no discomfort in doing so but I find that now I can also sleep flat on my back with no discomfort either.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Firm but not to fir.<br/>Very thick feels like a cloud<br/> Extremely easy to set up (I ordered a double) without help.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The odder... I'm sure this is common with memory foam and the odder lessoned and I can only smell it if my nose is pressed directly against it but the first few days it filled my room. I recommend buying a topper after the first week if you can't stand the odder.<br/>For now I highly recommend this mattress but like I said it's only been one week.<br/><br/>Update!<br/><br/>The odder is gone and I'm still happy with! updating to five stars.<br/>Thank you for the happy nights of sleep.
 Nothing gets me to sleep.  Not the sound machines, not a tempurpedic mattress topper.  It's a long boring story that sounds like those horrible litany of woe boring elderly relatives tell at Thanksgiving.  Let's skip that.<br/><br/>I've tried a lot of stuff including the Tempurpedic topper, MyPillow - and frankly, it's helped a little but nothing gave me a solid nights sleep.  So, the 100 night guarantee and a couple of very positive Chiropractor reviews were what pushed this like a life raft to a drowning man.<br/><br/>Buying a bed from Amazon sounds crazy, doesn't it?  It sure did to me.  Buying a bed is like buying a car.  You go and try out a bunch, haggle like heck until your day is totally ruined and then wait for delivery on a completely inconvenient day, usually when it's raining.  Then the delivery guys break something or have some reason why they can't take your old bedding away.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is was a tiny boat in big ocean of desperation, so I ordered this and the 18" inch Zinus framr. which I've reviewed separately.<br/><br/>The bed comes compressed in a single box, it's pretty heavy.  I had no problem getting it upstairs despite the weight.  My trick was to flip it end over end up the stairs.  If you're smaller than me, which is frankly implausible as I am only 5'6" and 160 lbs and would never impress anyone with my muscles - get a friend and use a board to slide the box up the board, hold the box, move the board, and keep sliding until you get the box all the way up stairs.  Safety first.<br/><br/>You have a couple of choices here.  What I did was unpack the box in the hall so I could more easily remove the tightly packed bed from the box.  It's tightly sheathed, cocooned, in plastic. I put it on top of an existing queen bed and carefully removed the plastic wrap.  It was fun watching the bed instantly decompress. I opened the windows and let the bed air out over night.<br/><br/>The only reason I did this was when I bought the Tempurpedic topper - it smelled.  The Tuft &amp; Needle didn't smell.  So, I really could have skipped this step and put the bed in place the next morning directly on its frame and saved myself moving the bed from one bedroom to the other.<br/><br/>If you want to play "Who has the worst boo boos", I'll probably win or at least win Miss Congeniality.  So, getting a comfortable bed completely sucks.  We've had a Select Comfort for years, which I don't like.  The Tempurpedic was like getting stuck in a pit for some reason.  I'm a side sleeper, and often wind up on my stomach.  I don't want anything that puts additional pressure on my ribs.<br/><br/>The first night was ... firm.  Not hard, but supportive and comfortable.  What I felt right away was the bed felt cooler than the topper I had previously.  I slept okay, but had to be up early and I felt oddly cheated.  Not by the bed - but like I was getting a level of sleep I hadn't had in some time.<br/><br/>The second night was luxury hotel, first night of vacation without the kids wonderful. Okay, so I replaced the bedding too.  I actually fell asleep really fast which doesn't happen very often and I slept for ten hours.  When I got out of bed, I had no back pain or hip pain. This is the first time in at least ten years I have slept through the night and woke up feeling this good.
 First Night....loved it.  We just received this King mattress yesterday.  Was shipped in a T&amp;N branded box weighing 92lbs.  Brought it up to the bedroom and pulled the mattress out of the box.  The mattress unboxing processes was just like the videos on the T&amp;N website.  Laid the mattress on the bed, cut the plastic "shrink wrap" off, and the mattress started expanding.  I would say it was fully expanded after about 30-45 min.  Some reviews state that their mattress did not expand to the stated 10in, however ours is exactly 10in.  The mattress we replaced was 12in, so we do have a small gap between our mattress and bottom of the headboard, but pillows cover that up.<br/>Some reviews mention a certain odor when they open it, however my wife and I didn't smell anything.  In terms of how the bed feels, the adjective I would use is "supportive" vs "firm".  You do sink into the bed a bit, so it is soft in that sense, but I found that the bed provided the right balance between comfort and support.<br/>After lower back pain due to the sag in our old mattress, I was very curious to see if this bed was the answer.  I am very happy to say that after the first night I woke up with no back pain!  One night is a very short test, but so far I would highly recommend this mattress, especially if you have experienced back pain due to sag in an old mattress.
 We have been sleeping on this mattress for a few weeks now. My back feels better but its firmer than I am used to and I lose circulation in my arms. I read all of the positive reviews and as with other bed in box mattresses they generally can send out a free topper. I clicked on the support button on the amazon page and they said I could order one or contact TnN directly. I called them directly and they said for Amazon orders they wont send a topper and if I didn't like it I could work with Amazon for the return. I felt good about the mattress since I felt like it was backed by great customer service but now that warm and cozy is gone and honestly I'm now considering a return not so much because of the bed but because I have no confidence that they will support me if I have further problems. That 100 day return feels like a trap now since I don't have another mattress to use and no $$ to purchase something different.<br/><br/>Maybe ill get lucky and it will break in some more....
 Update:  After sleeping on our Tuft &amp; needle mattresses for a while, we noticed that side sleeping was quit uncomfortable, leaving us with pain and stiffness the next day.<br/><br/>We contacted Tuft and Needle regarding the issue.  They offered us to return them.  With the exception of side sleeping, the mattresses are perfect.  So, to help with the discomfort caused from sleeping on our sides.  Tuft and Needle sent us two mattresses toppers free of charge.<br/><br/>I am very impressed with their dedication to customer care as well as their dedication in backing their products.  Many companies do not share that same integrity and dedication.<br/><br/>We purchased two XL Twin Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses for our split King adjustable bases.  The are absolutely perfect.  Neither too soft nor too hard, but just right.  We haven’t slept this well in years.<br/><br/>We are very pleased with our purchase.  I will update our review at a later date, if my opinion changes.
 After Adam ruined the mattress industry for us, I spent months researching a quality mattress at a reasonable cost. Ultimately we chose Tuft &amp; Needle because I was told that it's comfortable, yet would provide adequate support. I was afraid it would be too hard, but my line of thinking was, "If it isn't soft enough, we'll just buy a mattress topper." My husband and I both *love* this mattress. We've been using it for a few months now and we've decided that we're so happy with it that we don't even need a topper. And then, much to my husband's dismay (because of the cost), I bought Tuft &amp; Needle pillows and sheets. No regrets.
 We really enjoyed this mattress at first. It is very firm and not particularly "soft" feeling but we didn't mind. After a bit less than 6 months, however, the middle of one side of the bed seems to be weak/soft and causing me severe back pain. Even if we flip it one of me and my wife suffer. This is a real disappointment, and I haven't heard complaints from my (admittedly small number) of friends who have invested in the more expensive competitors. I spend time in a separate home for the weekends and my TEN year old mattress there doesn't cause me any problems.
 This company rocks!  My husband had back surgery and has been in the hospital and rehab for the past 5 weeks. I ordered this mattress in hopes of making him more comfortable when he returned home. He has been home now for a little over a week and he LOVES this mattress. While gone he barely slept at all his pain was so bad throughout the night. Now he is sleeping almost a full night without the pain being so bad it wakes him up. The bed is really firm at first! I read many reviews so I was prepared. My first night was pretty bad but the next day I walked on the mattress a little (read that suggestion somewhere) and I had Molly, my 60 bulldog, sleep on my husbands side while he was gone so that side would be broken in too. Needless to say that worked but now Mollys a little sad to be back on the floor.<br/>Tuft and Needle has been great to work with! Their customer service is amazing. They read a review about my tough night and some shoulder pain I was having and within minutes reached out to offer suggestions and always remind me that if it doesn't work, I can get a refund. They don't have to worry about that. I'm determined to enjoy it. There company really strives to make the customer happy. I'm telling everyone I know... get a T&amp;N. you won't regret it and your bank account will thank you as well!
 Got this mattress almost a year ago, and I'm still raving about it! Anytime I hear a friend talking about buying a new mattress, I send them here! I've tried the Big Name Brand mattress similar to this, and I can't tell this difference. It was nice getting this for much cheaper and, at least at the time of my purchase, a 6 month payment plan at no interest. I thought after 3 months that I would have a body-shaped indention in the mattress, but it has kept it's shape and firmness over time. My boyfriend has also been impressed with the quality of the mattress as well. We are moving into a 2 bedroom house in July, and I will definitely be purchasing this mattress for the spare room!
 I LOVE this mattress so far. I did a lot of research prior to purchasing and heard of this company from my sis in law. I was a little hesitant for memory foam since I live in a hotter climate and enjoy having heavier down duvets because of the inner solace that the weight of a decent blanket gives me. This mattress has met my expectations and then some. Very easy to set up as a woman and not too heavy to lug through my apartment. Came packaged very well and has just enough firmness and bounce for me of average weight and size. Not sure how this would hold up with someone more voluminous than me though. Mattress expanded to a good size almost immediately and I was able to comfortably sleep on this the first night about 8 hours after opening just fine. Not a very strong smell initially, and the scent from packaging had completely disappeared after a few days. I sleep wonderfully after testing for a month and my back pain is nonexistent now. Highly recommend for someone looking for a descent mattress in this price range!
 I've had my T&amp;N for a week now and I can honestly say this is the best mattress purchase I've ever made.<br/><br/>Logistically, the whole thing was a breeze from start to finish. I live in Hawaii and even though I'm a Prime member, packages tend to take forever to arrive. This one was at my door in less than a week. I unrolled the sealed mattress on my platform bed, cut open the bag, pulled out the plastic and let it expand all afternoon. By the time I was ready to sleep, it was good to go. I recommend following the setup video on Tuft &amp; Needle's website. It's not rocket science, but they have an efficient system figured out. I don't think I'll ever go back to buying mattresses in-store again.<br/><br/>Comfort-wise, this thing is heavenly. My last mattress was a Posturepedic/boxspring combo on a standard metal frame, which was working fine for me until I moved. I wanted a lower profile in my new home for aesthetic reasons, so I went with the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Nomad-Plus-Platform-Bed-Twin/dp/B01K5WPA16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nomad Plus Platform Bed - Twin</a>. I was a little concerned about the support level with a foam mattress, but turns out it works perfectly with my T&amp;N. I'm a side sleeper with a preference for firm support and I've never slept better in my life.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can say is that the mattress had a strong synthetic smell for the first night. It didn't really bother me but my cat was so turned off he slept in the living room. If you're sensitive to smells, you may want to let it air out for a full 24 hours before sleeping on it.<br/><br/>Overall a convenient delivery and setup process, good price and great product. What more could you ask for?
 Bought this mattress because it was rated a Best Buy by Consumer Reports. My experience with it is consistent with their review; it is a great mattress for side sleepers, firm without being overly so, supports my 225 pound frame without any problems. Took one star off because it tends to slide around on my box spring, end up adjusting it back into place a few times a week.<br/>One important thing to know about this mattress is they don't advise using it with a mattress protector.  The mattress is designed to breathe and do a bit of heat transfer, putting it inside a mattress protector prevents this and might make your sleeping experience uncomfortably warm.
 Arrived a day early, packaged well without excessive leaflets, offers.  Replaced a 6-year-old queen with center sag.  Kept the old box and sleigh bed.  Perfect firmness for me but glad we use a quilted topper.  The body doesn't sink-in as much as the foam pushes back. Awoke during the night and found there was no side or stomach pain, which has been the standard.  I'm often a stomach sleeper and this mattress works for that.<br/><br/>Some have mentioned sitting on the side of the bed to be different, did not notice anything.  I didn't have any problems carting the box upstairs and setting-up the mattress.  Any odor was minimal.  The longevity is unknown but I'm satisfied so far.  The one thing I noticed being different is the insulating value.  Staying in one spot for too long can concentrate heat in a peculiar fashion-- almost like a chemical hand-warmer heat,  but far less intense.
 The box, and product, is very heavy. It would be helpful during setup if the "outer plastic" was a different color than the vacuum package. The inner package was damage while removing the outer plastic and we had to scramble to get the mattress laid out before it finished expanding.  There may have been an indication which side of the mattress was the top, but we did not see it.  The chemical smell only lasted about 18 hours and wasn't as strong as other brands. The mattress is quite firm and does trap quite a bit of heat. 20 minutes after someone had gotten out of bed I could still feel where they had been lying.
 I was a little hesitant as I have not bought a mattress in quite a while, and this was my first foam mattress. I'll say that this has helped me through my recent back surgery and increased my ability to sleep longer and get more rest! Before the surgery, it decreased the insomnia I experienced just because of the comfort and how cool it kept me as I was sleeping.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend Tuft &amp; Needle as an affordable and wonderful new mattress for anyone searching around.
 Purchased this $750 King Mattress during Prime Day '18 for $560, which we thought was a pretty good deal.  Took AT LEAST a month to arrive after ordering, and less than 2 weeks in, both my wife and I's backs hurt more with this mattress than with our old worn-out queen we just got rid of!  Waking up at 3am on a workday because my back hurts is NOT my idea of a comfy mattress!  We are both primarily side-sleepers with the occasional back sleeping.  Beware fellow side/back sleepers!  This mattress may not be for you and chances are high we'll be returning it ASAP.  Hope this helps!
 After being miserable with the mattress we've had for many years, my chiropractor recommended Tuft and Needle.  He said that it was the best mattress he'd ever owned.  My husband and I had been shopping for mattresses for several weeks, and were really having a hard time finding one we loved, AND justifying the ridiculously high prices.  We decided to buy this mattress, and hope for the best.  I couldn't be more thrilled.  After the initial "getting used to a new mattress" phase, I've slept her better than I have in years.  My husband and I both agreed that we're also able to fall asleep faster, and sleep more deeply.  This just proves that you don't need to spend thousands on a mattress in order to get a high quality product
 This mattress was not for me, but I still think you should give it a shot because the return policy is great. My husband and I both had back problems with our old mattress...he has had back surgery on 5 discs in his back, and mine just hurt from the old mattress sinking in. He loved the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, and his back stopped hurting. Unfortunately, my back was a little sore at first. I tried to stick with it hoping I just needed to adjust, but it continually got worse until I finally started sleeping on the couch because I couldn’t take the pain. My husband continued to sleep like a baby. I’m giving the mattress 5 stars because it’s in good shape, it’s exactly what we ordered, and is apparently perfect for some people...just not me. The return policy is fantastic. I bought the mattress on 7/17/18, it was delivered on 7/25/18, and my order stated that I had until 11/2/18 to return it if needed, which is a full 100 days, as promised. You’ll need to call Amazon’s special handling department to make the return...don’t return it using the return button on your order or it will tell you to package your mattress, which is impossible and you don’t need to do. They make it incredibly easy, and we had a full refund the next day. According to Consumer Reports, only a very small percentage of people return their bed-in-a-box mattress, so it seems that most people are happy with their purchase, just like my husband. And since the return policy is great, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t give this a shot.
 Mattress is pretty firm, but highly comfortable. I'm 5' 9" 190 lbs., stomach sleeper and I don't sink very much maybe 1-2 inches. Wasn't any noticeable smell after a day of airing out. It helps me sleep cooler and better than my old Sterns and Foster mattress. I put on a Zinus platform bed frame to help in breath all the way around.
 I'm really glad I took the plunge. I'd spent about a month researching mattresses on "sleeptilimdead" and other bed reviewing websites of the like before deciding on Tuft and Needle. It was well worth the investment and I don't recall another sleep item that I fell so easily into.<br/><br/>Package came within three days. Unrolled like an exciting, floppy soft taco. DIdn't have much of a smell that I could discern and was easy to sleep on within a day. The fact it doesn't weight as much as a typical bed definitely makes for easier lifting and adjustment...in some cases. If you still need to drag this floppy taco anywhere (up a staircase, down a long hallway, etc) you may want help just due to its size and non-rigid demeanor.<br/><br/>I waited about three months to write this review just to really make sure I was enjoying the mattress. Needless to say: I'm very happy with this purchase, through and through. This mattress is stupid simple, I sleep soundly on it and when I have my SO on it, we don't wake each other up moving around in the middle of the night; the motion dampening is definitely a thing, and I almost feel like it's some fancy new technology of the 21st century after balefully sleeping on the same twin mattress for almost 10 years. I sleep on my side and prefer harder mattresses, but this appears to be a good medium range 'mattress hardness.'<br/><br/>It's funny. I've never had such an adult purchase that was as exciting as it was when I got it, but now is very...routine, but in a nice, stable way. What a great mattress! Super happy I didn't invest 1k in a Purple.<br/><br/>I'd recommend.
 I already had a twin T&amp;N mattress for guests who stayed over. Because I was getting an adjustable bed frame I decided to get a foam mattress in a box to replace my innerspring mattress &amp; box springs. I put the twin  T&amp;N mattress in the adjustable bed for a few nights to see how it was going to work and thought it was fine. I will say that the twin mattress seams to have a softer top layer than the queen mattress I received. (Not sure if that is because they have changed the formula or the twin has gotten a lot of use or what but I liked the softer top layer at first. I have now slept on the firmer queen mattress for a week and am now getting use to the firmer bed or maybe it is breaking in a little as well. Both beds work beautifully in the adjustable frame. Still not sure which one I like better.<br/><br/>It has been about 3 weeks now and I like the firmer bed better. The edges are a little sturdier and I am already very use to it.
 Was a little scared to buy a mattress in a box, especially without even trying it out. Nonetheless, I pulled the trigger and bought it and in 2 days had a huge HEAVY box sitting at my door.  Very first impression was, WOW!, and then actually sleeping on it is even better. I am a person who sleeps mostly on my back, this is a GREAT back sleeper mattress. I would say if your a side sleeper this MIGHT be a little firm, but I can't give you an honest answer on that. I definitely did not "sink-in" to this mattress, it has firmness and comfort in all areas. All in all this is a very comfortable mattress, my sleep has greatly improved less than a week of having it.
 I had purchased a Casper and loved it for our guest room. When we decided to replace our King I assumed we would just purchase another Casper. Upon researching reviews for the Casper we found the Tuft &amp; Needle side by side comparisons and decided what's the risk it seemed like this brand was a better value and maybe even a better product. I have been averaging around 2 hours extra since our new mattress arrived. The achy back I assumed was from a busy active day is no longer with me when I wake. I haven't woken up with that hot feeling like I used to in our old pillow top. Overall although we are in our first thirty days it feels wonderful my sleep has improved and I am confident we will continue to recommend!
 Delivery Issue: USPS refused to deliver to home saying it was too big.  (It really wasn't that bad)<br/><br/>First impression after one night:<br/>Pros: sleeps cool enough, very comfortable, good support, great for side sleeping, easy to roll over, woke up without back pain.  Dimensions run on the tall side which I like, perhaps 1.5" taller than the average queen.<br/>Con: only one now, the edge support is poor, meaning if you are near the edge you might feel like you're tipping over and off the bed.  I'm currently looking around for an aftermarket solution, but so far, ¡NO BUENO!<br/><br/>If T&amp;N addressed this I'm certain it would make the mattress notably more expensive and more difficult to ship ;(
 I have slept on a terrible mattress for twelve years because I screwed up buying a too soft mattress the last time when I was in pain. I got the runaround when I tried to return so I was too afraid to make the same mistake again.  I just lived with my terribly costly mistake.<br/><br/>I finally worked up the courage to try again,  mostly due to the fact that I have developed significant joint problems and I think my awful mattress was contributing if not causing the problem. I travel for work and get to try out a lot of mattressesi , some firmer than others, but in general hotel mattresses don't have the springs literally poking you in the shoulder blade. I started realizing that I usually felt better  until I got homes and slept again on mine. Time to do something.<br/><br/>I researched as best as I could, with my goal being to find a supportive mattress that is good for people with joint pain/shoulder pain who are  side sleepers, affordability, a good trial period with a simple return policy and  a d good customer satisfaction reviews.  I pray that my new mattress is the right fit,  because I am really suffering and need the right balance of support but without painful pressure. So here goes.<br/><br/>I  just received my two twin xls that I plan to push together use on a king sized pedic sure platform bed frame.( it has slightly arched slats to substitute a box spring) I would have preferred an adjustable split king but I'm trying to not blow the bank yet. I may just go for it if I continue to have to fiddle with body pillows everywhere .<br/><br/>The delivery was seamless.  I splurged on the 2 day delivery so that i could ensure i was home when my mattresses arrived. FedEx brought them at 9am, and before I could ask him whether or not I could tip him to carry them downstairs to my apartment door, he was already doing it. Thank Gods for him! Way to go Fedex!<br/><br/>Opened easily, being careful with the scissors and the two twins are currently expanding on my king sized frame.  I will wait at least 12 hours to lie on it to allow for correct expansion. I will say,  .the gap between the two twins seems bigger than I would see on European kings which are always two singles pushed together.  Maybe it will get better as they expand.<br/><br/>As for the smell some people mentioned,  I have to say as an asthmatic,  I find  there to be  no noticeable odor, zero, that  I can detect. I am relieved about that.<br/><br/>The mattress covers  seem nice and soft, but I am already concerned at the level of give in the actual mattresses. They  seem way too soft right off the bat.  I was under the impression that the T&amp;N mattresses are supposed to be medium-firm(  a 6 or 7). I weigh 200 and am a side sleeper.  I don't know if this will be firm enough.  In any case , I am going to give it a go. I just hope that if it really is too soft,  that T&amp;N's return policy is as painless as they advertise.  For now, I look forward to my first night on a new mattress and hope this solves my bed dilemma. I will update after a couple of months.
 I'm a side sleeper and this mattress is too firm for me, I'm 5'07'' 170lbs and my shoulders hurt when I wake up. My 100 nights trial is almost up and talking to my wife we think we need to return it. Will contact the company in a few days...<br/><br/>On the other hand, the materials and construction of the bed is really good quality, I really wanted to keep this mattress :(
 I want to update this review later, but here are my thoughts: is it normal for me to wake up every morning with both of my arms asleep? It is unexplainable but has been happening for the week I’ve had this mattress. I’m not even sleeping on my arms or in a weird position in anyway. I’m not sure what to do, the idea of returning the mattress is forboding. I also love how it is made in the USA and it’s a transparent company.<br/>It is very firm, but my last memory foam mattress was probably firmer. Other than my arms falling asleep mysteriously I have been sleeping really well. Maybe tuft and needle can help me out with the sleeping arms mystery.
 You know that feeling when all you can think about all day is getting home, putting your kid to bed, and crawling into bed so you can finally have the tension and worry leached out of your body by your angel baby mattress? If not, you clearly don’t have a T&amp;N.<br/><br/>My husband and I had been “enjoying” that special closeness that comes when you can’t help but roll into each other and bump booties in the great chasm of a worn-out spring mattress when I finally clicked “Add to cart.”<br/><br/>I feel like I need to apologize to my old self for all those crappy nights of sleep. I’m sorry, old me. You didn’t know better and will one day see the light. It gets better.<br/><br/>As for the mattress, it’s magical. I don’t feel my husband move in the middle of the night. It’s comfy when I’m sidesleeping, tummy sleeping, or back sleeping.<br/><br/>If you’ve been debating for a while, just buy the dang thing and try it out. Their 100-day trial makes it a no-brainer. Plus, you know you want angel baby sleep, too.
 This is, hands down, the best purchase I’ve made in ages. I was really nervous about buying a mattress online. I decided to go with Tuft and Needles because I’m a sucker for good customer service, and this company had some rave reviews. I did a ton of research, and ultimately decided to buy from T and N instead of Casper because of the customer service reviews. Both company’s had good product reviews, but T and N had better customer service ratings. It also helped that they were about $200 cheaper. In any case, I now have my mattress, and it’s the most comfortable thing ever. It’s not too soft or firm, and it has that memory foam feel on top. I am exceedingly please with how quickly I got it, how easily it unpacked, and how quickly it formed. We’ll see how it lasts the test of time, but it’s started out with a bang! Love it!
 Very Comfy, I cannot say enough good things about this mattress. It changed my quality of sleep drastically after my back adjusted to it. It's firm but gives in a very satisfying way. I've been sleeping on it for five months now and have never looked back to my inner- spring. Please give it about 2 weeks before you judge it if you have back problems like I do, you need some time to get used to the way it supports you. But in no time you'll be waking up so much more refreshed and rested. It has an interesting odor when you first get it out of the bag, but that goes away in a day or two. Also, make sure you unbag it and let it relax for a few hours before sleeping on it. I think the directions mention it, but it needs time after shipping to reform to its full height.
 Delivered to your door, but Tuft and Needle.  Any size mattress you desire.  So much better every typical mattress.  Forget mattress stores,  try this,  we did, and have never looked back.  We have two twin XL;s as we were using a split king.  Amazing and comfortable, just the right amount of support,  could not believe how easy to set up.  Just try it.  Not hot, not cold,  all of that memory foam junk, and individual hard wired coils and wood, is not needed, just Tuft and Needle.  They have a 100% money back guarantee so very hard to say no.  Ships direct to your house or apt by UPS, FED EX etc,  free freight,  unbelievable, until you end up believing.  Its the real deal, and its a good one.
 It felt like Christmas when my new bed came! My old bed was lumpy and had that dreaded dip in the middle.<br/><br/>The first night was like sleeping on a cloud, it was so comfortable! Then add in a mini me and a significant other and nothing made this bed cooler. It is fall here in MN, even with with a window cracked in 20 oddsome degree nights did not made this better. Spent an extra $100 dollars on a ‘cooling’ mattress pad and I still felt like a middle age woman going through menopause. I’m a little disappointed I am not 5 lbs lighter due to the sweat I produced night after night 😕<br/><br/>I wanted to love this bed, but unless I’m going to get a perk of sweating this much in my sleep, I need to try another bed!
 Updated review: after using mattress for almost two years, it slopes towards the sides and the foam has lost its elasticity. It now sags and give me a neck ache if I lie on my back, or if I am on my sides, it hurts my hips and makes my arms fall asleep. I regret buying this mattress, but cannot afford to replace, so I lie there, night after night, hating it.<br/><br/>========================================================<br/>Soft and good when sleeping on my back, sides, etc. Only complaint is the sides tend to mush down and one might awaken on the floor in the middle of the night. I find myself tensing my body and using body pillows to brace, etc., so I don't roll off. Not the easiest rest, but my husband loves it so I cope. I would have sent it back if he didn't love it. I recommend if you sleep with a partner, go up one size from your regular mattress to avoid the sloping sides.
 Fantastic bed. I was in a department store looking for a firm memory foam bed and found one I loved but it was $2000. I read online about the new boom of ship to home matress businesses and read reviews. I chose Tuft and Needle for the reviewes said it was more o the firm side vs the competitors.  I am so happy I bought it. It is med-firm I would say. Just the right amount of softness with the right amount of support. I am 6' 220lbs and I do not sink, my spine is striaght and only my shoulder and hip dip down. I am a side sleeper with neck and back soreness and this took care of my back, and a new pillow took care of my neck.<br/><br/>My wife is 5'2" 115 and she likes a more medium bed and for her she loves it also. It is not to firm.<br/><br/>They reccomend letting sit without sheets for 3 hours before sleeping to full inhale all the air, which we did, and tuft and needle said in about a week it will break in a little more.  I am glad I called for this 3 hour reccomendation is not in the instructions.<br/><br/>However, no smell and a couple hours like other memory foam.<br/><br/>Also for those who say they dont want a firm bed, memory foam beds to last for the longterm should be med-firm to last over the years in my opinion.<br/><br/>I am glad i got this tuft and needle bed, the price is fantastic. Budget price but definitely not a budget bed, feels the same as the $2000 i wanted, and it has a nice zipper matress cover also.  t<br/><br/>Oh this bed is not hot, it does not trap in you heat like others, i did not have a wet back when i woke up.<br/><br/>AWESOME
 I have to start off by saying my husband and I really love this mattress.  And we are VERY impressed with the quality, and quickness of delivery from Amazon.  But it is proving to firm for us.  We are both side sleepers, and although it seems like we sleep well on it, I have started having serious neck and shoulder issues, and my husband is having back issues.  We even went back to our old mattress since we hadn't gotten rid of it, but it is WAY worse, so we are going back to our T&amp;N mattress, but will probably need to return it.  We are 4 weeks in to our 100 days.  I also have tried every pillow known to man (it seems like it anyway) trying to see if it is a pillow issue.<br/><br/>Pros-Very well made<br/>sleeps cool<br/><br/>Cons<br/>I would say it is to firm for side sleepers.<br/><br/>I hope that the Tuft &amp; Needle Company continues to grow.  It's not often that you find companies nowadays that cares about their product or customer service.
 So...I had a ridiculously expensive Serta memory foam  mattress - I think we paid $3500 for it - and loved it, until it developed weak spots, as all mattresses do over time. Now my knees and hips hurt again. Time for a new mattress. In the intervening years since we bought the Serta, all these online mattress start-ups came into being. Were they quality? They were pretty cheap - were they worth a try? If a $3,500 Serta was only going to last five years, did I want to spend $3,500 every five years just to get decent sleep? After reading dozens of reviews, researching how these mattresses are made, and researching various companies (Lull, Lessa, Ghostbed, Purple, Nectar...), I made the decision to try a Tuft and Needle mattress - here's why: It's an American company and the mattresses are made in Arizona (unlike Nectar, which is based in the U.S., but manufactured in China - haven't we all had enough of substandard Chinese production? - Also, Nectar had dozens of delivery and customer service complaints in their reviews, and it appears they aren't honoring their lifetime warranty). After reading information on how these mattresses are made, Tuft and Needle's bottom layer met the recommended foam density and thickness, and its top layer did, also. In addition, Tuft and Needle is the only company that uses a top layer of foam/gel combination they invented. Tuft and Needle is also constantly tweaking its formula based on customer feedback - and it's been in business longest of the online start-ups. So, when early customers said the mattress was a little too firm, they improved it. By the way, I think they've perfected it. I lie down on this mattress and my poor, messed up back thinks it's sleeping on a cloud. I love it! But, the final factor that made me try Tuft and Needle? All the other companies were started by people already in the mattress biz (they know the biz, they know how to cut corners, they know how to mark the price up). Tuft and Needle was started by two software guys from Silicon Valley who literally had to learn the biz from the foundation up. Did I want to buy a mattress from smarmy ex-mattress company execs - or from guys trying to make a decent mattress, at a fair price, while employing Americans? Tuft and Needle it was. I have a 10-year warranty and from my experience so far, fully expect the company to honor it, if needed - and it's not a prorarted warranty, by the way. Delivery was prompt, set up was easy. Most importantly, I find this mattress very comfortable and certainly worth its $700 price for Cal King. They offer 100 nights to sleep on it and they'll refund your money if you hate it. Personally, I think you'll love it. I knew in 60 seconds of lying on it that I loved it, and one night sleeping on it sealed the deal. Good luck in your quest for good sleep - and I hope you try Tuft and Needle. You really have nothing to lose.
 Wow! After 25 yrs on a memory foam mattress, I was leery of buying any other kind of mattress...and you can't really get a good feel for what it will be like to sleep on something after "testing" it in a store for 5 minutes!  After reading numerous product reviews for several types of mattresses (one reason I didn't get another of what I've had for so long), I bit the bullet and ordered the Tuft &amp;Needle mattress.  I was hopeful (good reviews) but skeptical that something that comes out of a box looking like a huge hot dog bun could be comfortable.  My first night, I immediately noticed the way the mattress seems to "hug" me. Without sinking down into it, I felt cushioned and well-supported.  I have pain issues with my back, shoulders, and hips.  Most of that is gone after sleeping on this mattress. I'm not saying it's a miracle cure--I still have pain--but I have a lot less of it lately with the good support this mattress provides. I love this mattress and will buy it again, as needed, after the warranty is done.  We have to coin a new word--something that means Comfortable X 10!  I am absolutely flabbergasted at how this mattress feels--and how good I feel in the mornings!  And I guess we shouldn't forget about price.  It was a lot less expensive than comparable products, and T&amp;N graciously allowed amazon customers the same 100-night test period for returns.  I deliberately waited those 100 nights to make sure...but I am.  I'm in love with this purchase!
 A year and a half ago I bought two new mattresses, one for the house and one for the RV. Made by two different companies, I put the more expensive of the two, made by Tuft and Needle, in the house. The Tuft and Needle mattress is not uniformly firm and the sides of the mattress are weak...to the point that I am afraid to get too close to the edge for fear of rolling out of bed. I also realized that I began having back and joint pain as I found the T&amp;N mattress too soft and without necessary support. It became clear that the less expensive mattress made by a different company that I put in the RV was uniformly firm and gave me a more comfortable night's sleep. Stubborn as I am, it took me this long to order another mattress for the bed in the house from the less expensive company. I DO like it that there are companies now offering alternatives to the very expensive memory foam mattresses.
 I was very hesitant to purchase this product, especially after reading some negative reviews about this mattress and all shrink-packed and shipped foam mattresses. After a few moths of sleeping on it, however, It has worked wonder. I am a large man (6'4", 285 lbs), and it still supports me completely and allows me to get a restful sleep. I saw complaints about "sleeping warm" but have no experienced this. This sleeps cooler than the spring mattress it replaced.
 I honestly have nothing terrible to say about this mattress. Being the broke college student that I am, I found the price of this mattress to be very affordable and was one of the main reasons why I selected this mattress. I watched many YouTube reviews on the matress carefully and took notes on what to expect. The matresss arrived BEFORE estimated (bonus), the set up was easy, and overall very comfy. Many reviews tell you that this mattress will produce a smell once you set it up, however, I did not find any smell.  Even more reviews say that this mattress is firmer than the reviewer likes which I would like to focus on. I have been sleeping on this mattress for a week no with no problems whatsoever. I have slept on every mattress you could think of from rock solid to a marshmallow. I could have not asked for a better feel while sleeping. This mattress is firm yet soft at the same time! Which I find very enjoyable. I would for sure recommend that anyone looking for something affordable and wonderful should buy this mattress. And the best part? The 100 day garuntee and the 10 YEAR WARRANTY!
 My husband was having numbness in his legs and we both tossed and turned all night with other various body aches on our old mattress which by the way, cost over $3000!!!  After reading all the reviews on Amazon about Tuft and Needle plus the warranty and return option, we thought we'd give it a try and are we glad we did!!!!  No more numbness for my husband and we both sleep very peacefully!  Truly an outstanding product!!!
 A friend recommended this mattress.  I was afraid it wouldn't be "squishy" enough as she stated it was firmer than other memory foam mattresses.  I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a month and I am in love!  It gives enough to cradle my recently replaced hip but isn't so soft that I have to struggle to get out of the bed.  I do have the mattress atop a set of box springs because I wanted the bed to be a little taller than it would have been with just the platform frame.  I do wish there were handles on the sides.
 Nice bed. Tuff &amp; Needle is soft and easy to sleep on. It’s hard to review the comfort level on this or any mattress because each person has their own preferences. But so far everyone that tried this mattress liked it. I have it set up in my basement for guests. I also like that the material is made in the USA and environmentally friendly. The price is fair.
 I purchased this mattress and a bed frame for it in September of 2017. The mattress has been extremely comfortable, stayed cool through hot Louisiana summer nights and has simply been a great companion thus far. However, the mattress developed flat spots, or areas where the foam doesn't seem to have any rebound or cussion where are backs lay while we sleep. Even after rotating the mattress at the six month period these flat areas never recovered. Now the other end of the bed is developing these same compressed areas causing back and shoulder discomfort. Neither of us are particularly large individuals, I am 6'3" 220Lb so perhaps I am on the larger end of the scale and my wife is 5'2" and more than 100 pounds lighter than myself however her side of the bed succumbed to the same issue. The bed has been wonderful, but we are replacing it with a different brand. $600 for a queen size bed is inexpensive, however it's still $600 on something that only lasted a year. As a final note if you spill anything, or even have significant night sweats. This bed is extremely difficult to dry due to its open cell foam. It's basically a dish sponge, so take off the cover and compress it as much as you can with a towel. After spilling some water we have found that the mattress would not dry on its own even with the protective cover removed and a fan applied
 Arrived quickly.  Smelled pretty bad out of the bag, but two days airing out in my garage and while it 'smells new' it isn't terrible.  Comfort wise, I'd say firmer than memory foam, but much softer than any other foam mattress I've had.  My other bed is a serta sleeper than was a _lot_ more money, but over time developed a big of a sag in the middle.<br/><br/>When I first sat down on it, I thought it would be too soft to sleep on - but when your weight is distributed it is the right about of sinking in for me (large adult 200lbs+).  The second thing I noticed is that it does breathe really well, it doesn't get hot like the memory foam topper I tried.<br/><br/>My advice, get one for a guest room to try it out.  You will end up buying another.
 I do less tossing and turning with this mattress in a box. I do suffer from arthritis so I probably toss more than usual. When we received the mattress we unfurled it and let it set for three days before sleeping on it. After about a week and a half we found it to be a little to firm  We added a 3" egg shell pad and a mattress cover to hold it in place. I fall asleep faster. I like not having to feel the uneven support of a coil mattress. The price was right and I feel it was a good deal. The  mattress is on a adjustable base and had no problem. As of yet no problems, we will see after a year how well it holds up.
 This bed is amazing!  I got one about a month ago (replaced a traditional queen with the twin XL, which I was a little nervous about) and use it with a motorized frame (kind of like the old Craftmatics back in the day).  The mattress is VERY firm, but not uncomfortably so - it did take a couple of days to get used to it, but then it was incredible.  When I received it, unpacking it was very simple - but I'd say if you go larger than a twin to have two people set it up as it a: inflated very quickly once I cut the inner bag and b: was heavy enough to flip over on my own.  I've been sleeping very, very well since I ordered this.  Since it was so firm and I was going from a pillowtop mattress WITH a topper on it, I did order a 2" foam topper to go with it and now it's perfect.  Great mattress, reasonable price!
 This mattress is AMAZING. I compared it head to head with another foam "ship to your door" mattress company (Nectar), and T&amp;N is by far the best product coupled with MUCH BETTER customer service... don't get me started about Nectar's HORRIBLE customer service. The main difference is that this mattress is bouncy and light feeling, while competitors are dense and take a second or two to compress, causing pressure points in my opinion. To illustrate this, if you stand on the T&amp;N mattress and fall straight forward onto your torso, the impact is soft and comfortable. However, if you do the same on a Nectar or other denser foams, it literally knocks the breath out of you. This, however, does not imply that it is super soft like a pillow top... I am not a fan of overly soft mattresses. The top layer is bouncy and light, giving comfort without the lack of support that a pillow top brings. The second base layer is a denser foam that gives great support and density. It I enjoy each night's sleep on this mattress and couldn't be happier. I did all the research and had no idea which to choose while browsing online. I am so glad I chose T&amp;N. I can assure you, this is the correct choice.
 I cannot tell you how much I love these mattresses! I bought two for my home away from home while I am on a temporary job assignment. They are without question the most comfortable mattresses I have slept on.<br/><br/>At home I sleep on a firm mattress with a 2 inch memory foam topper AND a feather topper. I love my bed at home! I assumed that I would need the feather topper on this to make it comfy--my hips and shoulders are 57 years old and don't do well on extra firm mattresses.<br/><br/>But these are amazing. Perfectly firm for my taste and soft enough that there are no pressure points. They are firm enough to sit on as well--I have two twin beds in a day bed set up, and these mattresses are firm enough that I can sit on them and read or work on my laptop.<br/><br/>I had tried other memory foam beds and found them too warm and I melted into them. But this is really perfect. I'm sold and when I get back home I'm replacing my bed there with one as well. With the warranty you simply can't beat this since if you try it and don't agree you can send it back.
 I started with a Casper given that it was rated the highest out of all the foam mattresses. I had shoulder and hip pain for two months after getting one. I tried to put my old mattress topper to help and nothing could. I decided to try the Tuft and Needle as it was the cheapest and I could save some money, but I assumed that I would also hate this mattress. It forms to my body perfectly. As an athlete, I have strong legs, shoulders and a tiny waist. My waist would always sink low to the mattress and often hurt my back. I’d have to put a small pillow under my waist at my side to keep my back straight. This mattress fixes all of that. I sleep on my side and on my back - this mattress does wonders for both.
 Let me start this by saying that while I originally bought this mattress on Amazon, I ended up cancelling and buying directly from T&amp;N because Im local to them and they were able to get me the mattress same day (which is super awesome) when amazon had me waiting 6 days to get it through them. Although I'd give a lesser star review based on that alone,  the quality of this mattress definitely makes up for it.<br/><br/>The spring mattress we had before this was a hand me down from my brother, it travelled with me from high school, to college, to several apartments, and finally to our home. This mattress was nothing special. Hard but unsupportive, often leaving us with achy backs and hips, not to mention it was a FULL size and covered in mysterious stains. It was awful. After curiously looking at its law tag one day, we realized that the mattress was manufactured in 1998...thats right, this bed that we've been sleeping on was 20 years old! It was time to go. I quickly realized mattress shopping was a truly daunting task. So many options. We went to a furniture warehouse and laid on as many spring mattresses as we could find, not impressed with any of them. A couple of them that were okay were well over $1000. We also tried serveral foam mattress and found them way too squishy and soft. Hours were spent online doing as much research as possible and that even proved to be tricky because you cant always tell if what you're seeing is sponsered by a company or not. We were beyond frustrated. Of course when researching, the results were littered with bed-in-box foam options and, not going to lie,  I was VERY sceptical. How can a king sized mattress that is firm enough to support but supple enough to comfort fit in a box that will be delivered to my door and not cost an arm and a leg? It didn't make any sense but I decided to give it a shot.  As you probably are aware of by now (considering you're reading amazon reviews for a foam mattress) there are many companies that offer bed-in-box options. How do you choose a bed you've never even laid on? There were a couple things that stood out to us about Tuft &amp; Needle that ultimately helped us make our decision. First off, they're local to me, based out of Phoenix, AZ and I'm all for supporting local businesses. Second, I found nothing but rave reviews about their customer service (which after calling to order, I can attest to). Being in the customer service field myself, this is very important to me. A product is only as good as the service that comes with it. And lastly, everything I read about the T&amp;N mattress stated that it is one of the firmest of its kind which we were definitely wanting.  So we did it. Made the decision. After all, what did we really have to lose? We have 100 nights to test this out and if we don't like it,  it'll get picked up and donated to a shelter (how cool is that?!). The mattress arrived same day (again, through T&amp;N directly, not amazon) and I was able to quickly set it up myself. There was no funky smell and it fully expanded within minutes. After fully expecting to wait a couple days to sleep on it from stuff I've read (which I thought I read on the T&amp;N website but maybe not) I recieved a delivery confirmation with FAQs from the company stating it could be slept on right away,  so thats what I did. Its been 2 nights so far and I am impressed. I thought for sure Id be waking up sunk in a few inches from where I started but that hasn't been the case whatsoever, it is remarkably supportive. Before yesterday and today, I honestly cant remeber the last time Ive woken up without back pain. The difference is truly remarkable. Of course 2 nights is nothing in the scheme of mattress life, but I look forward to updating this review a few months down the road. Do yourself a favor and stop searching. Give this mattress a chance, you wont be disappointed (and even if you are, T&amp;N will take care of you and your mattress will go to someone in need, win win!)
 I decided to wait before submitting a review on this mattress and see how it goes for a few months.  For my wife the mattress transition was not easy.  She kept complaining about not being comfortable in the bed, but I'm largely attributing this to her being pregnant, having kids, and not having time to take care of herself in terms of exercise to work some of the pains away.  In my opinion the timing of the mattress change coincided with other changes happening which added up to a problem, but it was wrongly attributed to the mattress.  A few months after having the baby, and being thoroughly sleep deprived, she forgot all about her initial complaints and now can't wait to crawl into bed.<br/><br/>For me the new mattress has been perfect, I hate really soft mattresses and this one is just right.
 We purchased this mattress (queen) last May 2017 and did so based on the reviews.  We already had a boxspring so we did not purchase a new "base".  It has a definite low point in the in the middle which makes it hard to sleep.  We have rotated the mattress several times since we purchased it (and we are not overweight that this should be happening).  It also seems as if it holds alot of heat which is something we did not want and didn't think this mattress would be hot based on the reviews.  Not really sure what to do at this point since it's been over a year.  Wondering if a topper that others have talked about would help?  Pretty sure we would NOT purchase again.  Will probably have to buy another mattress since these types of mattresses seem to run hot.
 I slept thru a 4.4 earthquake, (good thing/bad thing?)<br/>After reading many reviews and it was listed number 3 in CR magazine. And it was a black friday special, the price was just right.<br/>Have been sleeping on this mattress since Dec 26, had a very peaceful sleep the frist night and still getting a peaceful sleep. I degas the mattress for a day, the bag it was in smell worse.<br/>I was a bit nervous about it being too firm, but just like Goldilocks, it's just right.<br/>I also like the fact that I can put it on top of my current box spring. A big plus, because it means a small change in the bedroom. Not ready for a modern bedroom theme.<br/>All in all I have been very satisfied with this.
 Updated 06.20.18<br/><br/>Throwing in the towel on the mattress. After 6 months of usage, the mattress is just not working for us. The mattress became soft and sinks with no support to our backs. We wake up with backaches. Definitely not the right mattress for us and will not be the right one for my child.<br/><br/>Decided to by this for my child's twin bed and after couple weeks of using it, I am not impressed with the quality. First of all,  the mattress is very bouncy/soft, I was looking for something firmer. Some of the reviewers says it's medium firm but I can't agree with that. If you put your weight on the edge of the bed, you roll off it easily. There is not match support on the edge of the beds. The bed did expand quickly and to the measurements it stated.
 If you are a heavy weight person like me,220 pounds don't bother . I never had back pain in my life and every morning after sleeping on this mattress I have back pain . This mattress is not made for heavy people , it's only good for very thunk people . Also , I'm having trouble returning it because I need to fold it and air vac it to ship which is nearly impossible to do . I'm frustrated , don't know what do do and Amazon didn't help much when it comes to return it !!!<br/>Please don't buy !!!
 The mattress is well-constructed and appears to be made of high-quality materials.  We tried it out for a week and found that while there was some give in the materials, it was just too firm for us.  Based on other reviews on Amazon we were really hoping that it would have more give than our current Serta pillow top, but it was much firmer.  After about a week the mattress still had not softened to the point where it was comfortable for us, so we decided to return it.  The Tuft and Needle folks were very nice and promptly process our request for a refund.  If you are looking for a firm mattress, this would be an excellent choice of an American-made product from an honest company.
 Stop wasting your time researching it and BUY IT. After three kids, my wife had lower back pain issues for the better part of three years. We've been sleeping on the T&amp;N mattress for almost a month now and I haven't heard a peep about her desperately needing a massage or a trip to the chiropractor. In short, this mattress will pay for itself and I'll be turn a profit soon.<br/>No odors, easy to setup, no special sheets, and it's cool to watch it expand from the packaging. It's a firm support with a "pillowy" top layer feel.<br/>Now, stop reading this and other wonderful reviews about this game changer of a mattress and buy it already. Do it, do it now.
 We bought this mattress after we heard an ad on a Dave Ramsey podcast. We buy whatever Dave tells us to, and he hasn't disappointed us yet. This mattress is definitely fabulous. It came in a box, albeit a very heavy box, and grew to full size in under a minute. It says to give it 2-4 hours to fully expand, but I'd say it would've been sleepable immediately. I slept on a Tempurpedic for years. A king Tempurpedic was about $3k, which is insane. To me, this is more comfortable. It has a bit of bounce while also having all the benefits of memory foam (contouring, lack of movement transfer). I have rheumatoid arthritis and loved my Tempurpedic for sleeping as it took pressure off my joints. The T&amp;N feels FANTASTIC against my tired, aching joints without putting any pressure on them. Bottom line, there is a reason it's the highest rated mattress in the world, and it is a fantastic price. Buy it! The end.<br/><br/>1 year update: I sleep so much better on the T&amp;N mattress than any other bed.  I continue to love it and have recommended it to many friends and family.  Best mattress ever!
 This mattress would very comfortable, but much to my surprise, it is just TOO HOT. I wake up drenched in sweat every night, which is very surprising as prior to this mattress I slept with my heated mattress pad on 9 months out of the year. I contacted the company and at their suggestion switched out the mattress protector to what is supposed to be a breathable one, but it has not helped the temperature of the bed at all. I'm now working with Amazon to get a refund. It is looking like I won't have an issue getting my money back, but Amazon also won't help me donate this mattress so now I'm left to figure out what to do with it on my own, which is not cool.
 Only about a month in and so far, I'm satisfied. Inflated to full size. No crazy smell. The bed is firm but still comfortable. My husband is about 210 and is in construction so his body takes a beating and he says the mattress is good on the body. No additional discomfort after a nights rest. Package arrived quick and with no damage at all. Will update after a few more months of use.<br/><br/>6 months in. No sagging or obvious wear. Feels the same as when we got it.
 Initially felt to firm, my back wasn't used to it...however it has become incredibly  comfortable...took about 3 weeks...and I must say sex is much better on this mattress than on my old 1300 dollar Serta pillow top...this mattress  is excellent really...paid 1300 dollars for serta in 2005. ...575 for this 11 yes later...
 I purchased this mattress and loved it.  Its relatively firm but compared to my Simmons Beauty rest its hands down a much better bed.  I was sinking into my old bed too much and constantly having lower back pain.  The only issue was it was a little firmer than I would like especially by my shoulder as I am a side sleeper.  I sent the customer service an email and they said they would send me a free mattress topper to add just a little bit more padding.  I was very happy with the customer service and its quite refreshing to see a company that actually cares about doing whatever it takes to make sure your happy with your purchase.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and company to anyone looking for a new bed.  The company made me feel very comfortable with my purchase and went above and beyond to make my experience top notch. BTW if your a stomach sleeper this bed is PERFECT.
 OMG!!! I wish to hug the makers of this INCREDIBLE mattress!!! If you are like me and have paid SUPER HIGH prices on more popular name brand mattresses over the years, my last mattress being the rolls royce of mattresses (not sure if I can point fingers for WAY overpriced memory foam, so I won't) but don't feel bad when you have actually discovered that we were suckered. Tuft &amp; Needle is the answer to an affordable, fairly priced, quality and comfortable mattress. I used to think the higher the price, the better the mattress. UNTRUE! I read the reviews before purchasing this mattress and frankly any review that isn't stellar, cannot be speaking of this mattress or this sleep friendly and economically conscious company. I also read about the company and the owners and it is a no-nonsense impressive bit of info. Im writing this review after only ONE night of sleep and this is my first review. Won't be my last. I purchased a bed and mattress (separately, of course) and the awesome bed assembly team came and they also kindly unwound the shrink wrapped mattress. I read the reviews that it would pop into place after the wrapping was off but I was still "unsure." It's true. It does within mere seconds of opening. fascinating to watch. Careful using the knife. I noticed the guy pointing it upwards to unwrap and not down as to not tear into it even accidentally.<br/>Now, let me give you some technical aspect reviews of this mattress:<br/>1. It's surprisingly comfortably FIRM yet conforming. Its like memory foam meets firm controlled foam. I read in other reviews it took 48 hours or more to settle into its firmness. Mine seemed to hold strong right away within 30-1 hour. I think. I crashed on it pretty fast after happily rolling around on it for the first 15 minutes.<br/>2. It DOES NOT SMELL. There are no harsh chemicals that many mattresses can have. Especially ones that are made in other countries. I have no prejudices against import export but sometimes the chemical nature of assembling, packing and shipping internationally, is just a smelly reality of products that can have a somewhat toxic fume. This mattress doesn't. Just smells NEW! made in the USA.<br/>3. I have a toddler who did the BOUNCE TEST this morning. Held strong didn't sink oddly. I look forward to lets just say, other types of adult bouncing ;)<br/>4. FITS onto the bed nicely. With the whole shrink wrap thing, you would think there may be some misshaping. Nope! maintains its shape throughout the entire 4 corners of the bed. When you sit on the edge, it does dip down but for resting it holds firmly.<br/>5. EXCELLENT NIGHT OF SLEEP. My back is an issue and finding the right mattress has been a challenge over the years. Hence, the top line several thousand dollar purchase. With this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, my problem back not only felt good but also as if I’m on the right track to healing. Rivals the best hotel experience. I can't believe this is my everyday bed. I honestly feel lucky!<br/>Listen to me mattress seeker!!!!... Although I LOVE Amazon, It wasn't my go to for mattress purchase. Couldn't conceive of that but considered it after finding a beautiful looking affordable bed, which will be my next review. I will say I was reluctant to buy a mattress on Amazon and not from a direct retailer. Wrong thinking! Amazon is awesome for providing the community of buying and selling with such great pricing and diverse product options. Also, If you are a hesitant mattress purchaser like myself and happen to be fortunate enough to stumble across this mattress, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE to purchase it. You will not be disappointed. You will sleep well. You will awake refreshed. Your back will thank you. You will finally like me feel you have made the right purchase. I'm a happy mattress buyer. Finally!!! Time to bounce!
 I absolutely love this mattress.  I like a firm mattress and this mattress is firm, but it is still really comfy.  I also like the fact that when my dogs jump on the bed or someone sits on the mattress, there is very little transfer of movement.  It was easy to order, it came when expected and arrived at my door in a box.  Easy to get out of box and put on the foundation, fluffed up quickly and was ready to sleep on within a few minutes.  I can't say enough about the quality and comfort of this bed.  The price blows away most other mattress in this size.  It is a really great mattress and the company offers a great warranty and stands behind their product.  I will definitely purchase another one for my guest bedroom.  I have been telling many of my friends about this mattress.  I am soooooooooo glad I did my research and discovered Tuft and Needle.  If you prefer a more firm mattress and don't want to spend a fortune on a mattress...you should check this one out.  I don't think you will be disappointed!
 I have always had major issues falling asleep, and lumbar pain was severe due to a poor form deadlift... long story short I can sleep any which way I want on this bed and the back pain is significantly diminished from where it was prior to purchase. The bed doesn’t lose form, and I knock out so fast on it and sleep deeply. Lastly, I don’t get super hot like I did on my ex’s Tempur Pedic. I’m picky, but I have no complaints about this bed. The bed has worked to relieve my back pain, quicken my falling asleep while allowing me to enter deeper sleep states.
 This mattress is very nice and was a great price. My concern with it is that it's very firm--which in itself isn't a problem. I prefer a very firm mattress. Yet this mattress has no contouring. It doesn't shape to your form to reduce joint pressure. We had an extra firm mattress for years that was perfectly supportive yet memory molded to your form, so that pressure was taken off the lower back, hips, and knees. Sadly, that manufacturer doesn't exist anymore, and the jury is still out on whether a plush mattress topper will remedy the concerns with this mattress.
 I really did my home work on this one.  Wanted a brand name mattress ( T. P.) but it was so expensive I thought NO WAY.  Scared us to death when in showed up at our door in such a small compact box that my husband said maybe we should think about sending it back without opening it.  I have space bags so know about shrink wrap.  Opened it, it expanded, and we gave it 72 hours before putting it on the bed just like suggested.  I can not tell you what a great, comfortable mattress this is.  It's like sleeping in a cloud.  No more stiffness or soreness when waking up.  And sleeping thru the night.  The idea that this is a small start up company and they only sell one mattress and making it the best possible product without all the different prices and qualities of product was really impressive.  Of course Best Seller from Amazon didn't hurt either.  We love this mattress and would suggest it to all size people.
 Love the medium-firm feel, love the value, love the hassle-free experience overall, love the idea of the company origin and operating credo.  We bought the King.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is that, for me, it is just a touch too firm for those nights when I sleep on my side. To be fair, I've only been on it for a week or so and I may just need to become more accustomed to it. It's not terrible, it is acceptable, but back sleeping and belly-sleeping are really top notch, and so by comparison, the side experience seems to be something less, for me anyway.  Otherwise, pressure relief in other positions, edge support, motion isolation, and sleep temperature are easily on par with mattresses costing three or four times as much.<br/><br/>We will very likely buy Tuft &amp; Needle for our kids college mattresses within the next year.
 I wanted to like this mattress after reading so many happy reviews. After waiting for over a week, the mattress didn’t fully inflate evenly. The mid section was high and top and bottom dipped. The mattress is very hard to lay on and there was minimal edge support. Customer service was great. I called amazon and asked for special handling department who arrange for UPS to pickup the next business day. The only catch is that you need to box the mattress up yourself.  I folded the mattress in half and used my own cardboard to make a box for the mattress and LOTS of packaging tape.
 So having the mattress for a couple months now I can say it’s not a bad mattress, but it’s not all great people say it is. If your a side sleeper KEEP LOOKING! Because this mattress is not for you.  Don’t get me wrong it’s not a bad mattress but I sometimes do sleep on my side and every time  I do my arm loose circulation in which I toss and turn  . I originally wanted to get the purple mattress- but it’s very pricey and they came out with new models and cost a buck load! So I settled with this. So can’t blame no one but myself.<br/><br/>1 yr later. This mattress is horrible! My god it’s crap. You can def feel other people move, side sleeping sucks, it feels to stiff. I’m 180lb and it feels like I’m sleeping on the floor. Never again.
 I come from a sleep number bed to the Queen Tuff&amp;Needle mattress. I was worried about the mattress would be to hot in Honolulu.I was very impressed as to how small when it came.Make sure you cut the plastic Intel you double chech you have the right side up. and positioned where you want to put it.Start at the top from one side to the other. It was fun just to watch it come alive.now start pulling down the plastic until you have it off.Now I should of kept the plastic to put the old mattress in it. I made the bed and it looks great.My wife and I couldnt sleep on bed that came with the apt.My wife was having issues with pain in her hips and back. The next day she reported to me she felt better and could sleep through the night. Being in Honolulu with no A\C  and sweating almost all the time I was hoping that buying a foam mattress would be hot as well..I'm hear to report that the bed is wonderful.I look forward to sleeping on it each day.The mattress is not hot to sleep on.I would purchase a good Bed cover.Like Tuff and Needle one.The number one thing i wanted was a company that w as in the U.S . I did my home work, and read many reviews about a bad smell and so on.I highly recommend this bed.I hope you all get one.
 BEST MATTRESS EVER. IF YOU ARE HAVING THE ARGUMENT OR DEBATE WITH YOUR SPOUSE ABOUT A QUEEN VS. KING GET A KING DANGIT! I knew we should have gotten the king. My husband didn't listen and then agreed with me later when it was too late. This is the perfect mattress if you have trouble sleeping at night. Just put on some good air conditioning, and lay on this and you will be out. If you are considering the queen because you think you want more bedroom space, I urge you to stop. Bedrooms are for sleeping. Treat yourself and Go big. the price isn't that different anyways, and the more space, the better you will sleep. :)
 Hey Everyone!<br/><br/>So impressed with this company's level of integrity and customer service two years later!  I bought 2 mattresses from them in 2016.  A little over 2 years later, I started waking up with back soreness, and I felt it was due to the mattress.  After about a week of this I emailed them to inquire about the warranty.  I spoke to several lovely people (and VERY prompt!) named Rachel, Kelly, and Marcie (I think there was one more in the mix).  First they asked me to take a picture of the bed with weights on it so they could see the sag.  It was very easy to follow process, literally took me about 30 seconds to place the weights and take a picture.<br/>However even myself had a hard time seeing visual proof of the sag.  However I just knew i wasn't being supported well on it.  So I sent them the picture and they responded with this.....<br/>"I looked your pictures over and, while it is difficult to see, there does appear that one side of the mattress is a little bit softer than the other. We also trust your experience. As a result, I've gone ahead and put in a new order for a replacement mattress that will be shipped out as soon as possible. "<br/>Its not often you really truly experience "a no hassle' experience.<br/>These guys walk the walk with what they promise, so appreciative!<br/>Lance
 I couldn't be happier with this mattress. It arrived well packed and compressed, and only took a few hours to open up enough to sleep on. Once aired out, there is no discernible smell to the foam. It has a padded cover and is firm enough for good support, but no so firm as to be uncomfortably stiff. I purchased a full size and wasn't sure 10 inches would be thick enough, but it is plenty big enough for one person, very comfortable and fits perfectly on the Zinus wood slat platform bed. I don't know about durability yet, but everything else so far is 5 stars.
 Wonderful product! such a delight to acquire without all the pomp and circumstance of shopping for a new mattress.  Didn't have one ounce of trepidation of buying sight unseen and without the 5 minute "oh let me lay down on it to see what it feels like" experience that lasts for all of 5 minutes... as if that would really tell how comfortable it would be over any length of time.  The mattress came earlier than expected.. always a bonus!  so easy for my husband and I to set up and I didn't notice any smell or out gassing of any type.  We bought this mattress for the bed in our spare bedroom and I had decided to try it out the first night. I slept very well, not too hard, and not too soft.  Agree with the edge being a bit soft.. but I don't sit there any longer than to put on shoes.  It is perfect.
 Look, you're reading the reviews on Amazon of the highest-rated mattress on here, just like I did.  I took the plunge and I got this mattress and I have to say that all these 5-star reviewers know what they're talking about.  This mattress is great!  It's got a nice top layer of soft but not too-dense foam, followed by much firmer (again, airy) foam.  While some memory foam mattresses really feel super-hot (in summer) or super-cold (in winter), after sleeping on this from summer to fall that the temperature, just like the firmness, is always JUST RIGHT (same as the price!)<br/><br/>Couldn't be happier with this mattress, you couldn't pay me to take it back.
 I have serious back issues. I also have Psoriatic arthritis. This bed has helped so much with my body pain that I can't believe it. My back is still painful and probably always will be, but the pain in my hips and shoulders and everywhere else has dissappeared. It is a God send. My husband, who has had a hip replacement and both knees replaced has also had such better sleep. He actually was doubtful when he saw the new mattress compared to our old, which was a very expensive coil pillow top. It was lower and didn't look like our old matrss at all, and we used our old box spring foundation. But after the first night sleeping on the new Tuft and Needle, he was completely sold. He sleeps so much better and snores so much less. I only see the Mint as as an upgrade now in the near future. We are both so happy with this matress. We are both 58 and are sorry we didn't buy this martress sooner!
 Not only is this the best mattress I've ever owned, it's probably one of the best purchases I've ever made in terms of my satisfaction level with the product.<br/><br/>When I first unboxed this mattress my initial feeling was that it was probably not going to be firm enough as the top layer is very soft.  I've had a couple of back surgeries and really need a supportive mattress to not have back pain in the morning.  Happily my worries were unfounded.  The top layer of this mattress is quite soft and comfortable, but not far beneath the surface is another layer that is very supportive without being hard.  I've found it to be comfortable and supportive in all sleeping positions.  I initially purchased a pillow-soft mattress topper to use with this mattress but ending up returning it as it's not necessary.<br/><br/>I've also noticed that this mattress is noticeably cooler to sleep on than my previous memory foam mattress.  On hot nights I would frequently wake up feeling hot even with the AC going, but with this mattress I haven't had that happen at all.<br/><br/>Great product!
 I needed a new mattress because my old one was breaking down and I was very uncomfortable and waking up several times nightly in pain.  I was hoping this was going to be the answer.  Unfortunately, life got in the way and I missed the return window so I will put it in my guest room but I think it is possible that I hurt worse now than before.  Not what I was hoping for that's for sure.  Not what it's cracked up to be. I also feel that after only about 4 months I am having to turn the bed frequently because it is already breaking down where I lay at night and I'm not a huge person... certainly not petite but not large.  I spoke with my chiropractor and he suggested staying away from total memory foam or gel... these are made for NASA not for sleep.  So, now I will try a hybrid that has coils and foam.  Hoping for better success unfortunately it is getting expensive to try to find the right mattress.  The next one has a 365 day return... ugh
 So far, so good. Only had it for about a week, my first memory foam, so I can't really compare but my back likes it very much;) It came in a box, rolled up, when I opened it and cut through the plastic wrap, it expanded very quickly and was ready to sleep on. Backed by a 90+ day return period, and 10-year warranty if something goes wrong... And it is "Made in USA"... I selected it based on the Consumer Reports from March 2018 issue and it was fairly well rated, not the best but considering the price, it is pretty great deal and quality!!! I like it, if anything changes, I will update;)
 Okay, so we've only had the mattress about 3 days now, but since then we've experienced the BEST sleep of our lives.  SERIOUSLY.  This is the most comfortable mattress we've ever had.  And we've paid more for traditional mattresses in the past.  I'm thoroughly in love!  It feels like this mattress cups your body in all the right ways.  As soon as we laid on it, I felt like all of my aches went away and it seemed like my body decompressed, and I was able to fully relax.  I really can't say enough great things about it.  We did not experience any odor with unpacking it and were able to sleep on it within an hour or so of opening it.  Do yourself a favor and give this bed a try, you will not regret it.
 I will NEVER sleep on anything else! I will never buy from any other company but tuft and needle. I am a costumer for life! This is the best bed on the entire planet, period. Costumer sevice is 110%.<br/>My two kids, 1 year and 4 year old can only get a full night sleep if they are  on this mattress. My back and knee pain have improved considerably. I have been sleeping on this for about two years now...that's two years of amazing sleep. I recommend this bed to all my patients!
 Tuft &amp; Needle has been known for quality, firm mattresses. We own and love our 5-inch queen model that we purchased in 2013. Last year we decided to upgrade to a king size (it was our Saint Bernard’s decision). Unfortunately, the newer models are not nearly as firm. It took us a full year to realize we really don’t like our new bed. We kept thinking our back pain was our body getting used to a new, softer mattress. Hindsight is 20/20 - we should have just quit during the 100 day trial, but here we are. We went back to sleeping on our old queen for now.
 We've been sleeping on our king Tuft &amp; Needle bed now for 5 months (it's in our sleigh bed frame on top of boxsprings), and we love it!  Our last bed was almost 15 years old (embarrassing), and we were in dire need.  My back, and especially my knees were hurting so much.  I wasn't sleeping at all, and my husband's snoring contributed to that.  Also, I was always so hot, which made me toss and turn - and then I would wake my husband up.  Not a good situation.  We tried mattress shopping more than once in the past three years, but always got frustrated and gave up.  The sales people will *tell* you that they'll leave you alone to try out beds, but they never really do.  It's hard to pick a mattress when you can feel the eyes upon you.  They they swoop in again and interfere.  I was nervous about buying a mattress online, but this company's return policy intrigued me.  I bit the bullet and bought one, without even telling my husband!  I think it came a day or two early.  My son and I were able to unbox it, and get it up the stairs.  I see what some of the other reviewers have said about the odor, but ours was mostly gone by that night.  I went ahead and put bedding on it and we slept on it that night.  I was anxious for the first couple weeks, because I wasn't sure I was noticing a difference in how I was sleeping - I DID notice a huge difference in my knees though, right away.  I often sleep on my side, and right away I noticed that my top leg didn't seem to "weigh" so much on top of my bottom leg, if that makes sense.  As time went on, I like the mattress more and more.  I can't say that I never get hot anymore, but not to the degree that I was... I should mention that I am in the throes of menopause.  Summer will be the real test.  I can say that heat is not waking me up.  I am not shedding layers or throwing sheets and blankets off and on because I'm hot, then cold.  Simply put, I am very satisfied with our purchase, and I believe we will be getting a full sized one for my daughter soon.
 We've been sleeping on a Tempurpedic Rapsody for nigh on 10 years, and it has set the bar pretty high, but I didn't want to spend $3600 on a queen for our cabin bed that we sleep on 4-5 days a month.  So, we looked through all the ads for the lower-priced beds and this one looked like a good deal.<br/><br/>What can you say about a box in a bed, that you can't feel, sit or lay down on ahead of time...it's a calculated risk, and EVERYBODY likes their bed just a little different.  But, honestly, with their 100-day money back, guarantee, including shipping, how can you go wrong, so we decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>Delivered in two days, popped it on the frame and cut the seal.  15 seconds later we had a bed.  The instructions said to give it 72 hours to fully expand and degas...BE SURE TO WAIT THAT TIME BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHETHER YOU LIKE IT.  I sat down on it right away and almost bottomed out.  Granted, I'm ~250, but I wasn't expecting that.  BUT, even just 8 hours later, what a difference, much firmer.  Not memory foam, but VERY supportive.  We slept on it that night and were very happy.  Came back a week later, it had firmed up even more, and liked speeping on it even more.  Almost a month in and we are very happy with the T&amp;N...especially at 1/6 the price of the TP Rhapsody!
 After sleeping on the Tuft and Needle mattress for a little more than a week, my wife and I are extremely happy. We like a firm mattress and the mattress we slept on prior was a very firm Stearns and Foster set that we paid amost twice as much as this one five years ago. I had started to develop lower back and a hip issue that has disappeared after a week on this mattress. Like others have already mentioned, there is definitely a strong chemical odor after unboxing it. I set it up in our guest room and keep the windows open with a fan running nonstop for 48 hours. The odor dissipated to the point that it was unnoticeable. So, moved it to our room and we are happy so far.<br/><br/>7-30-2017 - After a month on this bed, we are still happy with this purchase. The only negative is that this mattress sleeps more warm than our last mattress. Should not be a deterrent to anyone though. I've read that all memory foam mattress sleep warmer (no matter what technology used to make them cooler). It should actually be a bonus for us for at least half the year in the cooler months.<br/><br/>9-29-2017 - we're nearly at our 100 days on the mattress and are still as satisfied as we were. So, this is a keeper and I would still highly recommend it for someone that wants a fairly firm mattress that does give just enough for a side sleeper.
 This is the best matress I have owned. For me, it's the perfect comfort level; not too firm and not too plush. After reading some reviews prior to purchasing, I decided to buy a memory foam mattress topper as suggested by some people. It ended up just making me feel like I was sinking into the mattress, so I didn't not use it and it's great all by itself. Eight months later, and it is still as supportive as day one.  The cover is nice and soft and feels great under the sheets.<br/><br/>The only downside, which is minor, is that I agree with some reviews that the outsides are not very supportive. If you lay near the edge, it does tend to feel like you might roll out. But this is only if you're already blaying close enough to where you might be hanging part way off! My husband is not as impressed with this mattress as much as I am, but his back has felt better after switching from our old mattress.
 I've had mine for 8 months but I wanted to wait before reviewing.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this product...I use mine with a down topper to make it a little more plush, for me the mattress alone is a little too flat.  After almost a year there is no sign of compression or sagging.  Of course, because it's a hybrid, there is zero noise...great to not have to listen to the squeaks when I roll over.  Has done an amazing job of keeping back pain at bay!  wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if I ever have the need...great product.<br/><br/>I did think there was a sagging problem but it was the topper, not the mattress.  I communicated with Tuft and Needles customer service team and they were great!  I sent them pictures and they suggested I check the mattress without the topper and they were 100% correct, it wasn't the mattress.  Despite me complaining about a "non-problem" they were extremely nice, very competent, and incredibly helpful.  Nice to know that we can still make, sell, and service high quality and affordable products in the US!!!
 Love love love this mattress!! I am so impressed with the quality of this mattress. When I found it and ordered it I had my doubts, ordering a mattress on amazon without lying on it first like when you order from a brick-and-mortar store. However, I was pleasantly surprised once it came and we slept on it the first night. For reference, I am a back but mostly a side sleeper and my SO is the same.<br/><br/>What I love: First, there is absolutely no movement transfer across the mattress, if you jump on one side, the other side barely even moves at all. If there is any movement, it's from the bed frame itself. Secondly, it's so supportive but still so soft and conforming to your body in any position. Thirdly, it's kept it shape so far and there are no indents where we sleep on it (we've had it for about 3-4 months).<br/><br/>If it ever loses shape, I will report back but I can safely say it's literally the most comfortable mattress that I've ever slept on, I get a great night sleep and so does my SO every night! Would highly recommend!!
 This is definitely on the softer side of the equation.  It does not have a very substantial feel to it.  I weight 190 and it can feel the bottom (the box spring) when rolling in and out of this.  I returned it which was a nightmare!  No way you will get it back into the original box so i had the make one and that was after using 3 500lb ratchet straps to get it to a manageable size.  If you want to buy online I would buy from someone with a brick and mortar presence to make the return process easier!  I purchased a 14" foam mattress from costco and I am very very happy with it.  It's on the firmer side and it has a very substantial high quality feel to it.
 You have to love the reviews take your pick from a perfect nights sleep to don't waste your money or my Queen Sheets don't fit!<br/><br/>I'm 6'-5 240 lbs side sleeper and I love the mattress it's probably not going to cure your back problems, or help you deal with a busy mind keeping you up at night, but it's a damn good mattress.
 It took two weeks for my body to get used to this mattress.<br/>Once we got used to it, this thing is AWESOME.  I'm overweight and my husband is skinny and this thing supports us equally. My only complaint is that there's not a lot of extra "bounce". Which is what you want during sleep but it can be a little momentum-stealing during other activities.  But as we sleep on it more than we engage in other activities, it's worth the trade off.  It's a bit heavy so have a helper to maneuver up on onto your bed frame but it's fun to watch expand.<br/><br/>BTW, you WILL think that they sent you the wrong size mattress from the size of the collapsed item. We bought a king and I was convinced that they accidentally sent us a full.  It will surprise you how big it'll get.
 The mattress seems just ok so far (I've had it for 2mos), BUT-- it has never expanded to the full 10". I'd say somewhere between 8.5"-9"... There are MANY mattress options out there, and I chose T&amp;N due to their certifications like, Oeko-Tex 100 &amp; Certi-PUR. Due to the MANY breathing issues my son has with allergies and asthma, I felt a mattress such as this could possibly help his breathing when it was time for a new mattress. I am just sour on the fact that the mattress never fully expanded to the 10" promised. :(
 I really wanted to like this product. I ordered this product hoping it would be a great mattress. After almost two month of using it, I am giving up. I can not just get comfortable with it and sleep on it. It it a little too firm for me. I wake up with pain in my shoulders. I will be returning this product unfortunately. The two stars is for me just not liking the product. The delivery and purchasing aspect of this product was great, so its not a knock on the company at all.
 5 months ago, when I bought this, I would have given it a 5 star rating because it was such a wonderful relief from my previous mattress, but over time the firmness has gone away and the mattress is squishy and I sink into it a bit too much. My back and hips ache...which is funny because originally, this mattress gave me relief from that pain.<br/>On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most firm, it originally was a 7 for firmness. Now it's at most a 6. boo. sad.<br/>I wish I could have my money back.
 I am absolutely in love with this mattress! I have a really bad back; bone on bone in the lumbar region, stenosis in the thoracic and cervical spine; and this mattress offers me the best support without causing the pressure point pain other mattresses have given me. I am normally a side sleeper because sleeping on my back creates severe issues with movement when I get up. For the last few weeks, I have been waking up laying on my back and have had no discomfort or stiffness when getting up. It sleeps wonderful in any position I find myself in.<br/><br/>I noticed in the question area someone asked about "nightly activities" lol...I can say this bed performed wonderfully in that aspect! My body temperature runs high, thanks Mother Nature, and the least strenuous exercise causes me to sweat profusely. Add another body in the mix and well...any woman who has hot flashes will understand, their husbands may as well. This bed did not heat up, like my old one did. We didn't sink into it like we did on the old mattress (both of us are upwards of 270), and the mattress didn't slide out from under us like my old one did. This bed has met and exceeded my expectations!<br/><br/>What really sold me on purchasing the Tuft &amp; Needle was their warranty. If I wasn't happy, take it to a local charity, get a receipt, and they would refund the full price! That seems to be unheard of with other mattress companies. I bought a pillow top four years ago and within two years the sides had collapsed, the warranty was denied and if it had of been accepted, it would have been pro-rated and partial if applied to another of the companies mattresses. The second thing that really sold me, THE PRICE!!! It is a fraction of the cost of a temperpedic, the purple mattress, or that leesa mattress (excuse the spelling). It was well worth the price!!!! Thank you, Tuft &amp; Needle!!!!!
 Bought this after sleeping on a very hard mattress with a 4 inch memory foam pad that was HEAVEN on earth. Thought this would replace it. I wake up every morning with shoulder pain. Couldn't sleep for the first 3 nights. Added a 1.5 memory foam topper and its a little better but now my husband states he wakes up with hip pain every morning. We toss and turn most nights. Looking to replace this now just afraid won't find one we like at all. It's such a soft firm if that makes sense. Just don't like it at all. Want a bed that feels like sinking into a cloud like our 4 in topper on our old bed.
 I’ll admit it - I was suspicious. The rave reviews raised my eyebrow. I *hate* memory foam beds. But a colleague raves about hers, and decent mattresses are hard to find in Honolulu for anything seemingly below a million dollars, so I took the plunge. It’s a great mattress - firm but soft. It’s a comfortable (even “squishy”) surface but, crucially, you don’t sink into the mattress at all. As someone who prefers a very firm mattress I’m still not 100% sold, but I’ve been sleeping very well and it’s only been a week. Time will tell. It was well packed and promptly shipped (rarely, for Hawaii, for a fair price), and my only concern was a strong “nail polish remover” smell for about two-three hours after I unpacked it. I chose this mattress partly because of its CertiPUR rating, so I wasn’t worried - I’ve just got a very sensitive sense of smell. Luckily, the odor dissipated quickly and was completely gone within one day.
 I looked at the reviews and thought...well...great ratings. it seems to be firm. memory foam and not hot. return able and great price. took a day to let it roll out and unfortunately I haven't had one single night of perfect sleep and its been officially 2 weeks. I wake up with lower back pain. I came from a super firm IKEA 300 mattress and I would sleep great but I was a little achy in the morning thought a new bed would help. It did not. Its worse. Im sleeping on my sofa after tonight once I initiate the return. It doesnt give me the support  my back apparently requires, Simply listening to my body. I FIGURED it would take a week to adjust but I cant. When you put up with 2/3 restless nights I get it. 14 DAYS?? no thanks. Going to sit n sleep and take the money hit. sleep is too much ill under appreciated. What a bummer. its a soft lovely bed but I think it doest support back sleepers. When I SLEPT on my side it was nice. But im not a natural side sleeper.
 I've owned this mattress for over a year now.<br/>I purchased it because of all the good reviews and the good price.<br/>After all this time, I've discovered that this mattress is too soft for me, causing hip pain.<br/>After 1 week on a firmer mattress, hip pain going away.<br/><br/>It's hard to ding this company because people are all different.  Some will find this mattress AMAZING while others will have similar problems to what I had.  Only problem for me was that I didn't discover this issue during the free trial period.<br/><br/>The customer service is VERY GOOD, possibly the best I've ever encountered.<br/><br/>In retrospect, because I have limited funds, I probably should have bought an air mattress and adjusted it to suit me.<br/>Off to find a firmer mattress.
 I wasn't sure it was going to work for me.  But I saw that I had 100 days to try it and if I wasn't happy with it, I could return it. I had read the reviews from some the customers who had bought it.  Some were good and some were not.  I decided to try it.  All I had to lose was a few bad nights with a back ache.<br/>I'm glad to say that I did not wake up with a back ache.  It fact, it help my circulation.  I've been sleeping almost the whole night , except when the dogs wake me up to let them out.  But I'm able to go right back to sleep, which I wasn't able to do before on the old mattress.<br/>I love my mattress.
 At first I was skeptical, I always preferred pillow top plush spring mattresses so foam was an adjustment. Delivery was poor - it was delivered to my house in plastic sans box. Customer service was stellar, have never dealt with better customer service for a company. That sold me. After unwrapping, it inflated and had a bit of a smell that went away after a day. The mattress topper however had a scent that lasted for days. This mattress is firm compared to what I was used to. The first 30 days I was considering returning it due to aches and pains. Now I swear by it, once I adjusted it feels great. Also cannot feel when someone is tossing and turning next to you as much. It’s firmer when lying down but also very soft and durable. My only complaint are that the edges sink if you’re sitting on the corner of the bed.
 This is a lower cost solution to a solid but comfortable bed.  Bought this one month prior to anterior hip arthroscopy (hip replacement) to help with proper angles, depressions, and rigidity near the edge for getting in and out.  Prior to surgery this bed reduced discomfort while side and stomach sleeping.  After surgery, when back sleeping with elevated legs is required, it worked as well (using a foam wedge to elevate).  I’ll say that compared with a several thousand more $ but similar comfort mattress, i like the T&amp;N much better.
 We haven't had this mattress a week yet but do find it comfortable for a couple of seniors. I have a bad back and although no mattress will fix it, I do feel much more support and comfort. Two things we are still pondering is the queen size over laps our old box springs an inch on each side and lack of mattress support on the edges when you sit on it. My husband says he can get use to sitting near the corners for more support. I don't recommend this mattress for a frail senior who could slip off the sides while trying to sit.<br/>I thought the price was fair and shipping was great. We had no problems setting up the mattress on the bed following directions. Give us a few more weeks. :)<br/>Brenda &amp; Rick
 Quick shipping, well-packaged, and seems to be very good quality so far. There is a bit of a chemical smell when you first open it and as it expands, but I wouldn't call it overpowering and it seems to have completely dissipated. This is a replacement for my daughter's lumpy old "traditional" mattress and the difference is like night and day: even support, firm without being uncomfortable, and cool to sleep on.<br/><br/>The only caveat I should mention is that the light weight of the mattress makes it prone to sliding slightly out of position if used (as mine is) on a platform that doesn't have raised edges or some such to hold it in place. I don't think that this will be a major issue because, again, the mattress is quite light for its size (full) and easy to reposition if necessary.
 I ordered this mattress on Prime Day back in July for a great sale price. My sister actually recommended this brand to me after a glamping vacation where she said she had the best sleep ever on their mattress and the owners told her she was sleeping on a Tuft and Needle. Meanwhile, for almost 10 years I had been sleeping on an old secondhand mattress that was given to me by a friend when I first moved into my apartment. I had lower back pain everyday and it was just time to get a new mattress. When Prime Day came and this mattress was put on sale I jumped on it.<br/><br/>The box is pretty heavy but I managed to pull it into and out of my building elevator. I kind of wish there was some writing on the box saying which side was the top because I opened it from the wrong side. I didn't open it where the unstruction booklet was so I had to cut open the other side of the box to get to that. Just a slight issue.<br/><br/>I placed the rolled up mattress on my livingroom floor and followed the process of cutting open the two layers of plastic and allowing it to decompress. It was fun to watch. Later that evening after allowing it to breathe I placed the mattress on my bed frame after removing the old one and slept on it. It's a little heavy to carry (or drag, in my case) but nowhere near as heavy and dense as a conventional mattress so it was relatively easy to transport from my livingroom to my bedroom, pick up and place on my bed frame.<br/><br/>Since I have started sleeping on my Tuft and Needle my lower back pain has been reduced dramatically. It is almost gone so that's been great. I never smelled any strong odors from it so I was relieved about that. I did measure the height and it never did measure the full 10 inches (the size I ordered) but I don't think it matters. I have been sleeping on this mattress for 4 months now and have been very happy with it. It doesn't feel overly firm or overly soft. It's right in the middle. So I am very pleased with my purchase!
 This was the worst mattress I have ever tried. Ordered firm and it felt like a waterbed. You could feel all movements when laying on it. The edges had no support at all.  After 20 nights of trying you could see were you where laying and mattress would never gain it’s shape back. The only plus was that I was able to get my money back.
 We are lucky enough to live in Phoenix so we went down to the showroom 1st to sit on the beds. Our salesperson placed absolutely NO pressure on us to buy one, answered our questions and then let us hang out on the bed for a little bit. When we got home we ordered two beds. A king for us and a twin for our daughter.<br/><br/>We got our beds on time (one was even a day early). I was able to easily move both boxes into the house myself. Setting them up couldn't have been easier. I could have done it by myself if I didn't have to move our old giant mattress first. You just slide them out of the box, unroll it and cut open the plastic and enjoy the few seconds of watching your bed expand. (The three year old thought this was awesome!)<br/><br/>Our king did take some time to fully expand and there is a very very slight degassing smell to both the mattresses but it wasn't bad and we were able to sleep in it a couple of hours after setting them up without any smell issues.<br/><br/>The first night was pretty awesome. The beds aren't as soft as the ones in the showroom which is obviously expected, they need to be broken in. I really like the soft pillow top mattresses, like I like to feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud, which is not what this bed feels like. However I can honestly say I slept better on this mattress the 1st night than I ever did on our giant pillow top. I still tossed and turned the 1st night BUT when I'd wake up to move it wasn't because my hips or back was sore. It was more out of habit. They only part of me that was sore was my neck and I'm pretty confident in attributing that to my crappy pillow.<br/><br/>We've now had this bed for a week and we are still sleeping great on it. I was concerned about the mattress being too hot, even though other reviews and the people at tuft and needle said it stays cool. Surprisingly enough it doesn't get hot. We had two 119 days in a row and I didn't notice any difference at all. I can say with all certainty that all of us love these mattresses!
 Bought this bed as a first "big-boy" bed for our son.  He has been using it for several months now and it's holding up great.  I've fallen asleep on it as well and find it very comfortable.  It "puffed up" out of the bag just find and I never noticed any smell emanating from it, but still let it sit overnight just in case there was any residual smell from manufacturing.  We have it sitting on a box spring and are very pleased with this mattress.
 I love this bed. It is so incredibly comfortable. Decided to go with this brand instead of a spring mattress based on reviews on Amazon and other websites. I was a little worried for a lot of reasons. It sounds too good to be true based on reviews. I was afraid it would be too soft for my SO. I'm a person who wants to sleep on a cloud, my SO would sleep on a slab of stone if he could, but we both are happy with it. Happy to report it's not too good to be true! It actually arrived 2 days early. (Though I have prime shipping, estimated shipping was 3 days and I got it in one).
 Well, after months and months of research, reading many, many reviews, emailing Tuft and Needle to ask additional questions, we took the plunge and ordered a Queen T &amp; N mattress.  I have slept on the mattress for 10 days now and must say it is everything the reviews said it was and more.  I am beyond happy.  My husband is just happy.<br/>  Our previous mattress was 20 years old and still in excellent condition - to us.  It was just time to move on and maybe I could find something that my back wouldn't have that slight pain in the mornings.  I will tell you, I was so skeptical about an all foam mattress - after all, I had slept on sheets of foam decades ago while camping - flat as a pancake in the mornings and you were virtually lying on the floor.  Forget all that.  This isn't that kind of foam - it is sleep like a baby foam - wake without a pain foam - lay on your back, side or both foam.  It is just so comfortable.  Also there is a no motion factor to it.  If one of us rolls over, the other person doesn't move or  feel it.<br/>  It came in quite a large box and we pushed it up the stairs.  Then we placed the rolled up mattress on the bed and pulled the wrapped plastic off.  Once it was about the size of a really flat twin mattress, we carefully cut the next layer of plastic off and the mattress magically expanded to the exact size of the box spring - as in exact.<br/>  There was a faint chemical smell -  a whiff.  In fact I think I whiffed it about 3 times that night and never again.  Several years ago I purchased a foam twin topper and had to leave it standing to air out with the windows open for a week!  So to me, this was amazing....<br/>  I suppose you can tell I am very happy with my purchase.  The price point was great - last year we went mattress shopping and actually walked away from people trying to sell us mattresses and beds costing thousands of dollars.  This purchase was terrific because if it didn't/doesn't work out within 100 or 120 days, the company will come and pick it it up and return out money  - I do not see that happening.Yes, there are other companies, some cheaper and many more expensive - research, explore and then come back to Tuft and Needle!<br/>  Thanks to Luis Guerra at T &amp; N for answering my email.  Thank you to Tuft and Needle for changing the way people buy mattresses and allowing us to have such a positive experience.  Thank you for being an innovator and for changing the world - of mattress purchasing!
 Worst bed I’ve ever had. I’m better off in my 15yr old spring bed than this. I never had back problems until I encountered this bed. Going to sleep on it is amazing, it feels comfortable, however when I wake up, I have tremendous pain in my lumbar-sacral area. After the 1st night, I thought maybe it was the way I positioned, and I’m a back sleeper. So on the 2nd night, waking up to it, I couldn’t handle it anymore. I had to take pain-killers cuz the pain lasted. On my 3rd night, I tried putting a pillow under my sacral area, it helped a bit but is no way comfortable, at least not as painful as my first 2 nights. I didn’t sleep on it again until my second week, I thought maybe it was the bed had not yet fully expanded. Bad idea, still the same.<br/>I didn’t get help from amazon. How can I return this bed in the box 1/4th it’s size is just crazy.<br/>Anyways, the bed is in the basement now and my back aches sometimes. Trying to heal from the injury it had cost me.<br/>I really wish that this doesn’t happen to others. I’ve read many great reviews here, but this is not for me. This bed, when you put weight on it, it’s sides also go down unlike a memory foam, where if you put your hand, only where your hand is put goes down.
 I have researched mattresses ad nauseum for the past six months. I had about made my mind up to invest in a Casper mattress. I was going to bite the bullet and spend the nearly one grand. The I stumbled on Tuft &amp; Needle.For exactly half the price, I got  pretty much the same mattress. And I love my mattress!!!! Packaged and shipped the same way as the "other one", I set it up by myself. And it has been heaven since. I did buy a comfy mattress pad to protect it from my dog who shares the bed.<br/>It supports with just enough give to be comfy. I have back and joint issues  this was important.And I don't sweat it out,. The generous return policy is the same as the "other one" too but I'm keeping mine.
 After about 4 months of reading and watching mattress reviews, out of all of the current online mattress companies, we decided to go with T&amp;N. We’ve have the mattress for a few nights now - and I’ve got to say it’s a complete game changer. I’m a MAJOR hot sleeper, usually get pretty sweaty (nobody likes that). With the T&amp;N mattress, not only was it the first time I’ve never gotten the slightest bit hot, but was even a bit chilly. Amazing. There is zero motion transfer as well. As far as softness - I think it’s perfect. It doesn’t “Taco” you in as soon as you lay down - a great balance of soft and responsive. Of course, there’s the price too. $700 for a king. That’s just plain incredible. All that combined with the company’s mission and values - well, this things the complete package. Don’t hesitate, you’ll love it.
 One picture is my current king size T&amp;N mattress that I just received from Amazon. The other picture is of a full size T&amp;N mattress that I also bought on Amazon. You can see the obvious difference. I don’t know if my king size mattress is defective or what. One edge is normal, and the other edge is curved and bumpy. It will not lie flush with the bed like it’s supposed to. I know that T&amp;N mattresses are amazing because I’ve purchased a couple in the past. There is something clearly wrong with this one. It also only measures about 8” tall when it’s supposed to be 10” tall. This king size mattress was delivered wrapped in plastic. There was no box like other T&amp;N mattresses I’ve purchased from Amazon
 Hi im a recent college graduate. As you know my species are what you might consider broke. So i slept on a terrible mattress w my boyfriend that would have me waking up in the middle of the night due to back pain.<br/>Now that i have a job i can afford a $500 mattress and its amazing. My partner and I can both lay on it and not feel the other ones movement. Back feels supported. Hope it doesnt sink in the middle!!
 Came well boxed with cut out handles for easy handling. Mattress inflated immediately upon removal from box and unwrapping plastic. No odor I could detect, even on first opening. Mattress has a cover that can be zipped off and an interior gray cover. Top layer is very soft but bottom layer of foam provides good support. Moved into a well ventilated room for full inflation and any off-gassing. Feels very much like memory foam. Purchased for grandson. Appears to be a quality mattress. Made in the USA.
 I really really really want to give this product a five star review, because quite frankly it the most comfortable mattress I've ever laid on.<br/><br/>Let me explain - it isn't exactly the best out-of-the-box.  My wife and I purchased our new mattress and our new bed frame at the same time.  Since the description claims you can use a traditional box spring OR a slotted bed, we bought a nice new California King bed, and a Tuft &amp; Needle California King mattress.<br/><br/>Problem - our new Tuft &amp; Needle California King mattress is too thin.  :~(  my wife and I can feel every slot in the bed.  Left this way having any type of marital relations is not possible, because whomever takes the initiative, gets their knees painfully pressed into the slots.<br/><br/>(and the not so ideal)<br/>Solution - Our old crapy spring mattress was a queen, old school with box springs.  Being that I have MAJOR back problems, a spring mattress was not ideal.  So awhile back we bought a mattress topper.  How we solved our too thin Tuft &amp; Needle California King mattress problem was to put our old queen mattress topper between the slots of the bed and our new Tuft &amp; Needle California King mattress.  Now this is not under any circumstances ideal.  It leaves about a foot around all sides of the mattress on a declining slope.  In other words it is not fun to get in or out of bed, and waking up on ther edge of the bed is frankly scary.<br/><br/>Now this is the most comfortable mattress ever, but being too thin to enjoy earns only two stars.  Unfortunately we may be returning our Tuft &amp; Needle California king mattress.
 I love this mattress.  I have fibromyalgia along with hip and back pain so I felt that the mattress I was currently using (even though it was only a few years old and a good quality mattress) wasn’t giving me support where I really needed it to help relieve my discomfort. At first  I was afraid the T &amp; N was too firm and even went out and bought a Serta memory foam topper for it. While using the topper, by the third night I ended up taking it off in the middle of the night because it just wasn’t comfortable, so I ended up going back to using the Tuft and Needle without a topper. It’s now been a couple of weeks and I just have to say I love this mattress. I never want to get out of bed in the morning. Not sure if it helped my pain or not but certainly feels like it because usually by morning my pain is gone.
 My wife and I were very impressed with the quality and comfort of the mattress.  It seems to be constructed with quality materials.  Unboxing was simple and the bed expanded as expected.  The only issue we experienced was lack of edge support.  If we got within 4 to 6 inches of the edge of the bed, we noticed we'd start to roll off.  We are average sized (5'-100lbs &amp; 6'1"-165lbs), so I do not think that had anything to do with it.<br/><br/>We really wanted to keep this mattress, but decided to return it because we could not sacrifice losing nearly a foot of bed real estate due to the roll off / no edge support.  I would like to note that the Tuft &amp; Needle customer service is top notch and gave superior support.  I would certainly consider purchasing another mattress from T&amp;N if the edge support was improved.
 We purchased this mattress from Amazon on 2-25-16 and it was received on 2-29-16.  Packaging was in good shape and the ease of un-packaging was phenomenal!  We were able to sleep on it the first night!  While we had been mattress shopping since December this particular purchase was very highly anticipated once we decided on the "perfect" mattress for us.  The reviews for this mattress seemed to be that people either liked it or they didn't and there wasn't much in between so we decided to make the transition from the traditional inner spring that we have always had and purchased.  I didn't realize how much our old mattress was really hurting us until we have been able to sleep on this for the past week.  I haven't had burning hip pain like I did on our old mattress and my husband, who has had a bad back since I've known him, laid on it the first night and exclaimed "I can't believe we've found a mattress that touches all of my back!" and a week later doesn't have to hobble out of the room after getting out of bed in the morning.  At this point we are certainly pleased with our purchase and I am quite perplexed at all the reviews that state how incredibly firm this mattress is....to the point people are saying that they have bought mattress toppers to help with the firmness.....our experience has been quite the opposite.  I like a softer mattress while my husband likes a more firm mattress and it is very well suited for both our needs, as a matter of fact we call it the marshmallow because this mattress is what I imagine a marshmallow feeling like.  I do find it a bit difficult to roll over in at night but I really think it is a matter of getting used to because the sleep experience is SO MUCH different that what we had prior to this. There is no support on the edges that allow for "sitting" activities such as putting on socks and the such but really for us that tends to be a non-issue at this point. All and all the pros out weigh the cons for us with this purchase and are considering buying one for our teenage son.
 This is not a review stating the bed is bad, rather how I'm disappointed in T&amp;N. I already owned a T&amp;N mattress before I purchased my second one. I love the first one! No divets! It's comfortable! Its about 4 years and it's still fantastic! You're probably wondering, "Why only give it only 3 stars then?" As you can see in the pics attached, one is thicker then the other. The new one was about 2 inches thinner. The old us about 10 1/2" and the new 8 1/2". Not to mention, the specs say it's suppose to be 10" H. It's hard to say if this is a lesser quality mattress or not, since I gifted to a friend. My disappointment lies in the fact that I expected the mattress to meet the specs listed and to match the previous mattress I had purchased before.
 We bought this bed for a guest room and so far 3 different guests have used it. All of them said it was very comfortable. It is on the medium soft side, so if you like a real firm mattress, this isn’t for you. If you are a side sleeper or toss and turn a lot, you will like it. It was very easy to set up and was completely expanded in 12 hours. There was no off gassing from the mattress. Regular queen sheets fit it just fine. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a good mattress at an affordable price point.
 For the price this is a decent cheap alternative to the more expensive memory foam mattresses. I purchased a twin for my toddler daughter and for her it’s fine but my husband and I currently have the Nest Love &amp; Sleep (king size about 3 years old) and frankly they are not the same. The lack of support around the edges of the mattress drive me crazy. It’s soft and comfortable once your lie down however I don’t feel like it gives me the same support as the the Nest mattress. Sitting on it I always feel as though I’m sliding off (I’m not a big person) again not an issue for my 35lb daughter. I would purchase this mattress over a traditional spring mattress no doubt. If you’re on a budget this is a good alternative BUT with that if you can afford to spend a little more then I really think you’re better off long term.
 I've slept on this bed for two weeks now and there's no going back. I was hesitant of the price but with a 10-year warranty and 100-day sleep test, I figure I couldn't go wrong.  I have slept wonderfully since day 1 regardless of only being 2 weeks so far.  Although I'm not sure how to "activate" the warranty, based on other reviews, I feel these guys really stand behind their product. Carrying my king size mattress up to my 3rd floor was a breeze by myself (I'm 6'2" and 220 though so maybe that helped). I'm definitely a big fan of this mattress!!!
 I have been sleeping on my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress for almost 3 months. I love it! I researched all the similar brands for a month before making this purchase. It was down to this one or Casper, which Consumer Reports had rated #1 &amp; #2. Since there were so many written similarities, but a price gap of $250, I went with the cheaper option. I'm glad I did because I love this bed. I definitely feel more comfortable and find myself sleeping through the night way more often.
 Figured i would give this a few weeks before i reviewed.  Initial - unpackaged easily and the mattress expanded to its maximum size quickly with no off-gassing or other chemical smells observed.  First few nights it was quite firm.  My spouse is a back sleeper and prefers a firm mattress, and slept well on the mattress from the start.  As a side sleeper i thought it was a bit too firn.  I reached out to t&amp;n and they provided a foam topper to try out.  Following use with the topper, i was 100% comfortable as a side sleeper and it thankfully had no discernible effect on my spouse's comfort of the mattress.  All in all a positive experience.  Will try and update the review a few years in or if anything catches my attention.
 This is a great mattress. I needed to replace a queen sized futon and wanted to try a foam mattress. I was going to buy the Leesa, but $980 seemed like alot for a mattress. My friend and his wife bought a tuft and needle. They said the mattress is very comfortable.<br/><br/>I placed the order on amazon and the mattress arrived quickly. Upon arrival, I placed the mattress on my queen sized bed frame, and cut open the outer plastic wrapping. I unfolded the mattress, placed the zipper side down, and carefully cut the inner plastic wrapping. Within 3 minutes the mattress expanded to normal size.<br/><br/>After the first night's sleep, I decided to keep it. Tuft and needle is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Buying a mattress is a personal decision, but you do get a trial period to see if Tuft and Needle meets your needs.<br/><br/>I would buy this mattress again in a heartbeat.
 I bought this mattress about 40 days ago to replace my worn out mattress. It was delivered in a box and was easy to unpack. After removing the plastic and watching the mattress expand there was an odor present for about a week. The smell reminded me of fresh paint/paint thinner. I had to sleep with the windows open, but ended up sleeping in a different room after my chest started to hurt from the odor. But it eventually left. The mattress is soft, maybe too soft (I'm 6' and 220 lbs). I have found that my back doesn't keep straight after awhile. Initially you lay down on the bed and it feels amazing, but by morning your back is curved because you sank too far into the bed. This is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Use a platform bed frame with this mattress. The mattress is very soft.
 I was really stressing over moving and having to purchase brand new bed. I had a sealy postrepidic king size with pillow top mattress I was leaving behind. Cost me in the upwards of $3,500 when I purchased it years ago with the box spring.<br/><br/>Luckily on prime day I took the leap and this mattress was $200 off. Couldnt hurts for $3000 less than what I paid before. Plus it was air tight so although I was moving a month later I can have it shipped to me and bring up to new place in my car!<br/><br/>I was concerned it wouldn’t fit in the car but I bought it anyway. Month later after purchase I was easily able to fit it in my Nissan Murano as long as I put the back seat down. Yay! This is the king size for those wondering.<br/><br/>I waited 2 months before starting this review. As others had mentioned it does have a small plastic odor upon opening. I left it to breath in my new empty apartment without adding any covers to it just yet for 2 days. When I returned after two days I didn’t smell the odor anymore.<br/><br/>I also read some folks recommended to get a pillow top mattress cover if you find the mattress too hard. In the beginning it does seem a little stiff but I find that it’s breaking in and it’s more comfortable 2 months later. I did buy the waterproof pillow top mattress cover just because I have dogs and don’t want accidents.<br/><br/>King size sheets fit just fine. I bought a platform bed since most folks this is what these mattresses are better with. I must agree. My platform bed frame was another $800 but I have storage compartments all over the bottom. So overall a brand new complete bed cost me $1400. I must say I like this better than my almost $4000 bed by sealy! If I had to do this again I would definitely invest in this company. The mattress is amazing and very very comfortable!! I hope it withstands the rest of time!
 My husband and I were really nervous but we are surprisingly satisfied.  We read the reviews like everyone else and decided that even if it was impossible to return the product after purchasing, we'd try and hope for the best. I don't know how anyone could re-vacume-seal it into the box it came in... impossible! But shopping for mattresses stinks big time! And gosh, extensive. I like a hard mattress for my back pain and this works. I was really concerned how the foam would feel but i don't even think about it anymore. It's nice. We're happy. Hoping for durability! Oh... and I'm a hot sleeper and have NOT been sweaty. Yay!!!!
 Very comfortable, packed+shipped well, unpacked and let air out for a couple hours, and no issues!<br/><br/>Paired with a set of <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/LINENSPA-Bamboo-Sheets/dp/B015NGKCN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LINENSPA Bamboo Sheets</a> and the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-Upholstered-Square-Stitched-Platform-Bed/dp/B00W4DCVLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zinus Upholstered Square Stitched Platform Bed</a>
 We previously had a Tuft and Needle mattress in a queen size. After our dog started taking up a good portion of our bed, we realized we needed a bigger bed. So when we decided to get a California king size bed, we knew we needed another Tuft and Needle. We couldn't be happier with this brand. I would say, it's better than the big name memory foam mattresses.<br/><br/>I am significantly smaller than my boyfriend, so on our previous mattresses, whenever he would shift or roll over, I felt like I was always rolling towards him. Now, when he comes to bed after me, I don't even feel the mattress move. I also don't feel the 200 times our dog jumps on and off the mattress. I get such quality, uninterrupted sleep now.<br/><br/>We recently had our friends come to visit and after they slept on the Tuft and Needle mattress, they immediately went home and ordered their own!
 I purchased last year in 2015. Set up was easy, and I allowed the mattress one week to fully expand before sleeping on it. I had the luxury of slowly moving into a new home to allow for the extended time for full expansion. It's not necessarily needed though as I didn't really notice a difference after day one of expansion.<br/>The difference between a spring mattress vs. a Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is stark. I feel like I sleep on a cloud. It's firm enough for my hubby to be comfortable on his back and soft enough for me as a side sleeper. No more tossing and turning. No more sleepless nights from waking overheated or too cold. I have recommended to friends and family as this mattress has changed our lives for the better.
 I love my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. I'm also blown away by the company's customer service. I got my mattress really quickly in a very manageable box. I got a queen mattress so I didn't expect to be able to handle it by myself but it was no problem. I followed the instructions and got it out of the box on the bed so it just unrolled right onto my platform bed slats. It is definitely cooler than other Tempurpedic mattresses I've had. After sleeping on it for a few weeks, I felt it was still a little hard so I bought a fiberbed for it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I was bummed to have to spend more to make the mattress just right and it got hot with the fiberbed on it. I called Tuft &amp; Needle and told them the issue. They sent me a topper made just like their mattress but a little softer. I put it on and have been counting sheep happily since. I can't think of another time I've had such good, responsive customer service!
 I was in desperate need of a new mattress when I casually came across this mattress. I originally bought a memory foam mattress back when I was on tour &amp; only home for a few months a year. No worries, right?<br/><br/>Not long after that I was forced into early retirement (at 29) because I was diagnosed &amp; suffering from Primary Sjögrens Disease, fibro, &amp; RA. That was 5 years ago. Suffice to say, my memory foam mattress didn’t survive my constant bed bound-ness &amp; I was hitting box spring. My normally not happy back was pissed.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research online for beds when I didn’t have a lot to spend. T&amp;N seemed like the answers to my prayers &amp; pain.<br/><br/>I do thoroughly enjoy the mattress (granted, I only received it yesterday) except for the fact that it’s a bit firm for me. I’m seriously like the princess &amp; the pea at times ... I’ve heard it gets softer over time so I have great hopes! Just wish it would get softer now! 😆<br/><br/>I did get it incredibly quick &amp; it was easy (for my dad) to unpack. I will admit to some amusement at the fact the mattress goes from 1” wide to 12”. Kind of reminded me of those bath time ‘fun’ pills where you’d toss them in warm water it grew into a sponge or washcloth ...
 I'm so glad I purchased this mattress! My wife and I were sleeping on an old coil mattress and I always woke up with terrible back pain and never really felt like I was getting decent sleep. I noticed a major difference after the first night! Shipping was fast and set up took only a few minutes. I will never shop at a mattress store again after buying a Tuft &amp; Needle. Buy with confidence!
 This is definitely a good mattress and a company worth supporting (even through amazon). Since mattresses and people are all unique, this didn't end up working out for us, but I still feel it is a good product. I found the mattress to be on the firmer side and I ended up missing the fluffiness and fullness of previous mattresses I have owned. Again, doesn't make the mattress bad, just not my cup of tea. I will mention that we were able to get a refund for the product (even though Amazon tried to dodge their own policy of returns.....), but if you buy directly from Tuft &amp; Needle, their policies are much better. You are allowed the same amount of time to "test" the product and if you want to return it, they set up a pick up for the mattress to be donated with no extra work for you.
 So I had been sleeping on a spring coil mattress that I bought new in 2002. It dawned on me it might be time to replace. I had been having back, shoulder and neck issues and I started thinking it was from my mattress not my sedentary desk job. I have been laying on it for the last few days (I also bought the topper, sheets and pillow all from Tuft &amp; Needle). I cannot say enough great things about this company and the products they sell, prices and how AMAZING this bed feels!!!! I am blown away at how comfortable it is!. I have had zero pain and have been sleeping like a baby. My husband used to travel for his job and has stayed in a lot of nice hotels. He said this feels better than any bed he has ever slept on. I have to agree. I am a loyal customer and hope this company never changes. FANTASTIC PRODUCT! Thank You Tuft &amp; Needle!!
 Wanted to try something different than the usual inner spring mattresses I've had before.  I have issues with my back sometime so I didn't want a mattress that was way too soft or too hard. I watched several reviews on You Tube of all the mattress brands offered online &amp; all the others seemed like they would be too soft &amp; not offer enough support.  The Tuft &amp; Needle one looked just right &amp; it is.  I guess you can describe it as a medium firm mattress with just the right amount of support.  I've had mine for a few weeks now &amp; have had no issues with back pains at all in the morning.  I also have had no problems with getting too hot from sleeping on it like the other foam mattresses out there. Their special foam layer on top really works!  If you're looking for something different in a new mattress definitely give this one a try!
 It was time to get another mattress so I did lots of research, yes, probably too much research, but this is a once in 10 year purchase so I wanted to be careful.  I recommend using the mattress website, sleeplikethedead, very authoritative reviews. Some people say that this mattress is too firm for side sleeping, however, I disagree. I sleep on my sides every night and am very comfortable. I called Tuft &amp; Needle to inquire about the firmness/slide sleeping question. The company explained that their initial mattress was firmer but they changed the design of the current model to make it better for side sleepers. I think they got it right. Buy with confidence with their 30 day money back guarantee if you buy from Amazon or a 100 day money back guarantee if you buy directly from Tuft &amp; Needle. If you don't like the mattress they will arrange for a charity to pick it up so you don't even have to worry about shipping it back. We have now used this mattress for over 2 months and love it!  I highly recommend it!
 I was skeptical about buying a mattress in a box and how long it could actually last. I am not going to lie, the first week was rough. My back hurt every morning, but after the first week, it started to break in. I am about 1 month in on this mattress and it is much more comfortable than when it first arrived, but I wish it was a little softer. They say it should be broken in within the 100 day trial, so I suppose there is still time. What really gives me peace of mind is the warranty and trial. I am hopeful that this will work out for the best and at the end of the day am glad I did that this risk.
 We’ve needed a new mattress for quite some time, yet were leary about spending heinous amounts of money for a mattress that would fail us as our last 3 have.  Took a chance and bought this bed in a box on Amazon Prime day; not only did we pay a great price with an awesome discount, but we now have the best sleep ever!  An added benefit is you don’t feel the movements of whomever you sleep with.  Our kids and grandkids lay on it with tons of jealous oohs and aws.  Would make an excellent gift for anyone with a bad back or who just wants a peaceful restful sleep.
 My husband I totally differ when it comes to our preferred mattress firmness level.  I like around a 8, whereas he likes about a 5 or 6.  We went on a little weekend getaway where we sleep on a wonderful, very expensive mattress. We then asked the little b&amp;b owner for some information about the mattress.  The cost for the mattress was around $1,300.  I came incredible close to buying it since we have flipped back in forth with either,  a very firm mattress for me or, a soft  mattress for him for the past 12 years.  I made it my mission to make us both comfortable without breaking the bank. We even seriously considered getting a sleep number bed, both we are skeptical of those since they don't always seem to get rave reviews and can be fairly pricey.  I decided to dig around Amazon reviews on mattress to see if there were some better options out there.  Then I can across Tuff &amp; needles!!!  I was incredible intrigued.  I researched the very expensive mattress from the b&amp;b against this mattress.  They were both made in America with the same great materials. The only difference and I mean ONLY was the very expensive mattress has 2 extra layers of padding on the bottom of the mattress, making the mattress 2 inches thicker.  Since you don't flip either mattress, but simply rotate it head to foot I couldn't  see the value in the extra bottom padding I'll never use.  So for more than half of the cost of the expensive mattress, I bought this one that was shipped to my door with only a few taps of my thumb.<br/>I'm a fairly strong 130 lbs 5'8ft female and was able to drag it in my house, open it, the hoist it on to my current box springs by myself.  It was so cool watching it expand when I opened the plastic.  I recieved it late in the day so it only had a few hours to expand before we slept on it. Husband complained he had a backache because it was to firm the first 2 nights, but he had been very sick and running a fever. So I asked him to give it a few more nights since I believed it would soften a bit more in the next few days. We have had it for almost a week today. He is feeling better and loves the mattress as much as I do.  We are both sold!!!!  I'm thankful we were able to find such a great mattress for the price.<br/>It wouldn't be fair to say this mattress will work for absolutely everyone, but I highly recommend it to the vast majority of people.  We have both slept much better bring free from any back pain upon waking in the morning.  I wish we bought it years ago!
 Its super big and comfty.<br/><br/>The only thing I noticed over time, is the temperature.<br/><br/>I don't think this mattress is optimal for temperature control. It seems rather warm when its warm and rather cold when it's cold.<br/><br/>Its hard to find a good in between when it comes to temperature. If your naturally hot at night when sleeping, I dont think I can recommend this mattress.<br/><br/>Everything else is great.
 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QBZ25R4?redirect=true&amp;ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_20  This is the second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress that we have purchased. After loving the first one (queen size), we purchased a full size for our guest room. Having a mattress arrive in a box is amazing. We spent almost six months reading reviews of other foam mattress before settling on Tuft &amp; Needle.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Arrives in a box<br/>If you want to return it, they refund your money and help you donate your returned mattress via pickup to a charity.<br/>Super easy to set-up. Clear the floor. Slide if out of the box. Unroll it. CAREFULLY slice the plastic cover on one end and slide the mattress it out as the bag opens.<br/>Shock absorbing  (can't feel my partner tossing and turning all night)!<br/>It's firm but cozy and soft<br/>It has a thin washable cover that protects it ( which I haven't taken off yet to wash)<br/>I used to sleep poorly and get back aches and toss and turn. I don't now.<br/>It has a give to is like a very dense and soft memory foam.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Like any new mattress, it takes about three/four nights to get used to.<br/>A few of our family members think it is too firm. But after actually sleeping on it, they don't believe it is. (rolling my eyes)<br/>Can't keep the arthritic dog off of it.<br/>I have to keep explaining the Tuft &amp; Needle bumper sticker that is now on my car.<br/>It is thick, and if you plan on using a mattress protector (we do not as we like the slight memory foam effect) - you will need deeper fitted sheets.<br/><br/>It is really a win-win deal. You can donate it and get your money back if you do not like it.<br/>We are never going back to spring type mattress again.<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QBZ25R4?redirect=true&amp;ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_20
 I have to say, I was skeptical. We spent more than this for our last mattress, a Sealy Posturepedic, and it was the worst thing we've ever owned. When we unpacked this mattress, it was soft. It gave when I sat on it. I thought it was going to be garbage. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The Sealy failed to support us properly in some way. My wife and I both had back problems resulting from sleeping on it. It was so bad for me that if I slept on it for more than 4 hours or so, I'd wake up and have searing pain in my mid-back spine. Breathing was painful. I was dreading bed each night.<br/><br/>So far, and we've only owned it a month or so, this mattress is MUCH better. Again, I was surprised. While it is soft, it supports all the right places in the right way. I wake up in a bit of pain, but with the Sealy it was a 7/10, with this mattress it's a 2/10. That kind of improvement is nothing to complain about, it's fantastic.<br/><br/>Sleep is no longer a sad thing. It's once more something to look forward to.
 Having had this since July, 2018, I can now with all certainty and confidence say it is the BEST mattress I have ever slept on or owned. Previous mattress was a massively thick combo memory foam and other things. Too hot heavy and bulky. THIS mattress sold me on price, great reviews, customer service and the "will not fry you in bed" thing ;-) Previous foam mattress was too hot. This mattress is an odd thing to me: It feels soft and firm at the same time. Gives me great support but is soft. When I press on it there is no sinking in as-if it were very firm. Lie on it and it makes sleeping easier. No more tossing and turning for a good spot to sleep on. These people have created the perfect mattress. It is not light nor heavy. Fairly easy to pick up and move it.
 Two year update. I still love it. First of all, it's cheaper than the Casper. I almost purchased the Casper because it was the "it" mattress and all of the hype. I am so glad I decided to go with T&amp;N instead. The material. ratings, and price convinced to take the leap. Also, it's made in the USA, which is a big plus. You can just tell they're genuine company doing things the right way. I sleep like a baby. I don't have enough words to explain how happy I am I went with T&amp;N. Best decision I ever made.<br/><br/>**FYI, I came from the typical box spring mattress.
 Not to size. Purchased for my 13-year-old son, who is 5'9" on his way to 6-6'2" (my wife's dad was 6'6" and we have nephews, dad same height as I at 5'8", who are 6'2" and 6'4", respectively). I assumed I would get 5 more inches in length which may be been enough to get him to college. But even after letting it expanded 24 hours, and my son laying on it, it measures 77.5" -- exactly half way between a regular and XL. I'd shrug, except that regular twin sheets are too tight and XL ones, too loose. However, very comfortable if your sleeper will stay on the smaller side. Caveat emptor!
 I am sad to have to write this but my body aches from sleeping in this bed. My nect back and shoulders I am a side sleeper I don’t think its my weight Im average sized my hisband says its “fine” I’d feel better if at least he loved it. Its like sleeping on cement. The sides are uneven you can feel it when you roll over its very noticeable. I likes the premise and the nontoxicity of the mattress but Im miserable and even though the price point is pretty good its not worth it to wake in pain and roll down the sode of the bed.
 Unboxed yesterday. Initial review, will update in 30 days. Moderate amount of off-gasing. Several hours with all windows open and celling fan going was not enough to dissipate strong odor. Two of the four corners did not return to a uniform shape and remain semi flattened this morning.<br/>Mattress feeling is firm but comfortable. Will need some time to adjust to the firmness. Didn't notice any issue with heat retention, but with Windows open on a cool night and fan going, too soon to tell.<br/>Mattress cover is thin and cheap looking compared to other similar foam mattresses. Overall, I'm not blown away with the mattress but at this point, if it doesn't develop permanent indentations like our last 4 mattresses have after 30-60 days I will be satisfied.
 I purchased this mattress 6 months ago and I am completely in love. I had always been a box-spring mattress person and wasn't sure how I would take to memory foam, but now I can't turn back! I don't use a boxspring and this mattress hasn't sunk in anywhere yet. It's the perfect firmness to support my back while I sleep, and I am able to sleep comfortably through the night. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a memory-foam mattress on the firmer side!
 Absolutely amazed! I thought I needed firm for orthopedic issues. This is NOT firm, and it's the best mattress I've ever had! What a surprise, at this price; I've never slept better, and I've been sleeping 78 years of nights!!!
 OMG! Best first night sleep! Thank heavens I don't have a job yet, because I don't want out of this bed. There was hardly a chemical ordor when unwrapped. I went with the two TXLs to make a king. I'm glad I read another person review. It works better due to me moving at night or getting out of bed without disturbing the other person. You should buy a protective cover for waterproof, just in case this bed gives off too much heat or chemicals. Am going back to sleep! Later mouth breathers!!
 I'm 6'1" 250lbs and my wife is 5'2" 120lbs. Our old bed (2yrs old) was a medium soft memory foam bed. We would lay down and feel great, fall asleep and wake with back pain everyday. It took a long time to come to terms with the fact that it was our bed and not our pillows or sleeping wrong. We wanted an adjustable bed so we bought this along with an adjustable base (I won't recommend the base we bought). First few weeks we thought it was too firm and debated adding a pillow top, that proved not necessary. It softened up or we got used to it, either way it was a solid purchase.
 I love this mattress! I was on the fence about getting it for the longest time, but got it, and I'm so pleased. I sleep pretty well on it. Although, it did take some time to get used to the mattress (about three weeks), I was so used to sleeping on a spring mattress and don't know why I did for so long. The mattress stays cool and I never feel like it retains heat.
 I have been sleeping on this mattress for about 3 months and it's pretty good, I've had no real issues with it. For me personally its a little too firm but I like a softer bed and was used to sleeping on a memory foam topper. For the price it was a good buy as I was moving and needed a mattress at the house before I got there because my partner would be there before me, and a foam mattress that got shipped seemed like the best option.
 A friend recommended Tuft &amp; Needle so I bought this mattress for our spare room It was super-easy to set up. We placed it on the frame, &amp; it just inflates itself. I tried it out that night &amp; liked it so much,  I decided to use it myself! I was worried that it might be too hot since I had tried a Tempurpedic, which was sweltering-hot &amp; way too soft.  This mattress is not hot at all, and is actually much cooler than the Ikea natural-fiber mattress I used to have. Some reviewers seemed to think that this mattress is best for back sleepers. I'm a side-sleeper &amp; it works great for me, too. When I got up the next morning, I felt great--no stiffness. Yey! First morning in years I awoke without a backache.  I can see why this mattress is Amazon's top seller. It is a better mattress than most that cost 2-3 times as much.<br/>To wrap it up--<br/>Nice &amp; cool<br/>Firm but not too firm<br/>Good for side-sleepers, too<br/>Price can't be beat
 I've had this bed for two months now, and my quality of sleep has definitely improved. I find it amazing that such a premium mattress can be shipped in such a small box. It's mind boggling.<br/><br/>It's relatively firm, but very comfortable and supportive. This mattress is very much worth it at it's price-point, and I would buy again. The Tuft &amp; Needle pillow is great too, I'd recommend that if you're getting this mattress.
 We have been SO happy with this mattress. I was glad for the manufacturer note that there is about a week of break in time. I'm a side sleeper and for the first few nights I felt like this mattress was borderline too firm since I was waking up pretty stiff. I didn't notice any tender pressure points, just stiffness from how firm the mattress is. We've had the mattress for about a month and I haven't noticed any stiffness since that first week and the mattress does seem a tad softer but still firm and supportive. My husband is a back or stomach sleeper and he has loved it. We are so glad we found a mattress that we can both be comfortable on.<br/>We bought this to replace a VERY old mattress that was causing back pain for both of us, and I can't even put into words how much better we both feel. I had my doubts that a foam mattress could be soft yet firm - BELIEVE THE DESCRIPTION! Soon after we got this, I spent several days in bed with the flu and I was able to rest well without being uncomfortable.<br/>This mattress is AMAZING with motion transfer. My husband wakes up much earlier than I do, and since we've had this mattress I never notice him getting out of bed in the morning. He used to wake me up every day. Overall we are falling asleep faster, sleeping deeper, and feel better in the morning.
 We have used this mattress for approximately one month. During that time, we have already noticed that the bed sinks in more.  I can hardly do anything while sitting on the bed, especially on the edge of the bed, because I slide down the edges or sink in the middle.  I also have developed back pain that makes it worse for me to sleep on the bed, and I am uncomfortable whether sleeping on my back or my side.  I have had mattresses that were cheaper that functioned better than this. We are planning to return the mattress, but we will give it a couple more weeks.  My husband and I are petite in size, so I’m not sure how it will do for people who are bigger and heavier than us.  This is definitely an overrated mattress.  Buyer, beware!
 OK folks. This was a milestone for us. Yes, we have used waterbeds for our adult lives; however, the support just seemed less than desired. The problem was, we both love California King size beds. To put it mildly, we were excited to find that we were not alone. Tuft &amp; Needle’s mattress fit perfectly in our very nice waterbed frame. Amazon has a huge variety of sheets, pillows, comforters, etc., so no worries for whatever you need. I can personally attest that I’ve slept better than I have in years with Tuft &amp; Needle’s product. Hey, if you sleep 99 nights on it and decide it’s not for you, send it back for a full refund. In other words, a no brainer. At approximately $750, this is as good as it gets.
 This is our third Tuft &amp; Needle mattress.  Our house flooded, so we've had to replace a king, and have purchased 2 others.  They are very comfortable and appear to resist sagging.  One of the mattresses we replaced was a TempurPedic.  The Tempurpedic maaaay have been a bit more comfortable but would have cost 4 times as much to replace.  For whatever the T&amp;N lacks, in my opinion, it's made up for in the cost.  Our Tempurpedic was ~6 yrs old and was sagging.  When you laid in it, if you rolled to the center of the bed (King sized version), you could feel the difference in firmness and tended to "roll" back to the spot where you normally laid.  The T&amp;N may prove to do the same thing, but it cost A LOT less.  We bought 3 of them; happy so far.
 Update on my review: you need more time to get used to it. Now after 6 month I love this mattress
 After sleeping on an Ikea mattress for longer than I would care to admit, this mattress was a godsend. I wake up in the morning with no back or neck pain. I sleep well every night. I was a little skeptical, since some of the reviews said that after a while the bed seems to hold indentions, or become softer. I've had the full-sized mattress for about 4 months now with no problems. This is a great mattress for the money, and I sincerely hope that it holds up over time.
 I had no idea what to expect, but after careful research I decided that the value seemed to be with this particular product.<br/>I have had back surgery, and comfort is extremely important to me.<br/>I am kind of like the Princess &amp; the Pea! If too squishy, it will be a nightmare and if too hard, my back hurts all night long and even turning over is painful. I must say that Tuft &amp; Needle have made a QUALITY product here!  I ended up returning a Novafoam product, which quickly constructed its own giant sink hole. I also like this product since it is not as tall as the Novafoam was thus making it easier to get in and out of bed. One thing to consider if you are picky on how sheets fits, this is not an over tall mattress so my existing sheets fit overly big. Not an issue for me, as I just tuck it in around the mattress. To some that might be unsightly. I would rate this mattress currently a PERFECT TEN. Kudos to Tuft &amp; Needle for being able to make a product TOTALLY IN THE USA this good. They also stand 100% behind their product for A FULL TEN YEARS, which was the final nudge for me to make the purchase. Over half a million people have tried this mattress and 95% have kept it. That fact speaks for itself.
 I'm a buyer who's purchased a full sized mattress. Please note I'm an obese women and it's been about 2 months since my purchase... I think.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed in that my rear has caused a dip that's not bouncing back. This is exacerbating back misalignment and adding to my sciatica pain. I move around the mattress now (edges, turning mattress 'round, etc) in hopes that it will last until I can afford another mattress.<br/><br/>I went to an Air BNB home and had the most amazing mattress ever. I wish I'd checked it. I think it was a standard, not foam mattress. The point is, maybe this mattress (and similar types) aren't the best for obese people.<br/><br/>I may submit a photo when I can.
 My husband and I recently moved and decided to upgrade from a Queen to King.  We're hardcore Amazon shoppers, so we looked into the infamous Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses.  We were worried about what we would do if we wound up not liking the mattress.  The return policy is very generous (although I was worried about how we'd repackage it...) so we decided to go for it.  We were able to have the mattress shipped to our new home a day after closing.  Talk about convenient!  I didn't have to pack it on the U-Haul!<br/><br/>This mattress is extremely comfortable.  It took us a few days to really get used to it, but it's miles above our old Tempurpedic + memory foam topper combo.  We wouldn't trade it for anything!  If you're on the fence, go ahead and pull the trigger.  This bed is a perfect combination of soft and firm.  I like squishy beds; my husband's bad back requires firm beds.  Somehow this works for both of us.  It also doesn't transfer movement very much at all.  During the week he has to go to bed early for work, whereas I'm a night owl.  He no longer wakes up when I join him in bed because there's so little movement.  It's fantastic!
 Sorry to share this is the worst bed we’ve purchased. We are both fit and lean 35 years olds who know our sleep is very important to our health, but we have gotten less of that since purchasing this bed.<br/>Since sleeping on this bed we are both in severe pain and have chosen to return it and invest in a better made bed with a 20 year warranty (Intellibed)<br/>We researched many beds before buying this one but nothing compares to actually trying it.<br/>The Tuft and Needle bed does not form to or support curves and joints.<br/>My husband has never had back pain in his life and currently started getting back pain from sleeping on the T and N.<br/>Neither of us feel rested with this bed.<br/><br/>We have decided to invest in new mattress because sleep is way too important.<br/><br/>One star because the refund process was very easy.
 This showed up at my front door in an impressively small box...heavy though! My husband and I opened it, rolled it out, and opened the shrink wrap...it puffed up within a hour and we slept on it that night. We bought this after having a classic Tempurpedic for several years and it's been a good alternative to it. It is firmer and a bit bouncier than the Tempurpedic, which I like personally. The only negative is that even after a month, it is difficult to sit on the edge of it...your butt just kind of slides off the edge, very odd. I do not sink down into it like I did with the Tempurpedic either...I felt like that one used to "hug" my body and this one does not do that so much. Also, my husband has complained that it sleeps a lot hotter than our Tempurpedic did, but I think he should adjust like he did with that one. It will work out fine...for thousands less it is a great deal. I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend to someone looking for a firmer sleeping foam mattress.
 After nearly 3 months on the mattress i have found that it is not adapting as i expected. I find it quite comfy initially but that pressure points develop in the low lying areas after a short time and the pressure turns to pain and just keeps getting worse until i have to move or turn to relieve it.  My sleep tracker says i'm awake 3x more than i was before and i often wake up sore in the morning.<br/><br/>I'm 5'10'' 185 and usually on my back or side.  For reference i sleep fine usually on my back on hotel mattresses all the time without issue.<br/><br/>I ended up returning for a refund.
 Maybe this is just how it's supposed to be... but the edges of the bed are so soft that you can't even sit on the edge of the bet. it just smashes to a few inches and you slide off. This is my second foam mattress. Love my first one, this one not so much. Its much thinner. The sleep is fine. As expected for a foam mattress, but definitely not the raving experience I was expecting because of the advertising. I want to return it, but feels like more of a hassle because its only for my guests.
 We received two twin xl mattresses a week ago.  So far they are amazing.  My husband loves his.  It took my body a few nights.  I also love it.  I think maybe because I weigh less.  We have it on our adjustable bed and it does fantastic.  My husband's arms and hands no longer fall asleep in the middle of the night.  I actually wake up feeling very well rested.  My body does not hurt.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is easy to get out of the boxes and puffs out immediately. We let ours lay out for two days.  We only did that because we were waiting on our frames from another company.  I bought Twin Xl sheets from another company.  I went with a low thread count as I had read that is helps keep you cooler. It fits great and I'm not getting hot at all.  I hope this is helpful!!!!
 Wanted to really like this mattress but my arms keeps falling asleep when i sleep on my side and my wife hates it.  If you're petite, you will likely not like this mattress, as other reviews have stated (my wife finds it far too firm.)  I find it alright but have to change my sleeping patterns to not sleep on my side or I also find it too firm (135lbs..)  I've also fallen off a couple times awkwardly as the edges are quite soft.
 My relationship with this bed so far has been ... mostly good!<br/><br/>Setup was easy - the 'fumes' people talk about didn't bother me and were gone within a day. Watching it expand was like watching a piece of Jetsons-style technology; clunky but also sort of amazing? I slept on it the first night with no problems.<br/><br/>So speaking of sleeping in it - the first few times I laid in it I was like 'wow, this is comfortable!' and then a few days later I was like '...I GUESS this is comfortable?' I keep expecting it to be a little less firm, and I honestly am not sure I'd have chosen this level of firmness if I'd tried out a mattress before I bought it. It's nice, definitely not cheap or offensive, but I don't go 'ahh' when I lay down on it either.<br/><br/>But, this is why the whole thing is strange to me. It's DEFINITELY improved my quality of sleep by a lot. I fall asleep pretty quickly, stay asleep the entire night, and wake up feeling well rested. I find myself not feeling sleepy during the day or hitting any slumps in my energy. I don't toss and turn in my sleep anymore either; sometimes I wake up in almost the same position I fell asleep in. My old mattress was giving me kinks in my back, all of which are gone now. It makes good on all of its promises.<br/><br/>All in all I definitely can't dispute the facts; this mattress does not care whether it gets a 10 on my comfort scale or not, it is forcing me to get a good night's sleep on it. And you know, at the end of a long day, that's just one less decision I have to make for myself.
 First off, really like it, supports both myself (200#) and my spouse (petite).  Had it for about a week, no aches or pains that often come with a new mattress.<br/><br/>Minor issues:the mattress is about 1.5" thinner than our other mattress and we both feel like we are sleeping on the floor.  The box spring we have is designed for taller mattresses, so we need to buy a thicker box spring.  For me the heavy tall one, when sitting up in bed the mattress feels too soft, not terrible, just not the same support I'm used to. The wife loves it, so the issue is mine alone.  Of course we replaced that mattress from Costco (good mattress, too firm and didn't meet both our needs).  A minor quibble as I bought the mattress to sleep on.<br/><br/>Summary: the mattress is about 10" thick and our sheets actually fit, leaving none of the mattress exposed.  Supports great, loving it.
 This mattress was quickly delivered, easily set up, and has been wonderful to sleep on for the last 6 months.  My partner and I both love it and have never slept better, despite the fact we prefer slightly different firmness levels.  My only mild criticism is we live in a humid environment and it does seem to be warmer than it was advertised, but I believe that to be the fault of the climate, not the mattress. (Just be forewarned if you, too, live somewhere with higher humidity levels.)
 This is an Amazing mattress.  We have it on a hardwood bed platform and have been Very pleased.  It's hard to describe our typical good night's sleep anymore with regard to the mattress.  We use the term "Transparent" because it doesn't seem soft, or hard, or whatever.  It just seems right! - even for those "night time activities" are good.  We really, really like it.  This may be the best mattress for the price you can buy today...
 UPDATE: We've now had our mattress over a year. You cannot see any indents or dips in the mattress. We still love it.<br/>We were skeptical, but we had had it with traditional mattresses, furniture stores, and salespeople.  Only two years earlier we spent a chunk of change on at a highly reputable mattress manufacturer.  It was never supportive enough and we found, after only a few months, we were having trouble sleeping.<br/>After reading reviews and reading the Tuft and Needle guarantee, we made the leap.  Our mattress came quickly and was easy to unpack.  It wasn't long before it had expanded to a full queen size mattress.  From night one, it was heaven.  I was concerned that, as the months went by, we would notice sagging, indentations and loss of support.  More than 6 months later, I am happy to report that this mattress has continued to serve us well.  You can't feel much movement transfer, which is wonderful as I tend to stay up later than my husband.  You can sit on the edges and not sink.<br/>It still looks new.  No body imprints to be found.  Combined, we are about 375lbs and are tall, so we put some weight on it.<br/>Recently, we stayed at a hotel and the bed drove me nuts.  The springs made noise.  I could feel it every time my husband moved.  It was uncomfortable.  The bed was not old or of poor quality, it is just that when you become accustomed to a Tuft and Needle, it is difficult to sleep on anything else.<br/>I can't imagine we will buy a mattress from another company again.
 The not too soft and not too hard foam mattress made in the USA. I have bought foam mattresses before and hated them. You sink into them and feel trapped. Then they form to your body even when sleeping in a bad position that will put you in pain later. This does nothing of the sort. You are on top of it, not in it. You don't sink into it. Since there are no springs you won't find hard points of pressure with your should should you sleep on your side. I am happy with my purchase so far. I will update this review in 6 months.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have purchased two more beds for my children. Simply the best best ever made (at this point in my 48 years on planet Earth).
 This is our first memory foam mattress and I was fairly hesitant to switch from a traditional mattress for the simple fact that even when its less expensive it still isn't cheap and returning a mattress is not my idea of fun. That said I clicked the button and we purchased the queen with the intention to drop it on top of our old box spring. That lasted about 2 minutes. Our 15 year old bed had a bit of a bow in it and this formed right to it. Not the mattresses fault but a bit more money to get what we wanted out of this bed. Even if the box spring was perfect I would have still kicked in for a ridged foundation. ( another $400 from the local mattress shop ) This mattress on top of a box spring moved around a bit feeling a little floaty.<br/>How does it sleep?  I rotate from back to side and end up face down and this thing is way way comfortable in every position. I was worried I would feel mushed in when I sleep on my belly and its just not the case. My only note of something that I didn't expect is that the edges are a bit soft compared to a traditional mattress.  Not a big deal, I just moved in a little and it was all good.
 After 3 nights of sleeping- loving it!<br/>It came in a box as advertised, was bit of a pain to move the box up stairs and then we finally opened it. The mattress expanded within minutes on opening packaging. Super easy! It does have a chemical smell to it though, nothing overpowering. You won’t smell it while sitting on it but you will smell it when you lay on it, fading away every day but still there. The mattress is medium firm for us, I can not feel my husband moving around in bed either. Exactly what we were looking for, now it has to stand the test of time.. will update after a few months of using it.<br/><br/>Update Jan 2019<br/>After 7 months of using it, still loving it. Holding its structure quite well, great back support.
 Very good bed. I'd say it's​ more firm than I thought it would be, but it's still pretty soft to the touch. The top layer of foam is amazingly comfortable.<br/>Very good temperature control.<br/>Didn't notice any chemical odor.<br/>Easy unboxing<br/>The only issue with the bed is edge support, there is none.
 i guess you get what you pay for.  this mattress was too hot for comfortable sleep, and my partner and i both woke up with terrible neck &amp; back pain for the few nights we tried it out.  when i tried to return it, amazon wouldn't pick it back up, but encouraged me to donate it and gave me a full refund.  sounds great, until we ran into obstacle after obstacle donating.  many shelters do not accept king size mattress, and many also don't accept foam.  it was very difficult unloading this thing.  just beware- the "free trial" can come with problems.
 This mattress is AMAZING! I never feel when my husband moves or gets in/out of bed. I have had a great night sleep EVERY night since we bought this mattress. The temperature of the mattress stays cool at night (we also keep our bedroom really cold at night). Normal size bed sheets &amp; covers fit pretty nicely on the bed. I recommend putting a cover on the bed just to keep the foam protected.  The packaging is very easy to remove.<br/><br/>We use a frame with wood slats and no box spring. The bed has kept its shape well!<br/><br/>Also, the mattress was $150 cheaper on Amazon than on the Tuft &amp; Needle site! Loved the deal!
 I've had this mattress now for a week. I gotta say at first I was a little bit uneasy about buying a mattress online. I'm a very picky sleeper and I suffer from bad insomnia. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this mattress and they way it adjusts to my body weight. After so many months of looking and trying out mattress I'm so happy I took a chance and bought this one. Best purchase I've made. It's comfortable and it doesn't get hot during hot summer nights in Florida.
 High dollar purchases are always nerve wrecking without trying out the product or at least seeing it in person but after reviewing Tuft &amp; Needles return policy and reviews I decided to give this mattress a try and am so glad I did.  I sleep like a baby!  While firmness is subjective based on the person this mattress seems to hit a middle spot and I love it.  The most impressive quality to me is the ability to dissipate heat.  I live in LA and a massive heat wave just rolled through.  I live in a beach apartment with no AC and all the fans were sold out so I was out of luck but I still slept cool with this mattress.  After 2 months of use it has continued to impress!  it comes in a smaller package and does take 2-3 days to fully expand but I slept on in 6 hours after receiving it with no problems.
 Okay...it sounds silly. But for years, I could not sleep any more than 2-3 hours at a time. I'd wake up tired and my back would kill me. the first night I slept on it, I was in such a deep restful sleep that I overslept my alarm the next morning. It feels like I've been on a vacation or something.<br/><br/>It was easy to unroll and lay out on my bed. Pretty cool watching it puff up. in a matter of a few hours, it was ready. I've seen reviews of other people complaining about the off-gassing smell, and mine had absolutely none of that. No sagging, just perfect.<br/><br/>We'll see how it goes. It's only been a week or so, but wow.
 I have been sleeping on this bed for several weeks now and have gone from rolling around on a stiff bed to sleeping soundly all night. What a blessing. I have had several beds over the years and hands down this is the most comfortable bed I have slept on. When it arrived, it was easy to remove and expanded to the full height within hours. The first night I slept on it was like a dream and I couldn't believe it happened - I slept all night and not moved due to sore shoulders or knees. Since that first night, my body has become accustomed to the bed and I can sleep on either side without pain. Thank you for a marvelous product and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a good night sleep!
 So far it’s very comfortable, durability I’ll give a four because you cannot take off the outer shell to wash it so to me that’s not durable. I did recently purchase a Mattress Protector, that was unnecessary for the last mattress we bought like this as it had a removable one that was bedbug proof, waterproof, allergen proof, etc. plus the mattress was less expensive. But, we thought we’d try a different brand this time. It does have a good amount of time left on the sleep time warranty to see if we like it, so that is a plus! If you like a firm mattress this will be a great mattress for you. Our dog really likes it, he doesn’t even wake me up to go outside when I sleep in on the weekends!
 We bought two of these mattresses just under a year ago. I noticed right away they were a little soft but decided to try it out anyhow. After a couple months I realized they just were not working out but was past the 100 day trial window so kept it. Now almost a year in I can say for sure it’s not enough support. It works okay for my mom and daughter who are both around 100 lbs. However if you are pushing 170 or more, not so much. My husband woke up with backaches the couple nights he tried this mattress. Now that I am pregnant and need more support I am going to have to get a new mattress.
 It's been about 2 months since I got this mattress. At first it felt comfy, but it does not have great support. I thought this mattress was on a firm side, but that's not the case for me. Since I have been sleeping on this mattress, I continuously have neck pain. I tried using all kinds of pillows along with this b/c I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning this but never worked out for me. Not worth the price for me. I would rather get ikea mattress for less money or spend couple hundreds more to get higher end mattress like helix.
 Kool how a mattress now comes in a box!  Easy to unpack, no set-up required.  This is basically a thick foam pad.  It has quite a different feel from coils.  I find it comfy, supportive and not too warm.  My back still hurts in the morning, but I am not sure there is a mattress in the world that could fix that problem.  The only negative so far is that the sides are flimsy and thus not good for sitting on to get dressed.  Will have to move a chair into the bedroom.
 I was reticent to purchase a mattress I had never seen or laid upon.  However, I am really pleased with this mattress.  It came in a box that wasn't very big.  When we opened the box and put the roll on the foundation I thought I would be disappointed with the mattress.  However, the unwrapping was easy and the mattress fluffed up within minutes.  There was no off-gassing at all- ( we were prepared to sleep in another room for 2 nights but didn't need to.)  This mattress  was a little firm for me but not my husband.  We ended up putting our memory foam topper on top.  Now I sleep- not like a baby- crying every 3 hours.  I sleep like a teenager!  My back doesn't hurt at all for the first time in months.  I love this thing.
 Awesome bed! It is on the firmer side but I like medium-firm myself and it sleeps great. When the box came I kind of panicked thinking it was way smaller (width wise) than I was expecting but that was all in the packaging. Man they get that thing condensed down for shipping! Anyway, I got it unpacked and let it expand and air out some. The smell was really off-putting for me and it took about a week for it to completely air out with the windows open. Absolutely love the bed though! Would definitely buy again in the future.
 I'm 5'10 185lbs, my wife is 5'8 150lbs, we're not big people. I'm a back sleep and she sleeps on her side. For the first month the bed was not the most comfortable but from reading reviews, we thought it just need sometime to brake in. The 2nd month she started complaining about back daily pain. My wife is 29, workout 4-5 day per week, she in great shape she's never complained about back pain.<br/><br/>This bed is not for side sleepers. My wife is in pain daily.<br/><br/>Returned.
 I've slept for a little over a week on this mattress and so far it has been great. The comfort/support is fantastic for the price point. Additionally the graphite top layer must do something because I sleep hot - like... perpetual Dwarven smelting furnace hot - and I haven't woken up in the middle of the night sweating like I normally do. I really enjoy the lack of motion transfer, and the firmness is up there without feeling like a board or hurting my hips.<br/><br/>Unwrapping was easy, and there was little to no smell outside of pressing your nose into the mattress and taking a deep breath.<br/><br/>If you're a princess and the pea with mattresses, this may not be the one for you unless you can test it first, but if you're looking for a bang for your buck mattress this is definitely worth a try. I love it and enjoy falling into bed every night.
 Can'the say I liked it. The matress was about one foot shorter than standard size and too soft. Also, returning it has turned out to be almost impossible since it came vacuum packed and wIl not refit into original  box, nor do  commercial  shippers provide suitable boxes for this item.<br/>,
 The mattress is for my wife. I waited a month before commenting. She is on cloud 9. No pressure point problems, ie heels, hips, shoulders. She is not a back sleeper, however, that is how she wakes up, on her back. She has been able to fall asleep quicker, is more relaxed therefore better rested. She usually gets hot frequently during the night, but now she only gets a little warm. Covers off literally only one, two minutes, and back on covers. A much better restful sleep. She can not say enough good things. Cannot wait until I get my own. The only con about the whole purchase was after removing the plastic it came in, the mattress smelled like plastic for 3-4 days as we aired it out.  Our beds are the ones you can raise and lower the head and feet. The mattress goes right along. No problems with adjusting either. Great Find!!!
 There will be 2 parts to this review.<br/><br/>Part 1: This first part is for my shipping experience with UPS. When I ordered my T&amp;N king mattress it said that a signature was required due to the cost of the product I was receiving. That did not happen - my mattress was left in front of my house. I was not home at the time it was delivered but it was a good thing my little brother came home early to find the products just sitting there and was able to take it inside. That was just the beginning of a disappointing shipping experience - the second was how the package looked when it was shipped. I posted a picture of the T&amp;N box and how it looked when received - the box was damaged and I was scared the mattress was damaged as well. After trying to pick it up, the bottom of the package opened and the mattress almost fell out. I’m not sure who to blame for this, whether UPS on their poor execution with their delivery or with T&amp;N with the construction of their box. Like I said, I was definitely disappointed with the fact the my mattress was left in front of my house without signature and how the the package looked upon delivery. Thus, the reason I will be giving the review 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>Part 2: This second part is for T&amp;N. I was shopping around for a new mattress due to the current mattress I have and the back pain it was causing me. I have bad sciatic pain and my old mattress was probably the cause for some of that pain. It was down to T&amp;N, AmeriSleep (which was on the expensive side), Leesa, or Casper. After reading all the reviews it was down to Leesa or T&amp;N. I was leaning towards Leesa because they were giving out a free pillow with a purchase of a mattress (I am also in need of new pillows) and the price was decent. I chose T&amp;N because of all the positive reviews it received on Amazon. The video clip on Amazon actually convinced me that T&amp;N was all about customer experience and how they always look to improve their mattress. One recommendation is to probably put some plastic wheels on the bottom of the box so it can easily be transported without lifting and breaking or tearing the box. But otherwise, the mattress was set up the same night it was received and was definitely a night and day experience with my old mattress vs T&amp;N mattress. I’ve had it several nights now and I have less back pain sleeping on the T&amp;N mattress vs my old mattress. The second night, I actually slept for a good 8 hours straight without tossing and turning and waking up in the middle of the night. It was hard for me to get comfortable and because of the old mattress I was also in pain. After the second night I noticed my back pain was slowly getting better, though I still have some pain but it’s due to my sciatica and not the mattress anymore. Overall, I chose the right mattress and am very pleased with T&amp;N. Again, some recommendation regarding the box but definitely recommend this to anyone who is on a budget and looking for comfort.<br/><br/>Now, it’s a hunt to find a comfortable pillows to go along with my comfortable T&amp;N mattress.
 We cannot say enough how great this bed feels. It's firm enough to help ease the back pain my wife has felt for years, but still soft enough for us to feel like we are sleeping at a Marriot Grand.<br/><br/>We added a Fieldcrest Luxury topper from Target and bought new pillows. Now I honestly don't want get out of bed.
 I've had this bed for two years and it's been great. It's definitely a firm mattress which I love but I'm a side sleeper so bought a pillow top mattress protector and that did the trick. I've read some negative reviews about it getting out of shape but i haven't had that experience. Maybe because I bought with a Sleep Master Smart Box Spring and a Costco mattress protector and I rotate and flip every few months. It's worth the little extra work to save hundreds of dollars. Also this bed is by far the least stinky of all the bed-in-a-box. Seriously if you have never had a bed-in-a-box you might be in for a surprise on the smell. Anyway I aired it out and was fine within 24 hours. I've read other reviews and people say Nectar and Casper take weeks...ewwwww. So I recommend this bed. Best value for price.
 My wife was so skeptical about buying new mattress, but had some cash back on credit cards, so we decided to give it a try, after all there is 100day money back guarantee...we chose tuft and needle because it wasn’t 3000$ organic eco Matt, but at the same time they promise to be environmentally friendly and without any harsh chemicals, made in USA...<br/>Long story short, came as a giant really heavy roll up burrito, we unpacked it and had it sit for a day in a spare bedroom...<br/>After our first night we weren’t sure if we slept better...our bodies were a bit confused I guess, but hey...second night until today, it’s hard to get out of that bloody bed, it’s super comfortable, I can fall asleep in couple of minutes and my wife is 100% believer now,<br/>I would....we would definitely recommend this mattress
 So I have had the mattress for a couple of weeks now, and I not only is the mattress amazing, but I can't say enough good things about the company.  We recently moved, and our old mattress was not shipped correctly.  We had been in our new place for a couple of months and my wife and I were waking up sore and stiff everyday.  We decided to go with a foam mattress and at the recommendation of a co-worker, we went with this one.  I was worried about it being too firm when it arrived, and after a few nights, I emailed the company about the firmness.  They told me that there is kind of a break in period, but they also sent out a free topper.  The topper made it perfect!  I'm a side sleeper, and I'm pretty solidly built, so the extra couple of inches the topper provided was just right.  After a couple of weeks, both of us have zero back pain and stiffness.  I didn't think a mattress could make this much of a difference, but I will be buying again from this company.
 Sleeps nice and cool! I'm a very warm sleeper, so a cool-sleeping foam is very important to me. The soft foam layer prevents me from noticing if I'm making a dent - maybe it's even preventing a dent altogether.<br/><br/>I like mattresses on the firmer end - the T&amp;N is firm enough for me. The soft foam also prevents your legs from sliding too straight while you sleep if you're on your back. I've woken up on my belly and side on this thing a few times - super cozy, I love it.
 I love this mattress. I was on the fence about which manufacturer to order from, but then I had to move and didn't want to take an old mattress with me, and worry about having to get rid of it a few weeks after moving. Tuft &amp; Needle to the rescue. I ordered through Amazon, Prime let me know exactly when my package would be here.<br/><br/>The T&amp;N mattress is nice and soft. You don't sink into it like with memory foam mattresses. Instead, it's buoyant. You sit much more on the surface of the mattress than sink down low. I get the support I need as a side sleeper. This mattress sleeps cool and I don't have to worry about waking up covered in sweat. I can't say enough good things about it honestly. I'm sleeping better, I'm experiencing less pain and I'm incredibly happy with that I paid.
 Let me start off by saying this mattress is comfortable right out of the box. Unroll it, sit down on it, and you'll want to nap. It is perfectly medium.<br/><br/>The problem: It lacks structure. Upon unrolling the mattress and watching it expand I flopped on it. I immediately felt my hip hit the frame under the mattress because it compresses easily. And I only weigh 125 lbs. This lack of structure also leads to significant edge compression. I didn't notice significant compression when I slept on it since my weight was more evenly distributed, but you can forget letting your kids jump on this one.<br/><br/>And of course, foam sleeps hot.  If you run cold or live in Alaska, this might be the mattress for you. If not, or if you are a bigger person, you might want to keep looking.
 So my boyfriend and I are split on opinions of this bed. He prefers a firm mattress and loves it; but I am bony-yet-curvy and I have woken up with horrible pain in my shoulders, back, and hips almost every morning after sleeping on it for the past week. I'm now ordering a foam mattress topper, which isn't ideal because now it will be softer than my boyfriend likes. So frustrated. I waited and saved up for months to buy this bed after all the stellar reviews, but it just doesn't work for me at all.
 Arrived promptly. Box damaged in shipping but still difficult to open. I had bought a “pouch” from T&amp;N directly which was delivered intact and with 2 layer plastic wrapping as described which was easy to open and allow inflation. The mattress, unfortunately, did not have the outer plastic layer and the inner, thicker plastic containing the vacuum was heat sealed around the rolled mattress preventing it from unrolling properly and making extracting it from the packaging very challenging. Once freed, the mattress expanded well except for one corner which improved over the next few days. Smell is strong but diminishing. Very comfortable sleep. The mattress box foundation from T&amp;N seemed lower quality than one bought at the same time from another company. It was out of true and difficult to sink one of the corner pins. The wooden slats were a few mm too wide for the frame and did not sit flush despite the Velcro fasteners. One slat was broken, but with 12 slats total I chose to use the platform as is without trying to replace or repair it. Mattress seems stable on the platform. T&amp;N sheets are great: very soft and yet sturdy although the full size top sheet seems a little too short for the bed. T&amp;N pillows comfortable and supportive sleeping on back or side, cool all night, smell subsiding after about a week.
 Bought this item thinking it would be great. at first it seemed good. After sleeping on it for over a month both my husband and I started having weird pains. He had mid back pain and I developed severe hip pain. Neither of us thought it could be the mattress until several months passed and many, many chiropractor visits. I have not asked for a refund due to the fact it has been almost 10 months since our purchase. We are now looking a buying a new mattress.
 bought this mattress over a year ago. Hasn’t broken down at all that I can tell, and seems to be high quality. I’ve had a love/hate relationship with it since day one. The reason is, it is very firm. I thought after a few months of use it would soften up, but after 15 months it is still very, very firm. If you’re a back sleeper then it should be OK for you. Problem is, I am predominantly a side/stomach sleeper. I wake up in pain almost every morning. I toss and turn non stop because I can’t ever get comfortable. 3 stars because, like it said, it seems to be top notch quality.
 This mattress is just amazing. But whatever you do, don't try to sleep on it for 48 hours. That gives it time to regain it's intended shape and to get rid of the nasty smell it will have at first. We were ready to get rid of ours the first night because of the pervasive smell, but the second night, it was hardly detectable. By night three, it was gone. My wife and I are both side sleepers and we find it to be very comfortable. Much better than the $2000 mattress it replaces.
 After reading, reviewing, and watching various videos online about foam mattresses, I finally decided to go with this one. It’s been 3 weeks and I am not disappointed. Hopefully that doesn’t change over the course of time.<br/><br/>It came vacuum sealed, then wrapped, and arrived in a box where they include an info card, stickers, and a letter opener.  It’s very easy to unbox and the mattress is not crazy heavy (2 people to carry a twin up small flights of stairs).<br/><br/>The mattress is already pretty soft itself (at least in my opinion it was soft), but I topped it with a 4in gel memory foam topper. With both, I am now sleeping deeply and well overnight vs the years of tossing and turning with severe upper back/neck pain I experienced with my old spring mattress.<br/><br/>I’m a frugal minimalist, hence the twin size bed. It was incredibly affordable and I would recommend it for anyone in need of an affordable replacement.
 Impressively packed and easier to unpack than I had expected. I've slept on it one night so far and I was very comfortable. Previously had a queen size serta mattress with an extra memory foam pad on top that was stupid comfortable, but I needed a larger bed with my fiancee. The mattress yields, but it's firm enough that you don't sink in it. There is no chemical smell from the mattress. I'm hoping it lasts even half as long as my Serta, which I had since 1998. I'll update in 30-60 days or so.<br/><br/>**Update 01-06-2019**<br/><br/>The mattress has been great. No issues. Very comfortable. Great for any type of sleeping position. It is also refreshing not having to rotate/flip a mattress every six weeks.
 After having this for six months, I can say with certainty that I absolutely love this bed. Is it the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in my entire life? No. But that was a $3,500 bed. When my husband and I decided it was time for us to upgrade from our full-size bed, we quickly became discouraged by the prices we saw at mattress stores. For our budget, we assumed we would have to "upgrade" to a queen. But, thanks to Tuft &amp; Needle, we were able to get a king-size for less than our budget (which meant we could also afford new sheets and a new comforter and new pillows)!<br/><br/>I was amazed how quickly the mattress arrived, and how quickly it became full-sized (just a few minutes).<br/><br/>I love sleeping on this bed!
 Went to the Tuft and Needle store and tried out the mattress before purchasing.  If the warranty and the customer service is what they say it is this is a fantastic buy.  The mattress is very comfortable, my husband likes firm and I like medium, this fits both of our needs perfectly.  We get a good nights sleep.  Only had for a short time so we are hoping the mattress stays like this for years to come as advertised.  We ordered from Amazon so that we could order mattress pads and sheets all at the same time.
 After 6 months of complaining about her old mattress (which really was less than a year old) this morning my wife woke up with no complaints about a hurting back. We'll see how it goes because it seems like every mattress she's had in the past 20+ years has felt wonderful at first. The only exception was a Sleep Number which we up sized from Queen to King of a different brand.<br/><br/>Update-- No complaints for 6 months or so. However, things got to the point that my wife was spending half the night back and forth between bed and recliner chair. So, she did something she truly believed would not get her anywhere but she had to get it off her mind: she called Tuft and Needle. What a pleasant surprise! No hassle, no hoops to jump through, she didn't have to donate a body part. Customer service was extremely courteous. My wife has a new mattress and she's a happy camper.<br/><br/>I'll update next spring.
 Supportive ! even as a couple sleeping in the middle of the bed...no dips.  We spent over $6,0000!!! on our previous mattress. We noticed dipping in the middle right away. Within a year we had issues. The warranty got us nowhere! The Tuft &amp; Needle is one of the best mattresses we have ever slept on. This is a wonderful mattress. I cant believe i sleep so well and my husband feels the same even tho we are a short and tall couple. We love it !  Not to mention the very best price, quality and the philosophy of Tuft &amp; Needle. We own 3 now.  Two kings and a queen size. Our sister-in-law owns one and our mom as well. The T&amp;N pillows are also amazing! Really, you should give it a try.  Their return policy is excellent they do stand behind their product.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We have had our mattress for just about 3 years now and we still absolutely love it! We no longer use our mattress topper. There is no dipping in the middle (issue we have had with other mattresses in the past), very supportive. We recommend this to everyone. When the mattress comes in a box (compressed) one might think... no way is this going to be very good. I'm telling you, it is! :)
 My husband and I were suffering with backaches and decided our old mattress needed to go. After A LOT of research we went with the Tuft and Needle and have not regretted it one bit! The mattress has held it's shape VERY well with the two of us and our 100lb GSD sleeping most of the night with us. This mattress was by far one of the best purchases we have ever made and our backaches are GONE!!
 OKay, it was just night one. Of course, I will update this review after I have had the bed for a while. But I just received this bed yesterday, slept on it the first night, and slept the whole night through without waking up a single time. I can't even remember how long it has been (years!) since I slept through the night without waking up!<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the smell. I had to stick my nose up to the bed right after opening it to smell anything. I am chemically sensitive. Couldn't smell anything when I went to bed.<br/><br/>The mattress is supposed to fully expand in 72 hours. It will be interesting to see if it feels the same.
 We have had this mattress for about 4 months now (we bought the king size). WE LOVE IT! Our old mattress was pretty bad and hurt both my husband and my back. Upon reading the reviews, I saw a lot of people say it was softer than they were expecting. I had the opposite opinion, it was much firmer than I had expected (probably based on reading those reviews). One thing I will say is my husband loved it immediately, but I wasn’t sure about it at first. It probably took me a couple weeks to get used to the new feel of it, but once I did I am now IN LOVE with it. It supports in all the right places and is so comfortable. I barely notice my husband move or get out of bed. Also, I’m pregnant and in month 6, it’s been comfortable and supportive the entire time through my pregnancy so far! For the price and the quality of this item, I recommend it to everyone I know. I already convinced my best friend to buy one too and she had the same experience as me! Wasn’t sure at first but after a week or two she loves it too (and she has a hard time sleeping, so that’s really saying something). Plus I didn’t have to deal with mattress sales people and it was shipped right to my door. Couldn’t be easier or more pleased!
 I had a bad allergy to this mattress.....After reviewing both on Amazon and company website I decided to go. The company really has a great customer service which I appreciated really. Anyhow when I revived the package, after unpacking this chemical smell odor kind of covered the whole house. I aired out the mattress for 5 days the smell kind of went away a bit do I decided to sleep on it. The following morning I had bad allergy, my face , eye lids were all swollen and I only slept 6 hours or so and couldn't go back to sleep in the other room due to terrible headache and sinus/flu like symptoms . . When I checked online about poly foam and allergies, seems like I am one of those who have allergies. The smell itself gave me headache the entire time. When I called the company they were nice though. I got it through Amazon so plan to call for a pick up service And return this soon. I wanted to write this review in case there are out there who are sensitive to chemicals like myself... The company was nice when I talked to them about allergy issue
 Aww man! It's awesome. I was weary about buying a mattress online, but all of the reviews and "research" I did pushed me towards my decision. I'm very happy with my purchase. How much was this mattress? about $650 with tax? The cost was pretty low compared to the other mattresses I was looking at. I wanted a foam mattress and I really liked the ones I tested in store at the mattress outlets. The prices were up in the thousands there and I almost committed, BUT, I'm glad I didn't. I compared the materials used in the tuft and needle vs the ones I liked instore and they were pretty close. That's why I took the dive.<br/><br/>This mattress is comfy, for me. It's really firm. My family members tested it out and compared it to sleeping on a rock, but I think it's very comfy. I love it. I've slept great these past couple days. Maybe it cured my bad attitude I was having lately. A good sleep really helps and I attribute that to this mattress, the Tuft and Needle.<br/><br/>Thank you
 I could not be more thrilled with this mattress!  We loved it so much, we purchased 2 more for guest bedrooms. In the midst of moving, we had sore muscles most nights.  However, after sleeping on our T &amp; N mattress, we awoke refreshed and pain free!  I'm not sure the company can claim medical advancements in their mattresses, but they certainly benefitted us in unexpected ways. The convenience of having the mattresses delivered to our front door are added bonuses.  We love our T&amp;N mattress!!
 One of the reasons I chose to go with the Tuft and Needle mattress was due to the glowing reviews posted by so many people in the past. It seems the company would go the extra mile to make you comfortable by giving you some options. Some people elected to return the mattress while others received a mattress topper or a least a discounted topper from Tuft and Needle. My wife and I both have some sports injuries and it seems the mattress is a little too firm for us to sleep comfortably without frequent tossing and turning. I was disappointed to find out I'm on my own, as least financially, to find a fix for the mattress in order to get the sleep we are hoping for. I guess that's what happens when the big businesses buyout the smaller, customer focused companies.
 We ordered the full size option.<br/><br/>Packing was great, came on time, no issues. Setup was easy and let it air for a bit as has that "new" mattress smell.<br/><br/>Soft mattress - I've seen a few reviews saying firm but not the case. It's very nice, good for a side and back sleeper. Quality is good and my son has been sleeping very well.<br/><br/>Satisfied with my purchase.
 The bed is super heavy! We got a king. Easily unpackaged.<br/>Smell is very strong the first couple of days. Stay out of the room if you don’t want a headache.<br/>I have slept on this bed 4 nights so far. It is super duper firm. It’s about as hard as sleeping on the floor would be. Hoping it’ll soften up to a medium firm, if it doesn’t- it’ll be returned.<br/>I feel like the description of the “feel” of this mattress was vague in the listing.
 Bought this mattress after a lot of researching between different online brands brands (Leesa, Ghost, Casper, Purple).  Not knowing what to expect, I crossed my finger and prayed for the best...<br/><br/>So it arrived a day earlier than the expected arrival date which is always welcomed.  My girlfriend and I put together the new Zinus bed frame quickly last night (Great frame btw) and started unpacking the mattress.  The unit is a lot heavier than it looks; you'll have to understand, this is still a king size, memory foam mattress.  So even though it's rolled up in a nice tall box that made it easier for moving/transportation, it is still fairly heavy and requires two people to move it about.<br/><br/>After opening the mattress, it did not immediately expand into a full king-size which made us worried a little (the box didn't help by marking the wrong size, but a quick google search on the mattress tag resolved that issue).  After about an hour or so, the mattress started occupying the empty spots on the bed platform.  We did not notice any strong odor or, it's very subtle and bearable.  It's not too firm in fact, it felt a little soft for us as we're coming from coil spring mattress but this does still provide a very nice support and feels so good to sleep on.<br/><br/>We had a great night sleep on this and would say this is a keeper
 I had a very bad experience. I’m a tree trimmer who has some back issues and I thought that this would be a good product based on the reviews. The mattress didn’t inflate fully on one side and I was incredibly disappointed with the support. My back pain actually got significantly worse and I ended up sleeping on my friends old boxspring mattress. Thank God Amazon has awesome customer service and refunded me the money! They were very easy to deal with and I’d buy through Amazon again but I wouldn’t go through Tuft and Needle.
 We bought this mattress hoping to alleviate years of neck and back aches; truly  trying to avoid neck surgery.  We have had  a sleep number mattress for about 10 years. My back and neck problems were getting worse and scary with numbness in my legs.  Already had lumbar surgery years ago.  I am so thankful for this mattress!  The problems with my spine have disappeared .  Also, it is not a foam mattress that makes you sweat .  It simply provides a very comfortable good night's  sleep.  I rarely write reviews but felt the need to share the results I've  had with the Tuft, &amp;Needle  mattress.  I highly recommend this mattress!
 Bought this bed a day before Black Friday and then it dropped 75$ in price the next day. So I ended up paying full price, and not getting any money back which I was okay with at first. When I received my mattress and pulled it out of the plastic it looked like it had two stains on the brand new mattress. For a brand new product this there should not be any signs of this product being touched, especially since it is vacuum sealed shut on arrival????. The bed isn’t bad, it is a bit firm but if you just get a mattress topper with it you will be good to go. All in all I like the bed and will keep it, just wish I would have received the discount for the difference since the product went on sale a day after I bought it. It also would have been nice to open a brand new mattress with no stains right out the box. I will be calling their customer care to see what can be done. Pictures of stains are attached.
 I was very apprehensive trying this mattress because I have scoliosis and osteoporosis and a lot of accompanying back pain. I have always had a very firm mattress and was afraid this wouldn't give enough support, but I have never slept better. For me, this mattress gives the perfect blend of comfort and support, and I am thankful for the 100-day trial period offered which allowed me to place my order without anxiety.
 Pros: Delivered quickly and was easy to set up.<br/><br/>Cons: This bed is extremely hard-- I would give it a 9/10 firmness. Terrible if you are a side sleeper-- you will not be able to fall asleep. Sleeping on back is ok, but the mattress is so hard I am completely tensed up as I try to fall asleep. If I wake up in the middle of the night it is next to impossible to fall back asleep. I have no idea how this mattress has so many positive reviews. Maybe I got a weird batch, but this is horribly uncomfortable. Absolutely would not recommend. Will update this review if customer service is satisfactory.
 Matresses are tough to rate- this was high quality and a good price, but it was too soft for me. And I bought it because it was supposed to be the firmest of all the beds in a box, something like a 7 out of 10?  If that's true, then my beloved Tempurpedic is a 20 out of 10. Other may love it, just didn't give me enough support.
 I was very nervous about how plush this would be but it is perfect. I love this mattress. It definitely does not make *activities* more difficult or hinder excessive movement. Get this mattress. Smile. Enjoy. Sleep.
 I purchased this mattress with almost zero knowledge of foam mattresses and I'm glad I did. I had an $800 Sealy Innerspring in the cart and was about to go through with my purchase but saw Tuft &amp; Needle show up in the recommended section. The Consumer Report rating caught my attention and the $450 price sold me (20% off for Black Friday). The 100 day trial was great for peace of mind too! I will say that coming from sleeping on a sunken hand-me-down mattress with a huge down pillow top, it took me about 3 days to get used to a firm mattress -- I had some initial back pains that made me a bit concerned. After a few weeks, I can safely say that I'm sleeping well and I'm very happy with this purchase. I paired with <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-Upholstered-Button-Tufted-Platform-Bed-with-Wooden-Slats-Queen/dp/B00W4DCHUC">Zinus Upholstered Button Tufted Platform Bed with Wooden Slats, Queen</a>, also a good quality product for a reasonable price.
 This mattress was a gift from my parents. I called them and asked if they would give me this as a combination Christmas/birthday gift. They looked at it and asked if I was sure this was what I wanted, because something like this should cost four times as much. I smiled (having done extensive research) and said, "Yes, this is the one I want."<br/><br/>The mattress showed up a day earlier than expected  in a compact box WITH HANDLES that I - a 46 year old 5' 4" woman - was able to move easily by myself. I slid the rolled-up mattress out of the box onto my bed frame, cut the plastic, and it magically turned itself into an extremely comfortable mattress. I can sleep on my side again without shoulder pain forcing me onto my back. I wake up without hip pain from uneven support. This is definitely a firm mattress, but if you prefer something ploofier, you can put a topper on it. It's easier to make a firm mattress softer than to make a soft mattress firmer!<br/><br/>My only suggestion (as the T and N folks seem to read these reviews) is about the plastic wrapping. You're meant to cut the outer wrapping first, position the mattress, then cut the inner. However, since they are both clear, I couldn't find the separation and ended up cutting both at once. Maybe different colors of plastic, or some sort of paper separator?  I was able to get it quickly shifted into place before it expanded too much, so no harm done. Just a suggestion for the future. Taking a sharp object to a brand new foam mattress is scary enough, after all. :)<br/><br/>tl;dr: It's super comfortable and reasonably priced. Love it!
 We absolutely LOVE this mattress!! We decided to make the switch from a traditional mattress and box springs to foam. We did alot of research because most foam mattresses either eat you, or make you sleep hot....or both. Now, if you are doing what we did, going from a traditional to foam, you will need a few nights to adjust. This mattress is soft, yet has a lot of support. My boyfriend suffered from shoulder pain, but has not had it since sleeping on this bed. We are both back/side sleepers, although it is comfortable in any position. I would recommend. However, be aware if the trial period is important to you, amazon only offers a 30 night trial as opposed to the 100 night trial you get from ordering from the actual tuft and needle website. However, i believe that if you did not like sleeping on it, it would not take 100 days to figure that out. No off-gassing with this mattress, at least we didn't. Actually had no smell at all and was able to sleep on it the first night!
 Like most people, I was skeptical about buying a mattress I've never laid on but I decided to give it a try.  I've had the mattress for about 8 months now and I LOVE it.  It felt really hard at first but I quickly got used to it.  I have ankylosing spondylitis in my back and hips and this has actually helped my back and hip pain.  It's so comfortable that I can't sleep on regular mattresses when we stay in hotels now. I toss and turn all night on any other mattress I sleep on.  I bought it when the Cal King was $750 and I don't even care that they dropped the price since then.  The mattress is worth every penny and I highly recommend trying it.  Like others have stated, the set up was super easy, package came quickly and I'm 100% a customer for life now.
 This product offers neither pressure relief nor support as claimed. It is like sleeping on jello. Perhaps the one I received is defective, I do not know. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Tuft-Needle-Twin-Mattress-Bed-in-a-Box-T-N-Adaptive-Foam-Sleeps-Cooler-with-More-Pressure-Relief-Support-Than-Memory-Foam-Certi-PUR-Oeko-Tex-100-Certified-10-Year-Warranty-Made-in-USA/dp/B00QBZ26D2">Tuft &amp; Needle Twin Mattress, Bed in a Box, T&amp;N Adaptive Foam, Sleeps Cooler with More Pressure Relief &amp; Support Than Memory Foam, Certi-PUR &amp; Oeko-Tex 100 Certified, 10-Year Warranty, Made in USA</a>
 Bed sleeps great. Came rolled up (compressed). I unfurled and then opened the plastic to let it decompress. We let it air out for two nights before attempting to sleep on it. No noticeable smells, and slept great from the first night.<br/><br/>We are a bit concerned that the head of the bed is starting to form "softer" spots where we lay, but it's still in that "I can't really tell" area as of right now. We've had two mattresses form these divots before (she's a slim 130 at 5ft 8in and I'm an average 185lbs at 6ft) and were concerned that this one would have the same problem.<br/><br/>We are now many months after our purchase, so I'm still very pleased with the quality as of right now.<br/><br/>Will update if major divots form.
 After owning it for over a month, I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of my sleep. I have slept better with fewer aches and pains than I did on my $1700 mattress. My only complaint is that the mattress is almost too cool--I like to be cool when sleeping, but this mattress doesn't quite insulate like standard mattress. We are looking at getting a heated mattress cover.
 We received this yesterday and slept on it last nite. The box itself is quite large, approximately 2' x 2' x 4', and quite heavy. Lifting it is a 2 person job.  Setting up the mattress was VERY COOL! You have to be quick opening the plastic, as one small hole in the plastic, will cause the mattress to begin expanding. It only took seconds for it to expand.<br/>Now, to the mattress itself...At first glance, testing it after it was set up, it felt very comfortable. However, sleeping on it is a different story. It is a very firm mattress. Some reviewers compared it to concrete. This is an exaggeration. While it is firm, it is by no means like sleeping on concrete. If you prefer your mattress on the soft side, however, I concede it could feel similar to something as hard as concrete. For me, it may be that I was simply used to my cruddy, old coil mattress. It was nice to have something with a bit of support.<br/>I slept better last nite than I have in months, thus the 5 star rating. The mattress seemed to support the body in all the right areas.<br/>Overall this is a good mattress. It may take some people a bit to get used to the firm support, especially if you are used to a traditional coil mattress.<br/><br/>After 6 nights...<br/>I am absolutely sold on this mattress!! I sleep much more soundly, with less tossing and turning. While it is firm, that term may be a bit misleading. I would say supportive is a better description.<br/><br/>I would and will buy again, for other bedrooms in my home, when it comes time to replace the mattresses.
 This is like sleeping on a thick carpeted floor,i tried to give it the the benefit of the doubt,i even missed the return deadline because i did not want to have to pick the heavy thing up and carry it through the house again hoping it would get better.I hate returning things and i called the company early on thinking they could help me in some way like a offering to send me some other form of soft topper,but no help.So i am left with the rock,which i carefully read through a lot of reviews and a lot of people gave it 5 stars even though they said it was to hard and they had to put a topper on it?I am hoping it softens some as the warmer weather arrives or i feel it will be delegated to the spare bedroom,call it what it is,to firm.Only good thing is it does not sleep like a block of ice like the first bed i bought off of here 5 years ago,a memory foam with cool gel that would freeze you in the winter and make you sweat like pig in the summer,spring and fall it was comfy,go figure.Seems like your playing russian roulette when you buy a mattress from Amazon,you never know which one is a hit or miss,and this was my third and most likely the last from here.Goodluck.
 I've been sleeping on my Tuft and Needle mattress for a little over 2 months now and I love it! I was wary of purchasing a mattress online without trying it out first but I have no regrets at this point. I sleep through the night without waking up to reposition and the back pain I have from an old injury doesn't hurt nearly as much as it did. (It's not completely gone but Tuft and Needle aren't doctors so I won't blame them for it).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this mattress for anyone adventurous enough to buy a mattress online.
 It’s a miss for me.  We have run through most of the major brands and this came up short.  Specifically, the top foam layer is very light feeling and bottoms out on the next layer, which is very hard.  This was unexpected... but was resolved by putting a Novaform topper on the bed.  So now we’re back up to a total of about $1,000 🤨<br/>The bed in a box isn’t usually a gamble, but this didn’t work out as expected.
 I had planned to write my review after the original 100 days. As life goes though things got busy and here we are over a year later. Never the less here is my one regret. I regret not purchasing another already for my daughter. This has been the best purchase I’ve made on amazon. The mattress shows absolutely no wear, saggy, etc... I’m a bigger guy and this sleeps wonderful.
 OK, I purchased two of these guys... do I get to give them 10 stars? I normally don't write reviews unless I'm not happy with the product or service,  and if I do write one, it's usually after a few weeks to make sure the product doesn't fall apart. In this case, I'll just say right upfront -  This product is awesome, and so was the service. I was secretly hoping I wouldn't like the first one, just to see how Amazon was going to get it back. It arrives compressed in a box that obviously wouldn't work for returns. I guess I'll never know.<br/>I was used to my old mattress "Willie Lump Lump", but this T&amp;F mattress is sooooo much better. A little firmer than my old one, but not too hard. Seems to be a little warmer than the old one which is fine at least during the Winter months. Setup was easy. It works better with two people, but I managed the second installation by myself and I'm 74.<br/>The only drawback to purchasing off the internet is nobody comes to setup and take away the old materess... something included in the price of the store bought brands $$$, I'd just as soon save a few bucks and haul the old guys to the dump. Again, it's a little exercise but it's not going to kill me.<br/>If you need a new matteress... what are you waiting for?  enjoy
 Well... after about a week we found that no matter what we do the mattress just isn't working for us.  I, at first, was taken aback at the return policy Amazon was sending me through to return the mattress.  After calling Tuft and Needle they provide information on how to contact Special Handling and from there the return was smooth sailing.  While this mattress didn't work for my husband and I we both agreed that it is a very nice product at a great price.  I only give the mattress three stars as it didn't work for us... I would give the Tuft and Needle customer service and Amazon return process 5 stars.
 We tried foam because our spring mattresses sunk in a ton and were causing back pain. I roll around a lot at night, start on my stomach/side and usually end up on my back. My husband sleeps on his back usually like a log. We tried this because it was a firmer mattress but it did not help my back pain. It actually made it worse, my back still hurts but now my side was starting to hurt and I found myself lying on my arms in ways that made them "go to sleep." My husband also didn't like the mattress and was tossing and turning a lot.
 I was scrolling through my past orders and saw I had not left the review for this mattress. We bought it two years ago and it's been by far the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. We ended up getting a pad for it because my fiancé prefers a softer mattress, but if it were up to me I would not use the pad. However, it's very comfortable with or without it. Highly recommended.
 I've had this matress for about 4 months. Easy to unbox and set up, it expanded evenly. There is a bit of a smell but its not so bad and goes away after a couple of weeks. I have scoliosis and wanted a firmer more supportive mattress and this has been good so far. No issues with sinking sitting on the edge and there are no dips or indents so far in my normal sleeping spots. The only thing I have to say that is not so much an issue with the mattress but me personally is that I'm naturally a small person weigh around 108 so i don't quite sink in to experience the full benefit of the mattress technology and benefits. Regardless I sleep well and wake up rested so I'm happy.
 This mattress is for my 5 year old.  She's been sleeping on it for less than a month, but so far so good.  It aired up right away after taking the vacuum seal off and she was able to sleep on it that night.  It had a slight chemical smell when we first opened it, but that dissipated quickly.  My only "complaint" would be it seems to have weak edges - meaning if I sit on the edge of the bed to rub my daughter's back or read a story, it collapses and is uncomfortable for me.  It seems to provide great support.  Occasionally my hubs and I will both lay in her bed with her to read her a book and we all feel comfortable and supported on this mattress as long as we aren't right on the edge.  Overall we are extremely happy with our purchase so far.
 I was extremely excited to graduate from my Twin XL to a queen size bed for my new home. Moving is expensive enough...and I was researching bed brands like Casper and Leesa and preparing to make a big investment. I stumbled upon Tuft &amp; Needle from a Google ad after researching those brands, and I loved their story about disrupting the mattress industry and their outrageous price markups. The fact that the bed came in a box, vacuum sealed, was terrific for moving. I unboxed in my new home, and the bed sprang to life instantly. I prefer a somewhat firmer mattress for better back support for my herniated discs, and I thought the firmness was just right. The first night was a little stiff, but it continues to get more comfortable as a I break it in. It also has some nice bounce for no springs, and you don't feel like you're drowning in foam. My only drawback is that it was promised to have superior air flow and cooling capabilities, which I think are just OK. Hard to tell if that's the bed, or my new sheets, or just the weather in general that's affecting my temperature at night. Bottom line, I would highly recommend this product! Also, you have 100 nights to decide if you like it, so there's nothing to lose by trying it out!
 This mattress has changed my life!  I do not wake up sore and tired as I did with my old mattress. I also fall asleep faster and stay asleep all night. I used to struggle with severe insomnia and chronic fatigue. I thought that was the way I was wired and did not dream it was my mattress. The price is very affordable and the quality is superb. It was a bit of a struggle to unpack the Queen by myself but I was able to sleep on it the first night without any wait time for expanding.  You will not be disappointed with this mattress. I highly recommend! Thanks T&amp;N. Please keep up the excellent work &amp; I wish you continued success!
 We really wanted to like this mattress, but are very thankful for the 100 nights. My husband and I both had sore backs after sleeping on this mattress.
 I haven't slept straight through the night for years, literally. I'm usually wide awake at 4am, then I do the "deep sleep jitters" until I give up. That's when you slam into stage 4, then SLAM awake 20 minutes later, feeling nauseous, then slam back to stage 4 and repeat. Add to that the back pain when I finally give up and get up - that's usually 5:30-6am.<br/><br/>This mattress showed up on Friday, and I've slept straight through the night the last two nights. I am *THRILLED* beyond belief.<br/><br/>I've toyed with "foam toppers" before, but this is a much different, a much deeper, experience.<br/><br/>BUY. IT. NOW. It's truly life changing.
 I purchased two twin XL for a king bed.  One is comfortable, the other  impossible to sleep on.<br/>I wish to take advantage of the 100 day return policy for an exchange.  It seems that Tuft and Needle Matress has just had a policy change and if you purchase from Amazon, you are on your own as far as returns are concerned.  We are two old people who have no means of boxing and returning that defective matress to Amazon.  Buyer beware! There is no 100 day trial...you are just stuck.
 Based on our kids recommendation we purchased this mattress a few months ago through Amazon. Love the super quick delivery and set up. We were worried about the smell but did not experience that at all.<br/><br/>Honestly the first month my husband and I were pretty happy with the mattress. However in the last two months are noticing that we are waking up with sore shoulders, back and neck pain.  At first I thought it was just me and maybe my pillow but I have purchased 3 different sets of pillows  and found that we are still uncomfortable.<br/><br/>At this point I am not sure what to do.<br/><br/>I plan to call the company to see what if any options I have since we are 10 days over the 100 day return policy. We are looking for any recommendations to make our experience more comfortable.<br/><br/>Looking for a good nights sleep.
 So, we actually ended up returning our Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. But the process from start to finish was SO easy, and mattresses are subjective, right? I feel like it's a high quality mattress with great materials. Our only issue is that we decided neither of us like memory foam mattresses. We tried it for a week and I am so tired from tossing and turning that I finally gave up. I still think you should give this mattress a try if you like memory foam, and a slightly firmer mattress that sinks in as you lay there. They have an amazing guarantee...if you don't like it, call Amazon Customer Service Special Handling Department and they will refund your money and help you handle your mattress.
 We were a little nervous buying something like this online. I mean who buys a mattress online, especially from a company we have never heard of. WE did a ton of research, reading reviews etc, and made the plunge. The trial guarantee really made us feel comfortable with the purchase. We have now had this mattress for months , and its been great. Not sure I have ever slept on something so comfortable that was still supportive. If this thing ever wears out, we will be buying another.
 LOVE THIS BED! It is so comfortable.  on the firm side but it gives to your weight without allowing you to sink into a hole.  I've had it for about 6 months and still look forward to sleeping on my new mattress.  If you set it up by yourself, be aware that it is heavy, and maneuver it into the space and onto the frame BEFORE you unwrap the plastic around the mattress.  There was a slight odor to the mattress from the plastic wrapping, it wasn't too bad 5 hours after I set it up, but the longer you can let it air out the better, I didn't notice it at all the next day.
 I was a hesitant about ordering a mattress online without trying it first. I decided to go for it since the mattress is so highly rated. I must admit, that I was a little surprised at how much I liked it right away. I had no issues falling asleep. I tend to toss and turn a lot in my sleep, and the mattress is made so that your partner doesn't feel the movement. Needless to say, my wife is now sleeping like a baby. The mattress also keeps cool, so it's great to not feel so hot at times when staying in the same spot for too long. My wife wants to put a mattress top on it, but I'm a little against it. I think it'll take away from it, but we'll see. Overall, solid buy, and you can't go wrong with the price.
 I have to admit that I was nervous for a few days after ordering a new concept mattress online without testing it out. But I had nothing to worry about.  The first night we slept on it, both of us didn't want to get up.  This outperforms products of substantially higher prices.  Do your back a favor and have this delivered to your doorstep and roll it out for a satisfying night of sleep.  Make sure you get a modern base, I bought a Zinus SmartBase.  Please read the bio on the company that produces an excellent product at a fair price.
 Got it as a first bed for my toddler. It's a really good proportion of soft and firm (not that I'm a professional mattress comparer, but to my untrained back, it's just right), it's super comfortable, and it's been a game-changer for actually getting him to sleep alone in his room. I was kinda worried if it would fit in his twin toddler bed okay (it's kinda a raised-platform bed), but it does, and it's been perfect. Every time we've laid down on it, it's always comfortable for us as well. Delivery was prompt and hassle-free, and the box was very nice.
 I wasn't sure how a bed-in-a-box would go for me, and landing on this T&amp;N base model took a lot of research and internal debate. But this mattress was definitely the right choice!<br/><br/>I still sleep great on it. I like a balance of cooling but insulating while sleeping and this mattress still keeps me just the right temp. I don't get sweaty during my sleep, I can comfortably roll around and sleep on my side, I don't feel like I'm sinking too deeply into it but it isn't too firm either. I don't need any additional padding as I did with my old harder mattress. I am one happy camper!<br/><br/>For reference: I'm a female, 5'5", 145 lbs, typically side sleeper and I move around a lot, usually run a little hot as opposed to most women running cold
 I was hesitant to buy a mattress online, but after reading other's reviews of Tuft &amp; Needle I decided to take a chance. I couldn't be happier with my decision. This mattress has the right amount of softness to conform to every curve of your body, but firm enough to provide great support. I no longer wake up with a stiff back and the quality of my sleep has improved dramatically. I would repurchase again and again!
 For the first few nights on this mattress I was worried that it was a bit too soft, but that was before I put it onto a bed frame with about ten or eleven wooden slats for support. I have been satisfied with the mattress since then, and it has been a great value. I am considering getting a boxspring because my bed frame is very low to the ground, and I'm not sure how that will affect the firmness. Overall, it is not super-firm, but does provide a nice sleeping surface.
 This full size mattress was a great purchase, although I'm disappointed that I just missed a $50 price reduction. I researched several brands of online/rolled/boxed foam mattresses, and I read that Tuft &amp; Needle might be too firm for smaller people. Coincidentally, I'm right at the given "smallness" borderline of 130 lbs, and I have no complaints. The foam top hugs the body a little without making you feel like you're sinking. It's actually not an extremely firm mattress -- seems like medium firmness to me. Overall, Tuft &amp; Needle seems like the best deal around. (IKEA's foam mattresses are cheaper, but much thinner and lower rated. Plus they charge a lot for delivery.) Unrolling the mattress was easy, and it's really fun to watch it expand. It's nice to have a thick/tall mattress like this, because I use a slatted bed frame and no box spring. I've been sleeping well. My only problem is not wanting to get up in the morning because I'm too comfortable. I'm also happy to support an Arizona company that treats customers well and donates the returned mattresses. (Plus it's made in the USA, unlike the brands of a certain family that is currently promoting "Made in America Week." Make mattresses great again!)
 First of all, I was shocked when the mattress was delivered in one day despite being told it would arrive in 2-3 business days. Secondly, I am a small person so I thought I would struggle with the unboxing. I was once more floored to discover the ease by which I could drag the mattress onto the bed and that was the end of that. After cutting both plastic layers-- they included instructions-- I watched the mattress inflate itself as thought by sorcery. Lastly, I have never experienced such comfort, I woke up well rested without aches and pains like I had been accustomed to. Best Mattress Ever! Don't hesitate, just buy it.
 We bought this for our 5yo who was complaining about the cheap spring mattress on his top bunk. He is very happy with this new one.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>- comfy<br/>- firm but not hard<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- its heavy. i find it hard to change the sheets since its on the top bunk and the mattress is heavy to lift<br/>- its a bit bigger than our last twin mattress again making the sheets a bit harder to get on. There is still room between the bed frame and the mattress, but just not as much. I have to wedge my fingers in there a bit to get the sheets on.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd recommend it. We chose it for the price, the fabulous return policy and it's promise to be toxin free.
 I love my Tuft &amp; Needle.  I read all of the reviews before I purchased my bed. I read it felt like forever.  I even read the consumer reports reviews on all of the memory foam beds. First before anyone says that this is a fake review maybe you need to read everything before you make an educated purchase.  My husband and I love our bed so far.  We even purchased a new frame for our mattress https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B075YWKLR5/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12.  I have arthritis in my spine and have tons of issues sleeping on the traditional innerspring mattress to the point I couldn't even sleep with my husband.  I don't have the issues where I wake up in immense pain to where I could hardly walk.  I don't care what the negative reviews say about the "Fake" reviews.  We have had our mattress 3 months and we love it still.
 Purchased this mattress based solely on reviews and stellar return policy - It did not disappoint. We had our previous queen mattress for 8 years and it was DEAD - we were both sleeping so poorly by the time this guy arrived and it has changed my life! After a week of slightly firm breaking in period, this mattress is heaven. I am a person who pops out of bed in the morning, and only uses my mattress for sleep (no lounging etc.) but after having this mattress, I have to fight the urge to crawl back into bed when I get home from work. SO COZY!
 We have only had this mattress for a little over a week. So far both my wife and I have woken up with back pain each morning.  We are hoping that our bodies are just getting used to this kind of mattress. We had a spring/pillowtop mattress before and we really want to like it this mattress.  My wife also sleeps hot and noticed that the mattress seems to hold her heat so that she has to more around frequently to find cool spots.  Hoping it gets better soon.
 After extensive months of researching for beds that fit both mine &amp; my girlfriends sleeping needs we decided to go with the T&amp;N over the purple mattress.<br/><br/>Now this bed is more on the Firm side it still offers great support and softness at the same time. If your looking for a softer bed this might not be the choice for you.<br/><br/>Why this bed is great, I sleep in all positions side, back &amp; stomach constantly turning throughout the night and this bed has forever solved my back and shoulder pains and it’s only been two weeks!<br/><br/>My girlfriend stated the bed was a bit to firm for her so I reached out to T&amp;N and they sent me a topper free of charge! Customer service is beyond my standards.<br/><br/>Overall happy customer!<br/><br/>Key things<br/>- No Odor after removing from package<br/>- No mold as stated on other reviews<br/>- Expanded to size perfectly<br/>- Not as firm as the earlier reviews T&amp;N has made changes since their first mattress.<br/>- Not for you if your looking for a soft bed that passes the egg test.<br/>- Perfect for the price<br/>- Great for all sleeping positions<br/>- Excellent customer service<br/>- Dog approved!
 We’ve been sleeping on our new mattress for about a week now. So far so good! Unlike some reviews, I didn’t notice any particular smell when opening it unless I was super close to the mattress. I did give it a few days to expand/air out before sleeping on it so maybe that helped too. It has been super comfy so far, I like the double layer of firm/soft foam. Both my husband and I like a medium firm mattress, and I would say that is what this mattress is. I’m interested to see how it holds up over the months/years to come!
 The mattress itself is good, it's not the best mattress I've slept on since it's more firm than I like, but for the value I'd say it's good. As far as quality goes I'd recommend it and buy it again.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that the mattress is actually not the size it's listed under. We purchased a king sized mattress, which is listed on their website as 76" x 80" x 10" but what we received was actually 75" x 79" x 10". Initially, I thought it just needed some more time to expand, and that sleeping on it would help, but after a month of sleeping on it, it still is not the size advertised on their website.<br/><br/>This ends up leaving a gap on our bed where the frame pokes out from under the mattress and looks a bit clunky. I've also banged my knee a couple times getting in and out of the bed.<br/><br/>tl;dr: very firm mattress, size doesn't measure to what it's advertised as. Other than that it's good for your money, but don't expect it to be the best thing in the world.
 I have been sleeping on this mattress for several months and I love it. It is both soft and firm in a way that I find exceptionally pleasing. I kid you not, every time I climb into bed is a reaffirmation of my pleasure - I am conscious of how much I enjoy this mattress, every time. Surpassed my expectations by a significant margin. I would say that claims that this mattress isn’t appropriate for larger (heavier) users are wildly inaccurate.
 I got this mattress out of sheer frustration over my old, saggy, uncomfortable mattress. It's MUCH better than what I had and it's very well made, but the firmness is just a bit too firm for me. I get a much better sleep than I did before, but I had to get a memory foam mattress topper out of storage to keep from getting sore hips and shoulders. I kind of wish I had returned it and tried a softer brand, but there weren't as many choices at the time. Overall, much better than a conventional mattress, but if you're a side sleeper, be aware that it may be too firm.
 #1: If you tried and really liked a Casper - buy that.  The T&amp;N does not sleep like the Casper.  You'll be forced to buy a $150 Topper if you want it to feel more like a Casper...that kind of defeats the purpose of saving $ - if that's the reason you've decided on the T&amp;N.  With that said, the T&amp;N is a nice mattress and I think it's fine.  Packaging and delivery were great. However, my son thinks it is too hard; he liked the Casper. See #2 below...<br/>#2: I would not recommend buying the T&amp;N on Amazon if there is any chance you might want to return it.  Why?  It's a pain in the arse.  T&amp;N won't even talk to you and you're forced to deal with a special department at Amazon.  Personally, I feel duped and am not happy with either company.  I think there should be a disclaimer on the Amazon site.  I was told by two T&amp;N customer reps that they cannot help customers who bought through Amazon.<br/>#3: I wish I had bought my son a Casper.  I'm not going to save any $ because now I'm going to be forced to buy a $150 topper to see if I can make the T&amp;N more comfortable.  I will begrudgingly buy the Topper directly from T&amp;N so I can return it, but resent having to spend more $.  And, I will regret not buying the Casper in the first place.
 I was looking for a twin bed to use as a guest bed. I bought one of the tuft and needle mattresses. I ended up using it a couple of times and it was great. So when I needed to replace my queen mattress, I bought another tuft and needle, and it is awesome. It is soft until you sink in some, but then the support kicks in. Doesn't sleep hot like most foam mattresses. Highly recommend this mattress.
 I couldn't be happier with this mattress. It came here very fast, as well as in a very neatly packaged box. Easy to unpack, inflated/rose very quickly. Then it was time to sleep..<br/><br/>Amazing. Just absolutely amazing. It was firm, but still super soft. This is what the perfect mattress is supposed to feel like. The firmness/softness on this will make a lot of people happy. Ive had it for a few weeks now and each night I get such a restful sleep. I find myself having that "I can't wait to go to bed" feeling more and more, and it's because I can't wait to get back into this comfy bed.<br/><br/>I never felt hot on this mattress either. Some people are afraid of memory foam because of feeling hot, but you don't have to worry about that with this mattress. Tuft &amp; Needle's two layer system is not a gimmick. It works wonderfully.<br/><br/>Virtually no motion transfer. My fiancé and I barely notice the other moving or getting in/out. This makes for a nice restful night of sleep of your partner is a fidgety sleeper...or if you share your bed with an 11 month old puppy who hops in and out of bed all night like us<br/><br/>Overall, I find it hard to believe you'd be able to beat this mattress with something else, especially for the price. There's no false advertising here. This mattress simply works and I strongly encourage you to try it. You even have 100 nights to try to find a reason not to like it. Good luck finding one.
 Returned Purple 2 3" to buy this one - wow, this is for me. Mattresses are a very 'to each their own' thing, so take this with a grain of salt, but it's great for me. It's not too heavy, so it's easy to move if you relocate, and sleeps well. No noticeable wear patterns, have been on it for 4+ months
 I wouldn't buy another brand ever again.  I have joint issues and I haven't slept comfortably for years and years. This bed has changed everything. My husband and I actually sleep well again. Very little, to no motion transfer - we don't wake each other up when we are on different shifts! It is not too soft (you can actually get out of the foam lol) and isn't too firm. It hugs my body so perfectly. We bought a king size for us and a double for our daughter and she is in love with it as well!
 Bed is comfortable but not as supportive as I expected. I've never had back problems and some mornings I would wake up feeling like I have a slight pinched nerve in my shoulders. I bought a memory for mattress topper which has helped a lot. Not a bad bed but just not exactly what I was expecting/offer enough support or give in the right places.
 I retired my 20 year old (yes, that's far too long) S&amp;F mattress for this one.  This mattress has a different feel than my old one, but also different than any hotel mattress I've slept on - ever.  It's hard to describe.  You don't sink into it, but it definitely has more "give" than any mattress I've slept on.<br/><br/>It does not sleep hot.  I wake up refreshed.  It doesn't mess with my back or shoulders (I"m a side sleeper).<br/><br/>My only nit is when I put socks on in the morning.  The bed feels like it wants to eject me on to the floor.  There is very little edge support, if any.  A pretty small complaint in an otherwise perfect mattress.
 This is my first time buying a non-traditional mattress.  The soft vs. firm is subjective but I do like the firm level (not super firm like the floor).  I am sleeping on the mattress with the SafeRest Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector and bedsheets and they are working firm.  The weather hasn't been hot so I can't tell you much about the "cooling" factor.<br/><br/>I can tell you that the mattress supports my body well and I can feel it throughout.  The mattress came in a good package and it expanded fully once I cut the bag open in a few hours. There was no odor.<br/><br/>I brought this via Amazon so I only have the 30 day window for return.  If you buy it directly from T&amp;N, they will give you the 100 day guarantee where THEY will take care of the return for you (i.e. you don't need to arrange UPS, etc.)  The price would be the same as buying it from Amazon.
 I was honestly a little hesitant to try the T&amp;N mattress given the price seeming to be too good to be true and all the other companies getting in on the "straight to home" mattress craze.  I had a $6000 Kingsdown pillowtop that after only 5 years became really worn and causing me back problems. Given the return policy and warranty, we figured it was worth trying a cheaper option and we have been pleasantly surprised. It's incredibly comfortable and you can't beat the price. It's honestly worth the trial and if you end up hating it, you can just return it.
 I bought this about two months ago and it is holding up well.  It is a firm mattress but doesn’t seem to give me any pressure spots.  I was also afraid that it would get hot like many memory foam covers and pillows do, but I haven’t had that problem.  It must have some stain guard in it because I had a blood stain that wiped right off with a wet rag.  I will probably buy another for my guest bedroom this summer.  I wish they had a softer option though.
 I know many of you are like me,I want to hate stuff. I received the mattress a little more than a month ago. I waited to leave this review. I wanted to be certain that this mattress was not like all others. So here is the thing,we ordered this and a platform bed together. Well the mattress showed up a week prior to the platform bed. Leave in the box or put it on box springs? Well of course we put in on the box springs. I was in pain daily. I called tuft I explained what was going on and that I was not satisfied. They explained it takes a week or so for the mattress to break in. I was like yep, YEA RIGHT... he we go again. Guess what folks we got the platform bed a week later and she was right! This bed is the best thing I have ever slept on.<br/>I actually look forward to going to bed now. I would compare it to heaven and a cloud in the bedroom. 6ft 1 285Lbs Big Guy!
 I was always incredulous when people would say they could fall asleep in minutes. I always had such a hard time falling asleep. Finally getting my asthma diagnosed and medicated has helped, but the clincher has been my new mattress. I have now joined the ranks of people who fall asleep quickly (unless my cat is scratching at the door) and stay asleep (until my alarms start going off—feline variety included.) I love this mattress!!<br/><br/>*I have been using my mattress for less than 2 weeks. Will update if the love (or sleep) decreases.
 PRO: mattress was on sale during black Friday and arrive on time<br/>CONs:<br/>1. mattress dimension not as advertised, true depth is close to 8.5inches vs. 10 inches. Have a platform bed? There will be a gap with your headboard and mattress as a result. Mattress quality = squishy and thin, not supportive.<br/>2. chemical smell (similar to nail polish remover) persisted a week later-- its concentrated along where the mattress had been folded for mailing.<br/>3. the return process -- first off, you get scheduled 1 week later and it's a 5 HOUR PICKUP WINDOW. You get multiple emails from the pick up company, from the mattress company, from amazon -- all saying different things about needing your original packaging and whether the pick up company called Pilot, brings the return label.<br/><br/>Save your money and time, don't buy this, avoid!
 This is my first bed-in-a-box mattress I've ever bought. It was def a leap of faith to pull the trigger on this mattress but felt confident because thousands of other folks loved this same mattress. It is heavy. Wife and I put our platform bed together and then layed this mattress on the platform. It rose very fast once air was introduced. Let me tell you, my wife was getting 3 to 4h on the old crap mattress. Now she's getting 7h plus. Wife has a very sensitive nose and didn't smell any odors from the mattress... so, there's that. Wonderful mattress.
 Nice and comfortable mattress. I was hesitant at first because the return worried me in case I did not like it. After reviewing all the details and wanting to avoid a $ 2000 from a different sellers I decided to take the risk. It was worth it. This is an excellent mattress for a reasonable and affordable price. It’s not hard, not soft; I weight about 200 pounds and holds me ok, I don’t have an issue with he firmness; it’s feel really good. Some people says that the edges and corners are not hard enough, but come on, no body is supposed to sleep on the corners or edges, for me is ok. So far, after about a month an a half I am really satisfied with this mattress.
 I have had my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress for almost a year now and I still love it as much as  I did when I first bought it! It definitely takes a few nights to get used to though.  The first night it was way to firm for me, but that fixed itself by night 4 and was perfect.  Even after a year it is still the perfect mix of soft and support for me.<br/><br/>A couple things to note:<br/>-I live in Arizona so heat is a major factor for me.  When I first got the mattress I was amazed by how cool it seemed to stay.  Probably a month in, I decided for some reason to put a mattress pad on my bed - bad idea.  The mattress really didnt need the extra fluff (i just had the mattress pad, so i thought, why not?) and after about a month I realized that it was causing the mattress to retain heat instead of get rid of it like its supposed to.  Needless to say, the mattress pad came off immediately once I realized my mistake.  Now Im back to sleeping comfortably cool even though its 82 in my apartment.<br/><br/>-If you are thinking about getting a new bed frame, you may want to wait until you actually have the mattress.  I have a queen size mattress and a queen size bed frame from IKEA (with a headboard and footboard) and the mattress barely fits in the frame... Queen sized sheets are also a stretch to get around the mattress.  Not a problem for me, but if you are new to Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses, its something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>- I love sleeping on my side, which is so comfortable on this bed.  With my old spring mattress I used to wake up with horrible pain in my hips and shoulders due to the pressure from the springs, not fun.  I now sleep on my side every night and rarely wake up with anything hurting.
 I love my new mattress! For years I awoke with shoulder, hip and back aches; and woke several times during the night to change positions. With this mattress I sleep through the night and have no aches when I get out of bed in the morning.
 This mattress is much firmer than I was expecting.  You don’t sink in at all, and my husband and I found it to be pretty uncomfortable.  I have only had it for a couple nights, but I have woken up with back pain each morning.  I called Amazon to initiate the return, and they were extremely helpful and made the process very easy.  If you do decide to order this mattress, I hope that it works out for you, but if it doesn’t at least getting your money refunded will be a quick and easy process.  I am giving the mattress 2 stars, but Amazon should get 5 stars for their customer service.
 This is the second one we have ordered and we paid more with the price increase.  We ordered from amazon so we could have it delivered faster to stay at our daughter's house instead of an air mattress!  Love how easy it is to get and set up and it is so comfortable. It is not hot and sleeps great with 2 people moving around you don't feel the other person moving.  We will be getting another one the next time we need a mattress!
 I was hesitant to order a mattress that I didn’t see. I wasn’t sure if it would be too soft but I went over the reviews several times and decided to give it a try. It was the best choice I made. I love it and sleep wonderful on it. It was a medium to firm feel and after undergoing spinal surgery I needed something that would give me some support. I would buy it again.
 I’m starting to like this mattress, it’s been about 3 weeks since I received it. I got it quicker than Amazons expected delivery date. However, was a bit taken aback,that it was not in the Tuft and Needle box. It was wrapped in plastic, which was ripped. Thankfully, the inner plastic was intact. Not sure why there wasn’t a box, maybe you only get that when ordering from manufacturer? Beyond that, I got it unwrapped on my own and it filled out almost instantaneously. No odors, and the covering is nice. When you push on the mattress, it gives you the sense it’s going to be quite soft. Not so. It’s quite firm. It seems to have “bloomed”, (possibly from being so compressed)  in the last week, getting slightly softer and giving full body support. My old mattress was very firm, with hardly any give to it. So, this mattress is much more supportive, yet has firmness, you don’t feel like you’re sleeping on a board, nor feel like you’re sleeping on a fluffy, airy cotton ball. It’s an adjustment, for sure, depending on what you’re used to. I don’t find it hot, which I was concerned about. I’m still adjusting to it and I think as each day goes by, I like it better and better.
 I researched online mattresses extensively last year, when seeking to purchase a mattress as a gift for my son and his fiancée. This year, when I unexpectedly started my PhD, I found myself living in a little bedroom with two undergrads, and desperately needed a good mattress (at my advanced age). This mattress saved my sanity and gave me some of the best sleep of my life. Yes, the edges are not as supportive as the middle. Avoid sitting there.
 I researched lots of mattresses before finding T&amp;N.  After reading all the reviews I purchased one a month ago. You could feel the coolness of the mattress by just putting your hand on it.  At first I was worried that it might be too firm but it was perfect.  We have slept cool and comfortable from day 1.  No more waking up with aches and pains.  I absolutely LOVE this mattress and I appreciate what they stand for as well.
 I would probably pay $450 for this mattress, but not $575 for a queen. It does have some cooling to it, but not near as much as a higher end mattress. I still have my old spring/pillow top mattress, and this is just as firm. I will likely try returning this and going with Casper or Leesa.
 The wife and I have had this for about 80 nights now. I have enjoyed it and feel it is very supportive for me as I like a firm bed. The wife on the other hand has complained about how it doesn't support her lighter presser points and she wakes up sore 2-3 night of the week. So now I am going to try and find a topper that will work for her to help catch those points for her and make it softer and enjoyable for her to sleep on. I will update after we try a topper as our 100 nights is running out the 2nd week of January!
 I was very excited about this mattress but found it too firm.  I slept on the mattress for a month to see if it would soften at all but it caused hip and back pain and I had to file a return.  If you do file a return be sure to contact Amazon Special Handling Dept, do not just file a regular return as the regular return will give you a shipping label you cannot use.  It was a good quality mattress, I never noticed a chemical smell, and was great to have delivered to the door, but was too firm for me.
 We had an inner-spring mattress that we hated.  It came with our bedroom set and we could have upgraded it, but our prior mattress was very pricey and barely lasted five years, so I figured I'd stick with the cheapy mattress.  Bad move.  That mattress was terrible.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research and decided on the Tuft &amp; Needle, mainly because it seemed to be as good as the other offerings, but a good deal cheaper.  Plus, people said it was firm than other mattresses, which I prefer.<br/><br/>That mattress is great.  We did have a pretty strong smell for the first week or so, but then it dissipated.  I was surprised though because almost every review I found said these mattresses don't smell like some other brands.  I contacted customer service and they offered to refund my money or ship me a new mattress for free.  I declined though because the smell had pretty much gone away.  Great customer support though!<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is a very good mattress.  I was worried it would be a little too firm, based on the reviews, but it's definitely not.  It's actually as soft as I would want.  Anything softer, and I think it would be too soft, although that's a matter of personal preference.
 So in full disclosure, the mattress only arrived this week and is for my daughters bed... but<br/><br/>Delivery process was quick and despite the weight of the mattress, unboxing was pretty straightforward.  We had no issues with the shape of the mattress - it expanded evenly.<br/><br/>I have taken a few ‘rests’ on this mattress and to be honest - I think I may now have mattress envy.<br/><br/>Will update if things change after some use.
 I am a convert.  I agree with everyone else, it takes a good week to get used to it but then it's magic.  We are about 30 day's in on ours and love it.  Nothing else compares after getting used to this bed.  I do find it sleeps a little warmer than our traditional mattress but it is not terrible.  My siblings have the casper and the other leica.  I find this to be somewhere in between the two.  Caspers are little stiffer, lecia's a little softer.  I would buy another Tuft and Needle.
 Got two XL twins to make a king, because it’s easier to handle than the 86 lb king. Very comfortable.
 What a horrible mattress. I had extremely bad back problems because of it, once I stopped using it my back got so much better. It wasn’t just me. My partner also had back problems with it.
 After just ONE NIGHT we were wondering why in the heck it took us so long to pull the trigger on this. The 100 day guarantee was the clincher for us, but this mattress is so very comfortable. YMMV: We are both healthy, fit, thin people with no significant aches and pains to begin with. If you are heavier or have arthritis issues, I cannot speak to that... But we LOVE it.
 I'm no mattress expert, but I've owned my Tuft and Needle Mattress for the greater part of a year now.. and I love it.<br/><br/>I'm a very sensitive sleeper with occasional bouts of insomnia - since switching to a T &amp; N Mattress, I wake up less often throughout the night and wake up in the morning feeling alert and ready to start the day. It's a keeper!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Incredibly comfortable.<br/>- High-quality build is apparent.<br/>- Partner movement doesn't wake me!<br/>- Great temperature regulation. I sleep hot, and it's not an issue with this mattress.<br/>- Slight bounce for bedroom adventures.<br/>- Taking it out of the box and inflating this baby was awesome. I still tell people about how cool it was washing the mattress take shape.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The mattress cover is kind of hard to take off and put back on for washing.
 I’ve ordered 3 of these mattresses and ALL 3 are of different quality.  The first one was good (firm enough) so I ordered two more. The second one is softer than the first.  And the third one is exceptionally soft (unable to sleep on).  The quality and control of these mattresses are not consistent and reliable.  The first mattress is the only one that is in use.  I question the manufacturing location  facilities, as it is obvious that they are made in different manufacturing plants, resulting in an  inconsistent product outcome.  And from a consumer’s position, that is not acceptable.  3 mattresses purchased within 1 year timeframe should all be the same quality.  How can any of us know what kind of mattress we will receive?  Soft, softer, ultra soft?  Now I need to purchase mattress toppers for 2 of 3 of these mattresses.
 It seemed very promising.  I liked that it had great customer service reviews, no chemical omissions and that it was advertised as both soft and supportive.  After sleeping on it for 7 months I need to go shopping for a mattress topper.  It is definitely a firm mattress.  What was important for me was a natural mattress and this one sold me on their advertising and ease of purchase, but for the money, I would recommend to do a little research on natural mattresses and pick something that is more tailored to you.  Overall I think it is a fine mattress for people looking for a firm mattress and easy purchase. And kudos to their branding team and website. But generic one fits all mattresses are a gamble and unfortunately I lost.
 My wife has had severe head, neck and back problems for years.  We have been through several pillows and matresses during those years.  She now has the Tuft &amp; Needle queen matresses and pillow and has not had a problem since. What a blessing this matress and pillow has made in our lives. Thank you T&amp;N. B&amp;D McCromick
 After I read many early reviews and then later ones, I was convinced that durability of the mattress would be a problem. l returned it as soon as it arrived and bought a pure mattress that is high quality and comfortable. I've had latex before -- the last and last!
 So far, so good! I've only slept on the bed for 4 nights but it is really comfortable and was SO incredibly easy to set up. Was really hesitant on ordering a bed online- surprised me that it was this great.<br/><br/>Update: I've been using this mattress for about a year now and am still struggling a bit with it. I am a stomach sleeper and like a firmer mattress, but this one is just too firm. Even after a year of sleeping on it (and getting the T&amp;N topper), I still struggle to sleep through the night without getting uncomfortable. I also recently moved to Arizona and have been struggling with staying cool at night- maybe it is the sheets that I'm using- but I am way too hot at night. I also wouldn't suggest the Full/Queen size for anyone except a child. I am 5' 6" and 120 pounds and feel like it is too small for me. Love the idea of T&amp;N and think it is a great brand for customer service, but I'm not quite sure this is the right mattress for me. It has been a good option for me for the year I used it while in graduate school, but I am looking forward to getting a new mattress following getting married. I don't even know if we will keep this as a guest room option. I'm looking into other options.
 I want to say right away I gave 4 stars because I returned the product. If I would have kept it, I would have given 5 stars. The bed is a very high quality and well made product. It doesn't off gas like most memory foam mattresses. It was delivered super fast. It was easy to set up.<br/><br/>My problem was my back and shoulders and neck. All of which got extremely painful for me. I have a lot of back issues to be fair and I was very hopeful but for me this bed has just made all of my issues worse. I think it is just too firm for me. I was hopeful the adaptive foam would work out. They say to give your body time and I gave it about a week. During which time I have progressively gotten worse.<br/><br/>I want to clear up something that is a bit confusing. The return policy. It is stated that you get 100 days to return if not satisfied. You can't initiate a return like this normally as Amazon electronic return process is not set up to handle large item returns. You have to call customer service through AMAZON not Tuft and Needle. I wasted time through T&amp;N with no response but once I called Amazon I got a response very quickly and they basically honored the Manufacturer return policy but a step better. So after being initially frustrated by not having a clear process to initiate a return I was able to successfully resolve my issue.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone who buys this Mattress on Amazon is if you ever decide to use the 100 day return policy call customer service right away before even trying to initiate a return. You will save time and hassle and they will take care of you.<br/><br/>I am now looking at a Leesa or Bear mattress also sold on Amazon and American made.
 We bough a couple of the twin beds and a queen for our cabin upgrade.<br/>First things first they arrive in deceptively small packaging and you kind of wonder if the mattress is really in there.<br/>They are well made, sturdy and manageable to handle for the size.<br/>Sleeping on them we are very happy with the quality and the nights sleep we have all been receiving.<br/><br/>The best thing is Tuft and Needles customer service.<br/>We had a bit of a mix up in the order and two queens were delivered.<br/>It would be hard to complain as they managed to do a super rush job on delivering our items (even thought they are made to order), but in any event we ended up with a wrong size mattress.<br/>With a  quick call this was rectified in a  brilliantly quick, polite and helpful fashion. Our new mattress was ordered (again in a super quick turnaround) and many options presented on how to return the item whilst still using what had been sent till the replacement size came.<br/><br/>A product for me is only as good as the customer service when an issue occurs. Tuft and Needle were exemplary.
 How is a mattress going to be shipped to me? Answer: In a vacuum bag stuffed in a box. We had fun watching our mattress grow as we carefully cut the bags surrounding it. It only took a few minutes before a queen size mattress was ready for a flop test so test it we did. Pretty comfy! Since the first night I have had no complaints of back ache as with previous mattresses. My wife wasn't so sure but after adding a second pillow she is a happy camper. With the 100 day satisfaction or return it guarantee, I can't see any downside to a purchase and it was half the price or less than others that we considered.
 This is the first mattress that both my husband and I have found comfortable in years. He gets incredibly warm when he sleeps, while I'm often cold. We've both been comfortable sleeping in our new Tuft and Needle mattress. I no longer wake up alone to find him sleeping on a sofa in the living room<br/><br/>I'm a skinny side and back sleeper who loves soft mattresses, but kept finding they would start to cave within a year of purchasing them. This mattress is soft enough that my bones don't feel bruised each morning, but firm enough not to make my back and shoulders ache from sinking too far into the mattress.<br/><br/>We've only had the Tuft and Needle mattress for 3 weeks, but we're both quite happy with it so far.  I even told my parents about the experience and they've also gotten a Tuft and Needle mattress they enjoy as well!
 So far so good! I researched a lot... Zinus at the low end, Casper, etc. at the high end. But, T&amp;N seemed like the right balance. I sleep on my back, belly and side all in the same night... and had a tempurpedic for 3 years that I wasn't a fan of - too hot. This mattress is jus perfect! I don't get hot even with a nice down comforter, just the appropriate amount of support and cushioning for any type of sleeping. Good for couple activities as well, ha ha.<br/><br/>Have had it for 3 weeks now. Will update post if something changes.
 Great price...but...holds a ton of heat, there is NO edge support and as a small woman I have slid off the side from sitting too close a couple times. The firmness was great while I was pregnant but not so much now.<br/>I don't think it will hold up for a super long time and after reading the warranty I'm not sure it will do any good for being a 10 year coverage.
 I was going to give this bed a longer review period,but decided to go forward with posting now as I doubt that my experience will change with more time.  First, I have to comment that the customer service is top notch and very responsive. The bed itself was a bit stiff for me but with a topper added it is very comfortable.  The materials used in production appear to be of good quality.  Likewise the workmanship is quite good.  There is a smell to the bed when it is opened, but that dissapates over time, and is easily masked. The container it comes in is convenient and easy to move.  I would suggest getting the bed into the room you will be using it in before uncrating it, and to lay it as close to where you want it before opening the bag it is in. Ibelieve that this bed will serve me wall for years, and is a good value for the price.
 I have had my T&amp;N mattress and sleeping on it since August 2018. I have back problems but notice it seemed worse on a spring mattress which my acupuncturist said we're pressure points. I figured I'd start with something cheaper as I didn't want to go too crazy with a bigfig or purple right away. So after 6 months here's what I will tell you:<br/><br/>-It's pretty comfortable to start and I usually am asleep within 15 min of lying down.<br/><br/>-Pretty easy to setup and very little odor (depending on room size) once unpacked<br/><br/>-The mattress sleeps HOT AS HADES even with bamboo sheets! Considering going with a ratan mat but you will sweat!!!<br/><br/>-Because it's hot you're probably going to want a mattress pad or something that you can wash.<br/><br/>-Its sized weird; my mattress is about 5 inches total larger than my box spring. I looked at a platform based but by numbers and measurements that extra foam was a roadblock.<br/><br/>-Its softens up but still feels supportive. I'm not convinced I will make it the full 8 years before needing a replacement though.<br/><br/>-Theres no edge support which I knew going into it but people go to sit on my bed and usually end up on the floor. Literally.<br/><br/>-No flipping needed but I do recommend rotating it every few months.
 It took us a week to kinda get used to it but we love it! We just have to get pillows that are great too!<br/>At first it was weird because is not the kind of mattress that you sit or lay on and you are "wow, I don't want to get up anymore"-feeling. But when I sleep and wake up.  I have no pain. It's been years since I sleep and wake up without any pain. So although I cannot say that is one of those "amazing feeling" mattresses, the fact that I sleep good and wake up without pain is 100% the best reason to own this mattress! is hard enough so you don't sink in, soft enough to sleep well and the material is great! I can't even explain it! Try it! you have several days to return it if you don;t like it. We loved it!
 I was ready to put this in the "you get what you pay for" category. I needed a mattress quickly and I didn't want the hassle of stores and delivery. I did my research, and, between reviews and price, settled on T&amp;N. I couldn't be more pleased!  My Queen-size arrived quickly at my door; it was easy to handle; and it was easy to set up. It is also far more comfortable than I would've expected, easily as comfortable as my pillow-top coil mattress. Also not too hot (which has been my biggest concern with foam).  Highly recommended!
 I got this for my teen son, after he said the 25 year old spring mattress (that my mother got for me when I was 15) was uncomfortable.  The mattress arrived in less than a week, and it was incredibly easy to set up.  No smells, it expanded in all of 5 minutes, and it was incredibly comfortable. I was tempted to sleep on it before my son did!  In fact, I spent about $7000 on a luxury memory foam mattress (with the adjustable head/feet) about 10 years ago for myself, and now I wish I had waited!  My son loved the mattress from the first night.  It's been several weeks now, and he still loves it.  It was firm (but comfortable) on the day it arrived, and he said it has gotten a little softer.  Definitely worth the money.
 This is the first bed that I've ever bought as a young adult. It came in a tall rectangular box. I was amazed they were able to fit a queen in it. Easy to install, just open your box plop it onto your frame or designed location, carefully remove plastic and watch your mattress unroll and puff up like a tampon absorbing water. Overall I sleep better now.
 Have had it for almost 3 months<br/>Pros: amazing support, soft but firm, haven't had a bad night rest in weeks.<br/>Cons: had a slight odor after opening but went away after a few days.<br/><br/>I finally bit the bullet and invested in a good bed. I did a lot of research both online and in stores. My gripe about buying a mattress at a B&amp;M is how am I supposed to know what a bed is going to feel like based on 5 seconds of laying on a bed whilst the sales person stares at me uncomfortably? As important as a good nights rest is, I just couldn't justify paying nearly $4000 for a memory foam mattress. This takes the guesswork out of it with Amazon's return policy and Tuft &amp; Needle's 100 night return policy. And also makes a good nights rest immediately affordable and worth it.<br/><br/>There are a lot of online bed options but T&amp;N were one of the most popular and by far the highest rated on Amazon. What also sold me was their policy on sales and customer service satisfaction dedication.<br/><br/>The bed came in a T&amp;N box and it was heavy lol It took a lot of grunting and pushing to get the box upstairs. The bed comes vacuumed sealed wrapped in a plastic bag and as soon as I opened it up it tried to inflate immediately, squeezing itself out of the bag. It took my fiancé and I to maneuver the bed onto the bed and we let it air out and continue to inflate if it needed to for a few days.<br/><br/>We covered it with a bedsheet after three days and have been sleeping soundly on it ever since. I haven't had any complaints and I've since recommended two other coworkers to purchase a T&amp;N bed.
 After doing tons of research, I decided to purchase the Tuft &amp; Needle for a day bed. Some have described this matress as firm or too firm. I find that it is perfectly in the middle between firm and soft.  Because firmness and softness is subjective, everybody is going to have a differing opinion and this is mine.<br/><br/>Overall, I am completely satisfied with this purchase. A great value for a quality product.
 So far we are enjoying our king size mattress. When I was shopping for our bed there were a lot of new companies and competitors lacking history and evidence of longevity, such as Tuft &amp; Needle, and without having used any of the competitor products I can not speak on behalf of Tuft &amp; Needle as a company. However, the bed is very comfortable. My first concern was whether or not the sides would hold up seeing as that's a common complaint about non-traditional mattresses, but so far I have had no problems at all.
 I switch to this mattress from a sealy beauty rest.  It was an expensive pillow top mattress at the time.  It was about 5 years old and already had dents if you will where I slept.  Im not a over weight person by any means, thus it was some what unexpected.<br/><br/>Days after switching my back already feels better.  I dont wake up with pain and I feel more rested.<br/><br/>Interesting difference in this mattress.  It warms up and cools down much quicker.
 I have had a water bed for about five years now until my dog decided to dig up one of her bones in it. Needless to say, it was time to get a more sturdy bed. I absolutely loved my waterbed originally and was skeptical to get anything else. I took a chance with ordering this one and it paid off tremendously. I would recommend this to anybody and everybody.  There are no pressure points and so darn comfy.  Stays cool whole night and supportive as can be.  My partner moving during night or getting up does not wake me. California king all the way. Tuft &amp; Needle 10/10
 Best mattress I've ever gotten and I used to work for a mattress sales company. Sleeps cool, perfect softness and firmness. For the price the quality exceeds the expectation. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>Even when I had a spasm the bed helped contour to my body and helped me sleep at night peaceful.<br/><br/>8months into owning the bed and no sagging or defects from the memory foam.
 After looking at physical mattresses and feeling like the prices didn't match the comfort level (seriously?  $3,000 for a mattress?), we decided to give the Tuft and Needle a try.  I am pretty easy going when it comes to mattresses, but my husband is not, and after about a month of using this mattress we both have no complaints.  He loves it (the firmer the better for him), and I prefer medium firm.  We've had a sleep number bed, and were more recently sleeping on a plain, cheap spring mattress, but there was no adjustment time with this foam mattress. It felt very natural.  I think I read that they recently raised their prices, but I do not regret purchasing this one bit. It's still the best value out there.
 This mattress though! Got so much physical support I feel emotionally supported. Good so far. But has a strong chemical smell to it. My sheets smell like it and had to wash them couple of times to get rid of the odor. Will update in a few months again.
 I slept on it for the first time last night. No back pain when I woke up!!!!!! It was so easy to set up. Light enough I was able to get the box inside and the mattress on all by myself. The mattress is firm but giving, not too firm and not too soft, which means perfect to me. I let it off gas (which I couldn't smell unless I put my nose to it) and air up for about an hour before I put the sheets and cover on. It does not hold heat like my old foam topper. So happy with my purchase and it was $136 less on Black Friday.
 Too firm. I have bad shoulders and my arms go to sleep when I lay on my side because it has too much resistance. It also seems to be about 2 inches narrower than a full King mattress width because it doesn't fit our full King frame width. I couldn't easily find instructions to facilitate a return so I bought a 3-inch gel topper which hangs an inch over each side as I mentioned. I don't know how you're supposed to return such a large item that requires two people to carry it.
 We purchased this bed after having another memory foam mattress for 10 plus years. We did not experience any issues with the set up or any odor. What we REALLY liked is that it is made in the USA. I would add for those that are concerned about the firmness, it is definitely firm. We've slept on this bed for about a month and will be keeping it.
 I'll admit we fell into the "bed in a bag" hype and gave this a try. Shipping was fast and it came packaged well enough but after a few weeks it was obvious it just doesn't provide enough support as a conventional mattress and my husband would regularly wake up with back-pain. On the plus side, Tuft &amp; Needle as well as Amazon's customer service and return policy is top notch! I wouldn't shy away from trying one again as it all depends on the person and type of firmness the bed is.
 I gave this mattress a try because a friend pointed out how great the reviews were. I do not just hand out 1 star reviews lightly, but this mattress has literally been the 100% opposite of what all the great reviews have said. I'll start by saying that I am 6'3 and a solid 240 lbs, so I need a good mattress that will not wear down in a month. The reviews said that this mattress stays firm and doesn't easily soften up, like the other inflatable roll up mattresses, and that the mattress is breathable and stays cool. My lack of sleep with the covers on and my sore lower back can confidently tell you, after giving it about a year, none of this is true. Even my wife, who is 5'2 115 lbs has complained about being too hot and her back hurting since the first month we slept in this bed. She could sleep on a piece of plywood and wake up in the morning feeling refreshed so that is a horrible sign.<br/>My recommendation is to just spend a little extra money on a higher end mattress. Your body and mind will be much appreciative of your decision.
 I was in desperate need for a bed and I wanted something simple and without carcinogenic materials. This bed is extremely comfortable and spacious! I was sleeping on a full-size futon that was starting to stab me, so I immediately searched for bed and came upon Tuft and Needle. I was so excited and uncomfortable that I ordered the full-sized mattress without considering measurements. It was about 5 inches wider than my futon, so I had to move some furniture to make room. It was my own fault for not considering or reading the measurements and for assuming that an actual mattress would be equivalent to a futon! Plus, I am not complaining about the size difference because I am so happy to be able to stretch out and be even more comfortable. I bought the Tuft and Needle mattress support box, too, so the mattress gets circulation and so I can put my shoe containers underneath. Thank you so much for offering this extremely comfortable and consumer-friendly and -conscientious mattress. It's totally worth the investment and the delivery was quick and efficient! Thank you, Tuft and Needle for such a great bed and thank you Amazon for offering such an amazing product from a spectacular company!!
 Gets hot quick from my body heat, also.. quite uncomfortable for me as a side sleeper, I am 6' 4" 180lbs, and this mattress has me wriggling a lot trying to find a comfortable position and wake up with a minor stiffness. Might be good for some people, just, not for me.
 I liked this mattress for the first 4-6 months. By a year later I was rarely sleeping through the night. It's now about 18 months after purchase, and my back is absolutely killing me every morning. I thought it was me...and then realized every time I've stayed at a hotel, or a friend's home, or been on vacation, or even camping (!) basically slept on any other surface, I was just fine. I'm 5'6" and 140#, and can't figure out what it is about the mattress that has changed over time.
 Here Is my honest reciew for anyone looking into purchasing this mattress. We chose this company because we like to buy from small businesses.  The day we got it it came in a box. 🤔 so I rolled it out and let it expand. I was VERY skeptical. I layed on it and truthfully wasn’t feeling it. I messaged the company and they said to try it for a while I can always return it. Well I did and I have to say...there isn’t one night I don’t lift up my covers and lay down that I don’t say THIS IS THE  MOST COMFORTABLE MATTRESS I HAVE EVER LAYED ON! I highly recommend it!
 I was nervous about liking this mattress but let me tell you, all my worries were for nothing. This is hands down the best mattress I've ever owned. I was used to expensive pillow top mattress but this beats them all. This mattress is soft, but not in the way you'd expect. It feels like it conforms to your body, meaning it is soft and feels great but Doris you everywhere. I'm a big guy, 6'1 280lbs side sleeper. This mattress had ruined all other beds for me.<br/><br/>It stays cool, give support like I've never had, is soft and just a pleasure to sleep on. I have ranted and raved about it. I can't say enough good things and don't ever want a traditional mattress again!
 What else can I say about this bed that hasn't been said before? If you don't own this bed yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!  Simply amazing. I have back issues and its always been hard to find a mattress that is soft enough to provide comfort but hard enough for support but this mattress is the answer to all my prayers. I have never had a better night sleep in my life until I bought this. Such an amazing deal, stop wasting your time and money or more expensive brands. I recommend this mattress to anyone and everyone.
 Wonderfull mattress for all sleeping positions. This mattress does not give way and allow you to seemingly sink into oblivion like othe foam mattressses, instead it stays firm and does not sink overtime. It does start to loose stregnth near the edges but otherwise feels uniform in comfort. This mattress is very quiet and does not transfer motion easily, which is a great feature for not disturbing sleeping partners. I wouldn't say this mattress dispearses heat very well, but that is the only advertised claim that falls short. This mattress is quite heavy and will likely not move around much on top of a platform.
 Shipping and everything was great. Setup was easy and quick. This mattress is not for everyone! It is the firmest mattress I have ever tried to sleep on. You have to have a topper. If you body is not perfectly displaced you will feel annoying pains.<br/><br/>I love the bed in box idea and I wish I loved this one because of the $$$ but I didn't..<br/>I returned the mattress and am grateful Tuft and Needle holds to there return policy unlike some others (cough purple cough).<br/><br/>For those who want to know which bed won me over.. I ended up with the Leesa and love it.
 It's almost going to sound like I was paid to write this, but nope.  Legit the best bed I've ever owned.  I bought a super fancy pants double sided pillow top mattress when I lived in Venice Beach for $2800, it was just okay :(.  Ended up gifting it to a friend &amp; have been forever in search of a good mattress since.<br/><br/>One night I was visiting a friend &amp; fell *in love* with the bed in her guest room.  That's how I found out about Tuft &amp; Needle.  Bought one about 6 months ago &amp; have been meaning to write a review ever since.  Not only is it the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on.  It's not showing any signs of wear or loss in firmness after 6 months.  I'm obsessed.  Heads up, they did put it on Amazon's mid-year Black Friday in July, so I'm waiting to see if it goes on special for  this year's November Black Friday.  If so I'm def getting on for my guest room so I can spread the love.<br/><br/>Also, quick note, my black lab rescue mix sleeps in the bed.  When he jumps on + off, I don't even feel it (my other mattress I would).  It is awesome!!
 BEST MATTRESS EVER!!!  No smells and it feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud (well, based on what my imagination thinks a cloud would feel like if it was made out of something puffy and comfy)!!!  I used to have a Tempurpedic for 11 years but it would get so hot and it smelled chemically (when we first bought it).  This mattress......no smell.  I will be purchasing another one for my daughter as she still has her Temperpedic and I'd rather have her sleep on a non-chemically mattress.
 I REALLY wanted to like this bed . . .<br/>After reviewing the website I was sold on their MINT model . . . but, they don't offer free shipping to Hawaii . . .<br/>So, I chatted with their customer service rep and he convinced me that their standard model was pretty darn fabulous all in itself and ordering on Amazon Prime offered me the free shipping . . . and it was a mistake . . . THIS BED IS HOT!!!<br/>REALLY hot to sleep on - I live up high on the mountain and it's only June . . . and the nights are cool and this is uncomfortable hot (and I'm not normally a "hot" sleeper - I like my blankies!)<br/>Furthermore the sides kind of collapse when you get in/out of the bed . . . gives you a very unstable feeling and very uncomfortable for someone with a back injury . . .<br/>I would return it but can't even imagine the hassle that may present on Amazon?  Ordered a fluffy cooling mattress pad as well as a cooling tempurpedic type gel topper -- hoping this will help?!!<br/>I wish I could return and exchange it for their MINT model but that isn't an option on Amazon and I'm not quite sure what I will do if this doesn't work out with the added investments of the other bed toppers ---- so much for saving $$$<br/>There are a lot of similar beds out on the market - wish I had shopped a little more diligently - this was not a good choice for me!<br/>SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED
 I just received my new mattress and oh my, this is heaven. I realize I have not even tried sleeping on it yet, but wow! It is firm with just enough give on the top few inches to sink into the firm portion which is perfect for me as a side sleeper with a bad back. I just hope it doesn't turn into a taco in a few months, but from the reviews I have read that shouldn't be an issue. I cannot wait to see if I make it through the night without waking up in pain 3 or 4 times.
 I've been raving about this bed since the first great night sleep. I can't say enough good things, over the past 10 years I've wasted $1000's on pillows and mattresses. I have finally found the perfect bed no more waking up with a pain in my neck or lower back it's awesome!! Love this bed!!!
 I've used this mattress for six months now.  The reason I purchased this mattress in the first place is because I was waking up with back pain in the morning.  Upon reading up on the possible causes of the back pain, by process of deduction and educated guess (based upon how I live my life), I went ahead and made the purchase.  BEST DECISION EVER.  After a few days my back pain was gone.  I also found that I had more nights to where I slept through the entire night which was an added bonus.  The results were real for me.  Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle.
 I was very hopeful for this mattress after reading all the rave reviews. While on vacation we slept on a really firm mattress and all my back and shoulder ache disappeared. So as soon as we got back I started my search for a mattress that was firmer than the one we already had. After lots of research and review reading we decided to go with the T&amp;F mattress. Unfortunately I am having to return the Tuft and needle mattress as it was way too soft for me. I am a side and belly sleeper and I was waking up every morning with a really stiff painful lower back. If you prefer a softer mattress then this would probably be great but if you prefer a firm sleep surface then this will not be enough. I would say on a scale of 1-10 this mattress was a 3-4 in firmness. I am still giving this item 4stars as the return process through Amazon was so smooth and easy. They processed a refund and all we have to do is donate the item to the charity of our choice. Another point worth noting is that Amazon only offers a 30 day vs 100 day sleep trial. We did not need this long to decide but just in case you would like a longer trial period.
 I find it a little firmer than I was expecting from the reviews I read.  I'm used to a very soft mattress, in fairness, and this one works better than some others I've tried.  If you are like me and are used to a pillowtop mattress, I doubt you will find any of the foam mattresses very comfortable.  I will say it seems well made, and it does come with a full refund if returned.  I decided to keep it because I did find it better than others I've tried and the price is pretty great.
 I've had this mattress about 3 months, and I have no regrets. I started looking because my mattress was old and I had recurring back pain when getting out of bed. Since I switched to the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress I haven't had any back pain--not once. All of the concerns I had (am I really ordering a mattress online? sight unseen? will it be too hot? the price seems too low--what's that about?) were completely forgotten almost immediately. I'm always warm and I haven't had a single issue with being uncomfortable. My sleep improved dramatically. The process was incredibly easy. Customer service at Tuft &amp; Needle answered any questions I had. This was a leap of faith for me, but this is a company that does their job perfectly. It's a fantastic product, the most comfortable mattress--better than I could have ever imagined. One of the smartest purchases I've made.
 I wanted to wait awhile to write my review so I had the chance to sleep on this mattress awhile.  I wish I had bought this bed sooner.  I don't want to get up in the morning it is so comfortable.  It's not hot like the expensive brand and most of my sleep problems have gone away--aching back, sore knees and restlessness.  I bought one for my son and am about to buy one for my daughter.  I did a lot of research and this is the best price for the quality of bed.  I can't say enough good things about this mattress.  I understand they have a new and improved one in the market now and I'm not sure how this bed can get any better.  Recommend without hesitation.
 I know there are a ton of bed-in-a-box mattresses to choose from these days and I haven't tried the others to compare, but 5 stars for value with this one!  Legit, I slept on a $3500 Temperpedic for a few years and it's hard to tell the difference between that and this $500 mattress.  Only took 3-4 days to get used to and really didn't have any odor issues after the first day.  Definitely recommend!
 Bought the mattress in Jan 2017. Of the two years I have owned this mattress I used it for approximately 18 months. Initially the mattress was great, and comfortable.  Now 2 years later, I hate this damn mattress. It’s gotten really soft and hurts my back.  I’m pretty disappointed in the mattress overall now. It’s not long lasting. The 3 stars are for the initial comfort.
 Although it's a great mattress and is well made, it's not as firm as advertised.  The family member I purchased it for continued to have back problems due to the softness.  Thankfully I had another family member with the same size mattress so we could swap them.  Otherwise I would have been very disappointed.
 I've waited several months to write this, to see how it held up.  This is a nice mattress, comfortable, fairly firm but not stiff or unyielding, and has held up well for me.  I have back issues, so no miracle mattress exists, but this seems to have been a good choice for me.  Not going to lie - wish it was cheaper, though.<br/>Update 6/4/2017 - just wanted to update to say that this mattress is holding up very well! I've only flipped it once, and even with sitting up in bed on an almost daily basis to read or watch TV, it has held its shape.
 Six week report: So far, comfortable and no ache sleeping on this firm, not stiff mattress. My concerns are side and back sleeping, as well as temperature, (middle-aged mama drama concerns🥵🥶🥵. To control temperature and create a plusher feel, I use a two-sided lambs wool and cotton topper over a cotton mattress pad, which is perfect for me. *Everybody has their personal preference.<br/>Tried another boxed mattress a month before this and was disappointed. Read reviews from this site and Sleep Like the Dead.
 OMG this thing is so good for my back! Now, it could be that my old mattress was indeed too old and worn out, as I do have a slightly herniated disc in my lower back and often experience discomfort from sleeping (even on most hotel mattresses). With T&amp;N I have never woke up feeling better. I highly recommend it on comfort and support, but it's hard to beat the price too! It's been three weeks and I'm very happy with this purchase and I recommend it to everyone.
 i LOVE this mattress...it took me a long time to change mattresses...i am thinnish..and my bones are just too close to the surface to be comfortable on many mattresses. I never lost any time adjusting..perfect from day one...there is a chemical smell for a few days..i uncovered it for the first several days to air it out...then never noticed it! WhooHoo!!!
 After first night I can say: this mattress is the best I’ve ever slept on. And I am a heavy person. I always slept on spring mattresses and I am no longer surprised my back was hurting. I woke up this morning - no pain at all! And last night before going to bed I had this shooting pain in my left leg. I slept like a baby this night. And I’ll update my review after few months as well.<br/>Update: 7 months later, still like new.
 Now that I've had this mattress for awhile I can write a review. Its a great mattress! Love it! Havn't had any problems with it. It's still comfy. I have less back pain when I wake up in the morning and I stay cooler at night. My only issue with it is the same most people have had. The foam is not cut square. It seems to taper off on both side towards one end. We put that end at our feet. Sheets still fit and stay snug but for as much as it costs you would think they could cut straight.
 Bought two Twin XL matresses for a brand new split king adjustable foundation.  Invoice says Twin XL, boxes say Twin XL. Unpacked them, let them expand, foundation installer noted that they are too short.  5 inches too short, to be exact.(75 inches vs. 80) These are not XL's.  Will have to start the return process. Mixed feelings because the mattresses seem like they will be really comfortable. I've read other reviews that say returning through Amazon is a pain because of boxing them up.  We shalll see. Meanwhile, guests are coming for the holidays and we have to have something to sleep on since the whole idea was having an extra bed<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Amazon folks processed the replacements just fine but---the mattresses are still either defective or mislabeled because the length of both is still only around 75 inches.  The mattresses I received are NOT Twin XL's as ordered.  I will be contacting the manufacturer directly.  I've got over $800 in these things.  On a bright note, they are comfortable, they just don't fit the adjustable frames as they should and as promised.
 I no longer ache when I wake up. I was sick for a few weeks and rarely left my bed which would have caused me so much pain with a spring mattress but I was able to rest and relax, no pain! My partner can get up and it used to wake me but I sleep straight through. He is saving up to get one because he loves it so much. Got a box spring only for the height. Absolutely recommended.
 I can't say enough about this mattress. It is perfect. Not too firm and not too soft. I bought a bamboo waterproof mattress pa that isn't plastic but protects it.<br/>(I sneak off my Sleep Number bed and go downstairs at night to this very comfortable mattress.)<br/>I'd like one of these in every bedroom.
 This is my second T&amp;F mattress.  They both have Great texture and provide the supplies I need. The second one has a pretty bad chemical smell that takes my breath away.  I can’t use it.  I have had it for two weeks.  I like the mattress and hope the smell leaves.  Until then, I have to use my old mattress.
 Truly pleased that I did the research to determine that this was the best choice available for the best price. After reading reviews here at Amazon, as well as third party site reviews and ratings, this was my choice. The only negative versus it's main competition was apparently the need for a topper. I will admit the first few nights it felt a little to firm, but fortunately, as it is described by the manufacturer, it does settle in within two weeks. I do not feel a topper is necessary personally. I immediately started getting better sleep from the first night, and I have found that I have felt even more comfortable as the days went on. I feel it hits the sweet spot personally of the right firmness and comfort. Now getting closer to two weeks in, I absolutely love my decision to purchase this mattress. My smart watch gives it the thumbs up as well confirming that I am getting nearly twice as much deep sleep now versus my sleep on my previous more expensive mattress. I highly recommend this mattress as a high end competitor at a great price!
 My first foam mattress and it's great! I previously had a SleepNumber bed, which never seemed to keep an even firmness. After about 2 weeks on this one, my body adjusted and I sleep better and more comfortably than ever. Definitely get the no-slip pad! As far as delivery and set-up, I was able to get it in the room and onto the frame myself (I'm small and slight), but it would have been a lot easier (at 70+ pounds) with a helper. Definitely recommend this!
 Very good, the best mattress I have used in the under 500$ category. I fall asleep much easier with this mattress and stay asleep for the entire night.<br/><br/>Comfortable with a lot of support. If you like a slightly firm mattress, this is for you. Like some reviewers have mentioned, it may be too firm if you sleep on your side. In that event, try adding a topper for a little more umphhh.<br/><br/>It takes about 10 or so days for the mattress to break in, then you get to experience the comfort.
 I bought this mattress because of the reviews written saying it was firm. I have major back issues and had my 4th back surgery and was looking forward to a comfortable mattress. This is not firm and I would not recommend it for anyone with back issues. You sink in several inches and it is not even broken in. I can’t imagine how soft it will be after a month or more.
 After reading about like every brand of bed in box and traditional mattresses for like six months, we finally went with tuft and needle.  The box is kind of heavy and the mattress is a flat, thin coil shrink wrapped and wrapped in a secondary outer plastic.  As soon as the shrink wrap is cut, the mattress inflates in like 5 seconds.  I was shocked how quickly.  No odor of any kind.  Nice feel to it.  Would purchase again.
 We bought the queen size mattress for our lake house and my husband and I are so happy with it, we may replace our mattress at home with the same.  While the box took both of us to move, it took no time at all to unbox and place on the frame.  You see, Im thrilled because we both want different things for a mattress and this one satisfied both my need for softness due to pressure points and his need for firmness for whatever reason that is......I never understood the comfort of a firm mattress.  I loved the video they provided showing how they came to create this mattress.  Thanks you so much............very economical and an affordable price.
 I purchased this mattress in March of 2016.  I purchased an adjustable base for it, and immediately fell in love.  Sixteen months later, I still love it.  I am a side sleeper, and I have no issues with sleeping on my side.  IMO, this mattress is perfect for someone that wants a slightly firmer foam mattress.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Tuft-Needle-King-Mattress-T-N-Adaptive-Foam-Sleeps-Cooler-More-Supportive-Than-Memory-Foam-Certi-PUR-Oeko-Tex-100-Certified-10-Year-True-Warranty-Made-in-USA-Rated-CR-s-Best-Buy-Mattress/dp/B00QBZ25SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tuft &amp; Needle King Mattress, T&amp;N Adaptive Foam, Sleeps Cooler &amp; More Supportive Than Memory Foam, Certi-PUR &amp; Oeko-Tex 100 Certified, 10-Year True Warranty, Made in USA, Rated CR's Best Buy Mattress</a>
 Great bed!  It took my body a week or so adjust to this bed since it was so much more supportive that our previous bed.  I also had to get a new pillow because in that first week my upper back and neck was a bit stiff from now having a supportive bed with a lackluster pillow.  This bed is both very soft and very supportive.  The layers of different foam offer deep support, while also being incredibly giving at the heavier points.  For example, my knee sinks way down into the bed when I crawl on a first, but then when I'm laying down for sleep, I feel like I barely sink in.  I appreciated the '100 night trial' they offered, especially during that first week where I did go through a bit of an adjustment, but ultimately I am very happy with this mattress.
 I bought this mattress after reading consumer reports it had great reviews. My husband and I love this mattress it is so comfortable  I'm a side sleeper.  We had a waterbed for thirty years when it went bad this last one . They are quit making new waterbeds. so we decided to get mattress.We were afraid we would not like any mattress this one is great. I have a bad back and I have no trouble sleeping on this mattress. I would recommend it.
 Got a queen memory foam from another store that dipped in less than a tear. Wifey an I are not large people or too heavy. Bought this bed to accommodate her pregnant body in king for half the price of the precious bed. We have been sleeping on it for over 5 months and feels great, no dipping or sweaty/hot material. Would buy from them again, great product! Not too hard not too soft just perfect!
 We’ve had the bed for a month and so far really like it. We switched from a tempupedic, so I was concerned I was just trading for another version of that. Not the case. The T&amp;N is much firmer which is what we were hoping for. It did have the typical “I’ve been vacuum sealed in plastic” chemical smell for about 48 hours. But dissipated and was gone after that. I’ll update after a couple more months, but I bought it off a recommendation from my brother and I would happily recommend to others now.
 I never write reviews. I’m a nurse and injured my back a few years ago and now I’m pregnant so let’s just say I wrestle with sleep every freaking night. After doing some research and comparing the other foam mattresses on the market, this one seemed to have the most solid reviews. I was leery about purchasing at first because many described the mattress as “soft but firm.” First of all I abhor soft mattresses. I once bought a tempur pedic and returned it after 30 days, soft mattresses tend to sink and I wake up with even more back pain than I started with. Then recently I got a firm mattress, which apparently was too firm because I still had pain especially at my pressure points. Ladies and gents let me tell you this mattress gets it!!!!! Soft upper layer but does not sink. I look forward to sleeping every night. I highly recommend this matteress!!!!
 This replaced a 16-year old Sealy Posturepedic. I never really gave the mattress I was sleeping on too much thought. But as I recall, the reason I used to get out of bed in the morning was "I was done". That, "I'm uncomfortable now, so I may as well get up" feeling.<br/><br/>Tuft &amp; Needle did away with all that. Now, in the morning, I could just keep on napping BECAUSE IT IS SO COMFORTABLE. The alarm clock, the dogs, and the job force me eventually to rise. Tuft and Needle figured out how to make a great bed for a low price. We love it!
 Took a big chance and thus far I don't regret it.  I purchased for my brother and he states that he's sleeping better simply because he's not waking up as often.  My sister in law likes the fact that she does not feel him moving as much on this bed. In addition, they feel less back pain, its a win for now.  I will state my brother is about 5'11'', close to 200 lbs and he finds the bed supports him well.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I have ever had. I tried the Tempurpedic at a friend's house and it felt like sleeping on quicksand. My nephew has this Tuft &amp; Needle so I was able to try it before buying. It has enough give so my arthritic hips and shoulders are comfortable but enough firmness to support proper spine alignment. I no longer toss and turn during the night, I wake in the same position as when I fell asleep.
 Looking for a healthy mattress after months and months of research and I took a chance - no one I knew personally had purchased one and IT IS AMAZING!!  I bought it because of the healthy construction and my daughter loves it - it's firm yet so comfy!  I will be moving into a new house and purchasing all Tuft &amp; Needle Mattresses for my new house!<br/><br/>I used the IKEA bed frame and their box spring and with some sheets and a mattress pad - this entire HEALTHY bed cost under $1,000 for everything!
 If you are looking for a mattress, THIS IS IT! I researched thoroughly for weeks before buying a mattress. I watched YouTube videos, read reviews, and looked at different websites and I decided to purchase this mattress. I knew about the return policy and so I decided if I didn't like it I could return it and have no harm done. But I'm glad I bought this mattress!! I can finally sleep and get a good night's rest. In addition to the wonderful comfort the price cannot be beat! A low price and near perfect comfort, a beautiful combination. Don't hesitate, BUY THIS MATTRESS!
 I've had this mattress for about a month now, and this mattress is just okay.<br/><br/>5'11" Male weighing 145 lbs<br/><br/>I find this bed a bit too bouncy for my taste coming from a futon. It fits the memory foam, super supportive type of mattress, but it seems too supportive that it doesn't sink at all. Potentially due to my low weight that it doesn't sink enough. I prefer the mattress my brother got (Sleep Innovations Taylor), which has a gel layer that seems to sink the right amount while still being supportive.
 Just received the mattress,  set up was easy. Tonight will be the first night sleeping on it...stay tuned.<br/>1st night sleeping on mattress, and I must say soft and firm, back pain was less then it has been on 2 year old pillow top. Give update in a week.5 night on new mattress and I must say my back has lers pain and I'm not waking up in the middle of night with pain, if this keeps up ,I'll give it 5 stars...stay tune. My sleep has improved 100% since we got this mattress, back pain is almost all gone....know I need to find a great pillow.Just got the perfict pillow for the perfect mattress, this mattress is amazing
 I was a little skeptical to buy a matress online without trying it, but after looking at the reviews and really needing a new bed I bought it. I have had it for a couple of weeks and I love it! I no longer wake up feeling unrested or with the pains I was having prior to. It is firm, but I don't think it is very hard. I think it is firm for the purpose of keeping your body in a comfortable position. My husband has arthritis in his back, and he likes the bed. He is no longer having the extra pains that he had when sleeping on the old matress. I have had a temperpedic before, and I think this bed doesn't fall far from that brand. I did not have the plushy one, so I cannot compare it to the cloud.
 I was very excited to get this mattress, and was very disappointed when I got home from work to find it leaning against my apartment door. Not only was it not delivered compressed in a box like advertised, it was fully expanded, out of its plastic bag and had various points of damage (including a dirty handprint, and a small gash on the mattress cover). I realize that amazon delivers through contractors, and that the damages were probably the delivery guy's fault, but it should have been in a box in the first place, not a plastic bag.<br/><br/>I contacted amazon wondering if they would send me a replacement cover, but they said it would have to be a full mattress exchange. I did not return it because I did not want to go through the hassle of sleeping on the floor for who knows how long, plus the actual mattress had no damage and the thought of it getting disposed of was not encouraging (I moved from out of state with no furniture so I was buying everything new = no backup mattress). BE AWARE that if you order from Amazon and not directly from the manufacturer there is a chance it won't come protected in a box.<br/><br/>The mattress itself is very comfortable, I have been sleeping on it for one week so far and have not noticed anything worth complaining about. I will still be taking into consideration the 120 night trial period, but I hopefully won't have to use it.<br/><br/>All in all, no complaints on the product, but I am very disappointed with Amazon.
 **update - I took the memory foam topper off this. I had reused it from my old bed and like the mattress even better. It is denser but not hard. I think it is a great buy for the price.<br/><br/>I love this bed! I had a memory foam mattress topper so I kept it and use it over the mattress so I have never slept on it solo - but the difference between my old bed + the topper and this one is night and day. This was a great purchase - there are so many mattresses and so many reviews it was very hard to decide. One bad review and I would get thrown. In the end, I picked this one and feel like I got exactly what I wanted.
 The packaging was a bit of a pain to remove, but it built up quickly and was ready for use in minutes. It's super comfy, even without a box or frame yet. It's also nice that I can move without disturbing my partner, and I have yet to overheat on this thing like I do with any other mattress. I also sleep much better when I get to, and don't wake up feeling like a total zombie. I also have fewer migraines now.
 We've had our mattress for about a year and a half now. Its hasn't lost its shape at all and its still the most comfortable mattress we've ever owned. I do not find it to be too firm. I think it's just in between firm and soft.
 This mattress was so good then when I moved I had three different people call and ask to buy my mattress from me. Easily the comfiest thing I've ever slept on. Easy to set up and comes nicely packaged. The one downside to it was it was hard to get up once lying down. Made me late to A LOT of early morning meetings, workouts, class, etc. Would recommend to anyone buying a foam mattress. Also, a queen easily fits into a standard size crossover (Subaru Outback). Would highly recommend getting a frame and someone to wake you up in the mornings so you actually get out of bed.
 Versus our old Tempur(pedic):<br/><br/>+ noticeably cooler, which was our goal<br/><br/>- slightly more bouncy, so a restless partner is more noticeable.<br/><br/>Overall, we decided to keep this and dump the Tempurpedic.
 My girlfriend and I were sold on this mattress based on all the positive reviews and the trial period. Starting off, my girlfriend loved it and I was on the fence. It was firmer than my previous pillow-top mattress which took a couple weeks to adjust  to but after the "breaking in" period I was able to get a good night's sleep. Fast forward four months and we both have a hard time sleeping through the entire night without rolling around trying to get comfortable. Like clockwork, I usually wake up 4 hours into my sleep and wake up each morning feeling like I got a poor night's sleep. Naturally, we're past the return trial period so we're now looking into mattress toppers to make the best of the situation.
 Best sleep ever!!! I was suffering from chronic back pain and First day I slept on this bed and pain is gone~. I am a major snorer, yet my wife tell me I snore milder and quieter. Definitely, worth every penny. Bed is surprisingly supportive and it is not soft as I was imagining. Yet, very very comfortable. My 8 years old Daughter says "it is like sleeping on the cloud~~".
 Bought two of these via Amazon Prime in late April 2017.  Tried them for a few weeks straight "out of the box".  My wife and i both feel they are too firm, for us.  They seem soft when sitting on the edge, but we both toss/turn multiple times during the night and have some aches upon waking.  We did try to use various mattress toppers after the first few weeks to see if it helped, it helped a little. They seem well made and packaged.  Will update this review after we see how the Amazon return process works out.
 When I first pulled it out of the box I thought I would never be able to sleep on that thing.  I have had it about for one month and  I was surprised.  I am very comfortable on it. I have had chronic back pain for 25 years ever since I fractured my spine in an on the job accident. I did not expect to find any mattress that would fit my needs. So far this one has.<br/>Other than no side support which only bothers me when I am getting into my bed which sits very high. If the bed was lower it would be no problem at all.
 This is a great mattress.  After about two weeks, it seems to be doing exactly what I expected, allowing me to sleep well.  Only complaint...no info in the box regarding unboxing information, use, etc....I found a small marketing brochure in the bottom of the box focused on the feel good aspect of the product, happy customers, the message behind development, etc.. Nice, but not really a users or installation manual.  That is really the only missing piece for me.
 Look, prior to this mattress, I swore off ALL mattresses and decided that a 2 inch soft mattress pad on top of a HARD flat surface worked best for me. I'm a stomach sleeper and like my mattress FIRM. Firm like the floor, with some softness to contour to my body. Mattresses I've owned  before always sagged.<br/><br/>I discovered Tuft &amp; Needle in 2013 and bought my first bed (a full size) with them. I fell in love with Tuft and Needle. I loved it so much, I moved the full into my guest room and bought myself a queen a few months later. Loved it.<br/><br/>Recently I decided to upgrade to a king. Of course, having been a prior Tuft and Needle enthusiast, I was expecting the same firmness from the full and the queen. Unfortunately, not the case. I've had the king for about a week now and I can already feel the stiffness in my back. I was hoping the bed would get more firm in time, but I don't see that happening.<br/><br/>Lo and behold, I read all these reviews after the fact and find out that Tuft and Needle changed their formula because people complained it was too firm. My bad, I should have read those reviews first. But being a previous customer, I didn't feel reading reviews for a product I already loved was necessary.<br/><br/>I think Tuft and Needle should have options for softer and firmer mattresses. In addition, for people who are disciplined enough to do research (as I have now), they should give the ILD rating so that people know exactly what they're getting.<br/><br/>For those you like a firm mattress, you will be disappointed in Tuft and Needle now. I called their customer service and they said there's nothing they can really do for me. So unfortunately tragic. I give them 3 stars since I was completely happy with the first two mattresses I bought. Completely unhappy with the 3rd. I was hoping Tuft and Needle would still have older versions that they could replace mine with. But they do not.<br/><br/>Sorry Tuft and Needle, you lost a loyal fan. I'll come back if you give me a firm mattress option (44 ILD). If I were to rate the most recent mattress purchase, this would be around a 30 ILD, or a medium-firm mattress (I'm not an expert, I'm just going by the ratings that I've researched on other sites). I'm sure for a lot of people, it's perfect. For the select few (like me) it's too soft.<br/><br/>Here's the website I found explaining ILD: http://www.latexmattress.org/latex-faq/latex-firmness-ild.php
 So glad I purchased this bed! Needed an extra twin for guests and honestly was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews. It’s actually perfect! Inflated super quick as soon as you cut the plastic.  No odor at all! . Bed isn’t too firm like some of the reviews say. I’m actually pregnant and have been having lower back issues and the bed is actually perfect! And I even tried sleeping on the side and it’s fine.  Super happy with this purchase!!
 We had a kingsize Tuft &amp; Needle and when we decided to downsize that included the kingsize bed.  We choose to sleep on guest bed for a couple months while waiting for new house.  As soon as we closed on the new house I ordered my new queensize Tuft &amp; Needle and ooooh what a relief it is.  Had developed new aches and pains that have pretty much vanished since we got back into our Tuft &amp; Needle Bed.  We are very satisfied customers.  Decided that the guest room mattress was too uncomfortable for guests so will order another Tuft &amp; Needle before visitors arrive in November. For the record husband and I are both side sleepers.
 I've had my mattress for 6 months. Initially I loved it. My daughter bought one, as well. Wasn't too soft or too firm. Delivery was quick, set up easy. My only concern is at 6 months, I've been waking up with a stiff back. The mattress seems to be softer than when I first bought it. I am a bit worried that it will get more soft after time &amp; I will have to start looking for another. Any suggestions? I'm 5'7, 125 lbs. Light sleeper. Its difficult to get a good night's rest. I thought about buying a firm topper, but am afraid I'll be spending even more $$ with the same result. Again, for the cost, great mattress. Hoping this is as soft as it will get &amp; maybe my back is just acting up.<br/>Thanks!
 Wow wow wow!  I really value my sleep and have gone thru many mattresses in the recent years.  That said, knowing me I'll likely purchase another mattress in the next two to three years but T&amp;N so far has been the best first 6-month mattress EVER!  My back gets out of sorts easily and I prefer firm mattress.  And I also sleep on my side as well as on my back.  This mattress has all the right ingredients!  Love this mattress and recommend it to everyone!  I read that people were complaining about the edges not holding up/being soft - my thing is, should you be sleeping on the edge anyway?  And no, I don't think the edges are particularly softer or rolls off; it's the top layer that's supposed to be softer than the base material anyway.
 One of the biggest selling points for this mattress was knowing that Tuft and Needle would make it right if I did not find the mattress comfortable. Many reviews on amazon stated that Tuft and Needle would provide a topper if you found the mattress too firm, which it sounds like many people do. When i called Tuft and Needle to request this, they stated that they no longer send the topper for free and it would be $180 for me to order one. I declined and decided to return the mattress, which is also a big haslte. I will never buy Tuft and Needle again. i would strongly recommend going with a different brand.
 i typically sleep on one specific side of the bed (never have been a middle bed sleeper, not sure why), and have already started to notice a difference in the firmness between the two sides -- this cannot be normal, as its been less than a month of use -- that said, i've still got time left in the trial and im hoping things dont get any worse!
 One of the best purchases I've made. Bought one in college, and loved it so much I ordered another one after moving to a new city!<br/><br/>I pulled it out of the box and it was good to go in 10 seconds (although I did let it air out for a couple hours as per recommended instructions). I even bought the sheets from the SF store, and they've been amazing so far!<br/><br/>This bed is 100% worth the purchase if you're looking for a nice, relatively cheap mattress. You spend 1/3 of your life sleeping in a bed, so you don't want to cheap out.<br/><br/>But what really put T&amp;N over the top was their customer service.<br/><br/>I forgot to order the mattress in advance, but T&amp;N delivered it to my apartment the day I ordered it through the phone. I got some super nice emails from team members asking about my experience, including one of the co-founders. At the store in SF no one hounded me, they let me test out the sheets and even gave me a free t-shirt!<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this mattress, and T&amp;N as a company.
 We've had this mattress for 2 weeks now and are very happy. We were looking at Tempur-Pedic and were so desperate and were going to spend around $4k on a mattress. I was doing a ton of research and then saw a web ad for this and the Casper mattress. After watching 10 YouTube videos of reviews (had to since we couldn't lay on it ourselves) we took the plunge and ordered it. We saw that it would take about 2 weeks to get used to it or break it in which is true. The first night or two we were thinking "omg is this too firm?" but now we are happy. My husband is a hot box and i'm a freezer and we both sleep very comfortable. I was going to wait after the 100 days to write a review but no need. You honestly have nothing to lose to give this mattress a good try.
 These mattresses are amazing! Arrived right on time, expanded fully within a few hours, and so comfortable. We got two twins for our kids new bunk beds. My husband and I. without fail, always fall asleep when reading books to our youngest kiddo on his new bed! And my oldest is sleeping through the night again.
 Received a double size mattress in a box marked as queen. Not very impressed. Will update if I hear back from the manufacturer.<br/><br/>Updated: 7/14/18 - Tuft &amp; Needle is AMAZING!  They are shipping me another mattress directly from them, agreeing with me that since it was a manufacturer issue that Amazon should not be liable.  Furthermore, they are letting me keep the one I DID receive.  Hands down the best, most generous customer service I have ever received.  They have created a happy, raving customer for life.  Plus, after a few nights sleeping on it, it is the most comfortable mattress.  Quite firm, but I like that, and it is slowly starting to get a little softer on top.  You sink into it jusssst right.
 I was skeptical about purchasing a mattress online.  I read these reviews for hours before deciding on this one.  This is it folks.  It's the most comfortable mattress you'll ever sleep on.  Best night sleep I've had in years.  Not too soft, not too firm.... have had it a couple of months and it still isn't letting me down.  Won't make you hot at night either which was a BIG worry for me living in GA!  Simply put, my husband and I love this mattress.  Tuft and Needle is AMAZING! Wish I had found this sooner.
 I had been sleeping on a Chinese style bed that I had built into our bedroom.  The sleeping platform was plywood  with a mattress of  4-inch memory foam.  It was comfortable; but my doctor wanted me to have something cushier because of hip pain.  This Tuft and Needle mattress is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Not too firm and not too soft.  My dog likes it too.  The price can't be beat either.<br/>It came wrapped in a small package that magically turned into a twin mattress with just  a small flick of the scissors.  Amazing!
 Unfortunate I had to return this mattress because it was too soft for me, but I wanted to leave a glowing review because of your AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Easiest return processes I have ever experienced!  I would gladly buy another mattress from Tuff &amp; Needle if you ever happen to make a ROCK HARD mattress.  Thanks for being awesome!
 We bought this for our three year old. I did a lot of research on mattresses. I really wanted something safe for my son to sleep on. Most mattresses that similarly do not contain a boatload of harmful chemicals are quite a bit more expensive. The mattress is soft but very comfortable. My husband (who has a history of back issues) just stated that he is excited for my son and I to go out of town so he can sleep on this mattress in my sons room!
 My wife and I had a Casper King size that was lost by a moving company (don't get me started, yo), and after a month without a mattress we went ahead and got the Tuft and Needle King size mainly because the price. We're extremely happy that we did. My main complaint with the Casper was that it was too hard, and then my main complaint with a Leesa mattress (which we tested at a West Elm store) was that it was too soft and expensive. The Tuft and Needle is right in between firmness. We've been sleeping on it for 2 weeks and are very happy with our purchase.
 The price, great reviews and 100 day sleep trial are what convinced me to purchase the T&amp;N King. The mattress is very firm and well manufactured.<br/><br/>I slept on it for 3 weeks before purchasing a softer memory foam topper and new pillows but after a 40+ days of waking up with numb arms and shoulders and a sore back, I decided to return the mattress.<br/><br/>My girlfriend absolutely loved the mattress and had no issues. I am 6 ft and 210 lbs with broad shoulders and sleep on my side. I read that side sleepers tend to have more issues with the mattress.<br/><br/>I gave a 4 star rating because the return process was painless and excellent customer service.
 This is a wonderful mattress! I love it. This mattress is soft but supportive. I don't know how they did it, but they did! It arrived in a tight plastic wrap inside a box. Following the directions, we began to cut the tight plastic off, and the thing just swelled out of the wrapper. Cut faster, laughed my husband. Inside 5 minutes, we had a perfect, lovely, ready to sleep on, mattress. No waiting 24 hrs for it to expand. No waiting at all! I can't believe the low cost and the high quality. We liked it so much we bought another one (Cal King) for another room.
 We love this mattress.  We've had it over or almost over the 100 nights.  At first I thought it was going to be too hard but after the first few days (a week?) it seemed to settle into a firmness that was just right.  It is SO nice to have a mattress that doesn't have a hump down the middle where two frames are joined together...it's nice and flat all the way across the (king sized) mattress.  I am going to purchase a twin size for my daughter.
 I bought this hoping for the best, but liking the fact that it would be donated to charity when it didn't work out... Boy was i surprised!<br/><br/>I have lower back and hip issues (5'8" 175 lbs) and wake up in extreme discomfort if I'm on my back this mattress is supportive but not hard, and i can lay flat on my back without pain.<br/><br/>I do sleep on it with a Columbia cooling pad for my hot flashes (and I'm in Florida), so don't know how cool the mattress is by itself.
 I researched buying this mattress or any mattress for years.  I liked the reviews, I liked the fact they would pick it up if I didn't like it, I liked the price.  I liked the details on the page describing the mattress and the servives that followed it.  It is what they said.  I bought it 8 months ago.  Waited to post to be sure.  It is a very nice sleep.  It is also, as described, medium support, not to soft, not to hard.  I have no complaints.  It's helped my back and knees.  I think it's all they advertise and all they promised.
 Perfect softness and support! Upgraded from Sleep Innovations and very happy!
 This was my first bed purchase! After sleeping on the same hand me down matress for my entire adult life, I finally gave in and purchased this mattress! I experience back pain and knee pain from working retail, and the firmness of this mattress has changed my sleeping and comfort level ten fold. I am glad I made this purchase, it's exactly what I was looking for! I wish the pillows weren't so expensive, or I would have added those on too! You cannot put a pricetag on comfort and quality sleep, but this makes it a little easier!
 Incredible! So happy with this purchase. My husband and I had enough with our old mattress we were VERY hesistant about buying a mattress we haven’t tested out. However we were very pleased with the mattress. We’ve had it for over a month and we are getting the best sleep we’ve gotten in years. When friends come over they test it out and tell us this will be their next big purchase.
 This is my first review ever for Amazon. I bought this mattress because I suffer nightly with knee pain and daily with low back muscle pain. After reading about this mattress and its Casper competitor I opted for this mattress not because it was cheaper but because it was reviewed as being firmer than Casper. Having experienced memory foam mattresses in the pastI did not want that feeling of sinking into the mattress and the heat that generates and gives that smothered feeling. I received the mattress in a timely fashion and changed out my old mattress right away. The first night of sleeping on the mattress was no different than my old mattress I tossed and turned and couldn't get comfortable and my knee pain was just as bad as always and I woke with  stiff strained low back muscles. I was sorely disappointed, but I decided not to give up , and glad I didn't gradually the mattress became more and more comfortable by the end of the week my knee pain had diminished by 80% and my low back muscle pain and stiffness almost completely disappeared. A month in no more painful pressure points and all night tossing and turning I am actually getting some quality sleep . I generally don't write reviews but when I come across a product that stands up to what it claims I feel good about endorsing it.
 I love the mattress. Best investment I made for my camper. However, I am "paying the idiot tax" - the item dropped in price by over $100 for Prime Day. Purchased exactly 2 weeks ago and Amazon will not refund the difference.
 I ordered this mattress with two-day shipping from Amazon Prime. It arrived in large rectangular box, which is heavy but I could move it by myself. The mattress was tightly compressed, held by plastic wrap, but was easy to remove from box by inverting the box. Because mattress is compressed and wrapped tightly, you must cut the plastic wrapper CAREFULLY. Once freed, the mattress will expand. It also has a mild chemical odor, so I opened windows to air out the room. I let mattress sit unused for a day to air out and fully expand, then covered as usual with normal-depth queen mattress pad and sheets. This is my first foam mattress and it resides in a spare bedroom, so I don't sleep on it often. I prefer firmer mattresses and this mattress feels firm, firmer than my regularly-used firm Stearns &amp; Foster coil/spring mattress. It felt comfortable whether I slept on my back or my side. My cousin, who has lower back pain and prefers firmer mattress, slept on this mattress for three days straight and said she slept great.
 I’ve had it for about 2 months now and I still love it!! It was a little hard at first but I got use to it. I had a pillow top before this so it was a change for me. Overall though I’ve noticed I wake up with less aches and pains with this mattress!
 It arrived much sooner than they had estimated.  Upon opening the box what was noticeable was the fact that there was NO odor!  The last few foam mattresses we've bought (not from this company) had a very strong and offensive odor so that was a very pleasant surprise!  My son, who the mattress is for, said it's very comfortable and he can't wait to sleep on it tonight!
 Much firmer than expected. Better after after a few weeks of getting used to it.<br/>We've been using for 2 months now. Definitely would NOT buy another one. It's just to firm
 Seems to be working for now although it gets hot &amp; I always wake up sweaty, which is odd because I am not someone who typically runs hot. It is firm but comfortable and it helped my back pain compared to my old mattress. I think it could be a little softer since I sleep on my side - sometimes I wake up and my arms/shoulder hurt from sleeping on my side on the firm bed. But overall I think we will keep it because it has been so much better than my last mattress and it was a good price compared to its competitors.
 Love this bed! We had to replace all 7 mattresses in our household and for the first time I purchased a king size. Love it. I am 5' 4" and about 110lbs. My husband is 6' 1" and 230lbs. Very comfortable for both of us. Good side firmness. Wish I could spend more time laying around in bed! Only one drawback is I am VERY sensitive to motion transfer and I do feel my husband moving around.
 We bought this bed for our spare room. Slept on it a few nights to try it out. Now, we wish we had one for the master bedroom!<br/><br/>The mattress did have a slight oder when we first unboxed it, but that dissipated pretty quickly. It sleeps well. It didn't sag or confine you to one sleeping position.  Overall, very comfy and a good night's sleep.
 Waited a month to post this.  On average, for the last year, I have only managed to get about 3 hours a sleep a night.This mattress has literally changed my life.  It would take me 2-3 hours to get to sleep sometimes on our old mattress, which was a quilt top, only 3 years old.  I am asleep in less than 30 minutes with this new mattress.  And I am sleeping for around 5 hours now.  Not to mention, I am not getting hot on it, and feel pretty comfortable in any position I choose.  I am buying these for my whole family, and telling everyone I know about them.  Wheres my free pillow?
 What’s with the weird rating items?<br/><br/>Durability- I can’t rate since it’s only a month old but so far so good.<br/>Lightweight- yeah um no, but it’s a mattress for cryin’ out loud that’s not why i bought it, lol<br/>Giftable- umm yeah weird gift but i guess you could.<br/><br/>Now in with the real rating.<br/>Holy crap is it comfy.  Love it way more than my previous foam bed.  It’s supportive for me in all positions warm but not hot so glad i took a chance on this brand.  Would definitely buy again
 We have had this since August 29th; delivery and packaging/set up was fine and worked smooth. The mattress is a little too soft for me. My husband has some minor back problems, he says this is better that what we had before, but I'm not sure I agree. Ive woken up with aches I never had before.  Mattress preference is so personal, but, again, this is on the softer side. No fault to the company who makes it, but if you like more on the firm side, this might not work for you. Im considering returning if I can find a more firm mattress that is not a bank breaker; but maybe we will have to go there. Mattresses are so ridiculously expensive; probably wont buy online again - I think one really needs to try it out first hand.
 I had my soft Simmon's Beautyrest for a long time. I was getting to where my back would always hurt when I woke up and I knew it was time for a new mattress. I read so many reviews and asked so many people when I ultimately decided on this one. No one recommended it, but the reviews and customer service promises got me. I got it on Prime Day for a great deal. Plus, if you get the right kind of bed frame, you don't even need a box spring! I've slept on my Tuft &amp; Needle for a couple of weeks now and I am so satisfied! I truly don't wake up with back pain anymore and it keeps me at a good temperature. Very pleased with my purchase :)
 Had to replace a Sleep Number bed as I constantly wake with back ache no matter the setting. We decided on an adjustable bed frame and the T&amp;N Twin XL mattresses. Came in and fully expanded in about 20 seconds. So far only 3 nights but no back ache any of the 3 nights!<br/>My wife has RA and shoulder, hip and ankle issues and she also has not woken with additional pain. So far we love the mattress and our daughter is thinking about buying one also and she laid on ours and almost fell asleep!
 I am officially a bed-in-a-box believer! I was really skeptical at first, but we've had it for about a month and I absolutely love it.  Doesn't wake me when my husband comes to bed later than me, don't wake up with a sore back anymore... now i just need to upgrade everything else!!
 We invested in a foam mattress for ourselves 8 years ago. We debated getting the same brand for the kids. My brother decided on a T&amp;N and raved about it - comparing it to our mattress. We purchased one mattress for our oldest child to “try it out”. His is on a platform frame. He really likes it. We just bought another one for our younger child who will have his on a box spring. We also bought a pillow for each of them.  We are considering one for our camper because they come in a box - it will be easy to get the around the right corner of our 5th when and unpack it and let it expand in the MAster bedroom.
 Shipping was quick, we actually had to wait another 5 days for the base (another company) we ordered to arrive, before opening the mattress box. We called the company because the king size width is off by a little more than 3.5 inches. The customer rep told us to give it a few more days, however,  never expanded any more than the first day. We slept on it for a couple of nights, to test it out. It was too firm for me. I'm a side sleeper and I feel my shoulders and hips achy in the morning. I thought it's just trying to get used with a new bed. My husband, a very sound sleeper, seems to be okay with it. We then went away on vacation and slept in a hotel touted with good beds. I didn't have any achy shoulder/hip during the 2 weeks. I'm not sure if the T&amp;N is just too firm for me (120 lbs/ 5'2".) Anyway, we will definitely return it due to the very obvious short width, we just keep on bumping our shins on the bed frame. We are just trying to find out how to return it without lugging it out of our 2nd story bedroom. I would love to really like this bed, I wish the king size mattress is true to size and a little less firm.
 I am super picky about my beds, I have a hard time sleeping in most places that arent home because of the horrible mattresses in hotels. I dont understand why everyone likes a soft mattress.<br/><br/>This sleeps at about a 7.5 to 8 out of 10 on how firm this is, I usually lean closer to the higher end of that scale<br/><br/>It sleeps a bit warmer than i prefer but nothing that cant be fixed by leaving the ceiling fan on in the low setting.
 We purchased this mattress for my elderly mother and she said that it hurt her hips.  I called Tuft &amp; Needle to find out if there was a solution and they sent us a topper ($120 value) free of charge to see if that would help her.  Worked like a charm!  The customer service is second to none and they want their customers to be happy.  I know they are super easy to work with if you decide to return the mattress as well.  I will definitely keep recommending them as they are a pleasure to work with.
 We have had this mattress for 7 months now. It arrived in 2 days and was a cinch to set up. We let it breath for about 4 hours. Not much smell initially and it went away after the 4 hours. The first 3 nights my back was sore but that's normal when going from a 10 year old spring mattress to a foam one like this. After the 3 days I slept like a rock. More like a stoned boulder. Buying this mattress was a great experience. I see no point in spending thousands of dollars on a mattress after buying this. The large companies that do sell mattresses for that much money have a lot to make up for with expenses like having a storefront, sales staff, marketing, delivery trucks, etc.. this company and others like it do not have these expenses so less cost goes to the consumer. 'MERICA!
 I have to say I didn't keep the mattress. I am 6'4" and 300lbs and the mattress wasn't supportive enough for me (I felt like). However, I am giving a high review because Tuft and Needle and Amazon were super amazing at honoring the trial period and refunded my money on the mattress.<br/><br/>I would recommend giving it a try if you're a big smaller person. You may find this mattress perfect for you!
 Bought it 6 months ago. Arrived on time in a package so small that I thought they sent the wrong size but once we unrolled it, it expanded to a full king-sized mattress. With our plush pillows, this is the most comfortable bed I've slept in. Soft on top, firm underneath cool to the touch, I'm out like a light in no time flat.<br/><br/>The edges of the bed are soft so I don't recommend sitting on them to put on socks and shoes too often. That's a super minor price to pay for all the good night sleep.
 After reading reviews and talking to the company, I bought this. I have used it for 2 months. It is not as soft as I thought. soft form on the top is only 2 inch which is not good enough to make it soft(It looks like newer version is coming with 3 inch). I get body pain every morning, but my wife has no problem. I added mattress pad https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F53H74I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1, but that also did not help. Overall I can say it is a good bed, but looks like it is not suitable for my body.
 I've been reading great things about Tuft &amp; Needle for years as a Huckberry regular. I've probably had it in and out of my Huckberry shopping cart at least 10 times. Amazon had a great Black Friday deal so I was able to pull the trigger and buy it. As a night owl who always struggles to fall asleep at a reasonable hour... this mattress has made a huge impact on my daily routine. It's crazy comfortable and very supportive of your back. I fall asleep within minutes of laying down.<br/><br/>The company seems great, I've emailed back and forth with them for set up advice. I have mine on 3" spaced out slats. The setup is a breeze. You will not regret this purchase. I've had it for a couple weeks and still wake up wondering why I didn't set aside the money to buy this sooner. Next on the list... Tuft &amp; Needle pillows.
 Couldn't be more happy with this purchase. I have been sleeping on a firm Beautyrest inner-spring mattress for several years. In that time I have experience lower, left side back pain that has grown progressively worse over time. Although I am primarily a back sleeper, I have recently taken to sleeping on my side, fetal position with a pillow between my knees because that's what a doctor recommended for those suffering from low back pain. Side sleeping on my old mattress didn't really improve my back pain, it did however make my shoulders hurt.<br/><br/>I bought the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress because I thought it would help alleviate the discomfort in my shoulder allowing me to convert to a side sleeper. It has don't that, but more importantly, 3 days into sleeping on this mattress I can sleep on my back in my preferred position again or on my side with no pillow between my knees. In only 3 nights, the pain in my lower back hasn't been eliminated, but it is greatly reduced.<br/><br/>The mattress does run warm, I am hopeful that is something I will acclimate to, especially before the warm months of the year.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this mattress.
 I have suffered from lower and middle back pain for years. I am 34, 6' and about 225lbs.  I sleep on my stomach mostly. The first night I slept on this mattress I loved how it felt, and woke up completely amazed that my back actually didn't hurt. Literally the first time in years. I am very very pleased. The mattress is firmer than expected, but is firm in a way where you sink in a bit and it almost cradles you there.
 An AWESOME mattress, especially for the price.  I used to have a spring "flip-able" mattress and no matter how often we'd flip the mattress -- just about every season -- it could never compare to how comfortable this mattress is, without flipping!  It came very well packaged, instructions included on how to fluff it out, and once we laid it on the bed and actually laid on it, it was pure heaven.  The mattress actually seems to conform to your own individual body as you lay on it, making it comfortable for you on your side while your partner is completely independently comfortable as it's conforming to them on their side.  It does not overheat you with unnecessary fluff, it's easy to get in and out of, firm yet soft, like sleeping on a soft sandy beach with a pillow.
 My husband and I really needed a new mattress because our old one was so noisy, dusty, and it was too small. I did a lot of research and decided on this one based on the recommendation from Consumer Reports. It was one of their recommended buys and it was within our budget. I'm very glad we bought it! I feel like I sleep more deeply and I don't toss and turn as much. My husband loves it too. The only downside about this mattress is that I just want to stay in bed every morning when my alarm clock goes off. I highly recommend this mattress! It's a fantastic value!
 Super clean, packed well without much waste, no mildew or mold (believe me it happens), off gassing was minimal.  Mattress soft in feel, but extremely comfortable and supportive.  I have had some very bad experiences buying mattresses online, so I was extremely pleased to discover:  a top notch, quality product: comfortable, fairly priced for its quality, and surprisingly odor free after an hour.  Sleeping really well now.  Thank you Tuft and Needle. Will buy more of these when needed.
 My husband and I suffer from serious arthritis and low back pain. We bought new beds recently and our pain got worse. I decided to give the Tuft and Needle Mattress a shot because I figured, I had little to lose. The package was easy to manage and the mattress was easy to maneuver on to our frame. I am shocked at how comfortable I felt and how quickly and soundly I slept the very first night. I did not move the entire night. I woke up rested and my back pain was gone. Finally, a bed/mattress that allows your body to relax entirely and wake up pain free. If you are thinking about buying a Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress...DO IT!!!
 Ive had this mattress for about a month now. Prior to this I had a cheap IKEA mattress with a 1 inch foam topper that was about 10 years old. Unpacking was pretty cool, the mattress takes its full shape in a couple of minutes. I have to say the mattress is a lot firmer than I expected it to be. It definitely took me a week or so to get used to the firmness. By now I sleep well on it and wake up pain free. The mattress is far from a super cozy, luxurious, resort type mattress, but for $600 its a good buy. If I get 5 years out of it, I'll be happy.
 Very comfortable. I was hesitant to order a mattress I hadn't seen or tested but with the long trial period and free return I figured it was worth a shot. So glad I went ahead, very happy with this purchase.
 This mattres is very light and fairly firm.  I put a cushiony mattress pad on top to add just the right amount of softness.  It has very nice support edge to edge, and you do not feel the mattress move when the other sleeper moves around or gets up. We like it and sleep well.
 Well for starters I know several people who swear by this bed and I’ve laid on a few here and there so I felt like I knew what I was getting into. The bed showed up as advertised in a nice box and we unwrapped it and cut the plastic and there was little to no smell associated with its expansion.  We let it do it’s thing for two days.  To say the bed was firmer than expected is an understatement, in fact I went back to my friends with the same bed and theirs feels quite plush compared to the one I got.  Perhaps it is just breaking in, perhaps it needs to be beat up a bit, but certainly I feel like I’ve been in a car wreck each time I wake up from sleeping on this mattress. I’ve called T&amp;N and they were very nice and extremely helpful and the top it off, someone answered the phone! Like a real person! They sent us out a mattress topper for our bed and I have been away from home but I look forward to trying the toppper and getting the T&amp;N experience that people rave about.  Bottom line, this bed is quite firm so be ready for it!
 I was INCREDIBLY on the fence with this mattress. I read every review on amazon, several blogs, and spent months pouring over all kinds of mattresses wanting to make the best choice for the money. My parents own a fine furniture store and I am able to get nearly every store brand mattress at cost. I have wanted a Tempurpedic mattress for years, but even at cost those babies are still pretty expensive and I move around overseas every few years - without bringing my furniture most of the time. I am a very hot sleeper, a side sleeper, and I have spine problems from a car accident years ago. From reading the reviews (one Tempurpedic owner rated T&amp;N higher!), I was too tempted to resist any longer and decided that the customer service seemed good enough that if it didn't work out, I could return it with minimal hassle. BEST DECISION EVER. Within two days, my chronic back pain was the lowest it has been in years. I feel like a new person and getting out bed in the morning is one of the hardest parts of my day! Its hard to spend this much money on a faith purchase, and for that I really wish people had a chance to try it out somewhere. For me, this worked out so well. This is the best mattress I have ever owned, slept on, or tried out.
 Okay at first I was skeptical of a mattress that is made of foam and arrives to you by regular mail in a box. I was 50/50 on this purchase I was prepared to tell them to come pick this thing up, cause I thought there was no way a mattress that fits into a box that can ship to my door was going to hold up well at all or support me. I was mistaken and pleasantly surprised by this mattress it has changed my opinion of this type of mattress and the need to buy $1000 + mattresses from the big box stores with the pushy sales guys/gals. First off let me state I'm not a small guy by any means I am 6ft 4" 285lbs and this mattress does not sink or bottom out and supports me very well. Just like any mattress even my old queen size $1000 Sealy  mattress if you sit on the corner edge it will compress and touch your frame our supports so a box spring or proper bed frame is required. The mattress cover is durable and nice it seems to be holding up well so far and it can be removed for washing even though I haven't tried it yet it doesn't appear to be a difficult process. I bought two sets of cuddle dud flannel sheets and they hold on very well I don't see a problem with sheets sliding off as long as you don't buy cheap sheets. So far we have had our mattress about 3 months now and have not had any issues and I'm sleeping very well. It does take some getting used to it is a little firm but not to firm and you WILL feel uncomfortable at first if you're not used to a firm mattress but after a week or so on the mattress I sleep better than I have on any mattress and wake up feeling better. There is also not a lot of motion transfer when getting in or out of bed so you don't have to worry about waking up someone sleeping next to you.This is an honest free opinion of this mattress from a regular consumer this review was not paid for in any way.
 I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on high end mattresses. This one is by far the best buy for my wife and I. We absolutely love this mattress. Not too soft, not too firm, but just right lol. You won't be disappointed. If you don't like it, the company will refund your money within 100 nights and donate the mattress to a charity. You can beat it.
 In my line of work I have had many injuries including gunshot wounds, broken ribs and bones.  I could never sleep more than two hours at a time because of pain.  This mattress changed my life.  I now sleep well hardly moving during the night . I have almost no pain now and would buy this mattress again.  You have a 100 night sleep testing period.  You have a restful pain free night waiting for you. It takes little time to adjust.  Take the chance.  I believe you will be happy you did.
 It's ok. The firmness is a bit odd, not so soft as to be soft, but not really hard either. I think the top most layer is very soft and the rest fairly hard so it just ends up feeling kinda weird.  It sleeps a bit hot, but not too much.  All in all I would say it's worth the cost, but definitely not a nice as the more expensive brands.
 the mattress was a tad too firm for me; but that's so subjective that it's hard to know until it was here.  I reached out to the service group and got a very prompt reply with suggestions and they ended up sending me one of their queen mattress toppers that solved the problem.<br/>The topper is so good that i'm going to order one for the other bed.<br/>Service and follow up is wonderful, from Tuft and Needle, and the products are great.
 I was recommended by a couple of work friends and after seeing that consumer reports and reviewers on Amazon found it to be fantastic, I gave it a try.  Amazon's delivery for prime is stellar, but I was unsure when I saw how small the box was. But, amazingly, the mattress unfolded and inflated within a couple of minutes to perfection. It is very comfortable and quiet. Molds to my body and just firm enough. I hope my wife enjoys it as much as I do.
 This mattress makes the short list for healthy products.  It is also fairly light weight and comes in a package that you probably won't stuff it back into after opening.  It is firm.  We've spent as much on toppers as we have the mattress and still haven't come up with a comfortable fit (5 combinations).  I sleep on my back and my wife on her side.  I'm 220, she's 120 so we're not squeezing the guts out of it.  Disappointing.  The return window closed and I'm not willing to keep it for years so someone else will get this one soon.
 Took a few days, but we're now totally in love with this mattress.  The ease of selection and purchase, along with the recommendation from Gear Patrol and Amazon users steered us to it.  Then, the ease of ordering, delivery, and unpackaging made us excited!  And after a week or two on it (the smell is serious at the start) it's totally comfortable, *with support*, which is why we bought it in the first place.  We had a sad, saggy, middle-crater inner spring mattress, but now we love the foam!  It sleeps cool, stays in shape, and I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.<br/><br/>&gt; One month later, and still the best mattress decision I've ever made.  It feels good to feel good about the price tag too!
 After LOTS of research, Tuft &amp; Needle got my money. Unfortunately after a while all of these mattresses start to look alike. Functionally, 2 things caught my attention with this mattress.<br/><br/>1. Each layer of foam is put together with a thin layer of glue. The more layers of glue, the less air circulation you have. This can generate more heat.<br/>2. When I've slept on the memory foam mattresses, they wrap around you and you feel like you're stuck. Also, eventually that softer material will hold your body impression.<br/><br/>This foam is actually firmer than I thought I would like. When I initially tried it out, I thought I would be returning it quickly because I thought my body preferred a softer (not soft) mattress.<br/><br/>Previously I had a spring mattress with a built-in memory foam topper. I knew it was time to replace the bed but it was a big expense that I wasn't ready to deal with. I was suffering with back pain for a few years. I always dreaded going to bed because I knew I would wake up with more pain than I started with. I suspected the bed had something to do with it but I had no idea it was the cause. One week after sleeping on this bed, I was totally pain free.<br/><br/>The experience was great. After I got it onto my existing bed frame, I opened it up. It expanded to full size in a few minutes. Some foam mattresses tell you that you have to wait 24-48 hours before sleeping on it (where do you sleep until then?), but not this one. I did verify with their customer service beforehand but you can sleep on it immediately. The foam is encased in a T&amp;N removable cover and there was NO SMELL.<br/><br/>They need to work on their marketing. I just happened to stumble across them. Also the box that it is packaged in doesn't tell you there's a mattress inside (see picture). Apparently they don't realize that they can be selling in transit AND when that box is on the curb waiting for the recycling truck. That "ghost mattress" is getting a lot of exposure but T&amp;N is the real deal.<br/><br/>Finally the thing that convinced me to give them a try was the 100 day test period. Yeah, a lot of companies are offering this but when I discovered that if you decide to return it, they don't take it back. Instead they donate it to a homeless shelter. A socially conscious (and proud of it) mattress company...I'm hooked. They also mention on their website how they came out with a new product and overpriced the item (pillow). Once they discovered the true cost of manufacturing and selling, they gave the people who already purchased it a refund. Who does that??? I can't tell enough people about T&amp;N.<br/><br/>It is good to see a US based company doing the right thing. Kudos to T&amp;N!
 I don't generally review products but I know they can be really helpful when deciding on a bigger purchase, especially if there is no way to try it out before buying.  I wish I would have paid a bit more attention to the negative reviews before we ordered this mattress, as well as the trial period, because we have owned it for 1 year and are about to head out shopping for a new mattress, thank god. I really wanted to like this mattress! I heard about it via someone I follow on instagram (yes, lesson learned) and it seamed like a great company, quality memory foam, and it's very affordable. When we first started sleeping on it I was surprised at how VERY FIRM it was but figured it would soften up eventually. Nope. Definitely does not soften up. I was pregnant at the time we first got it and I think I just attributed any new aches and pains to pregnancy. But now, 1 year later, I wake up feeling truly awful. Neck and back pain, aching joints, I've even started having numbness in my hands and arms when I first wake up. I'm a side and stomach sleeper and honestly at this point if feels like I might as well just be sleeping on the floor. I'm a healthy, 37 year old, average height/weight female, and honestly this bed has made me question my sanity. Stating the obvious, I would not recommend this mattress.<br/><br/>2 stars and not 1 because I like what the company is trying to do.
 We LOVE this mattress. My husband and I went back and forth for a week on which mattress to get for our first apartment. Finally we settled on this one based on the reviews and price point. We are SO THRILLED with our decision. Word of advice: this mattress will take up to five days to fully inflate (or whatever they call it) it was extremely soft at first but it stiffened up to just right after 5 days. We love this mattress and have recommended it to a few friends! Definitely worth the money to have a nice mattress to lay down in at night!
 No one is pickier about their beds than me, I was extremely hesitant to purchase online without ever trying it out, but oh boy I am I glad I made this purchase.  First of all, it decompresses in all of 10 seconds and to watch that is pretty interesting.  When I first laid on it, it kind of felt like I was floating which was also interesting.  My first night's sleep on this bed was the best sleep I've had in quite a while.  Slept like a rock.  It has pretty good firmness to it in comparison to other memory foam like materials, which I prefer.  It doesn't get hot when you sleep on it and it doesn't give you that "stuck" feeling like others.<br/><br/>If I could give more stars, I would.  If you looking at this product right now wondering if you should get this mattress - stop reading, add to cart, and checkout.  You'll thank me.
 I had read a lot of reviews and was comforted by the 30 night trial (100 nights if ordered directly from the company) so I took the leap and ordered the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. It arrived and I unrolled it on my bed, it was only about 2 inches thick in the vacuum sealed bag.  That lead to doubts about how comfortable it could really be.  I removed the packaging and made the bed and about 4 hours later went to bed expecting a good mattress or at least a better mattress than what I currently had (8 year old Serta spring mattress). I will admit that I was totally impressed - without any doubt it was the most comfortable mattress I have ever laid on.  For the first time in my life I've been able to comfortably sleep on my back. I've only had it for 4 nights but am blown away by how great this product has been so far.  I will update after a few months to let you know if anything changes.<br/><br/>Update: I've had the mattress for a little more than 30 nights and it remains the most comfortable mattress I've slept on. It seems that Tuft &amp; Needle have a quality product at a very good price.
 I am so sorry I did not return these in time, but life got in the way. These mattresses are hard. Really hard. My kids have tried to like them, but it was just impossible, they keep coming back to our bed. After trying to sleep in theirs, I can see why. I loved their superior environmental ratings, but if you can't use it, you can't use it.
 After doing a lot of online reading I decided to order, knowing that there is a 100 day trial period. Very glad I did, the mattress arrived quickly, was fairly easy to unbix (queen size was a bit unwieldy but not too tough for one person to move around) and best of all is wonderfully comfortable. Definitely falls into the “not too hard, not too soft” range.  My back and hips feel much better compared to sleeping on my old mattress.
 I'm big, and I'm old.<br/>Recent visit to relatives, I was assigned a basement floor bedroom on an odd looking mattress.<br/>BEST NIGHT EVER.<br/>For the first time in recent memory, I slept ALL NIGHT LONG.<br/>Same throughout the week.  It wasn't just one night, but every night.<br/><br/>Returning home to my own bed- awful. Wasn't the same. Found out the mattress was from a website called "bed-in-a-box". On this website, the XLTwin was $550.  Did some more searching, came back to the same website, and the price had gone up $100!! The price changed every time I went to this website!!!<br/><br/>Checked Consumer Reports, and they ranked this "Tuft &amp; Needle" mattress higher. And it's MUCH less expensive.<br/>I don't like to gamble $350 bucks, but the gamble played off.<br/>After years of trying to find a mattress, this is it.<br/>I've done memory foam, gel, expensive Mattress Firm, to cheap stores. I had been currently sleeping on a 25 year old coil mattress we had in storage.<br/>I don't work for anyone- I'm retired.<br/>If you have sore shoulders, aches and pains that wake you up, and sides get sore, this might give you your nights back, like it did me.
 My wife and I were shocked when we woke up after our first night on this mattress. It's a difficult decision to pull the trigger on an online, foam mattress and we were hesitant, but we're so glad we made the jump after dealing with such an old and unsupportive mattress all these years!
 They say, give it 30 days. 30 days later, I was 28 days in pain. Not for me. Ordered a GhostBed instead, 5 days in a row, no pain. Love it.
 Wow. Double wow. Triple wow.<br/><br/>This is a NICE mattress. I shopped like crazy and was told about T&amp;N through a friend after lots of frustration and crappy mattresses trying to be sold to me by cheesy mattress salesmen in local stores<br/><br/>Do it. If it's not for you, it doesnt cost a penny. And it keeps you from having to travel around and deal with sleazy mattress salesman.<br/><br/>FYI... I timed it. I opened the box, unrolled plastic containing the mattress and put it on top of my foundation, and cut and removed the bag. Total time was less than 2 minutes.
 Alright ya'll, review time.<br/>My husband and I bought an expensive, traditional mattress 3 years ago, and we've hated it every day since. It caved in the middle almost immediately and we spent our nights waking up on top of each other in the Grand Canyon that had developed in the center of our bed.<br/>So we went looking.<br/>He wanted something firm and supportive. I wanted something soft and relaxing. We looked at countless mattresses, and they were all unnecessarily expensive and nowhere near comfortable for either one of us.<br/>And then we discovered Tuft &amp; Needle.<br/>While it's true that we bought their mattress, we also bought their mission; to produce something everyone needs in a way that's affordable and accessible, and a happy medium for people that want something completely different out of the same bed.<br/>And we love it.<br/>It was delivered to our house, no delivery person necessary, no hassle, no fee. And now we wake up in the morning refreshed, instead of at 3 AM in the middle of the bed underneath our partners elbow.
 Frankly this mattress is no better than a memory foam mattress that I had before it. Both my husband and I think the mattress feels the same way our icomfort mattress felt. We tried it with a box spring and then with a platform bed.  I will say after reading other reviews, that the mattress we received did NOT smell like chemicals as other buyers had indicated. Overall, it is an "okay" mattress.
 I researched many mattresses and end up with this one. I am thrilled! It is everything we could want! Fast shipping, easy assembly, inflates within seconds unlike some you have to wait hours or days!<br/><br/>My husband and I are both different types of sleepers and it accommodates us both. I love the soft but supportive feel and I sleep amazing on it. My husband was amazed at the comfort and convince for such a great price! And knowing that if something goes wrong with it they stand by there product is awesome. Unbeatable company and product.
 We have this for over a couple months now and it lived up to our expectations. It did feel a little too firm in the first couple weeks but we either got used to it or it softened after a few days. Overall, we are happy we bought this and it does contribute to a good quality of sleep.
 I really enjoy this bed! I had never gotten a mattress until this one.(all others had been passed down to me) I have spinal issues so i tend to wake up a lot at night to toss and turn. When I got this bed I was waking up maybe once or twice at night which was a fantastic development. This may not be the most amazing mattress ever but I can say with confidence that I am very satisfied with my experience! Thanks for the Mattress!
 At first I was happy with this memory foam mattress but now having slept on it for almost 4 months, I'm having severe pain in my lower back as well as between my shoulder blades.  We put these on an adjustable base however using any adjustments just makes it worse.  Definitely would not recommend.
 We really wanted to like this matress, but it’s just not comfortable when you move toward the edge. It’s also to soft for our liking. I’m going to attempt to return the mattress through UPS. I’m not sure how I’m supposed to get it back in the box. Tuft and Neddle doesn’t charge for returning the mattress like Amazon.<br/><br/>I’ll update this posting after I deal with UPS and try to stuff this back in the box...
 Best mattress on the market no question. We purchased a king size a few years back and 9solutely love it. No back pain anymore, sleep through the night, just wonderful night sleep. If you are going from regular mattress to memory give it a few weeks. If too firm - walk on it. We have had ours for 3 or 4 and still love it so much just bought another for spare bedroom. Highly Reccomend.
 We have used this mattress for about a month now.  Like I told my husband a few nights ago - this is a great cheap mattress.  It does definitely cut down on motion transfer, which was the primary reason we bought it and ditched our interspring mattress.  However, the edge is unsupported and you do feel a bit like you are going to roll right out of the bed if you get too close to the edge.  Overall, for the price, it is a great buy.  It shipped very quickly and although the container was very beat up, the mattress itself was packed so well that it was absolutely fine. If we get 3 years of use from it before upgrading to something better I will consider it money very well spent.
 I have had this mattress for several months. It came with a strong smell that wore off in about a week. It's definitely a good quality mattress that has kept its shape well. It is firm though, and has a lot of bounce back. Pressure points hurt when I wake up in the morning. It's a solid mattress that I think will make a good foundation for a mattress topper of a more body-conforming material.  It might be best for someone who likes a firm mattress and has no back pain.
 could not have made a better choice! I know I needed a better quality mattress due to lower back problems, but did not want to spend tons of money. so i browsed mattresses here on Amzn and came across this one here. i read at least 30 reviews on this product, before I made a decision. The mattress is firm, but contours nicely around your body and will provide you with a good nights sleep. i would buy this mattress all over again and i forwarded the info to a friend who is also on the market for a new mattress.
 I had a cheaper memory foam mattress from amazon before this one, so I can compare them like that. When I bought this one, I was really debating it because it was almost double the price of the cheaper one I had before, that I was perfectly ok with.<br/><br/>So compared to the cheaper brand I bought, this one is softer. It has a nice soft layer on the top compared to the others which is just solid memory foam it feels like. It's still a pretty firm bed though.<br/><br/>I think this bed is worth it over the cheaper versions, but I'm also not thrilled with this type of bed as my main mattress also.
 I've waited five months to write a review of this mattress, but it's time to let everyone know how much I love it. Its cooler than memory foam, has the comfort of a pillow top, but has the support only foam can provide. I don't know what more to say. I did tons of research, but this mattress has exceeded my expectations in every way, and at an excellent price. This one will soon be going in the guest room and I'll be buying the same mattress in a king for the master.
 Best quality bed ever ,  the bed it’s a bit to soft for me<br/>Since I have a machine in my back and I m a bit heavy but man no more soreness or body aches every morning like before it took one. Goth and bamm , the only thing it’s they don’t specify how exactly you or what you use as a base user Mattress because mynold box spring it’s like sinking and my metal base it’s all wired across the top so<br/>Do I get a wooden base? Or what you use ? Other then that I woke up and my wife with energy and man this is a lot of<br/>Relief ..
 I hate hate hate this mattress.  I’m in bed unable to sleep writing this review.  I desperately wish I was in the 100 day window of this mattress. I’ve never experienced back pain and serious tossing and turning in my life.  I wake up constantly rolling from one side to the other.  It started off okay.  Now I dread going to bed.  I’ll have to eat the $ on this one, sadly.  I never write reviews on products but this is just not worth the $475. At all.  My couch is gonna be my bed until I get something else.  My $199 off-brand memory foam mattress was way better than this.  Just don’t do it.
 This mattress is terrible but Amazon does not let you pick less than 1 star for a review, or trust me, I would.  Don't let the presentation in the box fool you. I wake up every morning miserable.  My back, my neck, my hips, you name it, it aches.  I am so disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  It almost makes me wonder how many are true consumers.  I will definitely be returning this mattress back to where it came from.  I am 1.5 months in with this thing and have been sleeping on the couch the last 2 + weeks until I can get rid of it.  I will definitely not be going with anymore mattress in  box options, ever!  And for those of you wondering, I am a fit 6 ft 195lbs so it has nothing to do with me being too heavy.  Also for those of you wondering, the suggested metal bed frame Amazon suggests, I have the 18" frame and it's just as bad.
 Did a lot of research before getting this mattress. It is truly amazing how toxic the flame retardant is in normal mattresses. This is one of the few that is free of that chemical spill everyone else chooses to sleep on every night.<br/>I’m a big guy and after six months, there isn’t the slightest indentation on either side of the bed. Somehow they have mastered the ability to make it soft enough for a bad hip without making feel like you are sinking down into a canyon. It is firm and supportive yet very soft for old sore bones.<br/>Highly recommend!!!
 After sleeping on the same mattress for 15 years I finally decided to switch. Order, delivery and setup couldn't have been easier. Very subtle manufacturing/packaging odor that cleared up within an hour. Tuft &amp; Needle lives up to the hype. After sleeping the first night I woke up feeling well rested and I didn't have any aches or soreness. I like to sleep on my side so I occasionally would wake up with mild shoulder pain. It's been over a week now and the pain is gone and I continue to wake up each morning feeling refreshed. I was a little bit apprehensive reading about the materials used (as I had a latex foam mattress topper) but the mattress is actually very sturdy and is an excellent replacement for a traditional spring mattress. I have an IKEA bed frame with the wooden slats and the Tuft &amp; Needle fits nicely.
 Best mattress we have ever purchased!  Thank you!!<br/>I had a car accident a few months ago and have not been able to sleep like a normal person since!  I used to wake up with neck and back pain (I still have a tear in my neck &amp; herniations and bulging discs) &amp; very stiff...could sleep 12 hours and feel like I haven’t slept a wink. I bought this mattress about two weeks ago, within the first night it was absolutely life-changing. I am so grateful that you guys made this mattress and also made it very affordable for everyone. Thank you again and I am so excited to share that two weeks in, I still have very deep, very quality sleep and no pain or stiffness in the mornings.  My mother as a matter fact just purchased the mattress today!  It should be there in few days and i am excited to hear her thoughts!!
 Two weeks on it so far and I'm in love. I'm a really big guy and a side sleeper, but have 0 issues with and pressure points or shoulder pain. I'm normally up around 7am because it hurts, but now I need an alarm again or else I'm out until 10:30am.
 I have had this mattress over a month and I really like it. Good support and comfortable. I did not want to deal with mattress salesmen and overpriced store mattresses. So, I reasoned that with the price of this mattress and the great return policy I couldn’t go wrong. I had to deal with the store manager showing up with a measuring stick to see if my last mattress was eligible for return after only 4 months. Then I kept the replacement way too long because it was so expensive. Who needs that in the internet age!
 We bought this mattress based on the many good reviews and after doing a lot of research. Researching mattresses is extremely confusing. The packaging of the mattress left a lot to be desired. (I'm not sure why they call them mattress in box, it's more accurate to call it a mattress wrapped in a bag.) After sleeping on it one night we knew it wasn't going to work for us. This mattress is VERY soft to lay on and non-supportive on the edges. Both my wife and I need a firmer mattress. I guess I'm old fashioned but the next day we bought a traditional firm mattress and we couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>That being said this is an honest upfront company and their arrangement with amazon is great for customers. . We received a quick refund, without any hassle at all. So, I guess if you think this mattress might work for you, you have no risk of trying it. For us it was a bad buying decision.
 My husband and I were looking for a new mattress for our Fifth Wheel. We had a king size RV mattress and hated it.  It was very lumpy and uncomfortable.  We decided we would rather have a queen size mattress and started researching on line reading reviews on different types.  We needed a mattress that wasn't too heavy but would be comfortable.  We came across two possibilities, one of which was T&amp;N.  Both had great reviews but T&amp;N cost less and was lighter weight and we could return it if it didn't work for us.  We placed our order through Amazon and received the mattress within a week.  We have had it now for 30 days and love it!  It is so comfortable with just the right amount of firmness.  On warm nights, we stay nice and cool. Best nights sleep we have had since moving into our RV full time!  The weight is perfect.  We have no trouble lifting the bed to get to the storage underneath.  We give this mattress 5 stars!
 I've slept on this for 7 nights. So far it's great. I had an 13yr old Serta spring mattress. This was a welcome change. My boyfriend and I work almost complete opposite schedules so I would always wake up when he would get up for work. Since the Tuft &amp; Needle bed I haven't felt him move at all. It didn't smell as I expected. The only scent was from the plastic but that was gone over night. I sleep on my side and found, for me, the mattress supports where it needs. My boyfriend sprawls out on his stomach or back and he says he sleeps better now.
 I bought this for my guest bedroom as I knew it would not get regular use, but I wanted a high quality, non toxic mattress for my family.  As it turns out, I have slept on it myself and it is heavenly.  I'm mostly a back sleeper, but also make it to my side and stomach sometime in the night..  This mattress is so comfortable and I woke with no back pain.  I've ordered another one from my grandson's room and am thinking about ordering one for my own bedroom.  Seems great quality for an excellent price!
 I have owned all types of beds, including the Temperdedic, and I must say that T&amp;N beats every bed by a long shot for the following reasons: Amazingly comfortable for everyone in my family; Very little chemical odor, which dissipated within a day; Helped relieve joint and back issues I have had for years; Comfortable, supportive, and good for adult activities.  I bought another within a week and plan to replace every bed in the house with a T&amp;N.
 I absolutely love this mattress! It is so comfortable! I need a firm bed that’s still soft enough to keep me comfortable through the night. I have always been a stomach sleeper until I got this bed. Now I sleep on my back or side without discomfort. This bed feels like it hugs your spine, if that’s a thing. My entire body feels supported and I can relax and sleep.
 I researched and asked for referrals for a good mattress, this was the one that was recommend time and again.  Loved having it delivered right to my front door. I was able to carry it upstairs and unbox it by myself.  I will add more after my daughter has slept on it for a few weeks.
 I bought this full mattress for my daughter who has had back surgery and was not comfortable with a typical spring mattress. This is perfect for her - supportive without being too firm. The ordering, delivery and set-up were amazingly easy too. There was not other mattress that was "green" even close to this price so this was a fantastic bargain.
 I thought it was heaven to sleep on but i guess I'm part of the 1% that thought the smell was to much. It gave me headaches. My husband however thought the bed was way to soft. He kept waking up with back and neck pain. I would say give it a try,chances are you will love it, if not they have a great return policy.
 We have been very happy with this mattress so far.  We purchased it for our 3 year old son.  We took it out of the box and let us breath for one night, but it didn't seem to need it.  It didn't have any weird smells and it inflated quickly.  I find it comfortable (cushiony yet firm enough).  I was hoping hubby would like it too so that we could order a larger one for our room.  However, my husband says it's too soft for him and that he doesn't like that the sides will push down if he is close to the edge (hence the 4 stars).  This isn't an issue for my son because he doesn't weigh enough, but it's something to consider if buying for yourself.  We will likely buy a queen for the guest room in the future though.  The price is really great for what you get!
 It seemed kinda strange having a mattress delivered while rolled up compactly in a box.  But boy does it deliver!  I'm glad I got the medium firmness.  It feels fully firm without being hard.  One suggestion for whoever decides to purchase this.  If your room can be warm at night, it would be beneficial to add a good mattress pad.  It allows more air circulation for a cooler mattress experience.  An inexpensive addition that really contributes to the overall satisfaction.  But this mattress is one of the best sleeper I've ever had.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. The quality of this mattress for the price is incredible, ESPECIALLY with free 2day shipping!! (Note: we did have to help the delivery man carry the box into the apartment). It arrives rolled up and vacuum sealed inside a box, it was fun to cut it open and watch it explode into a beautiful mattress. We've had it for almost a year now and it is like it is brand new. I had minor back pain with my (very, very) old hand-me-down mattress, I still have some aches (from my couch), but switching to this mattress has helped significantly. Definitely recommend this to everyone!
 T&amp;N is doing an amazing job in revolutionizing the mattress business. For me personally, I heavily dislike going into stores where there are salesman throwing ridiculous prices in your face. I ordered this bed and it came 2 days after. Unboxing it was such a neat experience. So far sleep has been wonderful. It's even easy to take naps. It's very soft but also firm, just a great balance and great temperature control. The fact that this mattress was so low priced for the amount of quality it offered was great. I might be exaggerating a bit... but I am 100% satisfied with this product and the company.
 This mattress is a little firmer than I was hoping. I've had it for two weeks and it constantly gives me back aches. There's no way for me to contact the seller about the product, which is kind of frustrating. I'm going to buy a mattress topper and hope that resolves the issue, otherwise I'll be returning it.
 The mattress appears to be of very good quality. We've had it for about 1 1/2 months, but unfortunately it is too firm for us. My wife and I are both under 150 lbs and it felt like we were sleeping "on" the mattress instead of "in" the mattress. In other words, it doesn't have the soft / plush feel that we prefer. As a result, this mattress would probably be a better fit for a heavier person. With that said, the folks at Tuft &amp; Needle were very helpful in guiding us on how to return the mattress even though we bought it through Amazon. I would give the company 5 stars!
 I'm a side sleep who's owned the same spring mattress for at least ten years. I was a little hesitant getting a foam mattress but after doing some research I decided to try it. The first two days of sleep I felt the bed was to firm and contemplated returning it, but, on day three something magical happened. The bed no longer felt too firm and was now just right. I love this bed and I'm very happy I ordered it.
 Bought this to replace my daughter's mattress - she loves it. Her old mattress was, well... old. It was not comfortable and did not offer good support. She loves that this mattress is soft yet supportive - she sinks in a bit on the top layer and then there is support. My wife and I both like this mattress, too (though we purchased a competitor's product a year ago because we didn't know about Tuft &amp; Needle - bummer!).
 The bed came well packaged, but I can't say I am a fan of the smell it had when I first slept on it. I personally find this mattress way too stiff and it's somewhat disappointing there aren't any options for mattresses like this because I think a softer mattress would have caused me significantly less back pain than this mattress did. I like many other reviewers experienced almost crippling back pain after a few nights of sleeping on this mattress and I continued to try to just see if I would adjust, but never did leading me to only recently replace it.
 It takes a bit of time to get used to it.  When you climb in bed there's no frame or springs so you don't have that solid feel when you get in bed.  It's almost like climbing onto a big pillow.  I say climbing because with the 10' mattress on top of a high frame, it really is high up.<br/><br/>There is a fresh paint kind of smell when you first open it up.  It mostly dissipates after a few days but you may want to buy it when you can leave a window open.<br/><br/>You need to give it at least a couple of weeks to break in.  Initially, I got pressure points on my legs if I was on my side.  When getting in bed you sink in a little so it seems soft but once you settle in, the mattress sleeps a little firm.<br/><br/>Even though I did not find it completely comfortable at first, particularly on my side, I did sleep better right away. My guess is that once the mattress finally breaks in, it will still be a bit on the firm side.  If you are looking for a pillow top, this isn't for you.  It will probably be best for back sleepers and side sleepers.  It didn't work for me when I tested it on my stomach.<br/><br/>The bottom line for me is I'm sleeping better than before, though I wish it were a bit less firm.  Perhaps in the coming weeks it will soften a bit.
 absolutely love my new mattress.  I ordered a King for my home and a queen for a rental property. Both came well packaged. Very easy to cut wrapping and place on platform bed. There was no noted smell with either mattress.  Inflated to 10" within about 10 minutes, took about 48 hours for full inflation with both mattresses. It sleeps perfectly at this time, my husband and I have not been warm from the mattress. I searched for mattresses for about 6 months. Read hundreds of reviews and finally settled on this company and I am very happy I did. It has been about 4 weeks and I have gotten many great nights of sleep.
 So when we first bought it it seemed good. Although one side was softer then the other which I thought was weird. But my wife slept on the firm side and I slept on the softer side. Problem is the softer side of the mattress has become so soft in one spot that it kinks my back if I sleep on it.  I have to get rid of it. These mattress's seem amazing at first (thus the great initial reviews) but from my experience and from reading through the reviews they don't last very long.
 Been sleeping on this mattress now for over 90days. By far the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned. I am 6'6" and my girlfriend is 5'6" we both fit very comfortably. Tons of room for us both to get comfortable.
 So I received a defective mattress and contacted Tuft and Needle directly they had me jump through a few hoops but ultimately sent me a replacement mattress. The replacement mattress was better than the defective one however not as good as my first Tuft and Needle mattress; that I love apparently they have changed the original mattress to make it softer. Personally it just seems to not be as good a quality and I do prefer a firmer mattress. Guess it will be a guest bedroom mattress and I am on the hunt for another quality mattress company like Tuft and Needle was.
 I cannot say enough good things about this mattress!<br/><br/>Our old mattress was very expensive. But it was getting up there in age and was starting to cause hip and back pain no matter how many times we rotated it.<br/><br/>Saw the add for Tuft &amp; Needle, and the price was great, reviews were great and we decided to take the plunge and we are so glad we did!<br/><br/>Set up was super easy, and I have had zero back or hip pain ever since we set it up!  My hubby and I are not small people and that makes no difference to this mattress! If one of us gets up during the night, it does not disturb the other in the slightest!<br/><br/>I really love this mattress so far!
 Love this bed. It was so simple and quick  to set up. I have had firm mattresses, pillow top mattresses and many in between. I tend to sleep on my side, and in other beds can wake up feeling pain in my hips and back. This mattress is soft enough to adjust to the shape of my body, but not so soft you sink in. I had a hard time picking a mattress because my boyfriend and I have very different opinions on beds, but we both love this one. I was worried it might start to sag after some time, but it has been 6 months and it has not yet. Highly recommend this one!
 Based on the recommendation of Jenna and Guillaume, of Tiny House, Giant Journey (a tiny house advocate blog), my wife and I bought a Queen-sized model Tuft&amp;Needle. It took a fairly long time to get used to it (well over the 30 days that Amazon gives you to return it... we didn't realize that the 100-day return policy only applies if you buy directly from Tuft&amp;Needle), but once we did, we realized we'll never go back to a conventional mattress!<br/><br/>We learned a few things worth sharing. First, don't buy a waterproof cover for it. We did this to prevent sweat, drool, and other water stains from getting to the mattress. We quickly realized that this made sleeping on the mattress MUCH too warm. Removing the cover fixed that problem.<br/><br/>Second, getting out of bed with a T&amp;N is more like *rolling* out of bed than sitting up on the edge and standing up. There is no ridge at the edge of the bed, like there is with a conventional. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you stay in a hotel for a week and end up with bruises on the backs  of your legs because you're used to the new way of getting out of bed.<br/><br/>Third, you'll likely need a taller bed frame, since there is no need for a box spring and the mattress, itself, is (I think) slightly shorter than a traditional mattress.<br/><br/>Fourth, you have to learn how to fall onto your mattress differently! You'll practically give yourself a concussion if you jump onto the bed straight as a board, like you can with one with springs in it. However, once you figure this out, you can fall into bed just as easily... just differently. :-)
 I needed a mattress quickly and didn't want to fuss with in-store mattress shopping.  So I went online to do research and discovered Tuft &amp; Needle because it was a highly-rated mattress.  I originally ordered directly through Tuft &amp; Needle, but I loved it so much I ordered a second matching twin mattress through Amazon later on.<br/>I have had the 1st mattress for about a year and LOVE it.  It's a daybed, so I sit on it while watching TV and sleep on it at night.  It does not sag and is comfortable to sit on, and sleep on (I'm a side sleeper).<br/>When I travel, I don't sleep as well because I don't think the hotel mattresses are as comfortable as T&amp;N.  (Hey T&amp;N, ever thought about partnering with a hotel chain??)  I'm a customer for life, and hopefully T&amp;N will be around in the many many years from now when the mattress needs to be replaced.
 I researched, and shopped, and read reviews and was hoping this would be the mattress for me.  When it arrived I was so excited to go to sleep.  Right away I knew it wasn't for me.  The first couple of morning my lower back pain was so sharp.  I gave the mattress a few more nights but it never got better.  It's simply too soft - if you like soft mattresses then this is for you, but I simply felt I was kind of just sinking into the mattress.  Luckily I was able to return within the 30 day period.
 My boyfriend and I recently purchased the queen bed for his house. He was sleeping on a very old spring mattress that had indented in the middle and was giving him back problems, and at my house I have an inexpensive memory foam mattress I purchased on Amazon. He prefers a firmer mattress, whereas I prefer a softer one. My issue with this mattress isn't that it's too firm--the level of firmness is fine for me--it's that it feels rubbery to me; you can't really sink in or get comfortable with it. I had a pillowtop queen mattress growing up that I loved. This mattress just feels like I'm laying on a big thick layer of rubber.<br/><br/>My boyfriend is definitely sleeping better on this mattress than he was on his other one, and I get a good night's sleep on it as well. He thinks the comfort level is "ok for the price." Had we started his process again, we would most likely buy a different mattress.
 Great mattress. I was a little nervous that all the hype would be just that... hype. But I have to say, it is a great mattress that suits both my husband and I.... he likes a firmer mattress and I like it a bit softer than him. Somehow it works for both of us! I definitely recommend it. Especially after seeing that a similar mattress at the mattress store was $3,000.
 Worth the money. Bed has perfect support. We use it as main bed in an Airbnb and loved it. Bought 2nd to replace my old standard mattress at primary home. (Better than Aldi box bed that is like a rock at first.) I recommend after 2 years and 2nd one after 2 months. Marshall 58 years old active yet a little over weight!
 Ordered two Twin XLs to replace a brand new, cheapo King size mattress that wouldn't stop off gassing. Thankfully these mattresses have no smell at all, something I've become very sensitive to after choking on formaldehyde fumes all night for the past few weeks. As an extra bonus, they are also incredibly comfortable. I wish I'd made the switch from innerspring to foam years ago.
 We were in desperate need of a new mattress, but I was having a serious case of analysis paralysis going through endless reviews of all the options that now exist. I finally said ‘what the hell’ and went for it when the T&amp;N mattress was a Prime Day deal at $570 for a king size. I am honestly shocked at how luxurious this mattress feels, and the fact that the price was so low makes it even more amazing. I had also been considering the Leesa but was told it’s softer than T&amp;N. If that’s the case, I’m definitely glad I went with this product as I wouldn’t want a softer mattress. I highly recommend it!
 This was a wonderful addition to our household.  Husband loves the cushy firmness of mattress.  Had zero break-in needed.  Based on some of the other reviews we added a  the<br/>Pinzon Hypoallergenic Overfilled Microplush. cover right away.<br/>Overall, Tuft &amp; Needle have lived up to there reputation of delivering on-time, a great and comfotable product with zero gas off.  Love it.  Looking forward to buying another.
 I love this mattress. My wife did a lot of research on mattress because I have on and off again back problems. This mattress was rated high on the list for people with bad backs, and with the money back guarantee we decided to give it a shot. Over two years later, we are still very satisfied with our purchase. I have personally recommend this mattress to friends and family over the years, and will continue to do so.
 I've had this mattress since April, 2015, so now is a good time to write a review for those wondering if it's still good after a couple of years. I've been really happy with it. I originally bought it because I was having lower back problems and the doctor recommended trying a different mattress - among other things. I followed the doctor's recommendations and have not had any problems since then. I think this mattress was a part of that solution. My only complaint is that I wish I could flip it over. I sit on the bed some time when I work on my laptop and it's noticeably less firm there. It's solid 4 stars.
 Needed a new mattress so after a long period of procrastination decided to try this bed. The price was probably the number 1 decider. The bed is soft around the edges but firm in the middle. I used my box spring and just put the mattress on top. I wanted a softer bed. After 2 weeks, the bed got a little softer, not much but a little. The bed does not envelope you. You lie on top. I had a 3" foam topper that I used from my old bed and put it on top of the new mattress. The bed is fine with this method. I will keep the mattress but in all honesty, I would probably try another bed next time. The mattress is not bad just a little too firm for me. Oh and it doesn't stink.
 This was my first foam mattress. I heard tons of ads for the Casper ones on some of the podcasts I listen to but ended up going with Tuft &amp; Needle because they're cheaper and still well reviewed. So far I have no complaints. It's comfortable, my cat likes it, and I don't overheat on it. It's also made in the USA and comes with stickers to make it easier to become a fanboy/fangirl if you so choose.
 Wow. What a great company.<br/><br/>We received the mattress quickly and efficiently. It unpacked easily, didn't smell, and we started using it right away.<br/><br/>The mattress itself was obviously constructed with high quality workmanship and materials. Unfortunately, the stiffness wasn't great for either my girlfriend or myself. It's not super stiff, but it turns out we prefer something closer to memory foam.<br/><br/>Even though we ordered from Amazon, the support team accommodated our request to return the mattress and handled the details of that (whew, I was dreading figuring out how to get rid of a mattress). Their response times and flexibility were phenomenal. I now understand why they're so well-regarded: this is one of the rare companies that actually stands behind its products.
 This is the BEST BED EVER!!! Great price, and it is soooo comfortable! We have had ours for almost a year and we love it! My husband is over 300lbs and he tossed and turned all night on our regular mattress, keeping me awake. Not only does this mattress not transfer much motion, he doesn't toss all night.<br/>I also have not woken up with a back ache since we got this mattress.<br/>A friend recommended the tuft and needle mattress to me. I was afraid it might be too firm, but it was not. Its comparable to a tempur-pedic mattress in my opinion, but without the hefty price tag. I would, and do recommend this mattress over and over!!!
 LOVE! Huge upgrade from our old spring bed! I was origanally worried that the bed wouldn’t be firm because it was from a box, but not even an hour after we unpacked it I was sleeping soundly on it. It feels very high quality and strong! I love that it is quiet/still if your partner moves during the night. Very soft and very conformable. We bought it with the intention of returning if it didn’t meet 100% of our expectations, but I can confidently say we will be keeping this bed for a long time.
 WHOA...this bed is super comfy. I replaced my old coil spring mattress with a king size Tuft &amp; Needle and it's the best decision i've ever made and the best use of $750. I haven't woken up feeling this refreshed in years, plus...chronic back and hip pain is a thing of the past. do yourself a favor and buy this right now.
 First off, the company seems to be well run. We received the mattress quickly to the front door with no trouble. This saved us the process of having to go to a store and borrow someone's truck to get the mattress home. I love everything the company stands for and believe they are filling a great need in the mattress industry, BUT here are a view things I wish I knew before I purchased the mattress:<br/>1) The mattress sleeps very different than a traditional mattress. Foam (at least this foam) is much more firm. I'm a side sleeper and tend to curl in a ball a bit. Sleeping this way on this mattress didn't work. I was forced to try and sleep on my back. In the long run this is probably better for my spine, but lead to some less than easy nights.<br/>2) I bought through amazon which comes with a 30 day free returns guarantee. Buying through the company directly comes with a 100 day. I bought through Amazon because it gave me 5% cash back through my discover card. This was a mistake on my part. Should have spent the extra 30 bucks and got 60 more days. I am 3 weeks in and will likely return it this week. With another few weeks I may have grown to like it but at this point I'm not taking the risk.<br/>3) This mattress probably needs a different pillow than the one I am using. Because it is firm it makes my fairly soft pillow sink down too far. This hurts my neck some nights. I more sturdy pillow my solve this, but don't have one to try. Also I keep thinking a topper of some sort might add just enough softness to make this mattress perfect.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad we tried the mattress, but will likely be returning it next week (week #4).<br/><br/>** Updating my rating from 3 to 5. The Tuft and Needle customer service team reached out and went above and beyond. I am now super pleased with my purchase.
 Amazing mistress! No odor! Quiet and firm! We added a one inch foam topper because we like it that way.  High quality product and arrives in box from UPS.  Open and let expand and ya have an amazing bed.  We did add the four inch box spring.
 There's not much I can say about this mattress that already hasn't been covered in other reviews.  However it's been almost a year since we purchased ours and wanted let everyone know it still looks and feels like it's brand new.  Everything from the foam to the stitching is holding up remarkably well.<br/><br/>I must say though that as much as I love this mattress, my favorite part is how Tuft &amp; Needle has disrupted the traditional sales process.  Not having to endure a cheesy sales pitch for an overpriced, store-bought mattress makes the transaction twice as sweet.
 So, it's only been a few nights, but I am highly satisfied. I've struggled with lower back pain for years. Now that I'm pregnant it's more frequent and shows up without warning, but always takes at least 7 days to start subsiding and then another week for my back to loosen up to the point that my full range of motion is restored. This mattress arrived after I was two days into my back pain. After the first night, the pain had subsided substantially. After 2 more night, my full range of motion is completely restored. I can't say for a fact that it's all because of this mattress, but I'm getting the best sleep I've had in years and I'm waking up feeling restored instead of slightly achy and exhausted. Even the cat seems to enjoy our new mattress!
 Got to admit, I was skeptical.  I am so glad we did not go to the mattress store and expose ourselves to the ancient marketing schemes of that industry.  Owned this for about two months now, dropped it on the box springs from our old mattress and we have no regrets.  We did not notice a lot of off-gassing like many people seem to be concerned about.  Took less than a day for the mattress to expand.  The box was badly damaged when shipment arrived, but the mattress was ok.  Not too heavy, two of us hauled it upstairs no problem.  Congrats to the team that created this mattress...big win.
 So I've slept on this mattress for a few weeks now, and it's so comfortable that it's like I've always had it. I used to wake up with some pain, which I didn't even realize was from the mattress being too squishy. The packaging is beautiful, and it's easy to get upstairs if that's your situation. It did not have any funky smell like some mattresses do. Super happy with the mattress!
 My family has 2 tempurpedics and bought this for our guest bedroom. This mattress is much softer than the tempurpedics, while I still prefer the tempurpedics, I think this is a really good mattress for the money if it holds up over time.  I appreciate the lack of fire retardant chemicals and there was only a faint odor in mattress after unboxing.  Both of my tempurpedics had significant off gassing when new - So much that left the windows open and didn't use the room for a couple weeks.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried that most reviews were not from verified purchasers.  But ultimately bought one after seeing the consumer reports review.  Ultimately, I'm quite happy with the mattress.
 Just received yesterday and had a really great night's sleep for the first time in YEARS!!!  No shoulder, hip or knee pain!  No pressure points at all.  It has only been one night, but, I am hoping each night will be better and better.  It is very light, so, I should have purchased a base for it to sit down in, I'm sure I will have to do that in time.  Right now it's just on a metal frame, I kinda feel like I'm camping.  Hope to fall in love with this mattress.
 I have been watching this company and all the other mattress companies that have been popping up online over the last 2 years now and I finally decided on T&amp;N because of the amazing reviews, the number of reviews and finally the price of this mattress compared to the other “internet memory foam mattress” brands. After 60 nights I’m pretty convinced that I won’t be needing that 100 night guarantee. I sleep well. The first 10’days maybe were odd and sometimes uncomfortable while getting used to a new mattress but now, Its great. Sleeps cool.  A little on the softer side more than I thought it would be but it works!  I would for sure recommend this mattress.
 I had a little reservation about buying a mattress online, untested, but I will never buy a bed again any other way than this. I love this bed, and I loved the super simple process of buying it even more. I am a side and occasional back sleeper, and either is very comfortable. I was able to unbox it by myself that evening and sleep on it that night. No weird smell, no pain, no adjustment period, no truck required, no confusing and unnecessary options to make the decision-making process more stressful, and no nerve-racking drive home from the mattress store wondering whether it's going to blow off onto the road. Just a good night's sleep at a good price.
 Wonderful buy. Love love love how this is truthfully marketed and comes through solidly! Has been used by one family member or another since we bought it for Christmas visitors. Absolutely no complaints. We had purchased a different mattress for our master bedroom that unfortunately retains too much warmth and I wake up sweating. This mattress does not retain too much warmth. I wake up refreshed every time. My cats love it as well. Always sleeping on the bed! I wish we had bought this for our master bedroom as well.
 I'm not sure what people are talking about being too firm. I sink into this so much, it's hard to turn over. It's only me, so i find i sleep in the middle cause sleeping on the ends i feel i'm going to fall out, it's so soft. Not sure if i'll keep it or not. I't been a little less then a month, i moved here, on Nov 15th. The bed was set up a  few days earlier before i got here, but actually sleeping in it, not to long. I'm a side sleeper, it also feels like my head sinks in lower then the rest of me even will 2 pillows. Is it really suppose to be this soft? I wonder what it will be like in summer.
 Have to give this mattress a 5 star. I have never slept better. My old mattress was pillow top, very expensive, had it for 4 years and every morning I woke up in chronic pain.  Decided to try the tuft and needle mattress based on the reviews and it's the best mattress I have ever had.  I wake up with zero pain, and I sleep the entire night without waking up. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
 We have had this mattress for a few weeks and wake up each morning without pain and refreshed. Setup was easy and the mattress inflated to full size in a few hours. There was a slight smell, but it didn't linger. We bought both a waterproof cover and pad as part of our purchase and so far we love the firmness and support that all of it gives us. Overall, we love what we bought and how much we spent. We feel that this bed is better than the $4000 Tempurpedic mattress that we were considering.<br/>The only negative comment that we have was that we received the wrong size mattress the first time and had to ask for a replacement. Customer service was great and we had the replacement within a couple of days. They also sent a company to pick the wrong sized mattress. Thanks for all your help. We are now considering buying a second mattress for our guest bedroom.
 I just spend my first night on this mattress, and I will not hesitate in saying it was worth every bit of the $600 I paid.  Last night was probably the best night sleep I have had in....FOREVER!  Restorative sleep is the key to a good night's rest and I now have the missing ingredient, a Tuck &amp; Needle mattress.  I purchased the Zinus platform frame and had no problems in setting up the mattress and frame as a 60+ year old female.
 We have been sleeping on this king mattress for over a month and our aging backs are much more limber when we wake up in the morning after a good sleep on a perfect mattress.  I had been looking at a far more expensive mattress - one which advertises heavily - and by comparing found that we could get the same benefit from the Tuft &amp; Needle brand.  Well packaged and we did give it 72 hours to fully expand before using it.  I heartily endorse this product.
 I've had this mattress a little over a year and absolutely love it. Note: I have compressed discs in my lower back and arthritis in my hips. I've been through several mattresses trying to find the right fit and I couldn't be happier with this particular mattress. If I could rate this higher, I totally would.<br/><br/>When it's delivered it is a bit difficult to haul to where you want it set up so keep that in mind if you're a single person. Otherwise: Take it out of the box, follow the directions and let it do its thing! I did not notice any weird smells/odors from taking it out of the box and sleeping on it the first night.
 Very nice! Great to have a Queen Size firm mattress again. Inflated it &amp; watch it take form. Smelled the glue right away. Turned on ceiling fan above bed &amp; turned on exhast fan in adjacent bathroom. 12 hours later &amp; fumes gone. Been using it ever since. No more lower back aches! No over heating! A pleasure to use! Highly recommend! Mostly sleep on my side &amp; no issues there.
 The Tuft and Needle mattress is a great idea. It arrived in a few days, set up in minutes, and off gassed for only the first couple of weeks. For the price it’s a great deal. I used it for the first two months but it is a little too soft for me. I need more back support. I contacted Amazon and they walked me through the return process which was quite straightforward. Kudos to Amazon on making this very easy. A high quality product that just didn’t work for me but they stand by their guarantee.
 Wasn't sure what to expect, having had the same King mattress for a _long_ time.  This was a Christmas Present for us, so we've had them now for 5 months.  Wife and I love our new King mattress (2x Twin XL).  We use the same sheets we had on our King, and it works great. We are in our Mid 40's and our backs don't hurt as much, and overall sleeping comfort has been improved dramatically.  I think mattress has gotten a little softer after 2-3 months.  I love to send stuff back that I don't like, but this was a keeper - after the first week!
 When it first arrived it was very good. Firm but comfortable, seeing it come out of the box and air out was fun.  Lately it is as if it has developed a dip in it and has been causing hip pain. When I'm on the edge of the bed it relieves the hip pain but who wants to sleep on the edge of a queen bed.
 The mattress that we purchased is 3 years old-- now it is way past warranty and is failing simply in that it sags in the spots where we lay down most often.  We have rotated the mattress every so often but over just a couple of years (problems started a year ago), this mattress is longer the comfortable memory foam mattress we enjoyed for the first year.  The spots where its sags are where the lower back rests and sleeping in these position results in back pain.
 This is our first foam mattress and we will never go back to springs.  I bought our king mattress two months ago as I wanted to really try it out before submitting a review.  Well, we love it.  I'm a big guy (6'3" and 260lbs) and I have had not problems with this mattress keeping its form.  We have a nice mattress pad (Pinzon Basics from Amazon) on it and it feels like sleeping on a cloud - very comfortable and supportive.  My sleep has improved and I don't snore as much (says the wife).
 The mattress was received much sooner than I anticipated. I ordered Thursday and received it Saturday. It was super easy to install. Just needed a second set of hands to help me roll it out and remove the plastic wrap. As soon as I removed the shrink wrap it started to inflate. Our first night has been pure heaven for this stomach sleeper. Also, my hubby who has terrible back issues woke up without a complaint. The bed was actually very cool and I love that about it. I hope I can say the same when the warmer weather approaches.
 It has been more than 2 months and I am still very pleased with my purchase. It is a firm matttress but very comfortable - I weigh 200 lbs and sleep mostly on my side and stomach. Turning on the mattress is as easy as a regular mattress, I did not feel like I had to crawl out of a hole. Against advice from the company I DID put a thin mattress protector on it. It increased the warmth as they warned me, but not enough for me to take it off. I am single and was able to drag the mattress bag into my bedroom by myself and roll it out. It fit nicely on a slatted frame (Zinus Quick Snap TM 18 Inch Platform Bed Frame). I gave it one night to air out and expand. It seemed like it got firmer as it expanded.  I didn't smell any strong "off gassing". If you like a firm mattress - I would recommend this brand.
 This mattress appears well-built and strong.  I was hesitant to return it but even after purchasing a mattress topper and a foam topper the mattress was still too firm for my back which translated to a waking up with a backache every  morning. However, if you are the type of person who prefers a firm mattress I wholeheartedly recommend it.  I am hoping the return process will be as easy and simple as promised.
 I want so much to love this mattress due to ease of purchase, the story behind the mattress, the overall feel but like so many others have said, it is just too firm. My husband has back problems and typically likes to sleep on a firmer mattress (more than once I've found him on the floor due to a mattress being too soft). But after a week neither of us has had a night of restful sleep. We will attempt to tough it out for the full 14 day "break-in" period, but I think our next step will be to invest in a mattress pad and hope for the best.
 Bought this for my Son, as other son bought one years ago.  Since he raved about it we did not even go shopping for a mattress - just bought this and he loves it also.  Highly recommend this mattress.
 Back pain gone!  My wife and I suffered from back pain from our old mattress.  The warranty took the scare out of gambling on a ship to home type mattress.  After reading the warranty and reviews we bought one.  First impression was that it was to stiff and not near as thick as our previous one. (we didn't purchase the pillow top add on).  A week later we were both in love with it!  Take no hesitation if considering one of these.
 It's been about a week now and I love it.  Not quite as good as the tempurpedic, but I'm not paying $4,500 for the tempurpedic.  At $700, this bed is a no-brainer.<br/><br/>In my mind, spring beds are totally dead.  I'll never go back to a spring bed again. There are a few other reasonably price foam beds out there.  I did my research and went with Tuft &amp; Needle.  I think their philosophy of going straight mail order with minnimal showrooms is a great way to go.  This is a $1,500 bed for $700.  I'm very happy with the decision.
 The best mattress I have ever bought. I am a side sleeper and I was waking up in the morning with shoulder pain,I thought that I needed to go to the doctor. After the 2nd night of sleeping on this mattress I would wake up in the morning without the pain. After more than 2 weeks the pain is gone and I have a more relaxing sleep. I did a lot of research on the new type of Mattresses and this one kept coming up as one of the Best.
 Ive been using this mattress for about 8 month now.  I had read reviews on many other mattresses before i decided to buy this one n i wanted to try this one.  I like the firmness Which gives me just right support n comfort.  Very satisfied w this mattress after spending thousand dollars on other spring mattress which last less than 6months<br/><br/>Edit) it was the best mattress i’d ever had until after 2yrs and half i bought this.  It started sagging in the middle and became too soft. It’s very uncomfortable and i am having neck and upper back pain. Just started looking to buy another mattress. I hoped and thought if this one lasted 5yrs and i would be very happy but no it didn’t last even 3yrs
 So far this has been my favorite mattress to date. Firm but not too firm and soft but not too soft. Great bang for your buck. With other foam mattresses, bedroom activities can suffer. I haven't had any of the sore wrists problems I had with my previous memory foam mattress and it has a minor amount of bounce to it. It's like the best of both worlds between foam and spring mattresses.
 The bed is great as advertised from the price to the comfort.  Bed stays cool, firm 7 outta 10 which is what my kids prefer and is comfortable for them.  I built a triple bunk bed for my boys around this mattress specs and I will always buy and recommend this awesome mattress. I've purchased one and will be buying two more to complete my project.  I'll never go back to buying beds from a furniture or bed store due to my experience with a tuft and needle bed.  This review was written on my questioning and observation of my kids take on the bed after little over two months of sleeping on the bed.
 Good product, but a bit harder (firmer) than I thought a Medium firmness should be.  We will keep it as it make a good base for our Gel-Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,  The pair make a great bed.
 Had it for a while now, so far so good.  I have rhumatoid arthritis and have trouble sleeping because I wake up hurting, this mattress sleeps better than any I've tried so far. Well worth the money.
 It was between this and a Purple and we went for this bed which at the time was lower in price and I LOVE it.  I am 6”, 238 lbs, and a side sleeper.  So far it was everything I had read, soft on top layer but firm enough for my weight.  I highly recommend this bed.  No chemical smell that we noticed.
 I am happy with this mattress and find it to be very comfortable.  Was able to wrestle the box into the house and bedroom by myself and unpack the mattress and get it onto the frame before taking off the plastic bag and letting it expand.  Happy with this purchase.
 I really which I had read the fine print on this one.  When bought off amazon there is only a 30 day money back guarantee , on their website it's 100 days.  That's a big difference. The mattress does feel supportive, but its just way to firm.  My hips start hurting after laying on my side in just a few minutes.  If you like a firm mattress it might be for you, but it hurts me.  Since I can't return it I will by a memory foam topper and hope I can fit sheets that fit over the both.  If it helps at all I am tall and thin.
 Excellent balance between comfort and support.  I am not sorry I bought this mattress.  At first I was skeptical due to the lighter weight than my previous memory foam mattress, but the weight proved to be a non factor in the comfort provided.  I noticed no unusual odors and my mattress was ready to sleep on in minutes.<br/><br/>The only suggestion I have is the bottom could be "grippier".  The mattress tends to slide around too easily on my steel frame/foundation.
 Update* I bought a second queen for my other kid! So excited she’s now as happy as my son!<br/> I get it now. The hype is valid.  I bought this queen Tuft and Needle mattess for my 16 year old son and he loves it. My daughter now wants one and two friends who've come to lay on it after hearing about the brand, also want one. Excellent price, no complaints. Packing was heavy duty and all cardboard so we were able to burn it in a bonfire.
 We love our Tuft &amp; Needle mattress! We bought it when we moved to Hawaii because our traditional memory foam mattress just slept too dang hot for the temps here.<br/><br/>This mattress not only sleeps cooler than our previous one; it's also super comfortable! I frequently woke up with back pain on our prior mattress, and rarely have that problem with this one.<br/><br/>The only thing I'd caution people on is the size - I'm a person who likes to feel my sheets before I buy them, and it's almost impossible to find regular king sized sheets here in person... it's all California King in the stores here. Maybe that's just Hawaii, but in retrospect I would have gone with the California King since it's the same price. Just a weird little tidbit I've noticed.<br/><br/>Other than that, which isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme of things... get this mattress!
 So I don't leave reviews much (actually this might be my first one after about a trillion purchases).  This mattress though... of which I have two.. makes a king is just so wonderful I had a throw in my two cents.  It is very very rare for a company to meet ones expectations nowadays, and to exceed them?!?  Impossible.  However, Tuft and Needle did just that.  I called them with a couple questions.  The folks there were attentive, helpful, and SUPER NICE!  I was blown away.  Still am.  I now am the happy owner of the most comfortable bed upon which I have ever slept.  EVER!  The product, perfect... the customer service.... out of this world.  What to do? See for yourself - you will love it too!
 It was time for a new mattress and decided to give a foam mattress a try since our travel trailer came with one and we like it more than our $3500 traditional mattress we have had for 6 years. We had heard all the rumors about tuft &amp; needle and decided to give it a try. I loved it from day one but was just a little to stiff for my sig other, we called T&amp;N and they got us a deal on their topper, we both absolutely love it now. Best sleep ever and amazing customer service.
 So far, so good. 4 stars for now so I can either knock it up or knock it down. Husband loves the hardness, it's a tad much for me. But, both of us have shoulder and hip issues, and while I feel it's a super hard mattress, it's done it's job so far as to helping with our usual pain! Will update.<br/><br/>Update on 12/28... I'm dying. The husband has major shoulder pain, and I swear, my back stays locked up. The first week or two, maybe, it felt ok. Like maybe the initial pains were that of adjustment. Now, I'm not saying it's not good. It's just not good for US. I'm about to ask about the refund policy. Hoping for the best, otherwise we will have to buy a new mattress and still be stuck with having paid for this one.
 We bought this bed for a guest twin.  It has a firm supportive feel.  It arrived in good condition and it was well packaged.  I am 73 year old female and I managed to get it located to our lower level once taken out of the boxed materials.  It inflated right away and there was minimal off-gassing.  I used an air purifier for a couple of days only bc we are using it in our lower level.  It has no odor now.  For our needs, this mattress is working out well.
 Super comfy, haven't had any back pain. Just wish it had expanded to the full 10in.i mostly only notice it because of the gap at our headboard 😣 it got to about 8.5in. Other than that it's pretty good.
 While I was initially wary of buying a "bed in a box," I'd done enough in-store shopping and testing out of all different types of mattresses that I felt confident enough to give it a try.  When Amazon had it as a deal of the day I went for it.  O M G DO I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!!!!!  Everything positive said about it is true.  A dream of delivery, set-up and from the first night I have slept better.  While I still may wake during the night, I find I fall back asleep faster and sleep deeper.  This is a great mattress.  Would absolutely do it again without question.  GREAT MATTRESS!
 We’ve had this mattress for a little over one month. We bought this for our 5 year old when the old hand me down twin mattress had to be replaced. We built a short term platform base for it from plywood and a full size bed frame. Our daughter loves this mattress and I have to say it’s very comfortable when I find myself laying on her bed. We feel we paid a great price having bought on prime day on sale (for roughly the price of the twin size at the time of this review). We are pleased with our purchase to this point and I am trying to convince family to purchase one for their old mattress replacement.
 I waited to write a review until I had several months’ worth of sleep time. I love the mattress! There’s still a bit of the quicksand feeling when I try to roll over, but we have another bed with a well-known foam mattress and my T &amp; N out performs that one easily. If I had to list changes I’d like to see there are two: the silky fabric that covers the mattress makes it slippery on the foundation, so I have to nudge it back into place daily. Secondly, the edges of the mattress are soft and have no supplementary support and since I sit on them to put on shoes, I wonder if they’ll break down sooner or later. These are minor details, though, and I completely recommend this mattress. *Additional plus: it went together so easily my husband didn’t swear once!
 Setup was a piece of cake although I was sure they'd sent a twin when I laid the new mattress on the box springs. It really does expand. A lot.<br/><br/>I don't really know how to explain the feel of the mattress. When you first lie down on it, it seems like you're going to just sink all the way down into it, until you don't. In my opinion it's a great mix between soft and firm. I was quite impressed with how the mattress seems to stay cool. We live in Tucson and that's an issue.<br/><br/>Anyways, we're probably going to need to replace the mattress in the Master sometime soon and as far as I'm concerned, I'd buy another Tuft and Needle in a heartbeat.
 LOVE IT!  Love love love this mattress!  I am 54, married 32 years.  This is by far the best mattress I have ever slept on.  We have spent more money and, purchased more impressive looking mattresses.  Honestly, it doesn't resemble a big white fluffy cloud.  It doesn't feel impressive to the touch.  If you sit on the edge of the mattress you will not be impressed.  The glory of the tuft &amp; needle mattress is only experienced once you have settled on the bed to rest or, sleep.  Once settled in, the mattress begins to charm its way into every curvature of your body; mind you, this is so gentle and, soothing.  You will feel fully supported and, gently held all at the same time.<br/><br/>Update:  I still LOVE my Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress.  Almost nightly my husband will say, I love my bed. :)
 I love this bed!!  Had it two nights so far and I am in heaven!  It feels like you're sinking into a cloud, yet there is firm support as well.<br/>How did they do it!  I am a Tuft and Needle fan!  I am a side sleeper, and it feels awesome!<br/>I was starting to wonder about all of these reviews, but now I am a believer!<br/><br/>Thanks T&amp;N!
 Great Mattress! My husband and I loved it!
 We purchased our mattress in May 2017 and it is still perfect.  My husband &amp; I agree it is the best mattress we have ever owned.  Several of my friends purchased it and love it too.  I have one friend who said it was too hard to her so she returned hers and she stated that T&amp;N customer service is excellent.  Guess these mattresses are not for everyone but for the majority, they ARE!
 I've slept on it for more than a month now.  GREAT bang for the buck.  I did a lot of research before purchasing.  Consumer Reports rates it a "Best Buy and likes it very nearly as much as beds that cost two, three, and four times as much.  I also got a Tuft &amp; Needle pillow, which i like more than any pillow I have ever had before.  You can't go wrong with Tuft &amp; Needle.
 I've had this mattress from march now, and this is my feedback on how I personally feel about the mattress. I have not had any contact with the company, but heard good things about its customer service and overall about the company. In terms of the mattress, Its not the right fit for me, when I purchased the mattress, I saw all the reviews especially about people who had a hard time fitting a mattress that had back pain, and this was the mattress for that. That it helped out a lot of people, so I thought give it a shot.. I purchased the mattress, it arrived via prime, perfectly no problems with shipment, but from the first night the mattress, didn't feel right, and I figured I'd give it more time to adjust it for my body to adjust to it, and their is no change from this mattress to the previous one, I was using. I still wake up with back pain every morning. This mattress for me is no better or worst then other mattress, I personally gave up on finding the right mattress for me, as its not like trying on a pair of shoes. So I am not blaming the company, or saying this is a bad product, for some this might be perfect. I wouldn't personally know if it is or not, because I haven't had good sleep since.. I can't even remember. So for me this is 3 star review, its not bad its not good, its just okay. So for those who have back pain, this mattress might be for you or it might not be for you, I don't know.
 I'd give it less stars, but I can see why other people like it.<br/>Top few inches should let u sink in further.<br/>If u put all your weight on your hand it sinks right in and feels wonderful. But when u lay down and distribute your weight the bed doesn't feel all that good.<br/>I'm 220 and am sure it is even worse for people that weigh less.
 This is tough to review. We've only been sleeping on this mattress for about 6 weeks. The quality seems good, but it's way too firm for me. I am 5'1" and about 110 lb, and a side sleeper. There's not much "give" when laying on my side, so it basically crushes my shoulder into my body and I've been having shoulder and neck pain ever since. I've changed pillows a couple of times  with some relief but I've learned it's definitely not just the pillow that's the problem.<br/>My husband who is 5'10" and about 190lb, and a back or belly sleeper, loves the mattress. I'm going to put a twin sized topper on my side or there's no way I can continue sleeping on this thing. I'm happy that my husband is happy with it, so I'll make do with my side.
 We've been sleeping on our new mattress for about two weeks now. So far, it's great! Very comfortable and supportive. It had a very strong odor when we first got it out of the box, but after letting the mattress air out about 30 hours, the smell disappeared.<br/><br/>UPDATE: we've been sleeping on this mattress for four months and we both agree that we've never gotten better sleep before!<br/><br/>ANOTHER UPDATE: 7 months in and still going great! The mattress has held up great so far!
 We need a new bed. Allergist always recommended water bed or soft side water bed based on ability to  clean and remove dust mites. We needed a replacement ASAP so I checked on the company. We made a good choice with this mattress. Tuft and Needle is known for hypoallergenic mattresses. There is no odor so if you are sensitive to smells, it is a great choice. It has a removable cover for washing. The mattress provides a comfortable texture, for a great night's sleep.<br/>Update 05/2017. I loved this mattress so much, I purchased one for my parents.
 I am very excited to sleep in this for the first time tonight. :) It was very easy to set up! I laid down on it and it is just the right amount of firmness, def not hard as a rock as a couple people say. A mattress that is too soft will give u a bad back. This one seems just right. Def made the purchase bec of the guarantee and all the great reviews.
 Love this mattress.  It still amazes me that they were able to compress this mattress to a size small enough for shipping.  The mattress immediately starts expanding when the sealed plastic bag is punctured and removed.  The mattress looks great just moments after removing the packaging.  The instructions say to wait two weeks before judging the mattress however the mattress felt very dense and comfortable the first night.  I am very pleased.  Thanks for making a great product!
 I've been using this for a few months now and i really enjoy it i have it lying on top of my old queen box mattress which is probably not needed but to give me the extra high tide desired. I have a lower lumbar back problem and this has allowed me to sleep comfortably peacefully and wake up feeling much better despite having used more expensive traditional mattresses.
 I use to think I didn't like this type of mattress until my friend couldn't say enough about how much they liked theirs. So I decided to give it a try. I love that it shows up easily at my front door and easy to roll out. It took me a couple of weeks for me to adjust to the heat that came from the the mattress for me. Other people have written about this as well. Customer service was helpful, suggesting to try without mattress bad or that I can return if still not happy. I went back to using the mattresss bad, lightened my top covers and my body seemed to adjust. It was worth the wait because it was and is super comofortable. The warranty is awesome, too. I kept my box spring under it. I was getting a back ache from my old mattress. That went away the first night. Seriously.  I would recommend and buy again.
 This is not a tuft and needle mattress.  The return process has started and I will update how that proceeds.  If they had minus stars that is what this purchase would get.<br/>I'm  a prime member and take advantage of the free shipping so I order a lot.  This is the first time I've had a product switch.
 BUY IT, period. The great reviews about this mattress are true. I'm 6'1", 169 lbs male, and a side sleeper. I bought a California King because of my height. I have slept on it for over one month now and this is really the best mattress I've ever had. The sleep quality has been superb. I've done quite a bit research before buying it. With its awesome price and quality, there's really no need to look further...
 I am SO thrilled with this purchase. I had the item in my cart for months, contemplating if I really needed a new bed. After finally having enough tossing and turning, I purchased it. Let me tell you first how easy it was to unpack, unwrap, and fill after the vacuum seal was released. Second, the shape took immediately. Nothing was distorted as only users had previously shared. I haven't noticed any smell whatsoever some mentioned. It's my first night in this bed, and I am simply amazed. The mattress is the perfect combination of firm and soft. It's firm enough to support you, yet soft enough to conform to your body without that sinking feeling. The cooling technology is wonderful! I am already contemplating another purchase for my daughter's room. So pleased with this purchase.
 This bed is more supportive than any bed I'd tried before. However, it is very, very firm to me (average size woman). It made my whole body gurt to sleep on.<br/><br/>I did add a memory foam topper and now it's a decent bed. Also note the price seems to go up around back to school time. I bought it then and between that and the topper, I'd just get a regular matress if I had to do it all again.
 Simply amazing! After years of trying to find the perfect mattress, this is it!! We have tried everything and spent thousands and thousands of dollars with lots of disappointments. We were on vacation and fell in love with the mattress. We pulled of the sheets and read “tuft and needle”. We ordered a mattress that night. We have a king size box spring. We bought two xl twin mattress’. It’s amazing. We use twin fitted sheets and king flat sheets, blankets and quilt. It fits perfectly. We sleep so sound.
 I love this mattress. I went from a very old tempurpedic to this and I like this one better. It's like sleeping on a cloud. I'm in college so I can't spend a ridiculous amount of money on a mattress so this was perfect. I wasn't expecting it to be so amazing but it is.
 Super value for the money. Love the mattress and was super easy to setup. Got my platform from Zinus (also highly recommended) and I’m sleeping better than ever. I had a memory foam mattress for 10 years but wanted to increase to a King...and honestly didn’t think it’d be such an improvement. It really is a perfect balance of support and comfort. It’s on the firmer side, but I definitely prefer that...also T&amp;N said it does soften a little within the first few weeks.
 I LOVE IT. We bought this mattress at least three-four months ago, and it still feels great. My boyfriend and I collectively weigh about 450 pounds (!!) and we have noticed no indentation or shifting in the mattress. It was easy to unroll, expanded within minutes, and even held up in our cross-city move. We love and highly recommend this mattress.
 I am returning this mattress because it is uncomfortable for me. I really wanted to like it, but it is harder than I expected and it causes shoulder, back, and hip pain for me.<br/>Also, the off-gassing is quite severe. It really stinks. I've had it a week and it still smells up the whole room.<br/>The return process is a breeze though, the representatives are very helpful.
 The bed is not memory foam it was hard as a rock. What a hassle having to find someone to pick up the mattress and box it.
 This mattress is not that firm - not as firm as other reviews led me to believe. No edge support for those of you who roll around a bunch. I do sleep better on this one than on my old mattress (took a couple days to get used to it). Only real complaint is that it is significantly warmer than my old standard spring mattress. It's an upgrade for me regardless, so I'll likely keep it.
 Guest tested and approved. Tuft and Needle mattresses are thick, but still soft enough to be in that perfect “not too firm” firm zone. We’ve already had guests use it this new one and they want to get their own now.<br/><br/>As an aside, we had a different order with Tuft and Needle for our own bed and they replaced our mattress when it had a defect theee years after purchasing. Their customer service is incredible.
 We had such high hopes for this item! The mattress was easy to set up and didn’t have any strange chemical smell, which was something I was particularly worried about. We waited two days to sleep on it so it would have plenty of time to expand. After a few nights of sleeping on it, both my husband and I are waking up incredibly sore, particularly in the shoulders and neck. I honestly had to move at a snails pace this morning to get out of bed because fast movements led to searing pain in several spots, including my chest (likely because I sleep on my stomach at some point during the night). I felt like a 200 year old woman. I’d like to say we’ll give it a little time to soften up, but we are honestly too uncomfortable to wait and will likely be sleeping on the guest bed until we find a new alternative. Will be returning unfortunately.
 This is a very high quality mattress. After 2+ years there are no signs of it breaking down in any way. I sleep in the same spot (180lbs), because my wife (90lbs) somehow manages to take up all the space on this CalKing. Despite me sleeping in the same spot -near the edge, there is no sign of sagging. I also tend to get really hot at night but this mattress helps.
 We were in the market for new mattresses for the family.  Previously we had purchased "economy" mattresses that fit our budget at the time but left a lot to be desired in the comfort department.  We had a little more disposable income this time around and wanted to get better quality.  We had a budget of $1000 and were looking to get both a twin and a queen.  After one trip to the local Big Chain Mattress store, my hopes of getting decent quality for that price were quickly dashed.  It looked like my only option was buying another uncomfortable "economy" mattress or financing  $3,000-$4,000 for the top name brands (which is more than I paid for my car!).  We did some research online and found Tuft &amp; Needle.  It sounded too good to be true, but we thought with the positive reviews and lenient return policy, it would be worth a shot.  We ordered the twin first, figuring we'd let the kid be the guinea pig. :) We were so impressed, we ordered the queen just a few days later.  My husband is mostly a stomach sleeper and I am mostly a side sleeper.  We both find this mattress to be the most comfortable one we have ever slept on.  We've had it for about 2 weeks now, so we'll have to see how it holds up long term, but so far it's awesome.  And the best part is that (even with sales tax) both mattresses, delivered right to our door came in at $10 under our budget!
 Good mattress for someone who has back pain. However, my GERD (acid reflux) was getting worse with this Mattress. After I changed my mattress to this one, every morning I woke up with heart burn.  Currently I am using my previous old mattress. After I changed back to my old mattress, heart burn was disappeared. I will return this product.<br/>Please be aware It is not easy to return this product if you buy it in Amazon. You need to pay ~$40 for UPS.
 Shipping and opening was easy and the mattress is really high quality BUT very very firm.  Even after I added a 2" foam mattress for the first 2 months to try to break it in, I was walking around with really bad back issues where it was hard to even turn my head. When I switched back to my old mattress, I immediately felt 100% in about 3 days.  Of course I returned the mattress (though Amazon doesn't actually take the mattress away, they just give you a refund).  So the return was very painless. It okay for a day or two sleep, so I'm leaving it in my guest room.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very disappointed in my first online mattress purchase.  I think it's necessary to spring for a more expensive mattress, but if that's the case, I'll just buy it from a real mattress store!
 I like this mattress quite a bit. We bought it for our 3 year old son, and he sleeps great on it. We read to him in his bed and I always find this mattress to be super comfortable.<br/><br/>What really ticks me off is that this mattress shot up in price during the exact period that I really needed it. I'm pretty pissed that I paid $100 more for this than I should have.
 I made a huge mistake in listening to my friend's recommendation for this mattress. I've had serious back challenges for years and it's much too soft but I cannot afford to replace it and am unable to return it.
 Terrible mattress.  100 nights is not enough to test this out.  You should never buy a mattress without laying on it first, even when they offer you 100 nights to try.  This mattress is too soft, and doesn't hold up long term.  The mattress has lost its firmness (which wasn't much to start), and for my husband who has arthritis, this is a horrible product for him.  Wish we can return...we need a new mattress that is firm!
 First, a message to many of the other reviewers: learn the difference between a "product" review and a "seller" review. Even though it is rare these days for a company to actually do what it says it will do, that doesn't justify a 5 star "product" review for a mattress you returned.<br/><br/>Well-made, good value, too firm. King size was correct dimensions.<br/><br/>The mattress is firm. My girlfriend and I noticed back and shoulder pain immediately. We are both side/ back sleepers and 40 ish in age. If you researched any then you should have known that this mattress is "universal" which means it is meant to appeal to the masses as far as comfort. So it's a crap shoot on whether you are going to like it. If you are a sleeper who is comfortable on a mattress this firm then just save the money on a bed and sleep on the floor. Otherwise, be prepared to buy an additional topper.<br/><br/>The good news is that the price point and quality allow it to still be a value by adding a quality mattress topper to provide the top level cushioning needed. I think t&amp;n should market the mattress this way since they choose to manufacture it in a universal manner (I expect this is a "cost down" method)<br/><br/> I went with the Sleep Innovations 4" topper which ran almost $200 on Amazon. That put me at about $1000 after tax for the whole deal. Good value imho. We both sleep fine now with the firm support of the t&amp;n with the added pillow top feel of the topper. No more pain.<br/><br/>Kudos to t&amp;n for thinking outside the box with their business model and warranty. However, I like a warranty that I never have to use. No company/person can guarantee my comfort, only quality and craftsmanship. Especially when it is an online purchase. This mattress is a quality product and I believe it will last for many years. The option to return via donation is great but an absolute pita. So have a backup plan. Mine was the topper.
 I like very firm mattresses. I chose T&amp;N because of the comparison reviews saying this was the most firm of the foam mattresses from other companies. It's firmness is okay. It's softer than what I like but firm enough that I won't complain and is comfortable enough. It's probably the best you can do without having actual springs. In the future I might go back to a traditional spring mattress though.
 Tuft &amp; Needle King Size Mattress<br/><br/>When the package arrived as scheduled, it was in a 19x19x46 box<br/><br/>The mattress is actually folded in half twice then rolled and shrink wrapped.<br/><br/>Once opened, it was immediately ready to be slept on even though it says to allow up to 72 hours to fully expand and for odor to dissipate, and surprisingly there was Never any odor at all. We did go ahead and give ours 48 hours before using it but by appearances it wasn’t necessary.<br/><br/>I read quite a few reviews saying it was an undersized King but ours Immediately took on the full dimensions of 76x80.<br/><br/>It’s Very possible that the company is reading the reviews and addressing issues to make constant improvements.<br/><br/>We have now slept on this mattress for 2 months and my wife and I both rest much better and wake up without the aches and pains from our previous mattress and would highly recommend it.
 I purchased this bed for my son who has always had trouble staying cool while sleeping. Tuft &amp; Needle is the answer. He is finally sleeping comfortably. This is an extraordinarily comfortable queen sized bed. We have a Tempru Pedic that we paid over $3000 and it's a terrific bed, but so is the Tuft &amp; Needle which is way Less! This is the bed we will buy for our next purchase for sure!
 I'm 4 months pregnant so I was looking for soft but supportive. We looked at a lot of different mattresses but didn't want to pay 2k or more with a second kid on the way. When we got it I was a little disappointed in how firm it really was- however that being said, we called to let them know and they sent us a free topper! Two inches of the foam layer - now it's almost perfect, but we are still breaking it in. Can not beat the customer service at T&amp;n - amazing company!!!!!
 I purchased this bed after visiting my local mattress store to see what I prefer and then reading many reviews and watching utube video bed comparisons. I honed in on the Leesa and the tuft and needle, for their quality and price. I ended up choosing the tuft and needle because I prefer a medium firm mattress (the leesa was described as medium) and it was more than 250 dollars cheaper.<br/>This bed is firm, not medium firm- firm!! After two nights of tossing and turning and waking up with numb fingers and a very sore back I ran to my local Costco for a foam topper.  The topper made the mattress OK. This mattress as advertised is a more bouncy foam. You don't sink into it, but rather lay on top. If you like the quicksand feel of tempura edit, this bed is not that.  This style may keep you cooler, but it failed to support my lower back and before adding the topper I woke up with severe lower back pain. Again, with a topper all is well, but I wanted to give an honest detailed review for those folks still deciding what to buy!<br/>If I didn't live in Hawaii I'd be returning, but return shipping gets complicated and expensive. I'm also keeping in mind that mattresses can soften in time and the total cost of this mattress and a high quality topper is still cheaper than the leesa.
 OK.  I have to admit I was skeptical.  How could these guys get it right when so many have it wrong?  It doesn't make sense, but it's true.  I purchased a full-size mattress to replace my Stearns and Foster Eloise Ultrafirm mattress, which was 4 years old and shot.  I'm a big guy at just under 300lbs - I made that great mattress sag.  I'm hoping the Tufts and Needle will show it up.<br/>So far, it is a lot more bouncy and made me wonder if I will roll out of bed at first, but I got used to it quickly.  I slept on it and wow - did I sleep!  Already convinced, it is amazingly comfortable.  I'll follow up as I approach the 100 night trial limit, but I don't expect my opinion to change.  This is a great mattress!
 We've had the king size for close to a year now. Still feels like day one.  No "holes" where we also on either side, can sleep right up (or on), the edge. Heavy obese sleeper or kids piled in the middle, this bed takes it all.  Im SO happy we went for it.  If you're holding back,  take this review as the one that tips you into buying.  Totally worth it.
 I can find nothing to complain about.  Great Price. Beautiful removable, breathable, washable mattress cover.  Expanded to full sized very quickly.  Very comfortable.  I love it.  I would certainly buy it again.  Thanks Tuft and Needle for a comfortable, cool, perfectly priced mattress.
 I LOVE my new bed! For the first time in years I can sleep through the entire night and wake up without pain.  My body feels so much better and I'm not restlessly flopping around my bed trying to find a comfortable position to lay in.  My husband's noticed my sleeping habits changed immediately and has since ordered a tuft and needle bed as well.  He's ALSO noticed how much better his body feels in the morning.  I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much!
 5 stars for to the quality of the product, the shipping, and the easy return process. I'm a side sleeper and the mattress was simply too firm for my comfort, even with a mattress topper. I saw another reviews mentioning a "7/10 on the firmness scale", and for comparison's sake I'd say that's accurate. Good mattress, good company, just not for me.
 I originally ordered this bed because the reviews were great, I was in need of a new bed. I was so excited to sleep comfortably and have experienced nothing good since getting their bed. I wake up Extremely hot, which has never happened before, so I got cooling sheets; didn’t help. Then I started expierencing lower back pain. Overall, this bed is not for me. I will be returning this bed.
 The best thing I've bought on Amazon yet. I bought it here because I had a gift card for Amazon and it's the same price as from the tuft and needle store. My wife and I are so happy with it. We have it on an antique bed frame that's setup as a platform bed so no box spring. We sleep great and when you move you don't leave any indentations. We are skinny and it's still comfy
 Let me start by saying I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BED!<br/>As long as I can remember I have always woken up in the morning with a sore back, and a need to crack it. Usually the back pain was accompanied by my hips feeling off and my shoulders hurting as well. I've tried soft beds, firm beds, special pillows, the whole gamut.<br/>Flash-forward to the present, my wife and I were moving to a new Townhouse and wanted to get a king size bed. I saw an add on Facebook of all places of Tuft &amp; Needle and started to dig a little deeper into finding out about these beds.<br/>All things to say, my wife and I decided to take a chance and get this bed.<br/>The bed came rolled up and compressed in a tall rectangular box, and when I say tall I mean it! It had to be 7 feet tall!<br/>We muscled the box up two flights of stairs and got it in place to unroll it, and cut it loose!<br/>It definitely has an odor of being made of memory foam, but we opened all our windows and washed the zipper cover, and had no trouble with odor after that!<br/>When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't believe how good my back felt. No hip pain. No sore shoulders. None of it!<br/>I was weary to get to excited though and figured I would need to sleep on it longer to see how I would feel.<br/>Well... I am one month in and still wake up feeling like this bed was the best decision ever!<br/>Do yourself a favor and get it!
 I have RA, Fibromyalgia, Spondylosis, and Scoliosis--this is the first mattress that I have ever been able to sleep on without pain--was easy to set up--called Tuft and Needle--they told me I could put the mattress protector on after 4 hours--and--I could sleep on it after 4 hours!  I have not noticed any fumes--have asthma and allergies--and no reactions--this was the best mattress purchase we have ever made!
 So far I’ve been really impressed with this mattress. My previous mattress was going on about 9 years old and originally was very expensive around $1800. I was pretty nervous about buying a mattress untested online and also very unsure about the whole compressed mattress in a box idea.<br/>However, now after doing it and see the high quality of the mattress and how firm and comfortable it is I’m very happy that I took a chance.<br/>Be warned this is a very firm mattress. I like firm and for me it’s improved my sleep and comfort levels but if you don’t like firm then maybe it will be too hard for you.
 I read all the reviews before purchasing, but it's still unfortunately too soft for me.  I am a 118 lb woman, not big.  When I slept on the mattress, I had a water bed feeling, a bit dizzy.  I would not recommend to anyone who prefer a firm mattress.<br/><br/>The customer service was great though.  I asked for a return pickup, it turned out that UPS wouldn't pick up any item that's not packaged.  Since I have no way to put the mattress back into the original box, they let me keep the mattress, or to donate to charity.
 I have never bought a mattress online before. I have slept on it for a week now and I love it! This mattress if money well spent. I was looking at other brands for about twice the money but figured with the 100 night trial it was worth the risk for almost a 50% savings. Very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommended.
 Absolutely the best nights sleep I have ever had!  Ditto for my wife, and we typically have to compromise on mattresses as she likes plusher and me more towards firm.  This bed is a great value; I have paid a lot more for mattresses that were not nearly as comfortable and which showed wear very quickly.  Only been using this for about a month now but appears to be very well made.
 I only just opened it up and flopped down on it, and already I love it.<br/><br/>A couple things I wondered about before buying:<br/>- It is not too firm at ALL - for a second I was almost worried it was too soft. But then I lay down on it and realized that it is perfectly soft AND supportive.<br/>- It does have a new-foam odor, but it is not overwhelming or even that noticeable after a minute or two.<br/><br/>Basically, this mattress is not going to do my taxes or cure cancer, but I am VERY much looking forward to my first night of sleep on it!
 This mattress came on time but it is way too soft. It's definitely not a medium firmness mattress. You literally fall into this thing and can't get out.
 We've now had this mattress about a week. My husband (the front sleeper) LOVES it and says it's the best mattress he's ever had. I'm a side sleeper and it's been, sadly, horrible. I takes longer than usual to fall asleep since my hips and shoulders can't get comfortable. But what's worse is my top arms fall asleep constantly, especially in the morning. So far I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep. I think the bed is just too hard for me. We're trying a foam mattress topper tonight to see if it gets any better, but as of now it's looking like we'll have to return the mattress, which my husband is really not looking forward to.
 Im 6'4 300+ lbs with 4 herniated discs/spinal stenosis which hits mt sciatic nerve, so one can say my back is really Fd up. Last night was the first time sleeping in the mattress and it was absolutely amazing. Firsf time i slept that well in years considering my weight i had a bit of sinkage but i think thats exactly what i needed because i felt more refreshed and painfree..because it is an adaptive foam it contour to all my curves perfectly and gave support where a typical mattress would not considering it has only been one day i will update my review a few weeks from now
 Shipping and packaging - excellent. I'm 57 yoa and handled the task just fine. Product - excellent. No odor, easy to position, and expanded quickly. Comfort is awesome. Customer service - excellent. I had a quick question and went to the T&amp;N website. Chat was available so I received an answer immediately. I'm very happy I went through all the comparisons and selected this company and their mattress. Old bones now have a new comfort level for sleep.
 I wanted to love this mattress, and initially I did but so far my back aches after I sleep on it, but only on my right side...which is odd b/c I sleep on my back and not to either side.  The pros are that they delivered it quickly and that surprisingly there was almost no smell.  Even my toddler didn't notice a smell and he's pretty sensitive to everything.  It's more firm than I thought it would be (especially since initially it feels very squishy when you press your hand into it), but when you lay down it seems pretty firm.  Not sure what the odd ache is so that's been disappointing.
 I had visitors to my apartment one weekend and needed bedding for them.  I originally wasn't going to buy such an expensive mattress but I was astounded by the amount of good reviews this had on how it was basically changing lives and bringing people from the dead in terms of the drastic improvement in one's quality of sleep.  It looked like the new coconut oil of the mattress world.  My original thoughts included that I could buy this mattress and use it if I like it, and have my original mattress as a backup for when visitors came.  I would have to foot $700 for the mattress, tax, and expedited shipping, so I was on edge.  On a late Tuesday night, three days before my visitors were to come, I impulsively bought this mattress with excitement with high hopes that it would really transform my sleep and completely woo my visitors and have them throwing money at me to see where they could buy theirs.<br/><br/>After receiving the mattress in a large hipster box, I opened her up and put her in my bedroom.  From an initial laying, I could not tell any sort of difference to my current mattress which I paid $110 for. This one: http://www.amazon.com/Signature-Sleep-CertiPUR-US-Certified-Available/dp/B005A4OO80/ref=sr_1_5?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458580621&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=foam+mattress<br/><br/>When you lay down in the mattress, you sink a little bit into a med/high firmness foam and it supports you very well.  Its definitely a different feel than a spring mattress but, it is almost the same feel as my cheap foam mattress.  A slight higher level of craftsmanship can be seen  in terms of the feel of the cloth surrounding the mattress - it feels a little thicker and softer than my cheap mattress's cover.<br/><br/>I didn't let myself get disappointed and slept in it with an open mind and high hopes.  I woke up in the morning with a growing amount of buyers remorse and thought, "it is probably just me, I will wait for my two visitors to sleep on it and see what they think"  My two visitors slept on it, and actually told me it was actually less comfortable than their current cheap mattresses.  I still have an open mind, and will continue to sleep in it for a few weeks to see if anything changes - i.e., energy at work, tiredness throughout the day, if I wake up at night, etc, and may update my review if anything changes.<br/><br/>Simply put, I'm not sure if its worth paying a 300% premium for this, also it feels like all the reviewers are on this bandwagon together driven by a type of wired international placebo effect of giving good reviews for the mere excitement of cheering something on that everyone else is doing.<br/><br/>In conclusion:<br/>I'm sure this mattress is made with quality parts and hands, is American made, and is trying to hard to break the mattress market, but unless if you're having some serious sleep problems or are allergic to the materials of a cheap Chinese foam mattress, I don't think the majority of the population will be able to really appreciate the mattress's differences compared to a cheaper one.<br/><br/>If you're not a sleep connoisseur , this mattress may not be for you.  I have a $110 foam mattress and cannot tell a difference between the two. I'm not going to return it because I do need a mattress for future visitors, but if I could go back in time, I would have definitely bought a cheaper foam mattress.
 Last night made the 5th night sleeping on this mattress. The first night we slept on it; Neither one of us woke up at all. I woke up the next morning struggling to get out of bed, only because it was so comfortable. I suffer from lower back/lumbar pain, it was the first time I have not had pain upon waking. Neither did my fiance. The mattress is firm (not rock hard) but cradles/ contours to the curve of my spine. whether i sleep on my side, stomach or back.. I will update this as time passes to tell the durability of the T&amp;N mattress.
 I had really high hopes for this mattress- but ended up being too firm for me, as a side-sleeper. Mattress offers great support but not enough give to allow my shoulders to sink in.<br/>Amazon's customer service was AWESOME in assisting with the return/refund.  I sincerely appreciate their making my shopping experience a positive one.<br/>Good mattress for back sleepers IMHO
 I am so happy with this mattress!  The first night was like sleeping on a cloud and when I woke up from just 7 hours of sleep, my hip pain was gone.<br/><br/>Tuft and Needle really got it right with this queen sized mattress.<br/><br/>My wife likes a soft mattress and I like a firm mattress, but for some reason we both love the feel of the Tuft &amp; Needle.<br/><br/>Amazing!<br/><br/>I just wish we had thrown our old mattress out sooner.<br/><br/>The only negative was that the box it came in looked like it had journeyed from the South Pole.  It was pretty beat up and dirty.<br/><br/>T &amp; N customer service sent me another mattress right away though, so kudos to them.
 I've had this mattress for 4 days &amp; it is so awesome!!!  Supportive but not hard.  Soft but not squishy.  I totally love it!!! Fantastic!!!
 Initially, I was very skeptical about buying a "mattress-in-a-box' but after doing a lot of research, both through Consumer Reports and then with the feedback from buyers of this mattress on Amazon... I gave it a shot. I can honestly say that this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is the most comfortable mattress that I have ever owned!
 We tried purchasing a memory foam mattress from amazon a few years ago and gave it away due to a few factors 1.) toooo soft so soft that you’d get stuck 2nd) it was way too hot at night. I am happy to report that this T&amp;N mattress is neither! It is on the former side but it feels like a traditional mattress minus the annoying springs. We love it so much.
 I love the bed! Have had it a few months now and sleep well on it. I would get it again if needed. There was a problem with the delivery, it only came wrapped in plastic and not the box like it looks. Something had cut / burned a hole in the plastic sometime by the time it arrived to me. However, I kept it because I needed it that night. Fortunately, it only burned / cut through the plastic and only got the actual mattress dirty, which mostly cleaned off. It has been comfortable and a decent price, my partner and I have both been happy with it.
 The Mattress arrived very quickly.  was easy to set up and instructions were very clear.  I slept perfectly the first night and now for about 2 weeks I still find it one of the best mattresses I have ever used.  I am a side sleeper so no pressure points and contours to my body perfectly.  First full nights sleep in a very long time.  I highly recommend this mattress.
 Review is over a year after receiving, and I can say it has been great. Always get the best sleep, well except for when the dogs join us! Great product, shipping was great, easy set up, no off gasing whatsoever. Love the mattress!!
 After watching many video reviews comparing this new breed of foam mattress, I decided to purchase this one.  The packaging is very clever and it's very easy to open it up and allow the compressed mattress to expand to its normal size.  The mattress isn't very heavy, though it can be a bit awkward to move around a slab of rubbery-feeling foam of this size.  It's probably a good idea to allow it to "air out" for several hours, especially if you're sensitive to unusual smells.  After sleeping on it for a week, I've been very happy with it, especially as I appreciate a firmer mattress.  Though it is firm, it does incorporate a satisfying amount of "give" in the top couple of inches.  For the price, I really doubt a better quality mattress can be found...highly recommended!
 We were happy with the delivery and unpackaging of this mattress. We had a pillow top traditional mattress before so this one took us a couple of days to adjust to. We chose this mattress because it was highly recommended by a friend.<br/><br/>The great news...my usual morning aches and pains were gone within days! This firm-ish feeling mattress helped in that way.<br/><br/>The not-so-great...the edge support is minimal. Although my husband didn’t mention it, I was afraid I would roll off if I got too close to the side. I also thought it slept hotter than our old mattress.<br/><br/>I bought a great topper for $50 that seemed to *help* with both issues and made this mattress very comfy.<br/><br/>Bottom line...although this was comfortable and helped with Morning joint stiffness, we did decide to return it. sleeping hot is a deal breaker for us. It’s been a cold spring here and still we felt hotter with this mattress. If you sleep alone or are cold at night and would appreciate the added warmth, I would recommend.<br/><br/>The return was free &amp; VERY easy through Amazon. They honor T&amp;N’s money back guarantee. I think we will try T&amp;N’s Mint version. It is more expensive, but is supposed to have added edge support and sleep cooler.
 It's an OK mattress.  Seems to be good quality, and customer service was excellent.  I've ordered 4 foam mattresses online.  This is the lightest of all that I have tried.  The top 2 inches of the mattress are very cushioned, then it gets firm, even hard, at least from my perspective.  I ended of returning this mattress, but would encourage you to try it if you are considering purchasing a foam mattress online.
 I love this mattress. We’ve had it for a year now and it’s still just as comfortable as the day we got it. We’ve never had to turn it or anything. I was pain free after a couple nights and I had been sleeping with pain and waking up in pain for a good 4 years prior. I thought it was just age or weight or a bad back but it was just my mattress! Now I sleep easy. The mattress stays cool and I don’t have pressure points. Very happy.
 very comfortable and a great deal for the price.  was a little leary of buying a mattress without ever having laid on it, but it's worked out very well.  relied on previous reviewers and they were correct - it's a very comfortable mattress.  previous reviewers had also mentioned a bit of a chemical smell; I did notice a bit of a smell early on, but I was able to allow the mattress to air out for a couple of days before we made up the bed, and it was fine.
 I have waited several months to write this review. It is a very comfortable mattress but there is a period of time where you need to get used to it. It is a memory foam mattress not a spring mattress which you need to give your time to adjust to. I like a pretty firm bed and this is about as firm as I would like. The pillows are excellent but a bit pricy. TN customer service is great and they have a reasonable return policy. I would buy another one. No problems so far.
 We have been very happy with this mattress after suffering for years with inferior ones.  The only drawback is a little sinkage by the middle of the night, probably due to body heat.  Otherwise a very comfortable mattress overall.<br/>I'm not complaining though.  We have suffered with so many other TERRIBLE mattresses, including foam, that this one rates the highest of any mattress we have tried.  Very comfortable!<br/>The packaging was an adventure.  Watching the mattress unfurl and fill with air was just FUN!!!  I want another one just to watch it do that again!
 We purchased this bed after reading all of the glowing reviews.  The customer service has been fantastic, from communications early on from Tuft and Needle about the purchase to follow up after our receipt of the bed.  Delivery was on time and the packaging ensured the mattress wouldn't be damaged in shipping.  The instructions were a snap and the bed inflated in 5 minutes.  It is nice looking, and lighter than traditional mattresses so much easier to move.  My only regret is the firmness.  I didn't let this affect my review, because I believe it is at the level of firmness advertised.  I believe I was swayed by many reviews indicating it was slightly too firm, and this led me to believe it would be firm enough for me, someone who likes a very firm bed.  Sadly it is not, but I think I will get used to it.  I am almost wishing we had ordered last year, before the company responded to the often voiced complaint that customers found it too firm and made the mattress softer :)
 The initial queen-sized mattress we received was 2" too narrow (even several days after unpacking it) and was too small to fill our bed frame. We contacted Amazon and they immediately agreed to send us a replacement, which we received a few days later. The second mattress had the correct width but was about 1/2" too short. We decided to keep the second mattress and have found it quite comfortable.
 I love the tuft and needle brand for my older son. He would alway sleep on the floor with his blankets right next to his bed or mattress. He'd treat it like a big toy instead of something to sleep on. I'm so excited that he likes to sleep on his bed. The only thing I wish was that I could put the mattress cover it comes with in the wash. It's really stained and spot cleaning isn't going to save it.
 We have four Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses and our son has one - he's the one that told us about this mattress and company.  Our experience has been great from ordering, shipping, ease of unboxing and placing mattress and best of all they are so comfortable.  We have a friend who stayed in our guest room (he usually brings his own memory mattress topper, picky guy) and he loved our Tuft &amp; Needle mattress.  No complaints.  Our son has had his a few years and still loves it.
 I've slept on a king size Tuft &amp; Needle mattress since December 2015.  The box was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but air is like viagra to these mattresses, so once I cut the plastic wrap it expanded into it's full size.  I had a normal style mattress before, and moving to a foam mattress feels light years superior.  I can't feel my S.O nor the dogs moving in the middle of the night anymore.
 First, this mattress is heavy, so be warned if you have to get it up 2 steep flights of stairs like I did.  It did go up easier because it was well boxed.  Once out of the box and out of the plastic it took shape and expanded to full size in just a couple of minutes.  It is very comfortable, with a nice soft layer on top of a firm base, so you sink in enough to feel supported, but not so much that you feel like you'll be swallowed.  The mattress did have that "foam smell" for the first day, so if you're sensitive to smells, it's probably best to let it sit out for a day or two before sleeping on it.  By the second night, we didn't smell it at all.  After sleeping on it for 5 nights, my back is feeling better, and I'm getting a deeper sleep.
 My daughter is a VERY picky sleeper.  I have been locked in a battle for a new mattress for her over the past several years.  She is chunky for her age and has found the standard Serta and Sealy you buy at the local big box to be very uncomfortable and hot.  Not wanting to spend 2k or more for a mattress, I purchased this for her in the full size.<br/><br/>One month later, she is completely satisfied.  Not only is it soft enough for her without being "Squishy", she can back the claim that the mattress is far cooler to sleep on than her pillow top unit.  We live in Vegas and the nights get very warm here.<br/><br/>I have offered to send it back if she was not giving it 5 stars, but she is sold on this unit.<br/><br/>I just bought a Cal King for my bed!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Very comfortable without being too soft<br/>- Really is cooler than using a mattress topper or getting a pillow top.<br/>- There is NO ODOR when you receive it.  This was a huge issue with some toppers I have bought!<br/>- The quality looks solid.  Glue seams and cuts are 100 percent accurate.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Heavy and tougher to handle than a regular mattress.  Not a big deal though.<br/><br/>I really am impressed with the quality and performance of this unit.  The warranty is excellent and our 1 call to customer service was perfect (Just to check on how to register the warranty).
 Comfortable mattress for a great price.  Much better than the old spring mattress we were replacing, and at a much lower cost.  Set up was really easy.  It looked completely filled out within minutes, but based on a recommendation from a friend we did give it several hours to settle before we actually used it.  I can't speak to longevity yet, but after a couple of weeks both my wife and I are pleased.
 A little background first: My wife and I have owned this mattress for 8 months and sleep an average of 8 hours per night on it. I weigh 200 pounds and she ways 115 pounds. Prior to this mattress, I had an Ashley memory foam mattress. We are both generally side-sleepers, but have tried different positions in an effort to accommodate this mattress.<br/><br/>Both of us have had a terrible time with this mattress. We both have been waking up with back pains nearly every morning. I think this is mostly due to the "sponginess" of the foam. It pushes back quite a bit and thus makes our bodies lie unevenly. Where most mattresses have different levels of support for the different parts of your body, this one seems to be uniform throughout. I've also noticed that it has begun form soft spots where we sleep (we have rotated the mattress twice so far).<br/><br/>Ultimately, I regret not taking advantage of the 100 night trial. We really wanted to give this mattress a chance, but it just didn't work out in the end.
 We really like the quality of the mattress. It was a bit firmer than we anticipated but we put a topper on it and it’s perfect! I wasn’t sure about buying a mattress like this but I’ve been converted! We love this mattress. We also bought the box/platform. Easy to put together. I hope this mattress lasts a long time. It’s very comfortable and a very good price. I’d buy again, so far.
 Great mattress. Bought during prime days. Got a great deal. Comes in a heavy box and then once open it just expands. Been sleeping on it for 6 months and have no complaints. We do use a platform frame.
 Ordered a cali King. Edges are incredibly soft. Wife and I couldn't even sit up right to watch TV without the mattress doing something funny.  Felt like cheap foam.<br/><br/>I'll give them one star just for their return policy. There entire return process was smooth , and painless
 We purchased the Tuft &amp; Needle queen mattress to replace our old Sleep Number bed. My wife is an Iraq war vet and has some back issues from her service. Our old bed was just not cutting any more. I first heard about the company on Digg and looked into them for months. After reading all the reviews on Amazon we chose to buy the mattress knowing we could get a full refund within 30 days if we were not happy. The mattress came in two-days with the free trial of Prime. It was neatly packaged and unfolded quickly. The first thing we noticed was the overall quality of the mattress. The cover is very well made and feels great. The firmness is perfect, even for my wife's picky back! It's been three weeks now and I don't think we've slept the well in years. The only thing we noticed that was semi off-putting was the light "organic" smell the mattress has when you first take it out of the box. That has slowly gone away and was merely just noticeable to begin with. Kudos to Tuft &amp; Needle for their excellent mattresses!
 I purchased this product without trying it at first. It's been a year since we've been using it. Reasonable mattress if you are looking for a short term product and if you do not care all that much.<br/>Unfortunately, it's not a replacement for a good quality mattress that you'd get from other known brands. Too soft and I think it has gotten softer since we purchased it. (I'm 192 lbs, wife is weighs much less.)<br/>Also, the dimensions of the bed is kind of strange, too. The queen size is about an inch (or more?) narrower. It means a lot when you have a decent bedroom furniture, just looks odd.<br/>These businesses are well aware of the fact that returning these products are a pain; especially since the item comes in a box that cannot be used after the mattress expands.<br/>My suggestion: TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.
 Was really looking forward to this mattress and have been very disappointed. Purchased for a daybed/couch and while it’s great as a couch it’s terrible as a bed. I’ve woken up every morning with a backache.<br/><br/>The mattress is very firm. I would return but don’t want to buy another internet mattress since this one does make a good couch (it’s main purpose). Overall I wouldn’t recommend it.
 Great Googly Moogly!!  Where to start... First of all my "Sleep number" bed went south on me.  I was not looking forward to a $2000 replacement.  It was a good bed.  It's also two thousand dollars.  So, I go looking.  The decision was clear cut for me.  First of all the guarantee on Amazon caught up with the Guarantee offered by the manufacturer (Tuft &amp; Needle).  Big help there.  Then there were the "Consumer Reports" reviews.  EXCELLENT!  Okay, so now I am looking a two highly rated mattresses, sold on AMAZON, both highly rated by C.R and receiving thousands of 5 star reviews from Amazon customers.  What to do?<br/><br/>I went to "Big Mike".  "Big Mike" is THE furniture repair guy.  I mean his knowledge of furniture is encyclopedic. I explain my quandary and show him the websites from both of the mattress manufactures I am considering.  He looks at the make up of both mattresses and says"Tuft and Needle".<br/><br/>He Goes on to explain all about the process of getting two or more types of foam to adhere together and the displacement of my body weight....TMI!. I did take his advice.  I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>My wife and I prefer different mattresses. She likes it firm, me. I have back issues and have recently had three lower back surgeries in two years. I like my mattress soft.<br/><br/>I have to say this one is a little more firm than I like. But it just felt SOOOO GREAT!  I slept like a rock immediately and so did she.  I did add a pillow top just for that little extra that I need. to enjoy the full nights' sleep.<br/><br/>I had trouble with this mattress the first three days -I awoke stiff... But,truly, after one month, I can honestly tell you that for the first time in my life I over sleep several nights a week.  I mean I have never ever used a snooze alarm in my life.  I have popped out of bed immediately every day of my life. Now, it's like I don't want to leave. Oy!  I Love this mattress and have never slept so deeply n my adult life.
 This mattress is very firm, especially the top layer.  I'd prefer a much softer top that gives a little.  Instead, there is almost no molding around your curves even when sleeping on your back which creates pressure points.  It's even worse when sleeping on your side.  I should have returned the mattress within the 100 day period but of course I missed my chance due to being too busy.  It would likely be nice with a plush top, but I don't want to spend an additional $100+ on this mattress.
 Have been sleeping on this for a few months. It is very comfortable for me as a side sleeper. I purchased this mattress over a few other mattress brands because of their customer service. Hopefully I will not have to use it. Reading reviews about how quickly other customers had their issues resolved made purchasing a mattress online a little less scary.
 I wanted to love this bed!  However it is way too soft for my husband and I.  I am very lightweight and my back started hurting immediately.  I gave it 2 full weeks but it has continued.  I went back to our old bed and feel much better.  My husband is a typical size for being 6.4" and his back began to hurt as well.  I am very disappointed because i wanted it to work.<br/><br/>Now we are in charge of getting it back in the box somehow.  I guess I thought they would provide a way to compress the mattress back up.
 This is a very comfortable mattress. Arrived in a box all smashed down and when removed it very soon became a full 10 inch thick King mattress. We have had it about a month now and it sleeps great.
 This mattress seems like it would be comfortable, but I never go the chance to try it out. The smell was unbearable. A week later and the chemical smell is still there, so we're sending them back. I wouldn't want to put this in my child's room. It's especially frustrating since I emailed them prior to purchasing and they assured me there would be no odor within a few days and that most people don't notice one at all. I noticed they are sold out on Amazon. I wonder if they're stuffing them in packaging too soon since they're in a rush and that's why many others didn't have an odor.
 In the past I didn't like memory foam mattresses because I'd sink in them. Foam mattress have come a long way. This Tuft &amp; Needle mattress takes your shape slowly and comfortably. You don't sink too far that you can't toss and turn in bed.<br/><br/>I bought 2 of these mattresses. One for my guest bedroom on a platform bed. My guests love the mattress. The other mattress is on an adjustable bed, and it works great!
 When i first got this mattress I loved it. Although it sleeps a little on the hot side, I found it very comfortable. I was raving about it to friends. However, I have now had it for around a year and wake up with a sore low back every morning. I have had to get up at 4am the past two days because my back hurt too much to keep sleeping. I would strongly caution anyone to please disregard all the great reviews from people who have only had this bed a few months. I would not recommend it as a nightly use mattress.
 Update: it's been a few months and this mattress is pretty good for my back.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my dad who has had back problems in his old age.  He sleeps like a rock on this mattress and says he hasn't had such a good sleep in a very long time.  Would recommend this for anyone who may like firmer mattresses.  This isn't too firm where you will be sore for side sleepers.  It is just the right mix of firm and soft.<br/><br/>Slept on this for the first time last night.  I was skeptical at first because I typically like firm mattresses, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well I slept on this.  I will give it a few more weeks and come back with an update, but so far so good.
 This mattress is good. Very comfy and has a surprising amount of bounce (good thing) for a foam mattress.<br/><br/>4 stars because the marketing seems a bit startup-cliche and that while it's a good mattress, it's not life changing and the marketing seems a bit fluffed on that. It is possible to get a foam mattress from Walmart for half the price, and this doesn't feel twice as good as my old walmart one.
 This is my second Tuft and Needle mattress--the first one I had slept on is on the third floor of an old house in Baltimore, actually on an old wood floor.  This is a fantastic night's sleep!<br/><br/>If you have tendinitis, this doesn't hurt pressure points. It's very, very comfortable if you are a back sleeper.<br/><br/>One warning: once you open the second cover, the mattress will inflate like a balloon in a matter of seconds. Don't open that last cover until you've put the bed where you want it. Recommended.<br/><br/>Edit:  After a few days, I feel better than I have in years. (I was sleeping on a fifteen-year-old Sealy futon.)  Seriously, this will make back pain and tendinitis from sleeping on an old mattress better in days.  This is a cure for soft tissue pain caused by an old or too hard bed. It's amazing.
 I love this thing. Period. Used to have lower back pain every day. Not anymore, I was skeptical for sure and didn't believe the reviews but I love it. I did buy a 2" memory foam gel topper because it does sleep warm. That's the nature of memory foam but the gel topper remedied that issue and now I have no complaints. Don't spend 4000 on another ripoff. Save yourself some cash and back pain.
 Not sure what it is about Amazon and large packages but they always tend to screw them up. Ordered a full and got a queen instead. The package wasnt marked otherwise I woildnt have opened it. Now I have a mattress too large for my bed and impossible to repackage....mattress is ok otherwise but looks ridiculous hanging off my smaller sized bed...
 I've given the mattress a chance to get used to and it is nice quality and has been comfortable for me although a little more firm than I expected. I don't like that sheets are hard to find since it's only 10" thick, just about everything sold is for thick pillowtop mattresses.  Even the suggested protective mattress cover is for a thick mattress and so while it fits, gets wrinkled under the sheets.
 After less than 5 months, the mattress has become much too soft, and is causing some pretty bad lower back pain. It is especially bad as a side sleeper. And because I bought it on Amazon, the return policy was much different than if I had bought it direct (where they'll just pick it up from you without boxing it up).
 We purchased our mattress in December 2016 and it is as comfortable now as when we purchased it. It continues to hold up well. It is by far the most comfortable mattress I have slept on.
 I have been sleeping on this mattress for over 3 months now and I like it! It is comfortable, not too soft or too hard. When my husband gets into bed after me, I do not feel the entire bed moving. When he rolls over, again, I do not feel any movement like I used to with my old mattress. I am very happy with this purchase!
 I am not one to write reviews, but let me rave for just a minute about how awesome this mattress really is. I bought this mattress on Amazon Prime Day thinking that it would be a good “budget mattress” to last me a little while. I read tons of reviews and found that Tuft and Needle was a reputable, quality product. When I received my mattress, I was a little upset at first because it seemed to be too firm for my liking. I decided to contact Tuft and Needle and tell them about my concern. The same day, they shipped me a mattress topper, telling me that this should solve the problem. After I gave it about a week, I realized I need to give it time and to let it fully expand. This is probably the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever laid on! For being a “budget mattress”, it’s definitely something I could see myself using for many years to come.
 I've been sleeping on a traditional innerspring mattress my whole life. Age 32..6'2" 200lbs. After hours of research from time off work (recovering from shoulder surgery) my fiance and I went with the Queen and low profile zinus box spring. So with 2 boxsprings stacked and Tuft &amp; Needle on top we are so pleased with our purchase. 2 weeks using now and I sleep on my surgery side with no problems...She has no complaints as well other than my loud snoring. Like so many others on here thank you Tuft &amp; Needle. Great product! Innerspring mattresses don't stand a chance.
 Hi, my queen sized Tuft and Needle mattress came quickly, but the mattress was poorly packed and the box was open when delivered.  I am not sure who is at fault here, but I know it isn't me.  The bed itself seems to be undamaged and in good shape, so that is the positive side here.  I haven't used it enough yet to comment on whether I like it or not, but so far I really like the look and feel of it.  So, I think it ranks fours stars at the moment, but if the mattress comes by itself in this flimsy box (no idea how they package their mattresses besides how it came to me) without any kind of reinforcement, then I think that is not really acceptable and needs to be remedied.  Again, however, no idea how they package these mattresses normally and maybe mine just got wrecked somewhere in between buying and receiving.  I Hope this is informative and helpful.  Sincerely, Sean Shufelt.
 My husband purchased this bed after reading about the company, and he likes it better than the $$$$ bed purchased earlier in the year.  He told me that his lower back is no longer hurting.  I would of given it 5 stars, but we only had it for one month.  We will see if it holds up over the years.  The mattress had no smell and set up was very easy.
 From quick delivery, tidy packaging, and easy setup, to extreme comfort, this mattress is a superb value. Soft cooling gel foam upper layer is supported by a dense foam base providing the perfect blend of firmness and comfort without pressure points. You will love this product; no reason to pay more for a quality mattress.
 honestly, I didn't really know what we were missing out on until we slept on this. we tried another brand after sleeping on a mattress that was probably 15 years old, at least. we were concerned about health, VOC's all that jazz so we did lots of research. the brand we bought before this had a 100 day trial and after about two weeks we had to return it because it was too firm. next up was the tuft and needle, and it was a game changer. after the first night we understood what it was like to wake up without back pain. for us it was the perfect amount soft and firm. you sink in, but not too much. it stays super cool which is great. I'm a big guy too, 6'2, 240.
 I just unpacked our new tuft and needle mattress!  So here is a review only on the unpackaging and set up. I will update this review after we have slept on it for a few nights.<br/><br/>The mattress came in a box just as pictured. The box was pretty heavy, but I was able to bring it inside to the bedroom. Now, I am a woman of average strength  (maybe even below average lol)  and I was able to completely unpackage this mattress on my own. After I opened the box, I slid the rolled up mattress onto our box spring frame. It was double wrapped in plastic: The first layer of plastic was holding the mattress into the rolled shape. As soon as I cut this away, it immediately started making a "hissing" sound.  It then laid flat on the bed. It started to "come to life" and fluff up as I cut away the second layer of vacuum sealed plastic around it. As soon as all the packaging was gone, the mattress was in a complete normal shape! I was expecting to have to wait an hour or two for it to fully fluff out, but it was instant. No odor at all, either!  Just on the unpackaging alone, I am well pleased. The only trouble I had was how heavy it was, but of course any mattress would be just as heavy. I definitely recommend two people unloading this - but I was not patient enough to wait for my husband to come home lol<br/><br/>I'll update after a few nights sleep!<br/><br/>**UPDATE** We have slept on our mattress for about 2 months now and LOVE it! We use to wake up wth occasional back pain, but not anymore! Because it's foam, instead of springs, when I move on one side of the bed, it doesn't disturb my husband on the other side at all. We really hate memory foam, and that is NOT what this bed is! It's soft without being too soft. I don't feel like I'm sinking in too much. Overall we are extremely happy with our purchase!
 So far a great mattress. Comes vacuum packed in a double roll of plastic, in a box. Expands with air after removal of all that. I originally wished it was thicker, it’s 10”. It doesn’t feel like memory foam, but it’s quite comfortable. Best feature unlike my last foam mattress is it doesn’t get hot. I also got the standard pillow but it’s nothing special - at $75 I’d skip that if ordering again.
 Run do not walk to your nearest computer and BUY THIS MATTRESS! I can't say enough about how much I love my T and N mattress! My dogs love it as well. Sure wish T and N would make dog beds. :-) My back issues have been helped significantly the past few months since sleeping on my new mattress. My husband and I do not disturb one another going to bed at different times. I NEED MORE STARS!
 I was so happy with this mattress when it first arrived.  My husband's back issues just disappeared almost overnight!  We did not experience any off-gassing from the mattress at all like some people mentioned.  However, just shortly after the the 100 night trial was over my back started hurting.  I ignored it for a few days thinking it couldn't possibly be from the mattress.  I changed my office chair, etc - same issue.  It came to the point I had to go to the chiropractor because my back was going into spasm every morning!  I still didn't want to believe it was from the mattress, but we just spent one night on a hotel mattress and my back was 95% better.  Now we are in the market for a new mattress again and can't even return this one because we've had it for 118 days.  What a joke....
 My most favorite aspect of this mattress is that the mattress is able to be moved easily.  If or when you move from one location to the next, you just need to purchase a plastic mattress bag, insert your mattress, and remove the air.  Easier than renting a trailer to move this baby around.  There is a complaint I have, but it may be due to how I sleep or my lifestyle.  I find that I now wake with shoulder pain and that is something that I have never experienced before.  I do not sleep on my sides (well, wake up on my sides) but normally sleep on my back.  This seemed odd to me as sleeping on my back resulted in pain in my right shoulder.  If I do find myself sleeping on my side, pressure is exerted on my left shoulder.  Something strange, indeed, but I cannot fully put these peculiar occurrences on the mattress because my work/sleep schedule has changed multiple times since owning the product.
 Very firm but for some reason about 8 inches from the left side if laying on my back it has a very hard spot that feels like a 4 foot 2X4. I threw away the box so I am not sure how to return. It arrives well packed using sealed plastic and the air removed by vacuum,  I threw out the box figuring I was keeping it and would never get it back in the box anyway without professional help.
 I was so surprised I could get such a quality mattress through amazon in only 2 days. It was fairly easy to unwrap, albeit a bit heavy. I was expecting it to take some time for it to really "poof up" but after I took off the protective wrap it took literally 5 minutes for it to be fully "poofed" and ready to use. This mattress is very comfortable and the right amount of supportive and soft. I'm a fan!
 Awesome Bed. I waited a while before reviewing to be sure we would be happy with the bed and I am certain we are liking it even more each day. My husband and I are not small people, probably average size. We mostly side sleep and I occasionally sleep on my stomach. I have a bad back and was a bit worried about buying a bed without trying it but really feel it has helped my back. We paired it with a solid base and are very pleased.
 I just received this mattress on Friday (it didn't arrive in a box).  We bought a brand new top of the line box spring.  Then we placed the box spring onto the bed frame.  The mattress was placed on the box spring while still in the plastic packaging.  Then opened the packaging of the mattress to watch it expand.  It did unfold and expand as it should.  when all was said and done the mattress was larger than the box spring.  The mattress is very comfortable but my concern is for the integrity of the mattress over time with the overhang on the box spring.
 Instantly slept better on night one. I’ve had it for about 5 months and have turned it around once to keep it “even”. They mean it when they say it doesn’t run hot like some memory foam mattress. Firm with a nice topper of cushiness.
 We have had for almost a month now. It's the perfect amount of firmness. I am very happy we went with the Tuft and Needle.
 So fast to set up, no smell at all. Fit perfectly with the sheets i bought, and the bed frame. Love the cool layer, you can tell the difference here in AZ, lol
 I was really hesitant to buy - of all things - a mattress online, without having ever slept on it.  But I trusted the ratings and reviews, and wow - I'm amazed!  Just like they say, shipping and setup was a piece of cake. And boy is this thing comfortable!  I've never slept on a foam mattress before, but I couldn't be happier!  If you're on the fence, just do it!
 My husband and I are very happy with this purchase.  I did a lot of research before purchasing, and this mattress had the highest percentage rate for satisfaction.  We have both been getting such good sleep!  He's a back sleeper and I'm a side sleeper.  I've been telling everyone.  The price was right too!
 I am absolutely amazed by this bed.<br/>Incredible to sleep on. After almost one month, I'd say hands down best value for the money. I wouldn't spend more for other higher priced beds even if I had the money.<br/><br/>You can forget about your arms or shoulders going to sleep, you can comfortably sleep on your side or on stomach. But I'd recommend to stay on your back, I believe it's better in the long run.
 I had zero experience with memory foam mattresses prior to this post, but the great reviews on Amazon, positive review from Consumer Reports, and a strong desire to stay the heck away from salespeople whenever possible brought us to buy from here. Even though the 30-day guarantee was nice peace of mind, it still felt like quite a gamble to buy sight unseen. Sooooo happy we did. I absolutely love this bed. It's comfy in every position. Everything is nicely cushioned and I feel like my body properly and consistently flat every direction I lay--no sags, no crooks, no nothing. I'm really surprised by how much happier I am with this bed. I will say that my wife and I both found we needed to swap out our pillows. The old ones just didn't have the right height for the different consistency and firmness of the new bed.
 Everyone who sits on my bed falls in love in seconds. This is the comfiest mattress I’ve ever slept on. 10/10 it has honestly ruined sleeping anywhere else for me
 I got this mattress on Prime Day for under $500. It's medium firm, has held up well for more than 2 months, and is generally comfortable whether sleeping alone or with someone else.<br/><br/>The major downside to the mattress is that it does hold heat, so if living somewhere without a breeze and/or AC, this maybe problematic. I keep my windows open while I sleep, and that of course helps a lot!
 I know sleeping is a very individual experience but for $575 and a top 3 Consumers Report choice it's hard to go wrong with this mattress when you'll replace in app 10 yrs anyway slept on it 1st night like a baby no back pain at all which I did experience from my previous spring free latex from Sealy other than a very plain cover which you'll never see anyway seems like a steal
 I waited a year to write this review, because I feel this is the only way it can be honestly rated. I never owned a foam mattress before, so it two about a week or so to get use to it.  After that, all I can say that it is an excellent mattress, worth every dollar.  I can sleep comfortably regardless of seasonal conditions; it always returns to shape after I get up; and again, it is very, very comfortable.  I do recommend this mattress only if you take the time to acclimate to this type of mattress.
 It's a little soft for me.  My previous mattress was 100% latex.  If you lay on the edge of this one, you will fall out of bed as it squishes down.  My wife loves it, but again, has to avoid the edge.  Now our bed seems a little smaller.  I do get good sleep though and it has not induced any pain of any kind.  I thought at first that being so soft my back may start to hurt, but that has not happened.
 This bed is not comfortable at all. I was looking for medium firm, but this is so firm, it feels as though you are sleeping on the ground. I wake up with backaches. I had to buy a 3 inch memory foam topper, so I can sleep on this mattress. Disappointed. Buy something else.
 This is a medium to firm mattress with lots of "bounce". It is not 'dead' like a memory foam pad which you will sink in. In my opinion is it very Reasonably priced (and Made in USA!). The outer mattress cover is very soft.<br/><br/>My previous dryup was a mid-range IKEA mattress with a 1 inch memory foam padded on top. To compare- the 10" Tuft sleeps cooler, is more firm. Also, my arms would often go numb when sleeping on my side before. This has been reduced with the new mattress.
 Phenomenal mattress. I like a firmer mattress as I often sleep on my stomach and it is perfect. By no means should this deter you if think you wouldn't like a firmer mattress because the material is equally wonderful in all other sleeping positions. Its is firm, cradling, and supportive with a perfect amount of spring. It doesn't have that sinky feeling that I've seen in other foam mattresses. Last but not least it regulates body heat at night flawlessly. With my old mattress I would wake up and toss off my blanket halfway through the night but not with this glorious block of miracle foam. Could not recommend this thing more highly especially considering how much more expensive the competition is. Ill be buying these things as long as they make them.
 Great matress for both my husband who is 6'4" 195# and myself 5'2" 135#.  The matress is firm but that's what I like.  I have had 2 lower back fusions and a shoulder replaced.  I love this bed.  We did add a matress topper, my hubby thought the matress was a little to firm for a side sleeper.  I also sleep on my sides.
 This bed is amazing! I'm a super light sleeper so when my husband moves at night it normally wakes me up - on this bed if he moves I don't feel him so therefore I sleep right through it. I've been having a harder time waking up in the morning because I'm so comfy 😁 Overall getting more quality sleep and feeling rested in the mornings
 The mattress is average. Sitting on the edges causes it to really sink. Bought it for side sleeping and it's not comfortable for side sleeping-- wake up with a numb shoulder and hip. Back sleeping is decent, not enough support and not very pillow compatible. We weigh 120 and 150 lbs, we find that maybe we're not heavy enough to sink in the right places. The mattress is cool, didn't overheat on it.
 Love it. We lived in Uganda for over 5 years on a foam mattress (not nearly as good). We've never go back to the bouncy, springy spring mattresses again! T &amp; N mattress rocks!! Comfortable, very little movement when either I or my spouse moves. Supportive, even on the edge of the mattress. No hot spots. Sheets fit fine. Bought the zinus mattress bed-frame. Great combo. I highly recommend this mattress.
 I was really in love with the tech aspect of the mattress - heat wicking, durable, solid "foam" support. After a while though, I'm realizing that my arm is often asleep when I awake. Maybe, it's because I'm always so still on one side because of the comfort that I don't bother to move my fully asleep arm. Idk, something to consider.
 I received my first Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress and Pillows less than a week ago and after sleeping on what I was told was a great quality mattress I found I dreaded going to sleep due to the severe back pain i was enduring. The T &amp; N Mattress expanded immediately upon removing from the shipping container and it fit my bed perfectly. I pushed my hand into the mattress and it sank in so far that I thought this will not support me well, but upon sleeping my first night I awoke and upon getting out of bed I experienced absolutely no pain and now several days later, I can honestly say I love this mattress. When laying on it you are fully supported and it is firm but soft.  I now look forward to nighttime now!!!
 Rad company!<br/>Really awesome return policy on their company website. A company that is doing it right.<br/>It was a very stress free experience to move to our new house and have our mattress delivered to our doorstep.<br/>This is a quite firm mattress and a quite reasonable price.<br/>Plus our dog is very impressed with it (he isn't allowed on beds, but he is obsessed). Please let us know when you start making dog beds.
 After 10 nights of sleeping on this mattress, I couldn't be happier. At 5 months pregnant, my traditional mattress was leaving me sore and needing 4 pillows to get comfy. With this option, I lay down and don't really move until I wake up (granted a couple times a night but that's another pregnancy issue). I bought this for the environmental aspect and the convenience, and hoped I would enjoy the comfort. Very pleased.
 We bought our mattress April 2018 after reading the reviews and friends recommending it.  The first couple of months were fine but after that it seems to be very firm. I'm a side sleeper and I wake up with my shoulder and hip hurting. My husband wakes up in the middle of the night and gets in the recliner (he has a history of back problems). He sleeps on a 4 inch foam mattress in our camper and never gets up until morning but for some reason this one seems too firm for both of us. I do not think it sleeps hot like others have said, I'm hot natured and it's very comfortable in that aspect. I really like the mattress and the price, just wish it wasn't so firm.  Seems to be very good quality material.
 I purchased this mattress based on the reviews. It was the first mattress I purchased for my use online. The quality is excellent. The mattress does tend to be firm, yet very comfortable. It is delivered rolled up in the box and needs to be given time to expand. My experience was the mattress fully expanded quickly. It was delivered in the late afternoon and I slept on it the same night.  I was concerned I might be sore after sleeping on the new mattress, but I wasn't.
 This is the best sleep I’ve had in years. It’s comfortable, cool and great on pressure relief. I’ve had lifelong issues with muscle cramps and this pillow seems to absorb them providing instant relief!<br/>My only slight issue is that my deep fit sheets and mattress covers required “suspenders” to keep them in place.<br/>Love it!
 The price is great but I'm not a fan of this mattress while cooler than my other it's just hard. After having this mattress for several months I still just don't like it
 With so many new online companies selling there different matresses was a tough choice, but decided to purchase from tuft and needles as was on a budget, but still looking for a quality mattress and sooooo glad I did. I just love it and the company, who really have outstanding customer service. So for me the matress by itself was a little too firm and was causing some mild pressure points pain when sleeping on my sides. But I loved the support it offered so I reached out to them and they responded quickly and sent me a free topper incredibly fast out to me. It's made out of their softer top layer foam so adds a little more softness, but still is supportive and which made this bed just perfect for me. I absolutely love going to bed now and wake up not wanting to get up as its just so comfy. And I wake up just feeling amazing with zero aches and pains and back pain is no more. Highly recommend!<br/>Only con is wish I purchased this mattress sooner!
 It is soft and was very Cool and comfortable the first 6 months however the mattresses has become so soft it is now causing back and hip pain in me and my fiancé. We are going to get a firm topper now.
 Everyone who has ever slept on this mattress raves about how they should have bought it in the first place.<br/><br/>I looked through a bunch of reviews and decided to buy one for myself.<br/><br/>I have never slept better!
 I shopped around for a while to find a bed that would help with my back pain. This is the best bed I’ve ever had!! Not to soft. Not to hard. Supports my back really well!! I love my bed and it is a great value for the money!! Wish all beds in house were like this. Have to wait for them to wear out more. I tell everyone about this bed!!
 I just purchased this mattress, I have heard such wonderful things about it!! 🙂 I have slept on my mattress for 2 nights now, I am so sad to say this but, I don’t like it so far.😞 i have woke up several times throughout the past 2 nights. I know that it says the mattress needs a few days to fully inflate but, as time goes on it seems to be getting harder... I think this mattress is going to be to “hard” for me. I will give the mattress a honest and fair chance though and “update” soon
 Love the mattress. It is definitely on the firm side, but at the same time the top layer feels plush. Hard to explain but it feels great. It is totally silent and doesn't transfer movement over to my wife, who often goes to sleep earlier than I do. We both knock out easily on this thing, it's just so comfortable. Very little sinkage, and good support. Big improvement over my old spring mattress. Looking forward to enjoying it for many years.
 I love love love this mattress, the absolute BEST investment. I bought the twin XL for my semi truck. Driving 70 hours a week I need good sleep, now I sleep all night and wake up with no pain or soreness. I had a Sealy mattress before this one I bought for 700. This Tuft needle mattress is 100 times better at 1/2 the cost. I’m buying my daughter the queen size soon.
 Really love the company and the concept; the shipping process is amazing too. But this mattress just doesn't cut the mustard unfortunately. I was planning on getting it as a temporary solution to replacing my old mattress until I'm ready to get a king, but it's just too soft to be supportive even on a temporary basis.
 If you live in an apartment building without an elevator be sure to ask a friend for help carrying it up the stairs...the box is a bit heavy and weight is unevenly distributed...which made things interesting.  Aside from that, very cozy mattress...and very easy to setup.
 Been using mine for about 6 months now and it is holding up great. It gives me great rest. It feels a little too squishy when sitting on the edges so making it not a useful seat.
 Day 1 and l am sold. l have not wanted to get out of bed all day.<br/>It inflated straight out of the box. I did not measure it but it feels like like was fully inflated after about 10 minutes. I have it on a box spring, so it makes my bed feel high which i like.<br/>I did not notice much if a smell.<br/>The comfort is half way between a firm and a soft mattress. Just right as the 3 bears say.<br/>Happy with my purchase.
 This is a REALLY comfortable mattress to sleep on, however the memory foam has no structure around the matress edge.  If you sit on the edge it completely collaspes and if you roll over or sleep close to the edge it collaspes.  Very easy to fall off the bed.  If I had to do this over again I would have returned it but I waited too long because it is so comfortable and I thought I would get use to the edges.  I plan to put it in my guest bedroom and find another matress.
 23 FEB 2016 UPDATE: (1star updated to 2 stars for Amazon's willingness to address my issues)<br/><br/>Amazon has agreed there is a problem with the bed and has offered a refund after inspection. I appreciate that Amazone has acknowledged and issue and is willing to resolve it even after the 30 day guarantee.<br/><br/>I still maintain the following:<br/><br/>1 - Buy this bed directly from Tuft and Needle for the following reasons<br/>a) 100 day no questions asked LOVE it or RETURN it. (Amazon offers 30 days)<br/>b) No need to return the mattress if you don't love it. Tuft and Needle asks you DONATE it<br/><br/>2 - If you are a HOT sleeper (meaning you create all your own heat at night) and you like a firm mattress, DO NOT BUY THIS BED.<br/>Foam mattress get softer with heat. If you love a soft bed, this is the bed for you.<br/><br/>I must say that after reading all the reviews (good and bad) and after hearing the rave reviews from my coworkers who vary in size from model skinny to never seen the inside of a gym AND after waking up every morning in pain on a 2 year old spring mattress, I decided to give T&amp;N a try. Well, I can honestly say my wife LOVES this mattress. She cannot wait to get into bed and she sleeps so soundly throughout the night. On the other hand, I cannot sleep more than 3 hours and I wake up with the worst back pain I've ever had (and I used to sleep on futon years ago). I'm 6', 200lbs, a 70's child and like some other reviewers, I have a bit of a mid section.<br/><br/>I read the review by T.King (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T11K3MYSLRE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00QBZ2BX2&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=1057794&amp;store=furniture) and was hopeful that the issue was indeed a fluke mattress. Their review however, does not seem to be the only one with similar problems.<br/><br/>We are now just over a month into our new mattress from T&amp;N and there is already a centerline firmness forming where we don't sleep. My side is noticeably less firm than the middle and my wife's side is just slightly less firm than the middle. At night, I get in bed and I am comfortable, it's only after a few hours does the pain set in and I wake up having to force myself out of bed and onto the floor to stretch, take pills, anything to get relief.<br/><br/>I really really want to love this product but I cannot sleep and waking with back pain is not an option.<br/><br/>One final thought. I was in Phoenix around Christmas and noted there was a T&amp;N store in town. We called in hopes we could stop by and check out the mattresses, but they were closed on Saturday. Would have been nice to test drive the mattress while in town.
 I tried to like it, I really did. It's a quality mattress (which is why I'm giving it 4 stars) that I think will hold up for 10 years but it's a bit too firm for my taste. And I like firm. I gave it 7 days and went back to my old mattress which is a pillow top but not enough back support. Mattresses are a personal preference so you may like it. The thing is, this is gonna be my main mattress so I need it to be comfortable. I need to find a firm pillow top. I toss and turn a lot. Lets hope the refund process is smooth.
 I've had this mattress for just over 2 months and I'm pretty happy. It is slightly firm, but every night I jump into this bed i'm happy. Its not a super soft mattress that envelops you in a cloud, but my back pain from my previous mattress has gone away. I'm about 160lbs, my gf is 115lbs, and my dog is 20lbs and we all sleep soundly on this.
 I purchased a full mattress last april and have found it very comfortable provided I sleep on one side or the other.  There seems to be a stiffer area down the center.  It has not been a serious problem, though sometimes I would prefer sleeping in the middle.  Am planening to buy another full mattress for my Florida home and have read a review or two that described tuft and needle mattress as hot. Together with the extra firmness down the center, am wondering whether there might be a better choice.  Suggestions appreciated.
 This mattress is the TRUTH!!! I was totally skeptical about ordering a mattress online without being able to try it first, but the high ratings and 100-day guarantee convinced me to give it a shot.<br/><br/>I was super confused when the mattress arrived -- and it came way before the shipping window they gave me, BTW -- because the box for the king-sized mattress I ordered was SMALL. But I didn't watch the video explaining how they pack it. After we got it out of the box and cut it out of the shrink wrap, BAM!, there it was at full size in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>I laid on this thing and I promise I have never enjoyed lying down so much! It's super comfortable, firm but not hard. Then my husband laid down next to me. I know this because I saw him -- NOT because I felt him. I felt nothing. He is 6'1". It was awesome.<br/><br/>At no point have I regretted this purchase. This mattress is more affordable than the competitors. I have already recommended it to any of my friends in the market for a new mattress. Trust me: A great night's sleep is a click away. I didn't know what I was missing.
 My husband is heavy and I am light. We needed a new mattress since our old one was giving him such back pain. We tried several from sams and had to bring them back. They were too firm. Felt like I was sleeping on the floor. But we didn't want something too soft and not supportive.  We gave this a try and it's great for the price.  It's been three months and so far we are still good.
 People commented that it did not have a smell, and it did.  However, it was not really strong and was gone by the 3rd day.  It only took a couple of hours for it to completely expand.  It is firmer than I was expecting, but I am getting used to it.
 Never wrote a review before but this bed is that good....was a little firm at first but after a few weeks or month it got perfect or my body just adjusted now its perfect firm but soft on top ....back feels great in the morning after years of stiffness. Also sleeping better when wife moves and no more rolling into each other and fighting for the middle dip. When I first got it I put a topper seemed to trap more heat so i took it off and can say it sleeps cool and i live in Hawaii. I also got it on black friday or some sale and paid like 600 bucks price cant be beat.  My friend bought a $2500 bed and still trading it out because it not comfortable.....buy this bed and save money but still sleep like your rich Neighbor !!!!!!
 Wonderful mattress that I love.  This bed is comfortable and allows me wake pain free.  I bought this with the Classic Brand Adjustable base and I have had the most wonderful nights sleep in years.  When the bed was first released, there was a smell, but the smell was gone after 2 hours or so.  The big measures out the dimensions of a king.  So far, I have had no trouble with the bed!
 Very surprised on how awesome this mattress is. Arrived very fast, within days of ordering. Easy setup after reading directions. I didn’t notice any chemical smells. I will buy this again when the other mattresses need replacing. It was a bit firm for the first 2 weeks then softened up. Still very supportive after 4 months.
 Love my new mattress!  First decent sleep in years!!  I've had this mattress since December 2017, and it's my favorite place to be in my house..... I know - spare me, right - It's all I can do to keep my teens out - ha ha....  It's well priced as I was prepared to pay a lot more for a decent bed.
 I'm so glad I decided to try the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress .. Such an easy set up.. Took it out of the box , laid it on the bed and removed the plastic and it rolled out and expanded immediately..  No odors at all.. I've been sleeping on it for almost 2 months and the most comfortable I've slept in a long time..I've heard others say it was too firm  but I like a mattress that you're not sinking into and no impression in the mattress when you make the bed..  I really believe I couldn't have found a more comfortable mattress anywhere.. I'm certainly enjoying mine.. Thanks T&amp;N for a great nights sleep..
 We have purchased two Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses so far. Our daughter loves hers, and our king is phenomenal. No unnecessary movement when rolling about. More comfortable than I expected. Price is amazing. Just do yourself a favour and buy one.
 Ordered this mattress for my toddlers first big girl bed and it is, by far, the most comfortable mattress in our house. We will be getting 2 more to replace the rest of the mattresses we have. There was absolutely no strong chemical smell like many of these type mattresses tend to have and you cannot feel the slats from the platform bed even without any type of box spring or cushion underneath. It is well worth the purchase.
 This is by far the best matress I have ever slept on. The first week or so I over slept big time, I did not want to leave this comfortable place, (good thing I don't have to go to work).<br/>Note: I have many physical ailments, after trying big name over priced matresses, to soft, to firm even with a foam topper. T&amp;N is soft on top and just the right firm inside. I have been telling all my family and friends to get one, it's that good.
 I am really glad to have purchased this item.  I am very happy to finally have a good nights rest without back pain.  I can turn side to side and the mattress conforms nicely to my back so there isn't any strain with the movements.  I am very pleased with the quality of this product.  Highly Recommended.
 Best bed I have ever slept on from five-star hotels to my sleep number. I fall asleep like a baby on this mattress and wake up refreshed.
 This may work for others but I found it way too soft. After the first night, I woke up with lower back and hip pains. The second day, I woke up with upper back and shoulder pain and a stiff neck. The pain continued throughout the week. I tried sleeping on my side (instead of back), my arms felt pinched and eventually went numb. I tossed and turned all night and missed work due to lack of sleep and pain. I am 5'1" and 124 lbs. the boyfriend is 6'3" and 162lbs, he slept fine. But, he also noticed the softness of the mattress.
 I waited a bit to review to be sure it lived up to the description.  We love it.  This is the most comfortable bed we've ever purchased.  Our previous bed was a $2400 name brand debacle, always had some aches and pains on waking and even though advertised as "cool foam" it wasn't.<br/><br/>This bed is perfect for sleeping in any position, back, side, face down.
 The best mattress, I have EVER purchased. I actually had to watch the unboxing YouTube vid, because the mattress seemed a bit smaller that normal, but as soon as I cut the plastic, the mattress quickly expanded to the size I purchased.<br/><br/>My lower back pain is GONE. The only caution I suggest is, be careful when sitting on the edge of this mattress, it is very likely you will slip off. But this is a purchase well worth the money. We will see how it holds up 2 yrs from now!
 It is a bit too firm for me. Nothing a mattress topper wont fix. Yet it is incredibly supportive, and sleeps cooler than my old memory foam mattress that had gone soft on me giving me back pain. Nice not to wake up with pain anymore, even if it is a little hard to get comfortable with this level of firmness. Its also bouncy, which is odd for memory foam, but I don't leaves glasses of wine standing on my bed.<br/><br/>And at $575, total bargain!
 It fully un-compressed as soon as it was opened. It did had a little odor when opened, but I was expecting that. We used a really light pad on top and between that and the sheets, there was no smell at all. I'm impressed! It is really comfortable. I thought at first it would be too firm ,but we absolutely loved it. We slept better than ever. It was a gift for my daughter who we were visiting and we used it for a week before swapping it to her bed (no second bed in her house). Even straight in the floor, it slept great!. We swapped it with her mattress when we left and now she loves it as well. As soon as the credit card is paid off again, we are ordering at least one more!
 Quality materials.  First was sent the wrong size had to return.<br/><br/>I like the look and the ease of setting up and the price.  Mattress has quality materials but was to hard/firm.  I could feel the hard foam on my knees laying down.  10” is kind of thin.  Bought a T&amp;N topper to go on top now is very comfortable.  Overall still cheaper than buying a mattress from a store.  I’m happy with it now.
 I was skeptical but I love it! I had a lot of questions before and after I bought it. I reached out to the company and they were quite helpful and very friendly.
 I was very skeptical purchasing a mattress online, my wife and I have bought several mattresses for 3 times the price and to our amazement this mattress delivers and is the best mattress out of the box that we have ever bought, I have had it for 4 weeks and we both love it
 Very comfortable and performs as well as more expensive options. Very glad I switched to memory foam with this product!<br/>PS- I stopped having collapsing/smushy/“weak” corner issues after about two weeks - the bed took about a week to fully sort itself out and get to full strength.
 This bed is great! It's a little more firm than I'm used to with my old mattress, but I would definitely buy this again. I have noticed a big difference in how rested I feel in the few weeks that I have had it. It was easy to take out of the package and set up. It's on the heavier side so you may need 2 people. With over 9,500 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, you're really not going to go wrong with this purchase!
 This is the second tuft and needle mattress i have purchased. The first one was so good i purchased this one. There is no better mattress on the market for the money. It is very comfortable and supportive. I see no reason to spend more money on other brands. Do your self a favor and get this mattress.
 Finally!<br/><br/>I've been searching for a good mattress for years.  I bought a new one about 6 months ago and already was in the market for another.  I have a bit of a bad lower back, and need a firm mattress to keep my spine straight.  Plush mattresses have my back curving awkwardly, leaving me feeling even worse in the morning.  I'm also a side sleeper.<br/><br/>But this mattress is perfect.  It's firm, but still soft somehow.  My first night of sleep on it was fantastic.  I see why the reviews are so high.
 First, I am not Vickie. I am her husband. I sleep, or try to, on one side of this mattress. It is just like the tempurtic (sp) mattress this one replaced, hard and HOT! The specifications said it did not get hot like the old type of foam mattress, but it does. My only hope for a good nights sleep on this hot box is a well padded mattress cover.
 It was overall a good experience but I would not recommend for one important reason, health.<br/><br/>After 5 months of use, my wife and I both have start to develop some sort and back pain. Her back pain become more serious these days. She decide to do a full general physical exam and one important suggest from the physician was to change the mattress.<br/><br/>I hope this is a personal issues and would not happen to others.
 Did my research on all the foam beds in a box, and this one came highly reviewed. Loved for the first two-three months...now it feels like it’s lost some of the support. Will try rotating it but was hoping it would have stayed a little more comfortable as when it first arrived. Seems to have indentations from where we sleep which is maybe going to happen with all foam mattresses. Wanted to give 5 stars but not quite there
 This is the greatest bed I have ever slept on. My wife and I got this bed over 6 months ago and it is still the most comfortable bed we have ever had.  It makes staying away from home hard because you will miss your bed.<br/><br/>We sleep better than before, it doesn't get hot in summer. It seems to be pretty durable.
 I’ve been sleeping on this mattress for about 2 months, and I’ve been very pleased. I used to wake up with back pain everyday, and now I don’t. My boyfriend and I both sleep comfortably. While the edge support isn’t fantastic, my boyfriend is able to sit at the edge without feeling like he’s going to fall off. Some nights I get hot but it’s sporadic so I don’t think it’s primarily the fault of the mattress. I prefer former mattresses, and it’s the perfect firmness for me.
 Best mattress I have ever owned hands down. I have gotten more and better sleep since owning it than I have ever had in my life. I could lay in bed all day. Not only that but I hurt my back in the military and since using this mattress I have had less back problems and more motivation to go to the gym everyday. Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle!
 I’ve given this mattress about 7 months chance. I have not gotten good sleep since I’ve had it :( my husband can’t even sleep in the same bed with me because it’s so firm. I’m pregnant and all of my pressure points hurt. Just purchased a mattress topper, I hope it helps. :(
 but it still smells after 4 months use
 First of all, my Tuft &amp; Needle arrived 2 days early which was super exciting. I've only slept in it one night so far but OMG it's so comfy. I had around five different dreams last night and woke up so refreshed. Nothing can bring me down now! I will say that I wish the edges were a little bit more firm for when you sit at the end of the bed but that's my only critical comment. This mattress rocks!
 I like a little firmer bed, my wife likes really soft beds. It's great for me, she didn't care for it too much.<br/>If you like a little firmer, but need something to form to your body and support your lower back, etc. This is a great product. If you like a ridiculously soft bed, then this might not be cushy enough for you.
 I unpacked the mattress and left it alone for over 3 days to settle into it's shape. The mattress is still a couple inches smaller than the posted dimensions and there is a permanent depression along the crease where the mattress was folded and rolled. You can clearly see the depression as well as feel it.<br/><br/>I have yet to sleep on the mattress because I am hoping it will correct itself, but doesn't seem to be the case. I have contacted their customer service but have not received any feedback yet.
 Was looking online for a modestly priced mattress as a student, and T&amp;N has the best prices for twin than anywhere else. It really was as simple as getting the box, opening it up and removing plastic, and seeing it "inflate." It's very comfortable, I'll probably get a mattress topper eventually for more structure, but I've really enjoyed it thus far and I'm so relieved I'm getting my money's worth
 This is a very good mattress for the price, our only complaint is both the stability on the edges and even after a month of use it is still a little too firm throughout. Looking at the topper that is mentioned with this as a possible fix but not sure about the quality of that.
 I was really hesitant to purchase a mattress without trying it, but no regrets whatsoever. After 4 months, I can still say this is the most comfortable mattress I’ve owned.<br/>I no longer wake up with a sore back.<br/>Bought 3 of these, one for me and 2 Queens for each of my kids. We all love them
 This is written after only one night on the new mattress.<br/>Came in 5 ft box wrapped and rolled very well. Easy to remove and unwrap, inflated immediately, no strong smells after leaving to air for about 8 hours. Set up with new mattress pad and fresh clean sheets...slept like a baby. Woke myself up snoring several times. No low back pain but had a very hard time making myself get up and out of bed (LOL). This is a 10 inch mattress and I have it sitting on a 14" frame and it's the perfect height. It does feel very soft to the touch like some of the other reviews state but it's really sturdy and medium firm when you put your entire body weight on it. My husband and I are both 6ft+ and both over 200 lbs so it was important that the mattress be durable and supportive for both our weights and size.<br/>If any of my opinions change in the future, I will update my review so that you all know the truth.
 I love this mattress. I have back injuries - severely herniated L4-5/L5-S1 and arthritis in my neck. I loved my old mattress but it was way too firm for my husband and he was always complaining about his hips hurting. He hardly ever could sleep through the night and was up and down. I admit, too, that while I liked the old mattress, sometimes I felt like it was just too firm...even for me. I talked him into trying this mattress since it's only $600 and there's a money back guarantee for 30 days....it was totally worth a try. Our last mattress was $1300 and that's a lot of money to spend on something that is hurting you!<br/><br/>So we bought it. At first, after the first night or two, I thought we might have made a mistake. I strangely woke up with pain my right knee that seemed to be coming down the leg and probably originating from my herniated disc area. I had never had pain upon waking in my right leg...it was on my left side that I had trouble because the herniation lay just slightly to that side and aggravated that nerve. My back, however, felt great. After about 3 days, the pain went away. I'm not totally sure, but after all that I'd been through with my back, all I could think of was that this bed served to support my back properly and allow it to re-align which took the pressure off the right side and transferred some to the left. My whacked out theory I know, but it's hard to explain in a review post. Anyway, the pain ultimately subsided and it has been AMAZING ever since. I'm SO glad we bought it. I actually sleep better on it than the old one (which is now in the guest room) and coupled with a new contoured memory foam pillow, my back and neck problems are gone. I don't wake up in the morning sore. I don't have an ache in my lower back/hip and my neck feels so much better! I always slept tensely in other mattresses, like I was trying to hold myself in a certain position because the bed didn't support me correctly. This one is the perfect blend of firmness for support and softness for comfort! Even from the first night, I could feel my body truly "sink" into the mattress and my muscles actually felt like they were taking the night off.<br/><br/>Best of all, and probably the most important...my husband sleeps ALL NIGHT. He hasn't complained about hip pain since we got the mattress, in fact he's commented that he feels great in the mornings. I read so many reviews before buying this mattress and all I saw were positive things. I hate how mattresses are so expensive that you almost have to take out a loan (some people do I think!), but this one is affordable and feels awesome. I couldn't talk this mattress up any more. I love the premise of the company and I love that I could order it with free shipping and it arrived in just a few days.<br/><br/>If you're in the market for a mattress, let me tell you....take the plunge and try this one. It's totally worth it. And if, for some reason, you find that it isn't for you (but it probably will be), then you can get your money back within 30 days and they'll tell you to just go donate the mattress. If you're suffering from back, hip, neck, overall skeletal issues...this mattress is FOR YOU! Take it from someone who is very active, but has real injuries (not just your typical soreness). This mattress allowed me to really relax during my sleep and in turn, that helped my body rest and feel so much better in the mornings. I have slept in it for about 3 weeks now and every day I love this mattress more.<br/><br/>I love this mattress.Did I say I love it? :)
 I'm sad to be returning this mattress.  It is very comfortable and convenient to ship to you, but it sleeps too hot for my liking.  It's my first foam mattress and frankly now I'm afraid to buy another, because if this one is supposed to not retain heat (according to Consumer Reports) I can only imagine how hot the other ones are.  I'll buy a traditional inner-spring mattress.
 Just got the mattress, may actually end up loving it, but this negative review is regarding the horrible packaging by Amazon.  The mattress was not in a box and there was no manufacturer documentation included.  It was simply the compressed mattress rolled up in another outer layer of plastic.  There was even a hole in the packaging all the way through to the mattress.
 Was very wary until I read article in This Old House about the company.  Can't go wrong with 30 return policy. It says to put where it going to be and you had better or else. The second I broke the seal it exploded like a life raft. My bad. It took me a couple of nights to get used to "firmness".<br/>Not hard but I am used to a 10 year old mattress with memory foam topper so it is not mushy.  I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!!!!!!! I tell everyone that you can get a good mattress for $500.  Awesome. Can't say enough.<br/>Thanks Tuft &amp; Needle for great product.
 We were excited to try this mattress bc of all the reviews we read. Unfortunately we had to return the mattress because it was not comfortable. The memory foam didn’t feel like “memory” foam at all, just a piece of foam. My husband suffers from back and neck pain so a good mattress is very important to us. I was waking up with back pain after sleeping on this. There was no memory feeling to it at all. We previously had a queen size icomfort that we absolutely loved and was trying to find something for our king a little cheaper, I guess u get what u pay for! We are defiantly going back to either an icomfort or tempurpedic mattress.
 My boyfriend call it the evil bed because the moment he lays down he’s alseep. It almost calls you. I waited at least 6 months before I reviewed and I have to say I love this mattress. It’s comfortbale and breathable, I sleep hot and didn’t have any issues.  Set up was easy and it fill the bed frame w/o issue.
 This didn’t work well for my wife and I. It’s certainly not terrible, but the lack of structure and squishy yet firm feel doesn’t work and if you sleep near the side, it will sink in. Overall it just kind of feels cheap. My wife is a back sleeper and I’m a side sleeper. I honestly don’t think foam only, no matter the maker, is for us. Back to trying them out in store and then hunting for the best deal.
 Slept on it for about 5 months now. I find it to be very comfortable. Just the right amount of firmness. My wife has had several spine surgeries and also likes it. Setup was easy - just heavy. Inflated pretty quick. Did have an off gassing smell but resolved pretty quickly.<br/><br/>My only real complaint at this point is that I bought at $900 and saw it recently as a lightning deal for $550. That’s quite the difference.
 I had mixed reviews on this one. I initially had a softer bed and was struggling to figure out if I like this one or not, as it's slightly more firm but you sink into it. After a couple weeks, it grows on you. I sleep very well and any position is comfortable.
 it is the most comfortable bed we have had, we did put a heated mattress pad on it because we have no heat in our bedroom and the mattress was cool getting in and we are older..ha ha...we will buy another one when we are ready to replace the other mattress at our camp
 Owned it since October 2016 and love it. If I take off my covers the mattres still looks brand new, you would have no idea it has been used for nearly 2 years. As of now I’m T&amp;N for life!
 My wife and I have very different mattress preferences, and it has been difficult to find a bed that suits both of us.  We bought this mattress two months ago and it is amazing!  It is firm (which I like) but not hard. The top layer is soft without you "sinking" in.  I can't yet speak for durability (a huge issue that we've had in the past with foam mattresses that end up collapsing in), but we love it so far.  Would definitely recommend.
 After much debate and store to store searching, I decided to give this bed a try. Had nothing to loose. It was everything that I expected based on reviews and info from the mfgr.  It did not smell strong, fully expanded within a few minutes. I sleep comfortably, not hot at all. It didn't take away all of my aches and pains, but it sure helped!  I still wake up scrunched up on my side or stomach but not because the bed is not comfortable.  When it is time to buy a bed for the guest room, I will probably buy another one of these.  I am SO very glad I did not buy a bed from a store.
 Very convenient as it shipped right to my front door. However, I was lucky that there was an elevator to help me take it upstairs. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for me to carry the box as it is large, heavy and unwieldly.  Well packaged in layers of protective plastic wrap.  It was relatively easy for me to unwrap and maneuver the mattress onto the bed slats. Thankfully, the mattress emitted little to no odor (unlike my other $$$ memory foam mattress that stunk for days). Very comfortable, not too firm or too soft.
 I bought this mattress for our guest room but like it so much I'm going to have to get another one for me. I thought I already owned the best mattress in the world (it sure cost like it would be the best) but I have to be honest I like this one much better, and it's less than half the price.
 The description claims it's comfortable and cool.  It is a very comfortable mattress, but it sleeps hot.  We wake up several times a night in hot sweats, even over the winter in a 66 degree room.  The mattress retains heat, so the only way to get cooler is moving to a new spot.
 Buy this mattress! I'm a 60 year old disabled veteran with a real need for a mattress that won't exacerbate the pain I already deal with. I'm so grateful that I've found a mattress that fits my needs. I've only been awake for 15 minutes, and for the first time in I don't know how long, I'm not in pain. Here are some points that might help answer questions.<br/>1. I'm 6' 1" and 300lbs.  2. My mattress is a California King, and it's a titch large for my frame, but it's okay.  3. There's a slight odor with that it but not bad at all.  4. There is a cover that comes on the mattress that allows it to limit heat.  5. My mattress box was about 4 feet long, and about 2+2 feet wide on all sides.  5. The mattress weighs about the same as a Battleship, so if you need help, plan on asking for it.  6.  It takes about 3hrs to deploy fully before you can use it.
 Having had no issues on any bed mattress ever before we ordered a King T&amp;N. I had a restless night of discomfort and had intense shoulder and lower back pain upon waking and throughout the day. Now day 3 of the same and I have ordered a $200 mem foam topper. If that doesn't work, we will have to return. My husband has no issues.<br/>Too firm for me - On my side or back T&amp;F mattress pushes up my hips and shoulders which mis-aligns my spine and feels like my head/body is going down a hill. On my stomach it pushed up my chest. This mattress has no give, only push.
 This is a great mattress. Very firm and comfortable. I have bad arthritis in my nexk and Fibromyalgia. Other mattresses was unable to watch TV due to neck pain. This is so comfortable. Slept through the night which I have not done in years.
 This is a high quality mattress.  We bought it on Cyber Monday inadvertently - one of us touched the "buy with one click" but neither one admits to it.  Oops! But it showed up and we needed a new mattress so we have been sleeping on it nearly 3 months.  Right now I am on vacation and wishing I had the mattress they have in my Airbnb instead of the new Tuft and Needle. I have back neck and hip pain that seems as bad or worse when I wake each am.  If you like a form mattress with almost no give, buy this.  Otherwise, keep shopping.
 Great mattress! I typically don't care for memory foam mattresses, preferring a softer pillow top type mattress. But, this a comfortable, wonderful mattress. Shipping was fast and on time, and set up was easy as could be!
 This is the modern way to shop.  Great on-line reviews that I trust, fast shipping, product delivered to my door at a fraction of the cost of a 'brick and morter' store.  All this with a product that the 'brick and mortor' stores lead you to believe you must try in-store.<br/> Overall experience was excellent: super fast shipping, it required me to lug the mattress up to my bedroom and unpack (no big deal), was sleeping in it the next day.  Wife was super happy with the comfort level. The mattress is a combo of box spring and memory foam. Minimal ordor from the foam the first 24 hours. Still scratching my head why it took s so long to act!
 Got the mattress yesterday.  Let it puff up over night and put it in tonight over a Zinus SmartBase (B006MIUM20).  One word 'Awesome'.  The mattress is excellent quality, firm/soft and cool.  The base and the mattress work perfectly together, not a sound and plenty strong, two people and two small dogs, not a creek and perfectly fine.  Order one, you won't be disappointed.
 I wouldn't recommend this for side sleepers. It seems to be a little too firm for those folks.
 My old mattress wasn't that old but I developed back pain while training for a half marathon which was a first for me. After 2 mos physical therapy I was better but not 100%. My bf had this mattress and I realized I always slept better and didn't have pain at his place. Realizing love wasn't the cure, I bought my own and am a devoted customer! No pin and I'm well rested. Thank you T&amp;F for making great product at an affordable price!
 Wanted to offer a real review since there is a ton of fake ones on here. Comfortable mattress, comes in the box and expands when you cut off the plastic. Had it for a week already and it is great! we have it on the floor since we have bought a frame yet but at the same time you don't really need it. It is firm but not in a bad way. The best way to explain it is it is a memory foam with the memory- you won't be sunk in the position you sleep. Best part is the payment plan. totally gets 5/5 stars.
 the mattress did not expand all the way.  it is caved in the center. not what i was looking for.<br/><br/>Amazon and Tuft &amp; Needle have great customer service about this.  T&amp;N's social structure is everything i would want to be involved with (great customer service, community oriented, breaking the industry standards, social responsibility etc...just the actual product did not meet.
 Not very comfy, but I may have purchased the wrong mattress. I send an email to the company about their return policy, I love the way the bed looks and I wanted to try a different mattress but I never reciept a response. It definitely does not keep you cooler or promote air flow.
 Loving our new T&amp;N king mattress. It was fun to open and watch it expand. We let it air out a few hours before using but it didn't seem to need it!? No smell, perfectly firm right out of the box. It has been a dream to sleep on. It seems to be as firm as you need it. It curves to my hips in side lying position and is comfy on my back too. Hubby agrees. It molds to the body and bounces right back when we roll. Does not need a boxframe. We bought the Classic Brands Hercules Platform frame, a perfect match.
 Very comfortable! Had a typical smell for a day which was so surprise considering the bed came in a bag but it did not last long. It seems firm but give it a chance. I thought it was too firm but I have had the best nights sleep in this bed. I highly recomend! Although I bought this on Prime day I would pay full price for this mattress. It was well worth it!
 Omg, this mattress! It's the perfect combination of firm and soft. I literally stopped having back pain after the first night on this mattress. It stays cool, which is a bonus. I sleep more soundly and fall asleep quicker. I cannot say enough good things about this mattress. Good quality. Don't overpay for a mattress in a store. These are better than your typical premium in store mattress, and for much less!
 I have had this mattress for a little over three years. In the last two years, it has really became uncomfortable. I am now waking up daily with massive back and neck pain as is my husband.  The mattress was great for about a year then slowly started to sink which formed a hump in the middle.  This mattress would be great if it wasn’t a daily use thing.  I know it is the mattress that is causing the back and neck pain because if either of us sleep somewhere else, we do not wake up with the issues we wake up with after sleeping on this mattress.
 Wow! What a great night's sleep right out of the gate! Let it expand for 72 hours before sleeping on it and even though the manufacturer recommends giving it a week or two before you're fully adjusted to it, it was amazingly comfortable from the start and is still getting better! We couldn't be happier with this product a couple weeks in.
 Amazing! We love it. Felt a little firm at first for me, but I was wrong. It feels soft and firm and luxurious. Love the bed. My husband has a bad back, and he is very pleased with the purchase. And it's an amazing price! So thankful we got this bed.
 I want to like it.<br/>Pros- cost, service, seems like quality materials. Tuft &amp; Needle is very responsive.<br/>Cons- very firm for side sleeper. Unable to easily sit on the side of the bed. Support just isn't there and easily slip off. I know this is a small detail but worth noting.<br/><br/>I did contact to see about returning, it is is just too firm. They suggested I give it a couple weeks to soften, which I have (still firm). Additionally, they offered to send a free 2" topper to try. Nice gesture, I hope it works, as I am using this in an adjustable frame. Cannot imagine that boxing and shipping this mattress is an easy process. If this doesn't work I am buying in store. Will update after I try the topper.
 Well, I had purchased this because our old mattress that we bought with the Ikea bed was sooooo not comfortable.  I got this T + N based on the reviews and it took less than a minute and it was fully inflated. I slept on it the same night and OMG it was sooo comfortable - a bit stiff BUT I am sure it will loosed up a little and my back pain I have been having is all gone....SOOO nice to be able to roll out of bed and walk with no paim.  Price was GREAT also.
 I have heard really great things about this mattress but it just hasn’t been great for my husband &amp; I. We both wake up with back pain everyday. We tried to contact customer support but they said we had to contact amazon by March 15th but amazon said our return window had closed on Jan 31st. Wasn’t worth messing with to return. Will be looking for something to replace it with.
 Finally a wonderfully comfortable mattress at an affordable price. Soft and pliable, yet firm, ideal for side sleeping. Much more comfortable than the expensive "memory foam" mattress it replaced (and at a fraction of the cost!) Tuft and Needle also has great customer service -- followed up their shipment with an email to make sure I was satisfied. Great product!
 While this mattress did not change my life, it was definitely an improvement over the mattress I bought over a year ago. I like the firmness of the bed, but also the fact that the memory foam is able to provide comfort. I have mid to upper back pain problems so although I have had these issues for the past few years, this bed helps by providing more support than my less firm foam mattress.
 Love this mattress! It came in a well constructed box, so no damage to the contents from shipping.  It was fairly easy to move to the bedroom, unbox, and get it on the bed.  We open the vacuum seal about 2 in the afternoon and it was fine to sleep on for the night.  It did take about a week to get used to it and for it to fully expand, but it sleeps like a dream. We will be purchasing another for our daughter.
 Bed in a box!  Easy delivery, easy set up, and super comfy.  It's a little softer than I was expecting, as I read that the Tuft and Needle mattresses were some of the firmest foam mattresses on the market.  But after sleeping on it, I'm completely satisfied.  I recently bought a Sweetnight mattress which is actually firmer, but I think the Tuft and Needle is more comfortable.  Great buy!
 4-Stars because it's been a nice mattress, good construction, but as others have mentioned it is extremely firm (not medium). My wife likes a firm mattress and so she doesn't have a problem with it, but has also noted it is very firm. If I had it to do over I'd probably go with a different brand. If you like a firm mattress, this is probably for you.
 My wife and I needed a new queen mattress for a cabin we purchased. We have been sleeping on a Very expensive name-brand foam mattress for several years, so are a wee bit spoiled.  At least that's what we thought until sleeping on our Tuft &amp; Needle mattress!  This mattress is the best mattress we've had in the nearly 40 years we've been married!  To top it off, it costs about 1/4 what our high-end mattress cost...  If you're looking for a great mattress look no further!  By the way, my wife weighs about 115 and I weigh about 235 and we are both absolutely comfy sleeping on this mattress!
 Too firm for my tastes and I miss my memory foam. I have a Queen size Temperpedic cloud. I bought a king size tuft and needle mattress in May when moving. Initially it was ok but now I find my arms falling asleep and now I can barely get to sleep as it is not comfortable at all. So now I have to figure out how to possibly fit it in a box and return to Amazon. If you have used a cloud you will NOT be happy with tuft and needle. I'm leery to try another company and will be investing in a tempurpedic king size cloud luxe.
 We've only had 3 sleeps on this mattress but so far we are LOVING it. It keeps my normally very warm husband a more reasonable temperature and I am sleeping very soundly. I don't feel his frequent movements anymore and because I'm sleeping so soundly, I don't hear his snoring. Maybe he's not snoring at all but I don't know! (Yay!)
 I've purchased 2 tuft and needle mattresses in the last 2 years, 1 for my husband and myself and 1 for my grandma. We each love it! 1 sits on a box spring and 1 sits on a sheet of plywood, both are good. The 1 on the plywood is more firm. My grandma rarely sleeps in any bed willingly, but she'll sleep in this bed every night.
 I kept hoping I would get used to how it felt. Well I just went over the 100 nights accidentally so I’m stuck with the mattress and both my girlfriend and I hate it. I wish I could say otherwise because we were really excited to buy a tuft and needle mattress because the company is very cool. But I can’t get around the fact that I wake up sore on this mattress EVERY DAY.
 love love love love love love OMG love it. No more back aches. And no more dead arms for side sleepers! WHY didn't i try this earlier! It seems to be about 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch narrower than regular mattresses. I tried it on 2 different beds and there is a slight gap. still love it tho.
 I was on the fence with this and the comprable Casper mattress.  I opted for the T&amp;N since it is significantly less expensive and has a great reputation.  After 2 nights I'm a huge fan.  The bed is extremely comfortable and just the right amount of firm for a side sleeper.  Moving from a spring mattress, this is a night &amp; day difference.
 For my initial impression skip to the bottom:<br/>We've had this mattress for 18 months now and it maintains it's density and shape like new, however I just discovered an issue.  I originally replaced my last mattress (A really expensive Serta pillow top) because it was close to 15 years old and I was waking up with back pain.  I got this mattress and it felt terrific when falling asleep, but I was still waking up with back pain.  I thought it was due to my being overweight, as my fiancee has no issues.  And as I've been steadily losing weight and getting into shape, that condition has not improved.  We just got home from a weeks vacation and the first thing I noticed after the very first night in the resort was no back pain.  For the past week, I got the best sleep I've had in a decade.  Last night we got home, and sure enough, I woke up this morning feeling like someone beat me with a bar of soap in a sock.<br/>I don't know if it's just because this thing is F-I-R-M or what, but unless you like a really, REALLY hard mattress, give this guy a pass.  I can't believe it took me a year and a half of terrible sleep and pain to realize the mattress was too bloody hard.  Time to find a new mattress again.... :(<br/><br/>Initial impressions, since it just arrived today:  It was packaged very well, and easy to handle for the weight (I live on the second floor).  It unpacked easily and all that plastic stripped off without a fight.  It was SUPER compressed, so we were a bit concerned about needing to sleep on it tonight, but it inflated quickly and seems to be at full height and density within 2 hours.<br/>There are NO weird odors.  No odors of any kind.  I sort of expected some kind of smell from new foam, but it's very neutral.  It was also easy to position on the frame and easy to lift corners to put on sheets.<br/>I'll update this review after we've slept on it for a bit, but so far, two thumbs up.
 I've heard all the stories about how a new mattress was too hot, too soft, too hard etc.  The first night with a KS Tuft &amp; Needle I didn't even feel the mattress.  My old, old mattress cradled/restrained me in a valley but the T&amp;N lets me roll all around.  Have to learn to not roll around looking for my old comfort zone.  I would definitely buy this brand again.  2 months in, I'll report status after a year or sooner if problems
 This is my first time buying a mattress online. I was deciding between Casper and Tuft &amp; Needle and after comparing all the facts that are important to me and my family, purchased two mattresses from TN for my weekend home. They arrived in a famous box 😃 Within minutes I had them both installed on the bed frame and it was fun doing it. The mattresses look and feel awesome! Great shopping experience.
 just bought to be the first bed we have for our new home in FL - so easy to assemble - love the "non-toxic" contents &amp; the bed was great to sleep on!! I added a topper that was on sale at Macy's from reading the reviews and it's great. I bought the 14 in frame from amazon &amp; love the whole thing - great purchase:)
 All I can say is all other mattress makers should just bow out of the game...this thing is legendary. I want to yell “murica” every time I tuck in for the night and feel the tingle of pure bliss pulsate through my body...if you’re getting a distinct sensual vibe from this review...good...because there is nothing more sensual than a good nights sleep. Just buy it, it’s amazon if you don’t love it you can return it. #amazon4life
 I have been waking up in the absolute worst pain ever since trying to sleep on this, and I do mean trying. I haven’t had more than 3 hours each night (thanks Fitbit tracker) from tossing and turning. Absolutely miserable. In my lifetime I have slept on countless floors, fold-out couches, summer camp metal bunk beds with 1 inch padding &amp; sleeping bags, a college dorm bed —- ALL were better in comparison to Tuft &amp; Needle’s “mattress.”<br/>Seriously. I was so stoked at the reviews and then the price &amp; thinking this would be the bed of dreams. If you are reading this and wondering “that price seems too good to be true for these reviews” your gut feeling is right. Do not buy the hype. Pay more and buy a something else. This is NOT worth the time and money. 3 nights was more than enough pain in trial.<br/><br/>This was my first foam mattress experience and I kept seeing concerns about being hot while researching. I have never experienced this on other mattresses before, but I quickly understood about a bed sleeping hot with this. This bed had me even more uncomfortable from heat.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this is Tuft &amp; Needle's customer service. It is PHENOM. I called about getting this returned and Tuft &amp; Needle offered to send me a free topper, which was appreciated, but it didn't "fix" this mattress at all for me.  I still slept hot, tossed &amp; turned, and woke up in pain.<br/><br/>Regarding the "free return &amp; pick-up" in the 100 day trial.  Since I ordered through Amazon, Tuft and Needle said Amazon would handle this &amp; assured me that they would pick it up.  When I contacted Amazon, they insisted that they absolutely DO NOT handle mattress returns and that I would have to arrange that on my own.  The pick up was a major factor in ordering a mattress online for me.  I called back to Tuft &amp; Needle and relayed this, and they arranged for a pick up immediately, but confirmed since I purchased through Amazon, it should have been arranged through Amazon and that Amazon is inconsistent with what they are telling customers on this.
 My wife is very picky about mattresses.  She chooses hotel that she knows has good Mattresses (typically Hamptons).  She loves this bed.  Works great with adjustable frame.  I would describe this as, not firm, but medium.  (We had tried another bed that was soft at the top, but too hard otherwise.)
 Update: Several months later, the bed is permanently depressed on one side :-( Very disappointing after such a great initial experience. One month review: I will never accept free items or discounts in exchange for my review, period. So, I waited one month to post this review. The first day I slept on it, I about sent it back, but I read all of the reviews telling me that it softens over a few weeks. I found this to be true. I originally ordered a similar mattress from Costco and after waiting two weeks with no shipment, I cancelled and ordered this one. It arrive within two days in a tall, skinny box. Some reviewers reported off-gassing, but I experienced none and I am sensitive to chemical smells. Once I took it out of the box, it popped into shape within about 30 minutes. The first night it was way too firm, hard surface, but I hung in there and sure enough, about nine days later, it was perfect. I can't say enough good things about this mattress. I own a Tempur-Pedic mattress and while the T&amp;N is very close, it is not equivalent overall. However, cost is a factor and I could have purchased many T&amp;N mattresses for the one Tempur-Pedic I own. I see why T&amp;N won Consumer Reports best mattress category. I would buy it all over again. Highly recommend!
 I was initially thrilled with the mattress. Good price and good product after less than a year, it has started to form permanent indentions. It is now causing back problems as I am being rolled into the indentions in the bed.
 He's beds are awesome! I have never slept better in all my years and I am 43 now. Cannot rave enough about that. This will be the first summer that will experience whether not it is cooling or not but it does not seem to reflect some of the heat so far. Keeping fingers crossed for this upcoming summer here in New York
 The Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress exceeded my expectations! Its just the right combo of Firm and Soft. Love the new shipping method too! Just open up the box and let your new mattress expand into sleeping bliss.
 I have been sleeping on the mattress for about 2 weeks now, and it's just a little more firmer than what I am used to. I do sleep on my side which is why this may be more noticeable to me. One of the great things about it is it is incredibly cool, and keeps my body comfortable throughout the night. Also delivery and installation of the mattress was great! Will give it a little longer to decide on a final verdict but for the price it seems like a great value mattress.
 I love it so much! This was my first king-size bed, and I'm so happy I got it. This brand is remarkably less expensive than Purple, which sells their kings for $1,299! On top of that, it's so comfortable. I never have a moment of trouble falling asleep, and staying asleep.
 Purchased for my adult son. He loves his new mattress. He opened it in the afternoon and was able to sleep on it that night. I was worried about a possible chemical smell that other bed in the bag reviewers have stated. There was no smell at all! It comes in a big box, which I would suggest having 2 people around to make moving it into your location easier. Great purchase!
 Arrived on schedule, well-packaged and protected.  It is heavy, but get the box to where the bed is located and unwrap.  It is a very comfortable, substantial mattress.  And that's what I was looking for - not some air mattress thing that won't stay on the bed frame.  It is solid.  Very happy with this purchase!
 I cannot say enough about this mattress.  I heard about it on a Facebook sponsored post (they work!), then I searched and read about this company's entrepreneurial spirit, which is near and dear to my heart.  But admittedly, the price is what drove me at first.  The other advantages that were noted, the coolness, the firmness resonated as well.  It shipped on time, the container was as described.  Any 'smell' that was referenced was non-existent to my husband and I.  We put it right on top of our existing box springs and have slept like babies every night since.  It is just the right amount of firmness for us, we don't 'sink' into it, it's cool all night long.  I honestly think about going back to bed that night every morning when I wake up:)
 After one month, I can say with confidence that it gave me the best night's sleep in thirty years. I even stopped waking up with back chronic pain several times a night. Good-bye box springs and traditional mattress.!I already ordered another one for the guest room
 Great mattresses! I bought two twins for my kids. They are super comfy and I couldn't smell any off gassing at all. They both sleep really well on these. When I need a new one I will be getting a T&amp;N too.
 Best sleep i have had in a long time. Never going back to an innerspring matress. Just the right amount of bounce. I used to have to roll over side to side through the night to relieve pressure points. I can sleep through the night in one position. Love this mattress. I am a large man 6'5" 260lbs.
 I have been sleeping on this mattress for a little over a month. Started out very comfortable, but now I am starting to have hip and shoulder pain on the side I sleep on. I have read some reviews where others are buying the T&amp;N topper. This is where the disappointment comes in, as why should I have to spend an additional $150.00 on a topper to provide the comfort the mattress should have provided in the first place.
 This mattress is a lot like the Casper we have been sleeping on for the past year. We bought this mattress for our toddler when she outgrew her toddler bed and she loves it. We have noticed that there are not any hot spots and it just just as comfortable (so far) as our Casper mattress. We would definitely purchase this mattress again. Great price, speeding shipping, high quality product.
 Very sad about this mattress, if I sit or sleep to close to the edge I feel like I'd fall off, seems like a mattress topper, than a stand alone one. It isn't uncomfortable, but it isn't great. The price was good for a king size...but not worth not being able to use the size of the bed (the edges aren't supported enough). I'm going to need a return. Bummer, because I had heard great things.
 I have been eyeing this mattress for a long time and finally bought it.  A breeze to put it on my bed and let it adapt for a few minutes. I love it; it's perfect support; not to firm and not too soft.  I'm so glad I bought it!
 Hate this mattress! I read such rave reviews about it and spend the money on it. It’s so soft, my back hurts. I’m a big girl. When my toddler lays in bed with me, she rolls into the depression made by my body! I want to return the mattress and want my money back. How do I do this? My 100 days are not up.
 I think sleeping on a hardwood floor would be more comfortable. This mattress is a nightmare for side sleepers, back sleepers, and basically anyone who wants to sleep. I have had this mattress longer than the 100 day trial or else I would absolutely return this sad product. Save your money and go see a quality massage therapist or chiropractor instead.<br/>-This review was written by the spouse of this amazon user.
 So far so good.  The mattress is a lot firmer then I would have expected a "foam" mattress to be.  The first couple inches conform to you body, while underneath that the foam stays pretty firm.  There is no bounce to it either, so I can just move/sit/whatever on one end, and the person on the other end doesn't really feel anything.  Takes a little getting use to if you haven't had foam mattresses before, but I definitely like it, and while I usually suffer some insomnia and lots of twisting and turning all night, I have definitely noticed better sleeping schedule, so yeah... that's a big plus.
 Have had the bed for just 2 months. So far it's great. I did have to put a thin layer of foam on top. I like a firm yet cushiony bed.  It's our guest room bed and everyone that has come over ranging from different sizes has complimented us on that mattress
 The mattress arrived after two days which was great.<br/>Though I ordered the queen size, it was delivered to my door step, in a box roughly 2x2x5 so it was easy to maneuver, bit heavy though.<br/>There was a slight chemical order as it is a new mattress but an hour after opening the wrapping, I couldn't smell it unless I stuck my nose right onto it.<br/><br/>The big deal: Comfort level.<br/>It is absolutely amazing; I sleep on my back or side and, thus far, either position feels amazing... no pain of any sort, just deep deep sleep.
 One thing first – I had to return the mattress because I had a backpain from it. So why the 5 starts. The service was really professional, got the money back and it all worked very well. Hence, you can order it really risk free.<br/>The mattresses is on the softer side. I am 190 pounds and my wife is 105 and we both had issues with it. Hence, don’t order it, if you prefer a medium to firm mattresses. I slept prior to this one on Casper and it was for sure firmer – and I did not weak up with pain in my back.<br/>You can try it out risk-free, but you should only do it, if you prefer a softer mattress.
 My son had a twin T&amp;N mattress. He liked it but complained about it being too small to sprawl out on. For his 12th Birthday, we got him the queen. He LOVES it! I put a mattress pad on it, and it's so comfy. I went to tuck him in the other night a fell fast asleep, too! Lol! Love T&amp;N! I would recommend them to anyone.
 It's firm and this is coming from a guy who has spent a lot of time sleeping on the ground. I've hiked over 6,000 miles and spent over 2 summers sleeping on the ground. As a result, I don't like normal mattresses, it's firm or GTHO (get the heck out). I initially bought the mattress because my girlfriend complained that my last foam mattress was too hot. This is cooler (in my opinion), but the girlfriend disagreed and said it was too firm. I thought long and hard about this and decided to get a new girlfriend as I really liked the mattress. I really hope the new girlfriend likes the mattress.<br/><br/>I want to be sure you know it's firm. So firm, that even I find it hard to sleep in any position but on my back. Yes, I added a plush mattress topper - it's really firm. I like it though.<br/><br/>How cool is it? It's hard to describe. I notice I use an extra blanket since getting rid of the old mattress. The old foam mattress was too damned warm and this is a nice change.<br/><br/>The thing you really want to know about is the key feature "Has bounce for night activities." I wouldn't call it bounce like in the old days of box springs, but it's definitely not the movement sucking black hole that my last foam mattress was. I notice on my downward thrust I don't lose all my kinetic energy, but I'm definitely not bouncing back up. This may be for the best, really.<br/><br/>A year later: Still very happy with the mattress. The firm feeling is still where I want it. My girlfriends are happy with it.<br/><br/>Three years later, it is now too firm.  I wake up each morning with a stiff upper back and feel unrested. Sadly, I have to replace it after a short tenure of 3 years. A shame. Until now, I really liked the mattress.
 Best mattress I've ever had. Put a ventilated foam pad on top of it to help stay cooler (live in FL) and have not noticed it being too hot. Nice and firm and compared to what I replaced about 100 times better. Wish I had room for King size. Would buy another one. Didn't take long at all for it to "unroll" and the initial smell was not anywhere near overpowering, just slightly noticeable at first but never a problem.
 I've had this bed for two months now and it is still good.  I have not had back problems since using it.  I am a heavy man and it is extremely comfortable for me.  I hate memory foam because I move too much and this bed is not memory foam it adjusts quickly when I move at night.  My wife loves it as well.  Took a few nights to get used to a completely different kind of mattress but even then it was great.
 Well I came home to find my mattress box on the porch. I slid it into the house and inspected the package for damage and there were gouges in the Box. I open the box and was surprised at the size I thought for sure they had inadvertently sent me a twin size. It was damage free. I unwraped the mattress and instantly could hear the rush of air as it started to grow, within probably 3 minutes it was inflated, it was amazing! A full-size queen mattress I can't wait to sleep on it!
 Best. Mattress. Ever. I was able to drag it up the stairs and get it situated on the bed by myself.  It didn't take long for any weird smells to off gas., and it has been the most comfortable thing I've ever laid on form day one. We've had it for about 5 months now and it is still just as comfortable as when it first arrived. It gets pretty hot here in the summer and it's actually been pretty cold here lately, but the amount of body heat the mattress retains is always perfect. Never too hot or cold.
 I use to sleep on spring mattress and I was getting back pain. Once I bought this, my pain disappeared. What I don’t like about this mattress is that the edges are not supportive. And this mattress gets HOT, which I hate!!!
 I also fall asleep just relaxing on this mattress. It has immediately solve two huge problems that I have struggled with for more than two decades. The constant flipping over from one side to the other. I WAS doing this as much as thirty times a night. (I know because I worked with a sleep center to keep track.)  In one night I am down to ZERO. Also, I could not lay on my back for a long time; now it is not a problem at all. After quite a bit of use, I am convinced that I am well on the way to resolving issues and returning to somewhat nornal existence.
 This mattress is just too firm for me. I've had this mattress for over a month which would normally be a pretty good adjustment period but it still isn't quite cutting it for me. I find myself tossing and turning more than I did on my old pillow-top coil mattress.<br/><br/>On Tuft and Needle's website, they offer 100-night hassle-free guarantee but yet they only offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on Amazon. I was dissapointed to find out about this since I had originally looked at their website before buying this and thought I had 100 days. It does leave me wondering as to why there is a difference though.<br/><br/>I have come to find out that Casper (a Tuft &amp; Needle competitor) offers a similar mattress except softer. If I can't make this mattress work for me, I may have to give them a shot.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Casper-Mattress/dp/B00XLNWXBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Casper Mattress</a>
 Almost every night, I'm tossing and turning because this mattress is way too firm for me. My shoulders, lower back and hips ache almost every morning. It's a nice mattress, but I can almost never get comfortable on it, or stay asleep for more than an hour at a time. I could usually sleep like a rock on my old mattress, but this one is miserable.
 I recently purchased the Tuft &amp; Needle 10-inch mattress to replace a 7 year-old traditional spring mattress. I hadn't truly realized how horrible my old mattress was until I replaced it with the Tuft &amp; Needle. I immediately began having more consolidated, restorative sleep, and the seemingly ubiquitous lower back pain I had been experiencing upon waking has all but disappeared. I didn't personally note the negatives some reviewers have complained about, viz., a strong chemical odor emanating from the mattress, and/or the mattress being excessively firm. There was a perceptible, albeit faint and inoffensive odor when the mattress was first opened, but this dissipated within a matter of hours (and I'm fairly sensitive to noxious odors, strong chemical smells, perfumes, etc). As far as the mattress being too soft or firm, I suppose that's ultimately wholly subjective, but the firmness suits me just fine (I purchased the newest iteration of the 10-inch mattress; I suspect many of the reviews indicting the mattress for being overly firm are in reference to the first generation). I did add a Novaform 3" Gel Memory Foam Topper to the mattress, but this wasn't truly necessary, as I found the mattress itself sufficiently comfortable. However, I do find the topper compliments the mattress well, and I like the additional height it adds, along with the fact that my sheets fit better with the topper in place (this is true of all the sheet sets I've tried thus far, from Pottery Barn, West Elm, Coyuchi, Williams-Sonoma, Restoration Hardware, etc). For the price this mattress simply can't be beat; moreover, with Tuft &amp; Needles' excellent 100 day risk free in-home trial and no-hassle return policy, you've absolutely nothing to lose.
 I've only slept on this mattress for two nights, but it's been two nights of the best sleep I've had in years. I normally have back pain, which I always attributed to sitting at a desk all day. Now I know it was my old mattress... which was basically a giant taco shell. The Tuft &amp; Needle had me fast asleep in minutes. Normally I have restless legs and end up moving to the couch within a few hours of going to bed. The T&amp;R mattress is a game changer. Customer service seems great, too (though I only chatted with them for a moment online). I love their return policy. But if things continue like this, I won't end up needing to use it. A good night's sleep is priceless. This mattress is worth bajillions of gazillions.
 I'll start by saying that the main reason I bought this mattress is because my wife and I were fighting for room in our queen size bed which I was really happy with. After endless researching I decided that getting a Tuft &amp; Neddle king size bed was our best bet. 6 months later she is sleeping in our queen bed in the guest room and I am having more neck and shoulder pain than is reasonable. We are both side sleepers and she noticed long before I did that our mattress is not the most comfortable for this sleeping position plus I feel every ridge from the bed frame we also ordered on Amazon, especially in the middle. What to do?? Get a mattress topper? My favorite part of this mattress is that I don't get hot and sweaty and putting a topper on will negate that aspect of this mattress. I am looking for a way to get comfortable is this bed and I haven't figured out how to sleep on my back.
 Lobe our bed. Give it a week to get used to sleeping on it. We switched from a Gelpedic bed and don't regret it. Provides great support, very cool and cleans easily! Our cat got sick on it and we hadn't gotten a protector on it. Used a Norwex cloth with just water and washed it right off. Highly recommend this mattress!
 We absolutely love this bed!  It is "firm" but not "hard" and comfortable but not soft!  It arrived in a few days fter ordering it and was easy to set up!  We chose to use a box spring with it (for the height),but my daughter ordered one and choose not to use a box spring with it and says it's just as comfortable (if not more comfortable) than any other bed she has purchased!
 I admit was surprised and doubtful by the size of the box when it arrived. But, we unpacked the mattress with ease from the box and allowed for it to expand as directed. It’s everything as described. We purchased the mattress for my son. And it passed his approval. He says it’s comfortable but, firm which he specified in wanting the most in a mattress. Very satisfied with this product. Considering on purchasing another for ourselves.
 Great memory foam, but go for sleep number! Been over 5 months, and this mattress is NOT for people that have and backs and shoulders like me. I wake up several times a night with my back in pain or my shoulder killing me with my arms falling asleep. I sleep better on my couch. Wish I had never bought this thing. Wanna buy it? Message me.
 Very disappointed, i heard about this mattress from the radio show (HMS), and he said how great it was how he woke up stiff back, and after getting a tuft &amp; needle, he slept threw the night an the aches and pain were gone.<br/>since i got it its been the opposite and now i have more pain and stiffness in my back, but threw away my old mattress so am stuck with this one if people ask about the mattress I will recommend it if they want something as firm as close to sleeping on the floor
 I bought two of these as an early father's day present for my dad and I. We both find that the mattress are a bit too firm for what we were looking for. We both suffer from back pain and are looking for (and were recommended) something a tad softer, that's able to support our hips and lower back (lower back issues)<br/>Other than hoping it was softer, we both have no issues with the mattresses.
 I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromiyalgia and this is the best mattress I have ever slept on. A comfort indeed for me.
 I've had this a few weeks now and I'm loving it.  Before I had a pillow top mattress that was well past it's prime.  This new mattress lets my body sink in at all the right places but not too much like a memory foam mattress.  I wake up feeling like I've slept really well.  I'm glad I took the risk of buying a mattress online.
 I can't say enough how much better I have been sleeping on this bed. It's comfortable, affordable and easy to deal with. No sales reps, no costly delivery. I've only had this bed for 1 week, but at this point I can say I will never go back to a conventional mattress. It even looks really nice on the platform bed I purchased.<br/><br/>Getting out of bed in the morning has never been harder! So comfortable!
 We love our bed. Really glad we made this purchase. Honestly - there is nothing specific about it other than its fantastic. One thing , i wish someone would have told me before we opened up the product is this: It comes sealed tight, vacuum sealed to be exact and the chemical emissions of opening a product sealed like this should be done somewhere that has air flow, maybe even outside. This is not specific to Tuft and Needle, but it is something i learned while going through the motions of unpacking this product - just a day late.
 I’ve been having worsening back and hip pain over the past few years and assumed it’s just bc of my weight gain and job as an ER trauma RN. Now, I believe it’s my mattress. I’m on assignment out of town and sleeping in a different bed- no pain currently. I’d suspected it before when my pain improved on 2 vacations but this is the nail in the coffin. Bye bye painful bed.
 If you are looking for really firm keep looking. We were replacing our 15-year-old Temper-Pedic because it was no longer firm enough for us and we ended up getting something pretty much the same. I see they came out with a new style called the Mint maybe that would have been the better option, you should check the differences between the two before you buy. Both of us are average weight, I'm 130 lbs and he is 185 lbs so I don't think that's the issue. We are not waking up with aches and I don't know what else to get so we will hang on to it until I find something else.
 So comfortable! Definitely super FIRM, so if you like your mattress a little softer, probably don't go for this one. So easy and convenient to unroll, really the hardest part was figuring out how to get rid of my old mattress.
 Was afraid at first, never brought a bed in a box, but it does perform well. works well while sleeping with my girlfriend. Pairs best with a memory foam pillow. I'm running Egyptian cotton 1400 count sheets, memory foam mewe pillow and and steel slatted frame. I'll follow up in a few months after i get a few more miles on the turbo, I mean mattress. Only negative thing I will mention is that there is not a lot of edge support, so if you like to sit on the edge of your bed for extended periods of time, i'd try the mint, it's suppose to and more edge support.
 I really, really wanted to love this mattress.  Tuft &amp; Needle was recommended by a friend and after reading through the Amazon reviews, I decided to  make my purchase.  Unfortunately, it was not for me - just too firm for this petite side sleeper.  But I'm still giving it 5 stars because of the customer service I received.  Amazon and Tuft &amp; Needle were awesome.  Now I'm donating the mattress to a local charity and getting a refund.  Speaks volumes for the kind of company that Tuft &amp; Needle is.  They believe in their product and believe in giving back.  Well done!
 I've lived with this mattress now for about 3 weeks. It's OK, but it ain't special. A little firm and it has some flaws. It's smaller then advertised as it isn't a perfect 60" X 80". It sleeps "hot" which is good for me in the winter as I keep my house around 65 degrees. I wouldn't buy it again nor can I recommend that others buy it, but I'm gonna keep it because it seems impossible to send back.
 Absolutely FANTASTIC.  This is the first mattress iv bought in my adult life and it was a great choice.  Came in a large, white box that had handle holes so i was able to drag it up the stairs to my apartment.  Its SO comfortable.  I can crawl around on it and i can feel that its not effecting anywhere else on the bed.
 My wife and I bought this mattress about 2 months ago. We slept on it for about 3 nights before going out of town for 2 months, and the experience was mixed. She was ok with it.  I like to sleep on my side and belly, but after not too long I would have pain in my side and lower back. I felt like I was sinking in the middle and had too much support in my shoulders and legs. It was like being folded in half like a taco. I am in my 20s and am in good shape. I feel like I should not be having back issues everyday from my mattress.<br/><br/>Update: I meant to post this review a couple months ago. Anyway the mattress is still a miss. I mostly sleep on my old bed or the couch. The tuft and needle just doesn't offer enough support for me. It reminds me of sleeping in a hammock and sinking down in the middle. Maybe it works for some people great, but not for me.<br/>After being back from travels,  and sleeping on a dozen different beds all over the world, the Tuft and Needle is still the most uncomfortable for me. I have tried putting a mattress topper on and it has alleviated a little pain, but I still wake up sore and tired.<br/><br/>We saw this bed on a tiny house blog we follow and I really wanted to like it. The company seems great, and many people do like it. It is just not for me. Maybe it's time to go back to the old Ikea bed?
 I spent weeks checking websites and reviews for all the foam mattresses before finally settling on this in part because of the return policy.  I’m picky, to be honest, and fully expected to have to return the mattress so I saved the packaging.  It’s firm but not overly so and seriously comfortable.  After three weeks I’m happy as can be and thinking of buying another!  I would definitely recommend.
 My sister loves her Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, so when my old Beautyrest needed to be replaced I decided to give this one a try.<br/>Unfortunately it is not for me. Much too firm, as I am used to an ultra-plush spring-mattress with a feather pillow topper.<br/>I am a side/stomach sleeper and since I first began using this mattress on April 27th, I have not slept through the night. Pain &amp; over-heating are waking me up. I have no topper or anything - so I don't understand why - but this thing gets very HOT if you stay in one place for too long! Scorching heat - sometimes so bad I end up dreaming that I am trapped in a fire - LOL<br/>On top of that, I also have neck/shoulder/upper back pain in the mornings.<br/>Another thing to note: I made the mistake of buying this mattress from Amazon rather than T&amp;N directly. I did not know at the time that I would only have a 30 night guarantee instead of the 100 night. It looks like I am out the $600 that I cannot afford to 'throw away'. :( I am going to have to find a good, plush topper or something. Oh well - lesson learned - read all of the fine print on the company's web-site!!
 Very hard, actually gave it away. Disappointing.
 Great mattress. Very comfortable for someone with severe arthritis and spinal degeneration. It works well with my adjustable base, actually better than the most well known name brand in foam mattresses. i separated a king adjustable bed into two twin xl. Replaced the 15year old tempurpedic with a new one and bought this mattress for the spare room. I wish I hadn't bought the tempurpedic now. This bed works better on the adjustable base than the other very deep mattress. I wish I had bought this mattress first because I wouldn't have bought the tempurpedic. Now we are stuck with it due to mattress store small print not allowing returns.
 I absolutely love this mattress. I had bought a Simmons mattress and box spring for $1,600 eight years ago and it had already been down. This mattress is so comfortable and well worth the price. Even if I have to buy one again five years down the line, it is still a better deal than spending a lot on an expensive mattress that doesn't even last the 10 years under warranty.
 A friend has Tuft and Needle mattress and it’s considerably firmer than mine.<br/>My Tuft and Needle is way too soft for correct, healthy support.
 I have had my mattress about 7 months. At first I loved it... then I was always hot. I bought an expensive thick, cotton mattress cover to help with night sweats. The worked. Now my back always aches. I rotated mattress around hoping it would help. Nothing helped. Bought a topper. Still not sleeping well. Not sure what the issue is with this mattress but pretty sure I’m just spinning in a circle and spending more to make it work for me and my back. Never had these issues with my previous mattress.
 I purchased this mattress for my daughter when it was time to upgrade.  I took a chance based on reviews and after a year she still loves her bed.  After checking it out one night I decided to grab a second one for the guest room.  I highly recommend this mattress!
 Had originally bought a queen sized T&amp;N mattress direct from their website and wanted to upgrade but we were disappointed by the king we bought on Amazon. I don't know if it is an older model but it's not as thick as our queen or as soft on top. It's okay, just not the same mattress. Disappointed.
 Looove this mattress. We’ve had it for about a month or so and it’s been great so far. It’s not hot like some of the other memory foam mattresses I’ve tried. It feels amazing on my back. Have had no back problems since using this mattress.  My husband and I usually can’t agree on mattress firmness and this one works for both of us.
 I got a Queen on Prime Day, 2018, for less than $500. My old spring mattress was destroying my lower back and this bed in a box delivered right to my door was right up my alley.<br/><br/>It's been about three weeks now and this mattress has exceeded my expectations. My lower back pain lessened within the first week and is now completely gone on week three.<br/><br/>For less than $500 I couldn't be happier.
 I've been trying and trying to figure out what has been killing my back. I finally figured out it was this stupid mattress! Every time I am on vacation or stay in a hotel overnight my back pain goes away and the minute I get home it comes back. What a waste of money. We had a zinus before and my back never hurt and it's half the price! going back to a zinus! Just keep in mind if you are used to sleeping on a pillow top or soft mattress maybe don't get this one, just saying.
 Probably the best bed i've ever slept on. Don't worry about getting sucked into the bed. It's just the correct firmness to not allow that. You sit just perfectly on the top and pressure or bulk points will snuggle in nicely. Actually is amazing for "workouts" if you catch my drift.
 Mattress box arrived trashed and retaped. Packaging is not adequate for such a heavy bulky item. After a week my wife and I still experience backache. The mattress isn't as firm as we had hoped. We'll give it more time to see if we can get use to it.
 I just got my mattress full size. The box is heavy and had to drag it but the holes in the box helped it. It is recommended to be carried by two people. Mattress expanded in a couple of seconds. it was nice to see and took a nap after a couple of hours of letting it sit, it was good and i have good hopes that it will get better. no stiff muscles because i got a a lower back condition and my coil mattress was too tough on my back. im planning on getting an electric massager for my car and my chair. Im 5'3 and 130 poounds so i dont sink in the mattress. prolly bigger individuals could have a problem but in my opinion the product is like they claim "not too soft not too hard". i like it so far and totally worth my money. thank you
 Bought a twin for my young son. Very comfy and easy to set-up. My issue is that the edges of the mattress collapse with pressure. This is my first memory foam bed so maybe that is the case with all such mattresses. But with a twin, it means you lose a large percentage of the actual sleep space. When I lay down with my son I can't go anywhere near the edge because I start to slide off or at best I'm on a slope... Back it goes...
 Very easy to set up on our adjustable bed frame. It did have a slight odor that faded in a day. The support is firm - a bit too firm for us middle aged folk, but we solved that by adding a soft mattress topper. So far, it is a good mattress for the price.
 Honestly I can't complain about the quality of the mattress. It looks and feels like it is made very well. The only problem I have is that it is much firmer than I expected. I'm sure for many people this is a great bed, and I don't have any problems with this company at all. This bed just isn't entirely comfortable to me, I just wish it hadn't taken me 2 months to realize that otherwise I could have returned it.<br/>Just make sure you keep the return policy in mind if you decide to purchase. If this bed isn't absolutely amazing the first week or so that you sleep on it, it isn't going to be any better 3 weeks later either.
 So far so good,<br/>Bought this as an replacement for our five year old "Tempur-Pedic wanna be" mattress (Cal Kind size)<br/>This mattress are very similar and provide good support as well as are cool to sleep on.<br/>We have used the same for several weeks and it seem to hold up. When buying this kind of mattress, you need to know , that regardless the commercial promises and warranty, they will not last longer than five years tops<br/>But so does any other modern / other mattress<br/>You get the "bang for the buck" and a good nights sleep,  and that what the purpose of the entire exercise<br/>I would recommend to buy the mattress direct from TF since the will pick it up if yo change your mind, with AMAZON you need to "re=pack" the mattress before you will be able to send it back, ,, good luck with that,,,,
 Tuft and Needle is an amazing company with an even more amazing product. I have been nothing but impressed with their customer service and amount of care they give to their customers. We ordered 3 mattresses from them and they are all wonderful!
 The bed is definitely on the firm side. I'd put it at a 7/10 with 1 being a cloud and 10 being concrete.<br/><br/>There isn't a ton of sinkage into the foam, which I like. It seems to keep me cooler since I'm not sucked into the foam.<br/><br/>I am a side and stomach sleeper and have had no issues getting comfortable. My wife is a side sleeper as well, and she absolutely loves the bed.<br/><br/>I would definitely buy again. Great bed, great customer service.
 This mattress is okay, but not great. It’s not firm at all and sags if you sit on it. The mattress is much thinner than other mattresses I’ve had which in itself isn’t an issue, but it means a lot of fitted sheets and mattress protectors are ill fitting. My mattress protector slides around like crazy, but I don’t want to shell out $90 for one of the T&amp;N protectors - that’s over 10% of what the mattress costs and is significantly more than other branda
 At first this was an incredible mattress, but after 3.5 years we need to replace it. Both my wife and I have started getting back pain in the middle of the night. We are looking at other manufacturers. If it would have lasted 5-6 years or had only cost $500 we would have been ok with it, but that is not the case.
 Arrived on time and nicely wrapped. When opened quickly expanded into a ten inch mattress. Felt a little to firm at first but after a couple of nights sleep appeared to break in to a very comfortable medium. Used this on a platform bed frame with no box spring and it works fantastic.This mattress is rated as a best buy by Consumer Reports magazine where I first saw this product and it is definitely is good buy. Appears to be no heat build up which is a complaint of other foam mattress but not so with this one. A great mattress.
 Without the topper I would give the mattress a 2. My husband would have given the mattress a 4. Hence a 3 score. I think it was way better after we bought the topper.
 TUFT AND NEEDLE  shipped very quickly.  It arrived  in a large heavy box, Needed 2 people to get it out , unless you cut the box off very carefully. This is my second foam mattress and the last one was very hard , but this one is not hard at all.  This is a very comfortable mattress.  It  springs right back into shape, it's also very spongy when you get on it. It's what I would expect from a foam mattress. I'm not sure how long this one will hold up , the last one needed to be replaced after 2 years ( I paid more for it than I did this one). I'm hoping this one has a longer life span.  So far I'm not disappointed with this purchase.
 I hadn’t been sleeping very well for months. After doing tons of research, we decided to try your king size mattress. When we unpacked it, it immediately grew to 10”. We’ve had your king size mattress for two nights now and it’s been blissful! Thank You Tuft &amp; Needle
 We purchased this for a weekender and now i prefer it to my much more expensive (10 year old) temperpedic. I generate significantly less heat sleeping on this and that means a better nights sleep! Thinking about getting another to replace the home setup.
 I only got the mattress yesterday and the chemical smell is way too strong. I had to sleep with the windows open but it did not go away. It has been 24 hours since I took it out of the box and the smell does not go away yet. I will update this review later on.<br/>The mattress is comfortable though, especially is you are back sleeper.<br/><br/>Update: the smell slowly went away on day #5. I recommend you make arrangements to sleep on a different room the first few days after you get the mattress and put it on your bed.
 This is the third mattress I but. The second twin mattress, actually. My concern is that the other 2 I bought have the brand embroiled all over the mattress but this last order does not. I am wonder why. Is it fake?<br/>It feels kind of the same but it has no label or brand anywhere.
 i'ts only 3 stars because i bought for the reason that according to their claim that it will Keep You COOL..been sleeping here for 3 nights now and the temperature is 53F but after 4 hrs it's already HOT..i have to change position and move a little bit where its cool...and then move again and again..it's like half of my body have hotflashes and the other half is coldflashes.the firmness is just right for me.It's very goodlooking mattress..but it's hot,maybe if i sleep alone then it's ok coz i can roll everytime it gets hot."false advertisement"<br/><br/>it's been 14 days now....so i tried without mattress protection and use percale sheets,it helps it's not so hot anymore but it still get warm.i still sleep in the other bed sometimes..
 Couldn't believe a queen mattress could fit in such a small package.  Heavy to move than I would have expected.  A  joy to open and watch it take its full form.  First two nights I felt it was a little more firm than I was used to.  By the third night I was fully adjusted and have had no sleeping or comfort issues since.  Highly recommended.
 I was a little worried to buy a mattress online but am glad I did. The shipping and assembly process was super easy. The mattress feels really comfortable for my taste: not too soft and not too hard. Also, I don't feel my husband moving around anymore so I'm sleeping better.
 I really wanted to like it, but after using it for a couple of weeks, my wife and I are having neck and back pains. We thought we would spend a little extra to get a brand that was more recognized with a lot more reviews, but it just did not work out for us. We are most likely going to send it back through their policy.
 Love my new mattress! My back pain has decreased tremendously(not totally gone but that’s due to my office job and bad posture) My shoulders doesn’t hurt like they used to when I sleep on my side. Nobody can beat the price of this mattress. I was going to try a purple mattress but I heard it not good for big people. Seeing that I, like most of America is overweight, Went with Tuft&amp; Needle. It’s a medium firmness which is perfect for me!
 I was worried about hurting during the two weeks it supposedly takes to break this mattress in, but that never happened for me. It was immediate comfort....but that could be because I was switching to this from a 16+ year old box spring mattress! Haha. Anyway, I’ve been using this mattress for over a month and I still love it. I definitely sleep better. Will edit my review if something changes.
 Great mattress, but I found it to be just a little too firm for my taste. I solved the problem by purchasing a 2" gel foam topper for my mattress. Now my bed is perfect. If you find yourself in that situation, remember that you might need to buy sheets with extra deep pockets to fit over both pieces. I look forward to climbing into bed every night.
 Wanted to use the 100-day trial, but we're keeping it! The bed is very comfy. I like firm mattresses, my wife likes soft, and we can both agree we like this mattress and feel rested in the morning.
 This is my first king sized mattress and also my first memory foam mattress. I've never slept so good in my life before. I have nothing but positive feedback regarding this product. Shipping was amazing and it arrived on the second day after my order was placed. Packaging, unboxing, and implementation was super easy and the bed is a pleasure to sleep on.
 The mattress was relatively comfortable in the 1st year.  The mattress felt mostly okay in the 2nd year, but I began feeling some discomfort from the lack of support for the back.  Now beginning the 3rd year, I frequently wake up with a bad back.  So, I'm now searching to buy a new mattress with better back support from another company!
 I love this Mattress.  My Husband loves this mattress.  I see why Amazon backs them because they must all sleep on them.  I figured after looking at Purples price and watching these young men talk.  I found Amazon good on their sellers but to back 100%. Now why make a three thousand dollar mistake. I have slept so good.  It's been Great.
 Ive had the queen size tuft n needle mattress now for two weeks. Im 6' 280lbs. I also ordered a 2" memory foam topper after reading the other reviews who mentioned firmness.<br/>I think T&amp;N should design these with weight ratings. Because this mattress isnt usable for someone of my size and weight. i dont have back issues but after the first night my lower back was sore it felt like i was sleeping on the ground it was so firm. after the 2nd night i was stiff and sore and more back pain. I dreaded it on the 3rd night so i folded up a down blanket for cushion which helped. My 2" topper arrived and the beds now heaven! For the 1st time in a decade I slept for 10hrs straight! I love it now but think they should put weight limits and or offer such toppers for fat people. :)
 One of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever owned! I was very skeptical prior to purchasing this item as I always like to test out my previous mattresses in the store. But Tuft &amp; Needle exceeded all my expectations and will be the only mattress I will be purchasing for my home moving forward.
 This is the best bed I've slept on in years.  I wake with no back or hip pain (a very pleasant experience).  My wife however found the mattress too stiff for her tastes.  We have compromised by putting a little additional padding on her side and she's gonna let me keep it.
 I did a lot of research before buying a this mattress.  I love that it came to my door!  It takes two people but was easy to unpack and set up.  The foam smell wasn't that bad.  It took about 48 hours before the bed was fully ready.  It's an amazing mattress.  It's not to soft or firm.  I always get a good nights sleep.  I would recommended this mattress!
 Its very firm but soft and comfortable. After owning it for about a month I've noticed that both me and my partner have had to take our comforter off and replace it with a light quilt due to how hot the mattress gets. It makes both of us over-heat very easily and we both wake up several times in the middle of the night covered in sweat. These mattresses retains ALOT of heat. We will be returning it.
 I'm glad I bit the bullet and put $600 down on this mattress. It's remarkably comfortable, even though it somehow fits in a reasonably small box. I love that it's much lighter than a spring mattress, which means it'll be easier to move when the time comes. Setup was easy, and my back has been very pleased with its comfort.
 My wife and I were looking for a new mattress and decided to look at online reviews. This was highly rated and we loved the return through charity aspect. We ended up ordering through Amazon to get it a few days quicker and have it arrive on a weekend. I built our slat bed frame from scratch. The mattress had 5-6 hrs to inflate before we slept on it. The first night I thought it might be just me sheer exhaustion from working on the bed. The second night I thought it might just be true. The third night I was sold. This is the best mattress that I have ever slept on in my 34 years on earth. I wake up rested and ready to blast through the day. I wake up without joint pain (ie shoulder, hip, lower back). If you are on the fence about this mattress, I challenge you to give it a try for a week.
 This mattress is a lifesaver. I am a heavy guy, and this bed is incredible. I have not had good sleep like this in almost a decade. It sounds crazy, but it is firm yet soft. It is just right. It’s not like normal memory foam mattresses where laying on it is similar to laying in quicksand, you find yourself sinking and sinking. This mattress made me nervous, bc this is the first time I’ve bought a mattress without trying it. I went off of my sister and her friends opinions, and that’s the best decision I have made in a long time.
 Love!!! We look forward to going to bed now! I'm a very light sleeper &amp; I always toss &amp; turn. But with this mattress, I don't feel my husband or the pets jump in &amp; out of bed, I don't sink &amp; I sleep cool! It's soft but very firm. My husband loves it, too! We have had it two weeks now &amp; love it!
 I've had this mattress for over two years now, patiently waiting to see if my back would adjust to it eventually, but it never happened. For me (165lbs) it's just too firm. I added a topper to it, but even that didn't help resolve my back pains. The material is well made, but I just need something with a little more give. I sleep like a baby when I stay at hotels with super soft mattresses that give more. If you like a firm mattress, I think this would work well for you.
 Very happy with the mattress.  It is exactly what was advertised.  We were replacing a foam mattress that we had spent twice as much for and we couldn't be happier with how well we sleep on this Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress.
 It's as good as the reviews indicate.  We replaced a king sized mattress for which we paid SIGNIFICANTLY more and couldn't be happier.  It is firm, but I've had no issues sleeping on my side (not super firm).  It is sent vacuum packed and fully inflated in around 90 minutes.  The biggest thing I've noticed is how cool the mattress feels...it seems to breathe exceptionally well, better than any I've ever been on.<br/><br/>My thought: this product is both better and cheaper.  Save your money and buy it.
 I watched the videos at the T&amp;N site; I read the reviews on Amazon.<br/>And I decided to take a chance.<br/>Long story short: we LOVE our new T&amp;N mattress!<br/>It's exceptionally comfortable at a very reasonable price (considering what our local mattress stores are charging).<br/>How it will wear over the years, I don't know, but for now we're very happy.
 This was a gift to my Son and his wife.  The mattress never did  come to full  size on one side and he complained  it  was just uncomfortable and looked lopsided all the time. It was damaged during shipment. The box appeared to have been run over with something.
 I needed a mattress on a tight budget.  I have a lower pain and this was rated #1 in Consumer Reports and lots of Amazon customers liked this.  At first it was perfect.  Touch of cool comes through the sheet when you lie down.  I've had this for over a month now.  It isn't as firm as I had hoped and this is critical for my back.  If you don't have that problem it is good for the price.
 Mattress does not help keep your body temp cool like description states. We bought a little over a month ago. Opened it 2 weeks ago when our furniture arrived. We have had other memory foam mattresses that are cheaper on amazon for years and we’re better quality. This mattress keeps you hot. We have the a/c on 65 degrees, light covers and its 40 outside. There’s no reason why we should be over heated. Aside from body temp being elevated, the mattress is bad for both our backs. The other mattresses at 400 support the body better in our opinion. Super dissatisfied in the quality and money spent.
 This mattress is way to firm.  If u sleep on your back no problem, but if u sleep on your side it is awful. Do yourself a favor and get another mattress. When u wake up in the morning you will hurt on what ever side u slept on.
 This review is more about our experience with Amazon than the mattress itself. We recently ordered 2 Twin XL mattresses.  The only problem? They sent 1 Twin XL and 1 Twin (a difference of 5 in" in length).  Since these were to be used to make a king sized bed with adjustable bases this wasn't feasible for us.  Customer service was fabulous and issued us a refund. We re-ordered another Twin XL and had the same issue - they sent a twin - again.  We won't be ordering from Amazon again, but directly from Tuft &amp; Needle.  The mattress is comfortable, this is my first adaptive foam mattress and I was worried, but so far so good!
 My husband and I love our Tuft and Needle mattress. It is very comfortable and seems to only get more comfortable the longer we have it. I never wake up with any sort of pain like I did in the past! Would highly recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing a mattress.
 Love this mattress. We were in need of a new bed and once we adopted our dog even more for the space. We upgraded to a California king. We’ve been sleeping on it since December and I’ve noticed a major difference. I have back problems and this has made sleeping easier. We are planning to get a mattress topper to make it a little more softer in certain spots but I think that’s from the type of frame we got.
 My husband and I were searching for a new mattress when we came across Tuft &amp; Needle. We thought we would be spending way more than the price we got our king from Amazon for. Where else can you get a mattress with over 18,000 reviews? I was sold!<br/>We have had this mattress for a couple weeks and are very happy with it. My back was aching every morning and now it doesn't, so I see that as a plus!!!
 This mattress is amazing. I have been sleeping so terribly until receiving this mattress. I am a side sleeper who suffers from sore shoulders and hips due to my sleep position. I now sleep with the firmness and support that I need without compromising the soft fluffy texture that I prefer. This bed was also very easy to set up and shipped as expected. I am one happy camper!
 If you're sitting there, hesitating to order a mattress online. ORDER THIS ONE!! This is my first online mattress order and it went great. The mattress shipped fast and came in a decently sized box. Once you unwrap it, it inflates pretty quickly and you will be able to lay on it in a few minutes. Perfect combination between firm and soft. Order. This. Mattress. !!!!!!!!!!!!!
 It came in a rather small package for such a big item but when opened up it goes to full size. We bought a California King.  We had spring mattress in the past so this was our first with foam. Seemed weird at first because just not used to the fell, especially when you sit on the side because it goes down a little more than a spring.  But once on bed and used it we love it.
 It was very easy to set up. It is a firm mattress which my husband loves. I would prefer a softer mattress but it is very comfortable. Had no odor at all when we opened the package.
 Picked this up for my daughter who was asking for a new bed.  Last thing we wanted to do was spend $1200 for a bed she is only going to use for another 3 years before going off to college.  Can't say enough good things about this bed.  Super comfortable, great support, and super fast shipping with Amazon Prime.  You get 100 nights to decide if you like it or not.  Totally worth a try if you are on the fence about switching to a all foam mattress.  I've already recommended this to my closest friends and plan on getting one when we replace the spring mattress that cost X2.
 I was skeptical. A mattress in a box? But so far I love it! It’s super comfortable but firm. not squishy. Some reviewers said it’s hot but I haven’t experienced that. I did need a friend to help me get the box upstairs and unwrap it. Not a one person job!
 We have had this mattress for a few months and have found it way to firm. My husband and I wake up with stiffness from it being to firm and I don’t feel like I get a very great nights sleep anymore. We now are looking into a pillow top for it but that’s more money we have to spend. If you are looking for a very firm mattress this would be the one for you. i was looking for a firm mattress but this just is excessively firm to me. Everything else about the mattress was fine, it was easy to unpack, came in an easy to manage box and does not get hot like I have heard other mattresses do.
 UPDATE: Tuft and needle has reached out to me and offered to send a topper to see if it helps. They have great customer service!<br/><br/>The mattress seems of high quality. However, for me and my wife it is simply to firm. I really hate to return it but we both woke up with back pain and headaches. Maybe a super thick pillow topper might fix it? I am just not sure.
 This thing is super convenient. I was skeptical at first but read nothing but good reviews so I gave it a shot. It looks impossible that a legitimate mattress would be inside the box but in less than a minute after cutting it open it became apparent that technology is awesome even in the mattress department. I love how firm it is even though at first you feel like you’re sinking into it. It also absorbs vibrations very well so there’s no risk of waking up your partner when you get up. I honestly can’t think of anything super horrible about it other than it seems like it gets a little warm sometimes, but not enough to complain about.
 I bought this mattress a little over a year ago and finally replacing it.<br/><br/>The good: no smells, prompt delivery.<br/>The bad: never quite gets to the advertised thickness...always feels a little lacking in firmness...at ten inches thick ( more like 8.5) you need larger foundation than most mattresses. Generally not a fit for my family. I’m out 700 bucks and can’t return it for just generally being bad.
 I purchased this mattress for a friend. She and her husband are both large people(200+ lbs.) and have back problems and chronic pain. They LOVE this mattress. She is disabled, and is getting some of the best rest she has had in years. She cannot say enough good things about it.
 I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ENOUGH. WE ORDERED A QUEEN SIZE MATTRESS IN LATE JANUARY 2017 AND IN NOVEMBER ORDERED TWO MORE MATTRESSES FOR OUR SONS. OUR OLDER SON WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FIRMNESS OF HIS MATTRESS AND I FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT OURS SO I CONTACTED TUFT AND NEEDLE AND ASKED THEM FOR A RECOMMENDATION FOR A MATTRESS TOPPER. I LEARNED THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TOPPERS AND IN THEIR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY NOT ONLY PROVIDED A TOPPER FOR MY SONS BED BUT ALSO FOR OUR QUEEN MATTRESS FOR FREE 11 MONTHS AFTER WE PURCHASED IT. THE TOPPERS HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. IT IS RARE TO FIND A COMPANY WITH A GREAT PRODUCT AND EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.
 First few nights I slept great. But then again started waking with aches and pains. Put a mattress topper on top which has made it better. Maybe my body is too old and will wake up with aches and pains with no matter what mattress. It was recommended to me by a male friend who had back surgery. I wished I had returned it within the timeframe.
 We love this mattress! I used to wake up multiple times a night, but now I sleep like a rock.  I used to have lower back pain and I noticed a difference after two nights. Two months in and I have not had back pain since.  Awesome quality material, feels like it is built to last. I wish everybody could sleep on one of these...the world would be a much happier place!  I normally dont take time to write reviews (just heavily tead them), but this mattress is really worth writing about. Thanks T&amp;N, keep up the good work and try to find a way to make these more affordable so everybody can be happier (although they are worth every penny)
 This mattress kicks ass! I was a little hesitant due to all the reviews saying how firm and uncomfortable it is, but it isn’t firm to me. Very springy and soft. We slept like baby rocks the first night, which says a lot, cause I’ve always had trouble sleeping on a new mattress for a few days/weeks. We switched to this from the execrable Sleep Number. This was an enormous upgrade.
 I have been very satisfied with my purchase.  I get a good nights sleep on this mattress.  It is not too hard and not too soft.  I can roll around easily without feeling stuck in one place. It only sinks in when you sit on side of bed.
 This mattress has excellent quality but  quite firm. We really wished it to work. However after sleeping on it for 2 months, it is still too firm for us to feel comfortable. I have requested a return but don’t know how to pack such an item for shipping.
 We bought this mattres to replace an older memory foam mattress. Our old mattress was one that we found very comfortable. It always was much better than those in the hotels we stayed in.. It didn't transmit motion when one of us rolled over. Eventually it shaped itself to us in ways that left my husband with back pain.  There were times when it seemed too warm. It was too heavy. The first week after we got it there was an awful smell that eventually went away.<br/><br/>This is the basis for my comparison. Our new mattress has meant that my husband's back no longer hurts. It's substantially less heavy than our old one. It is cooler than our old one.  It did have an odor to start with, but definitely not as bad. This mattress is at least as comfortable. I have no basisfor comparing it with all the others available now but I did look at many reviews and comparisons. This mattress did very well and that's why I bought it. We're happy with it.  I would recomment it.
 Good price for a good matress. I am 298 lbs and my husband is 345 lbs. I waited for 6 weeks to write this and give honest appraisal. It does not sink down and stay there.  It is not hot. It does seem hard to turn over and get situated. Otherwise, a good purchase.
 We were kinda nervous to buy a mattress online without trying it first, but we went ahead and took a leap of faith! Other reviews highly recommended it. We are so glad we got this bed. Not too firm but not too soft. We like our beds a little more on the firmer than softer side, just side note.
 I strongly recommend considering other mattress if you are a person with lower back trouble or have had a surgery in you lower back or abdominal region recently. It gives no side support and getting off the mattress or bed is hell.<br/><br/>I had a detailed chat with the tuft n needle team and they did.not bother getting back. They infact sold this telling customer that they are increasing the price by $150 and actually ended up reduced in it by $50 cheaper than what I paid. But this aside don't buy this mattress if you need edge support.<br/><br/>I have attached my chat session with them. Still to receive an response. I wish i had returned it.
 I am a few weeks in and I'm sleeping better and feel more rested in the morning. I have been waking up in the middle of the night less frequently as well. As someone who has undergone a thoracic spinal fusion (t3-t7) and has had back pain issues for a while, I've been waking up feeling noticeably less pain than usual which has been great.<br/><br/>Edit: 8 months later and I’m still getting great sleep. The next bed I buy will be another Tuft &amp; Needle.
 So I'm giving this mattress 3 stars.... due to the fact that it didn't meet the hype that they proclaim and other reviewers maybe right but it does not mean it's helps everyone.  I purchased a Twin and I find it to be too firm.  I expected to be somewhat softer than my standard mattress but the feeling is about the same.  I'm giving this the 100 days and hoping that it takes time to feel/know the difference cause I definitely do not want to have to pack and ship this back.
 This mattress is incredibly comfortable for such a great price.  It's just firm enough to support so you don't feel like you are falling into it but not hard enough to cut off circulation like a typical mattress.  It's also very light weight and easy to move compared to a typical mattress.  So worth it!
 I wanted to wait and really give an honest review,the mattress is not what I expected it to be it is uneven and very comfortable . I thought the unevenness will go away with time, but it has not. Not very satisfied with this purchase.I think a lot of work has been put to produce a good product maybe we got a 🍋.
 I seriously LOVE this bed. It is comfortable in all the right ways; firm support but cradling softness. I have terrible hip and lower back pain... with my old worn-out mattress I could barely straighten up in the morning. The tuft &amp; needle mattress has given me great relief. Totally amazing!
 I waited a little prior to reviewing the mattress just because of all the mixed reviews, after the mattress broke in it was firm enough for me and soft enough for my girlfriend. The mattress didn't smell or anything and came to life once it was removed from the packaging. The cover it comes with is actually really nice and from what I can tell it is crafted with great materials all around.<br/>Two small gripes I have is the shipping was a little slow for my taste, and the responses from the staff was sub par.
 I've had sufficient weeks to sleep on this bed to really get a feel for it. It's more on the firm side even when settled and degassed so if you're the softer, cushy mattress kind of person beware.<br/><br/>Only gripe I might have is maybe some hand holds or something. I was trying to move/readjust the mattress and must've gripped too hard while moving (since there isn't much to grab hold of) and a small chunk came off. Luckily it's still encased inside the mattress sheet.
 Love, love love!!!  So happy I bought this mattress.  I paired it with the Zinus Upholstered Button Tufted Platform Bed with Wooden Slats for my 1 bedroom tiny house and it is wonderful!.  Not to soft, not to firm.  I have bad back and this mattress is fabulous.  I have had it for about 3 months and could not be more pleased that I made the purchase.
 I purchased this mattress 7 months ago. At the beginning it was awesome but now it's killing my back and there is a small curve where I sleep even though I am not that heavy I'm 175 lb.
 Husband and I purchased this mattress during prime week sale as were in desperate need of one and took advantage of sale. That should of been our first sign! My husband and I are heavy set people and after 6 months of owning mattress I absolutely hate it! Retains heat! This was awful during the hot months! And now just feels lumpy and uncomfortable.
 After sleeping on a high-end mattress I woke many times per night with hip pain.  I never had a good night sleep until I got this mattress.  Fast delivery and ready the first night.  After a few days it got better and better.  No more hip pain and finally a good night sleep!
 I just received my queen T&amp;N mattress, to replace my worn Serta Perfect Sleeper pillow-top inner spring mattress. I couldn't bear the thought of the usual store purchasing process for a mattress. When I read others' reviews of T &amp; N, I figured I had nothing to lose by trying the mattress. I'm so glad I did! The mattress inflated in about 2 minutes. It was amazing to see something on 1.5" thick and the width of a twin, expand into a 10" thick queen width mattress. And the mattress is so comfortable! Other reviewers have complained that the mattress is too firm, but I think it's perfect. I never want to get off my bed!
 I like beds extra firm and this was perfect for me. I'm a side sleeper mostly with some back problems and I wake up feeling fine. I've only used it for a few months but so far so good.
 Absolutly amazing. The bed lives up to all the hype. It is soft but supportive. I don’t sink into the mattress and my partner and I sleep so much cooler. I’ve had the mattress for a week and my back already feels the pressure relief. It’s amazing.<br/><br/>Also, as we are all adults. It handles adult activities expectionally well. No shame in the game; this mattress covers all the bases. Comfort, feel and bounce back from activity.
 This mattress has been terrific for a good night's sleep for both my husband and me. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a supportive mattress that ranges somewhere between medium-firm and firm. The mattress arrived in great shape, was easy to roll out on our box springs, and we were sleeping on it a few hours later. No smelly off gassing at all. We purchased the king sized mattress--the price was right as an added bonus to a comfy night's sleep.<br/>We honestly have nothing we can say that is negative about this mattress or the company that makes it.
 It was great, at first. But after a bit, the back pain started. The more we slept on it, the worse our back pain got. Right out of the box, it felt like you were going to roll off of the side. Thought it would get better with time, but it didn't. Didn't start having back pain until well after the trial was over.<br/><br/>Great for a guest bed though!
 I liked it initially but it’s almost unbearable to sleep on now. Very uncomfortable, incredibly firm mattress. Missed my return window, now I’m stuck with a $900 hunk of garbage.
 For the money, I would buy a better mattress!  I tried it for almost 60 days and put it in our extra bedroom; I know their story is good however really watch what you are buying.
 I use the product for everyday sleeping and my lower back hurts so bad I can’t hardly stand it. While standing in my shop now I have tremendous lower back back. Stay away from this mattress.
 For at least a year I've been procrastinating about replacing my old mattress.  Every day I've been waking up in pain, telling myself its inevitable and part of aging (I'm 55 and have scoliosis).  I've been taking pain killers like Aleve just to get through the day.  This morning was entirely different.<br/><br/>I woke up and my back didn't hurt.  I didn't want to get out of bed in case the pain came back but my cats weren't down with that so I got up, and NO PAIN.  Wow!<br/><br/>It seems a bit risky to buy something like a bed online, but I'm very glad I did.  I plan to buy another for my 23 year old son, who also has back pain.  Simply amazing!
 This mattress is a little firm for a foam mattress. That said, the people who complain about it being "too firm" are a bit off their. I have  I did a TON of research before I purchased this bed and is by far the best of all the beds that I tried. The fact that you can return it without any hassle makes it for sure worth a try.
 It was easy and convenient to setup. However, my wife uses it exclusively and says that it is way too soft. She did not want to complain so unfortunately she did not say anything about her discomfort until after the sleep warranty had expired. If you don’t need a firm mattress it would probably be a great mattress.
 The mattress is very comfortable.  However, it is 6 inches more narrow than a standard queen size mattress.  The bedspread "tents" over the mattress so it doesn't very good.  The bed is in a spare bedroom and, quite frankly, I'm too lazy to deal with a return.  If it was a less comfortable mattress, I would return for sure.
 I have had the mattress for awhile and, I can honestly say I wanted to love this based on reviews and what the company stood for and there information about other companies. In saying that this was one of the hottest mattresses I have slept on and also one of the stiffest i kept waiting and waiting for it to not be so firm. All in all it has made me thing of going down the route of helix, purple, or a new one matsleep. Sad that I think Im stuck with this thing, we ended up putting back on our old 8 year old mattress.
 The mattress didn’t have plush memory foam on the top layer which made the bed to hard for my husband &amp; I. We have been sleeping on a 3 inch memory foam on top of our mattress for years and thought Tuft &amp; Needle would have the softness I need.
 Had it 6 weeks. Smell seems to take a long time to go completely. It's bearable for s entities nose like mine, but still present. Less firm than I expected but comfortable.
 We've only used it a few days but I'm already impressed. I was worried it would be hard as a rock with some reviews I had read but I was pleasantly surprised. Firm, yet soft and cozy. It really seems to support you well. I'm a stomach sleeper and it has been great so far. It came neatly rolled and opened right up to a full mattress. No regrets and very happy with my purchase!
 We are replacing most of our traditional mattresses with Tuft and Needle "Bed in a Box". The mattress is cool, super comfortable, simple to install... though do watch the shipping weight. The 88lb kingsize definitely is a 2 person lift.....<br/>Great product. Best of success to the inventors.
 Very comfortable mattress - bought this kind of last second for my father-in-law who was coming in for Thanksgiving, and not only was it delivered very quickly, he says it is perfect - and he has chronic neck and back troubles. Slept on it for a week with no complaints! I would definitely buy again for both ease and quality. We put ours on a platform bed frame but I believe it would be fine with a box spring as well.
 Yes, I am lazy- I rarely submit product reviews.  I’m also a little jaded...what good reviews are reimbursed?  We’ve used this mattress every night., sleeping with our two medium sized dogs, and it’s the best night’s sleep we’ve had in a very long time.  I have not received one penny for this review.
 I purchased this item and have been using it since Jan 7, 2018. WOW i have been having lower back pain since i started to sleep on this mattress. Have others been having the same problem? Did i get a super soft matters?
 I waited a couple of months to write this review.<br/>I spent a lot of time trying to find the right new mattress for us. I hit the jack pot with this.<br/>To say I am very happy is a understatement.  Both my hubby and I love this new mattress. Would highly recommend!
 We have had this mattress for 6 months now and it has been decent.  My wife likes it better than I do.  The dissapointing thing is that we are already starting to notice sagging where we lay.  Being that we are both less than average weight I don’t feel like 6 months of use should warrant sagging in this mattress.
 Awesome, just awesome!! Great bed for a bad back. I'm a bigger guy. 6'2 240 lbs. Works wonders!
 I have purchased a queen size and a king size and couldn't be happier with them. Just firm enough, just soft enough. And I didn't spend a month's pay for either of them! A friend purchased one based on my recommendation and said he has been very happy with the one he bought as well.
 Love this mattress. Husband and I both said goodbye to our chronic back pain and AM exhaustion.
 Most comfortable mattress I've owned.  Firm, but not hard, and perfectly supportive.  I have no complaints.  I've owned this for ten months, and haven't noticed any sag in the mattress yet.  Don't hesitate with this mattress, and just get it.  Life's too short to waste on uncomfortable sleep.
 Switched to this from a cheap spring mattress I had for about 7 years and the difference is insane. I sleep so much better and the bed is so comfortable. I like a firmer mattress and this one does just fine but still provides a nice padding. The best feature is my partner doesn't feel me move around at night or when I get out of bed early in the morning which was a problem with the spring bed. Would definitely recommend anyone looking for a new bed to buy this mattress.
 This mattress was super easy to set up and took next to no time to reach normal size. I LOVED the good night's sleep I got on this mattress even from the very first day. The support was wonderful, yet the top has a soft feel to it. I would recommend this mattress to anyone. The guarantee is great, so if for some reason you don't like it (I can't imagine that, though), no worries.
 This particular mattress was over-all great. The package arrived on time and came in a large box with handles, which made it easy to carry into the house. Once I unwrapped the packaging, the mattress inflated immediately. There was NO awful foam smell after opening (which was fantastic! unlike other foam mattresses I have purchased in the past). I was able to immediately sleep on the mattress. The mattress is 10 inch and is extremely light weight, which makes it easier to move when I rotate every couple months. VERY comfortable, soft but not too "squishy".
 I usually sleep without pillows because they hurt my neck but this mattress feels firm with the right amount of soft so that my face doesn’t sink in. Sleeping with pillows on other beds have always hurt my neck but I’ve noticed that sleeping with pillows on this mattress is easier on my neck. I also wake up feeling slightly more rested and less stiffness. The bed frame used is from ikea with slats.
 Day #2 on new mattress and I’m in love! For at least the last year Ive been waking up with my arms and hands burning and numb. And my husband and I both suffer from low back pain. After just 2 days I wake up feeling awesome, in no pain and most of all WELL RESTED!!! ❤️ I recommend this mattress and company to anyone looking for a new mattress!
 Owned for less than a year has already significantly sunk in, but of course less than the manufacturing warranty because it springs back up and it’s noticeable just by looking at it shortly as soon as you get off the bed! My boyfriend and myself are both overweight and I was worried this would happen overtime, was suprised it happen within less than a year though. Next time I don’t think I will go with a bed in a box. Plus size buyers be aware, this probably won’t be a good long term solution. Bed was great the first 6 months, I will say that.
 This mattress really surprised me, from the opening of the box to find this tiny compresses mattress.<br/>I'm just glad I read the note suggesting the plastic wrap be removed on the bed where it is going to be used.<br/>We removed the plastic wrap then tore off the the vacuum bag it was in then watched in awe as the mattress took shape.<br/>There was a very minor chemical smell that quickly went away, we made up the bed then tried it out, I'm a big guy so I don't stay in one position very long as I get uncomfortable, on this mattress I found I'm comfortable in any position.<br/>I think we're going to be very happy with this mattress.
 11/21/17: It's been almost 100 days and I wake up with my back hurting. The mattress is great to flop on for a few minutes, but a full night is killer. I'll be returning it.<br/><br/>12/9/18: Didn't get around to returning the mattress. I hate it. I wake up with lower back pain if I try to sleep in.
 First, unfurling the mattress is awesome - film it (we should have).  The price and comfort of this mattress cannot be beat.  We started in furniture/mattress stores and were completely turned off by the prices.  $2000 for a mattress?  $3000 for a mattress?  No way.  I was convinced by the reviews.  I was really worried about buying a mattress online but it turned out to be a sound investment.  I love snuggling in on cooler mornings!  The bed is comfortable and satisfies both me (who likes a tougher mattress) and my husband (who prefers it softer).
 Why, why, why, why... have i waited til now to try this mattress? So much better than the crap i have spent thousands on through the years. My back pain is GONE!  Let me be blunt......this mattress is AWESOME!!! You dont sink into a hole like some others. No springs to wear out. Just buy the darn thing and be done!
 I have to admit, I was skeptical. A bed in a box, really?! But I figured for the price I would suck it up and try it out. And BOY am I glad I did! It took several hours to completely inflate and I think it got still firmer over the next couple of days. It is SO comfortable, with just the right amount of give and support. I like a "firm" mattress, with just enough cushion. This baby does the trick. Rolling over on one side doesn't "bounce" the other sleeper, and I can sneak in and out easily. The side walls don't have a ton of support, but that doesn't bother me at all. I love this bed and will be buying another when the time comes! Made in America too! (Very little off gassing, I'm sensitive to odors but slept comfortably all night from the very first day.)
 This is hands down the best mattress I've ever had. took a few nights to get used to, but once I did, my ongoing shoulder-blade pain and side pain went away. The fact that I had it delivered to me for free in a few days and didn't have to deal with scheduling a delivery service is just icing on the cake. I couldn't be happier with every aspect of this purchase. Best $600 I've ever spent (got 3% cash back for using my Amazon Visa credit card).
 The mattress is a little too firm. It has little give and not as advertised. To give you an idea, it feels like I'm laying on an over-inflated air bed -  it even has that kind of bounce.  One good thing about it is that it inflated really fast with minimal odor.<br/><br/>It's been about a month since my purchase and I am not satisfied with the product, especially for the price. I've made other mattress purchases before through Amazon and they were better and more affordable. I suggest you keep looking.
 Not bad, but seems a little too firm for me.. I wish I would have looked at the thickness as well. The bed in my guest room is much thicker and seems more comfortable. I will most likely go with something  and return this one.
 Heavy material that's incredibly supportive, thick as well as amazingly comfortable.  Package arrived fast, and bed took a very short time (less than 2 hours) to entirely expand.  Was able to set up before entire expansion.  Would highly recommend.
 The mattress feels great! I no longer sweat.<br/>I have fibromyalgia,  and the mattress makes it less painful.<br/>Also,  my dog never stayed on the bed,  but now she stays the whole night!
 Forget going all around town talking to 10 salesmen in Mattress Firm, Mattress Wharehouse, and Mattress Blah Blah Blah trying to sell you a $5000 mattress.  Save your time and money and invest for 1/10th the price delivered to your door.  I've bought four of these over the last few years for two different houses and they are fantastic.  My wife does like it a little softer bed so we invested in a cushioned mattress cover and it does the trick. I couldn't be happier with the quality, cost, and ease of this product. Perfect 10!!!
 It arrived on time we opened the box pulled the mattress out. removed the plastic wrapping from it and watched it inflate like a life raft it was amazing! I slept on it the same night, l slept like a baby I love it. The edges are firm and it sleeps cool and you don’t feel weight transfer when you get in and out of bed. I would buy it again!!!
 In the spare room so do not sleep on it every night.  But when I do it has been a good night sleep and not completely sure but no strain on my back.  Maybe even helped it a bit.  Need more time with it to be sure.
 I like the fact that this bed is all Made in the USA. It arrived quickly, was easy to unpack, and easy to put on to my flats. I have had this bed for approximately a month now and I love it. I also like the philosophy of the company. So far everything is 98%.
 First night's sleep was great, no getting used to it, just very comfortable. I have hip and back problems and it was a leap for me to try the foam mattress, I will never go back. This truly is life changing, I can turn in bed much more easily, no pressure spots in the morning. The dogs love it too! I was told I would have to air it and let it rest. None of that, it was ready for use. My friend has one and told me I would need to accommodate  to it. Not true for me. I am sold.
 This is by far the most comfortable and supportive mattress I've ever slept on. I actually sleep all the way through the night and wake up much more rested than before. I also have always had lower back pain and would attribute it to sleeping on my stomach. This is no longer a problem with this mattress. Highly recommend.
 Have a Tempurpedic at home we love. This was an order for our RV and it is very close in comfort to our  Tempurpedic at 1/4 of the cost. We love it can get up at night and not disturb your partner.  I recommend that if you are looking for a foam mattress you buy the Tuff&amp;Neddle.  So much more comfortable than an innerspring mattress. Would buy again if we ever need a new mattress.
 Ok, so I waited 2 years to do this review so that I can give the BEST possible opinion of this mattress.<br/><br/>First thing to know is that both my husband and I are heavy people.  He's a big, tall guy and I am an average height, thick woman with curves.  This is important to understand how much (or little) my body is supported.  My husband is a hot sleep so no matter what, he will sweat.  However he has never sweat before as much as he does now sleeping on this mattress.  I have never been a hot sleeper but I now sleep very hot on this bed.  I've gone from sleeping with one foot out from under the covers to sleeping with no covers because of how hot this bed sleeps.<br/><br/>When we first started sleeping on the mattress we found that there was not much give.  So much so that our limbs felt like they lay atop the mattress due to there being no contouring to our bodies.  So the heavier parts of us (such as your torso and hips) weigh into the mattress (and yes, I mean WEIGH INTO and not sink into) but because our limbs are lighter, they don't make enough of an impression in the mattress to receive actual support.  I'm guessing it's because the top layer is so firm that it requires a good amount of pressure to then GIVE support.  But it's so bad for us that it's like sleeping on a floor with a hole where my hips would be. No support but there's "give" for my big, roundy bits.<br/><br/>The bed lost support from the first month we owned it.  We kept it because of several reason, one of which was that we wanted to give it a chance to see if the whole thing would "break down" as beds do the longer you sleep on them.  It did not.  We're both side sleepers (I used to be a stomach sleeper but found it IMPOSSIBLE to comfortably sleep on my stomach on this mattress) We DID find that the places where we carry the most weight (him in his torso and me in my hips) has lost it's support the most.  This is a problem when trying to turn over.  It also cause problems for my back,  knees and my hips when I sleep on my back angled towards either side because my hips have NO support.<br/><br/>So overall I would say that this bed is NOT made for heavier people.  It has no support for heavier people but will 'give' once the mattress has broken down, but 'give' in a bad way (think hole in the floor).
 I finally got more than 5 hours of sleep. A little stiffer then I expected but it’s new and I still have time to test it. I definitely like it better than the Sleep Number and Deep Foam style mattresses<br/>previously used.
 I purchased an adjustable base to use w/ this. Been using them both about two weeks. The mattress feels great lying in bed reading etc and I fall asleep quickly. Here is the caveat-when I wake up I am in a severe SEVERE amount of neck, back and shoulder pain for the first 8hrs of the day.  I agonized over this brand for some time so I am really dismayed that I made the wrong decision and petrified to tell my husband as I dont think he’ll believe me
 I am here to tell you this bed is wonderful.I love it The cat loves it my helpers love it .Imagine but soft Easy to turn in,not like being in a marshmallow.It does take 2 people to unpack it .It's rolled up tight in plastic ,so I grabbed the plastic horizontally and  just kept pulling then flipped it on the bed sliced other cover down the middle. It became queen size quickly .It has a nice zippered cover on  It .It's wonderful I am not a spring chicken or a skinny chicken for that matter and this bed gives wonderful support .Couldn't be happier !
 great mattress at a good price.  I had back surgery about 15yrs ago and find this mattress very comfortable.  normally I toss and turn all night but, not on this one.  yes it is rock hard like the reviews state but, I just a cheap $20 foam mattress pad and that makes it soft enough.  how I found this company was on a website called sleep like the dead.  this mattress is rated well for heavy people, back pain, comfortable sex, and no heat.
 This mattress came rolled up in a box.  When we took it out and cut through the plastic wrapper, it puffed right up and was ready to sleep on immediately.  It is very comfortable.  I love it!
 I can't express just how much I like this bed.  It has the feel of a bed that costs three times as much.  I was quite skeptical when it arrived, rolled up, in a smallish box.  I just couldn't see it serving as a substantive mattress choice.  Boy was I wrong.  It quickly filled out and it feels great.  I like a firm mattress, so if you don't like firm, this may not be your cup of tea.  It is perfect for me.  I sleep well and feel great in the morning.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
 I've been sleeping on this mattress for about a month now, and I absolutely LOVE it. It took about two days for it to expand from being compressed for shipping, and I was a little concerned with how firm it was at first. But that third night was absolutely the best night's sleep I've had in years. After a couple of weeks with the new bed, my partner and I decided we needed pillows made from the same material. We purchased <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/9734-GREEN-MONDAY-SALE-9734-Hypoallergenic-Shredded-Memory-Foam-Pillow-with-Stay-Cool-Bamboo-Cover-Dust-Mite-Resistant-Made-in-the-USA-by-Restwel-Queen/dp/B015G70RW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">☆GREEN MONDAY SALE! ☆ Hypoallergenic Shredded Memory Foam Pillow with Stay Cool Bamboo Cover - Dust Mite Resistant - Made in the USA by Restwel - (Queen)</a> and they go perfectly together. They're the ideal combination of softness and support.
 Had a problem with the first mattress but contacted the company and got fast friendly service. I like the mattress but  would have preferred a little softer one since I am a senior but would still recommend  it to anyone.
 So far so good.  Ordered this mattress off Amazon because the shipping was a much better deal than ordering directly from Tuft &amp; Needle's website.  My son seems to like it so far.  It didn't seem to have a bad smell like so many people complain about mattresses like this.
 The bed seems very high quality and has been sleeping great. It is on the softer end and I wish it was a bit more firm. So beware that if you are looking for a very firm mattress this probably isn’t for you. A last note, the mattress really did not have that foam smell some memory foam product give out. Definitely air the mattress out and let it rest before using.
 While I've read mostly positive reviews on this mattress, I've also checked out the negative ones.  And for the most part, I'd disagree pretty vehemently with the negative stuff.<br/><br/>As noted, I'm coming off of a plush, innerspring W Hotel Mattress, which is made by Simmons.  This mattress is well-regarded and has held up well and served me well for a number of years.<br/><br/>But even good mattresses need to be replaced from time-to-time and it was time.<br/><br/>I had some concerns about memory foam mattresses.  Some tend to make you hot when you sleep. I had a supposedly high-quality memory foam mattress topper and it slept hot.  Also, I didn't like the feel of sinking into the memory foam.<br/><br/>So candidly, I was a bit worried about ordering the Tuft and Needle mattress.  In fact, I almost cancelled it a couple of times.  But the 100 day return policy, good pricing, and favorable reviews convinced me that I had little to lose.<br/><br/>The mattress arrived in 2 business days.  I placed it on a "bunkie bed" platform zipper-side down and carefully punctured the wrapper.  It's amazing how quickly this mattress "inflates".  Yes, I know it's not really inflating, but it looks like it's doing that.  The mattress can be used almost immediately.<br/><br/>When I first opened the mattress, there was a minor chemical smell.  It fully dissipated in a day or two.<br/><br/>I can't begin to tell you how comfortable this mattress is.  A lot more comfortable than even my W Hotel Mattress, which was double or triple the retail price.<br/><br/>I like the fact that I sleep on top of the mattress, rather than sinking into the memory foam.  Sure, there's a bit of give, but I'm not surrounded by hot memory foam, so scratch one concern.  In terms of firmness, I'd put this mattress at roughly a 7 on a 10 scale.  Much more firm than my W Hotel Mattress, which I consider to be a good thing.  I have some back issues that are the result of a rear-end collision, and while it doesn't heal or cure my problems, my back has generally felt somewhat better than before.<br/><br/>The mattress does not sleep hot, in my view.  There is very little heat transfer.  I'm also using a waterproof bamboo cover for the mattress, which will protect it and presumably further insulate it from any heat.<br/><br/>But in short, it's a great mattress.  If you're hesitating, don't.  If for some reason you don't care for it, you have a generous trial period during which you can get your money back.<br/><br/>My game plan was to keep the old W Hotel Mattress for a month or two, just to be certain that I liked the Tuft and Needle mattress.  After 1 night, I was sold.  Listed the old mattress as "free stuff" on Craigslist and had someone haul it away within a few days.<br/><br/>A great mattress at a great price.  Highly recommended.  5 stars!
 I was hesitant to purchase a king size mattress online. The very positive comments about T &amp; N customer service convinced me to give it a try. I have slept on the mattress for less than a week, all I can say is I like it very much. I wanted a new mattress because of lower back problems. My old mattress was an expensive mattress, but it was 15 years old. Delivery was quick, unpacking and setting up the mattress was easy for one person. I highly recommend this mattress.
 I have had back surgery and chronic back pain due to ruptured disc in my neck and lower back. I haven't been able to sleep through the night before I got this mattress. I still have some pain in the lower back, but I would definitely recommend it. I can sleep through the night.
 This is our second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. Super fast shipping wonderful company. The Phoenix show room is beautiful and the staff amazing. I will be buying all my children Tuft &amp;Needle mattress from here on out. Takes about a month to break in and once it does bye bye back pain. Thank you for restoring good sleep in my life.
 This mattress was WAY too firm, even with a soft pad on top.  I returned it.
 I'm very happy overall with the product. Packaging was perfect, and if folded out to full size as it was supposed to in about 2 days with no odd or foul smells.<br/><br/>I will say that the mattress is a little on the soft side for me, but I generally prefer a very firm mattress. I have been sleeping on it for about 6 weeks now and it has softened some but not significantly.
 THE BEST VALUE IN A MATTRESS IN THE COUNTRY.  PERIOD.<br/><br/>This is a truly excellent mattress and at a wonderful price!  AND, it was delivered to us in Hawaii!  This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever had...so, we bought another for the guest room!<br/><br/>I can't recommend this highly enough!
 Incredible! This is the second T&amp;N mattress I've purchased. I had one then had to leave it with family as I moved across country and after a week of sleeping on it again ( compared to a aged hand me down traditional ) no back pain, sleeping fully throughout the night, feeling refreshed.. There really is NO comparison! Do your self a favor and get a Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. American made, cheaper than a TempurPedic. The list of pros far outweigh the cons. Cannot praise this enough.
 It’s been 1 month since my bed was delivered and it’s been great! I was concerned the firmness wouldn’t be to my liking but it was fine, the first nights were super , so adjustment periods, just pure undisturbed sleep. Even today, the bed is still super comfy and I wake up refreshed
 This is the second tuft and needle mattress we've bought. We liked the first one so much that we wanted another.<br/><br/>The entire delivery for this mattress was disappointing and it arrived dirty and with the packaging damaged. It was not delivered in a box as expected. The plastic bag it came in was torn open, and the edges around there got dirty.<br/><br/>Quality mattress, but I cannot recommend it if it isn't guaranteed to get to the door in one piece.
 In only we one night was able to toss and turn (always a part of my sleep in past). With hip problems have not done in ages without leg/hip pillow and discomfort waking me. This second night, woke up 6 hours later in strange position, no pillow, no discomfort. So far very pleased
 Just hit about 9 weeks with this mattress. It is unquestionably the most refreshing sleep I've ever had. Just keep in mind that it's on the firmer side, but nothing too crazy. I'm a back and side sleeper, and this seems like the perfect foam for me. Sleeps cool!<br/><br/>I'm never going back to coils!
 It was perfect for few months. Then, as other people mentioned it below as well, it got soft and doesn’t support your body as it should or at least as it has been. My body feels so restless and sore that I just had to sleep on the floor. Right next to my bed with Tuft and Needle mattress. And I actually loved it a lot when we just got it. Two starts because only thanks to this experience I started to consider to sleep on the floor that now I think extremely better for my health and I’m going to get rid of the traditional bed. I guess, thank you?!
 Sleeps hot. Am sleeping in a hole that never recovers. Hard to turn over because I’m in a hole.
 I think I received an open item. The inner liner was not sealed, and I did not have to cut it open to release the mattress. Since the condition said "new" when I placed the order, this is of concern to me. The mattress otherwise appeared to be okay.
 Bought the twin size for a day bed in our nursery. It’s has been great for both sleeping during our baby’s early months, and for sitting. Came tightly packed in a box - cutting the wrapping pffft - instant mattress, right where you need it! Highly recommend
 The mattress is firmer than I ever imagined...enough so that my wife didn't like it and wanted to return it before our 100 day trial offer was up. Unfortunately, I didn't read the Amazon offer details after researching the bed on the Tuft &amp; Needle website....Tuft &amp; Needle offer the 100 day trial. Amazon only gives you a 30 day trial run. So, now we're stuck with it I suppose. My fault for trying to save a few dollars. Really, it's a fine mattress...shipped quick, unwraps and expands easily, no smell, light weight, etc. Just too firm for my wife's back and hips. Now we have to find a pad to put on it to see if that saves us. Anyone in the Ohio Valley wants an almost new California King mattress, just message me!! We can make a deal!<br/><br/>EDIT 7/19/16 - I just added a couple stars to this mattress purchase...after my initial review, the folks at Tuft &amp; Needle contacted me and offered to make my situation right. It turns out however, that a Serta 1.5" gel pad topper was just what the Mrs. needed to make her happy. I always liked the mattress personally and now she's good with it. The fact that the company went out of their way to help me was enough for me to add the extra stars. A++ for effort and customer service.
 The reviews are true that the edge of the mattress is a little insubstantial for sitting, but I can live with it. The mattress provides a steady, stable sleep surface. If you're accustomed to mattresses that bounce and sag, this will take some getting used to.
 Replaced an 8 year old memory foam mattress with this beauty. Love how it’s soft and supportive. No real smells when I open the plastic which was a plus. Expanded pretty quickly and was ready to go. Upgraded to a better night sleep for sure.
 My very first night in this bed, and im here to tell you. I have never been able to go to bed and fall to sleep and not toss and turn all night trying to get comfortable due to back pain. I usually get up with aching back and stiffness. Not at all with this bed. I can only imagine it will get better as it breaks in a bit. I absolutely love this bed.
 This mattress  is just too firm for me,  and aggravates my hips and pressure points in my back.  As much as I want to like it, it just won't work for me and I will have to return it.
 I'm really impressed with the entire Tuft &amp; Needle experience. Delivery was quick and hassle-free and setting up the mattress was a breeze. In terms of mattress quality, I've been sleeping on mine for about a month now, and the quality of sleep I have been getting has been amazing. There was definitely a noticeable increase from my old, cheap box-spring, and I'm not looking forward to sleeping on other mattresses when I travel for school or work. Concerns about temperature while sleeping had prevented me from buying a foam mattress in the past, but I haven't noticed a difference at all compared to my older beds. It's impressive that Tuft &amp; Needle can make a mattress like this, here in America, and sell it as inexpensively as they do.<br/><br/>This combined with how they value customer satisfaction, their free trial period, and other areas (donating unwanted mattresses to charities), makes Tuft &amp; Needle a phenomenal company in my eyes. It was enough to make me actually write a review on Amazon for once. Well done, guys.
 I really liked this mattress and the company but I guess it was just too plush for me causing me to wake up sore. I had some hip pressure which caused stiffness in my feet and lower legs when I first stood up in the morning. After three months, I finally accepted that I had to return it. Returning it was easy.
 So awesome not waking up with a sore back. Have been sleeping better and not waking up several times a night. I did slot of research before buying. The mattress is living up to all its great reviews. Loving it.
 I researched mattresses for over a year before pulling the trigger and buying a Tuft and Needle mattress. The Tuft and Needle mattress is as expected, comfortable but firm.  I am so happy we moved away from a box strings mattress.
 Been on this for a couple months now. It's great. It is a tad firmer than I personally like, but not uncomfortably so. We put a 3 inch topper we already had on top, and it is just right, although I could have been happy without it.<br/><br/>Our prior mattress was a spring mattress with a built-in topper. It lasted us almost 15 years before we decided it was showing its age. I expect this one to last as long if not longer given there are no springs to wear out, but we will see.
 Perfect mattress for our guest bedroom. A little on the hard side, but it should get better once it is broken in.<br/>Came super fast and was wrapped tightly. Be careful when cutting the several layers of wrap around the mattress as to not cut the mattress.
 Although the shipping took two weeks and when I ordered it it said it was Prime and would take 3 days.....the actual review of the mattress is: its amazing, we bought a Casper 2 years ago for one kid then tried this one out now for the second kiddo. They are both really really comfortable I’d buy both again but the gift and needle was about half the price! It’s slighty softer than the Casper
 Bought this for my kid.  He was sleeping on the cheapest mattress I could find.  Ten years later...it was time to upgrade.  He loves the thing.  They are comfortable....really comfortable.  He sleeps like a baby again.  Plus, the price was unbeatable on Black Friday.
 Well, Im still within the 100 days on this mattress. With that being said. Its amazing. I had my old mattress for about 20 years. Im sleeping so much better now and I think Im not snoring as much. Yes, theres an app for that. I wanted a mattress that didn't have glue or latex because Im hot natured and wanted one that breathed. I live in CO and my house doesn't have AC. I have had flannel sheets on the mattress and the windows open and Ive been fine. I highly recommend Tuft and Needle.
 Comfortable. Second Tuff &amp; Needle mattress we have purchased.
 I ordered this brand after much research on mattresses and didn't want one made in China.  We had a 12 year old "famous" named  brand memory foam mattress that was just not working for us anymore.  Too many aches and pains and ruts.  So I order this even though we had friends order other brands.  I am thrilled to say after the first night both my husband and I woke up feeling great.  Being "seniors" we have stiffness and aches in the morning, but this has helped us get back to feeling good in the morning.  It was kind of interested watching it "fill up" with air.  I wish I would have video taped it.  Less than a week and we are very happy.  Time will tell how it holds up, but we are optimistic!!!
 I absolutely HATE this bed. I've had it for about 8 months now. I am a side and stomach sleeper or somewhere in between. I wake up with horrible back and hip pain EVERY.SINGLE.DAY. to somewhat help with the pain this mattress causes, I've had to start  sleeping on my back, which i don't find comfortable at all, and end up tossing and turning and waking up throughout the night.  This was not an issue before i purchased this mattress. My previous mattress was a firm spring mattress, it even had a few springs poking through by the time i ordered the T&amp;N mattress. I slept better on that p.o.s mattress and actually miss it compared to this one. This is the worst sleep I have have ever gotten. I'm pissed that I went with T&amp;N mattress. I was planning on purchasing a different brand, but came across this one. With it's high ratings I felt like i was making a good choice. After sleeping on it,  I'm having a hard time believing the accuracy of their ratings.  I was really excited and looking forward to receiving this mattress.  They say there is a two week break in period, so i thought it would get more comfortable, It didn't. Here i am 8 months later, tired every day from a crappy nights sleep and horrible back pain. I absolutely regret buying this mattress and at this point will I will be staying away from all of these foam mattresses in a box.
 We have ordered king size mattress and the height of the mattress is not 10 inches. We have measured the length and it’s about 7.5inches tall. Very disappointed that they would mislead costumers with their measurements! Our backboard is very tall, even with a tall baseboard the mattress still is not tall enough as we thought it would have been an actual 10 inches tall
 Had a Tempurpedic... dog liked the taste of it (a long story).... didn't want to spend Tempurpedic money again. Based on Amazon user reviews, I  took a chance, sight unseen and now I sleep just as comfortably on my new Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress as I used to my (now) chewed up high dollar mattress.  Sound sleep, comfortable sleep, wake up without aching bones sleep....  you remember that kind of sleep when you're a kid and you're waking up to a new day?!  Yeah, that sleep.
 After reading reviews on most all other mattress I choose T&amp;N even though they were a bit higher than some. I love it.  I did put down 3/4 plywood on my full size platform bed and then put the mattress on top of that.  I have a firm yet soft bed if that makes any sense.  If I sit on the edge it will sink down but laying my whole body on it to sleep, its firm enough that I don't sink in.  I have already recommended this to my daughter and she and her husband are getting the king size.
 I LOVE this bed!!!! I was scared but after i got it i was so happy I did. By far the best mattress ever!!!!!!!!
 This mattress arrived in a nice box.  Was easy to roll out and it was ready to sleep on in just a few hours.  I love the comfort and I am sleeping much better on this mattress. I would recommend this to everyone. Love it.
 I wanted to take a minute to update this review 2 years later. I can honestly say that this mattress feels just as great as it did the first day we slept on it! I have recommended it to many people and will only buy Tuft &amp; Needle for all of my mattress needs. Absolutely worth every penny!!!<br/><br/>Original review from 2016: This mattress is exactly what they advertise. My husband and I are highly satisfied, we searched long and hard for the right mattress. The foam they use is perfect, it's always cool and it springs back to it's full form instantly. Absolutely no complaints here!
 I think I love this bed. The greatest thing is it actually does keep me cool, and I didn’t even realize it until I had to sleep in a hotel bed last week, and woke up covered in sweat, even though the room was at 68 degrees. My home is much warmer and I still never weak up sweaty.
 The mattress is ok but going forward I’ll try anything but a foam mattress. It was a lot lower than I expected &amp; I feel I’ve had more back &amp; neck problems since I’ve gotten it .. in the beginning it was pretty good .. now not so much
 This mattress is impressive, and it really does puff up, keep its shape, and look great, but it is FIRM. I was hoping for a little more give, I think I will have to order a topper to get the comfort I was looking for.
 Super comfortable. Super affordable. Super buy. The unpacking was a breeze. Takes about 3 nights to break in properly. At first I thought it was very hot but it turns out it just needed to break in for the airflow to flow properly. The customer service for this company is amazing as well. Can't beat the return policy either. Press buy now.
 I was having trouble sleeping. Pain was waking me up in the middle of the night. This was the 4th mattress I bought and thankfully it is perfect for my pain issues! A friend recommended it. I’m not sure I would’ve been brave enough to try it otherwise, although the return guarantee is excellent!
 This is the finest mattress I've ever slept on.  It makes a world of difference on how long and how deep I can sleep. There is no comparison to our old conventional spring filled mattress. Both my wife and I took to this mattress from the first night on.
 This. Mattress. Is. Awesome. Comfortable, doesn't heat up a lot and has great support. A few weeks ago, I talked to customer support in regards to an older 5 inch model and they expressed a lot of care for my situation and sent me the 10 inch within days!<br/><br/>If you add the technology of this mattress, the price point, and the customer service if you ever need to resolve the issue, this is well worth every single dollar.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to purchase another mattress from T&amp;N.<br/><br/>Thank you!
 returned the first mattress i got from another company because of the smell<br/>This one is MUCH better no problem at all and very comfortable
 About a week in so far and really happy with this, this is my first mattress purchase in over 10 years. Thanks for the prime day!
 Bought this mattress for a family member. He has fibromyalgia and most mattresses hurt his joints. Not this one!  It is firm enough, but allows the body to sink a bit and not put pressure on the joints.. He's had the mattress for a couple of months, and it shows no signs of  wear. The only thing is, Why do they call it Tuft &amp; Needle?  It's not tufted and the cover may be sewn or maybe electronically fused. It is just basically a pillow cover on foam. Not complaining, just wondering.
 I love this mattress. It's firmer than I'm used to but so freaking comfortable. I've never been as happy with my bed as I am right now.
 We've had our mattress several weeks now.  It has been exactly as described.  It was fun watching it unroll on the bed, and even better discovering that it is firm yet very comfortable.  Our only problem has been that we find ourselves so comfortable that we oversleep!
 I've had my new mattress for a couple of weeks, and I love it so far. It's moderately firm, which is what I wanted. I don't sink into it like a lot of memory foam mattresses. It sleeps cool, which was a major concern I had. Provides excellent support. I'm an average sized guy, 165 lbs., and this mattress is just right for me. So glad I didn't spend more.
 As others suggested we bought two twin xl mattresses to form a king. We sleep 'hot' so we were a bit leary of the foam trapping in our body heat. We've been pleased so far, you'll get a hot spot but it's not uncomfortable. These are great for people who sleep on their side as well.
 Disappointed. The mattress is extremely soft.  At first it wasn't so bad, I slept well and was well rested but now 3 months in, my back is always in immense pain and I'm constantly tossing and turning.  I feel cranky and can't even sit on it without sinking in.  Customer service wasn't very helpful - I was placed on hold for long periods of time.The trial for the mattress should have been longer.
 Excellent bang for the buck mattress, I was skeptical upon purchasing it that it would actually be comfortable given its relatively low price.  It’s comfort is comparable if not better than the Tempupedic Supreme Breeze I have in my other bedroom.  I’d definitely recommend this to a friend.
 We just replaced the last mattress in our house and now have 4 beds from Tuft&amp;Needle.  This offers firm, uniform support and is a great value.  If you want a little softer feel add a good quality mattress pad.  Doctor recommended!
 I am extremely happy with the product.  It has the right level of firmness and comfort for even the most finicky sleepers like myself.  The package I thought looked very small for a bed when it arrived.  However, when I opened it I was very pleasantly surprised.  The moment I ripped open the seal, the bed fluffed up right into place.  I had a backache the day the bed arrived and by morning time I felt better without any medicine.<br/><br/>Now I regret that all my other beds my home are not T&amp;N beds.  I spent oodles of money on Serta, Sleep Number, and other types, and now wish I hadn't.
 Heaven in a box. We have to have a box mattress because of stair issues and trying to get a standard bed up stairs just wasn't going to happen. I was nervous buying this but went for it after reading other reviews. It is without a doubt the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on and have since recommended it to everyone I come in contact with. I no longer wake up sore or achy, and actually feel refreshed!
 Bought the Queen version for home since it was time I upgraded from my childhood twin size. For an Asian who grew up with their mother insisting I sleep on extra firm beds, this bed feels amazing. It provides a firm-level of support and yet lets you sink in just the right amount (I am a side sleeper). I loved it so much I bought the king sized version for the city where I live now.<br/><br/>Unpacking is easy too. Just take it out of the box, unroll, and cut the plastic wrapping off and it will inflate in no time.
 We are full time RV’ers and travel the country for hubbys job..  we bought this as a replacement for a mattress purchased from a big mattress store..  it broke down and we both hurt every morning..  BUT this mattress is AWESOME..  hubby snd I are both sleeping great and not hurting every morning..  great job Tuft and Needle
 I love my mattress. I purchased one for the guest room and realized how comfortable it was, that I purchased one for my own bedroom. I no longer have a back ache in the morning and I sleep so soundly. This mattress is great. Though you don't hear advertisements on the radio, as you do for other mattresses; you won't go wrong. The price is reasonable and you really can't go wrong. If you decide it's not for you, there is a great return policy. Sleeping well, Tessa
 Okay, so we've only had it a day, but my hard to please teen, who is long and tall, loves it.  We all do!  I think T and N are really onto something.  I suggest watching their video.  It is supportive yet conforms to body in the right places.  I am really pleased!  It arrived in 4 days too! Wow!<br/><br/>Cant comment on long-term wear.  I will post again next year.
 Updating after having the mattress for almost 4 months. I don't know about smells, sinking and being hot. I haven't experienced any of this. It took some time to get used to the firmness, and the mattress has been amazingly comfortable. I still give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>Quick shipping after waiting over 6 weeks for a Nectar mattress which never materialised. Ordered 1/11, arrived 1/15. THANK YOU! I've only had the mattress one day, but I am very happy. I slept well for the first time in ages. Comfortable in all positions. My back is supported.
 The price for this mattress is great. Even better in my case since it was on sale just that day I purchased it. The mattress is fairly firm at first. It gets softer the more you sleep on it. I bought a twin. It may differ in some cases due to having a smaller middle area of the mattress to sleep on. I think a twin mattress may have more pressure on the sides since it is smaller in width. You have several months to sleep on it and decide for yourself. So you won't waste your money.
 Sadly I am going to have to return this one. I have only had it a week but just can't sleep on it. If you like a firm mattress this ones for you. It is just too firm for me. Feel like I am lying on a board. Shipping to the house was no problem. The king comes in a large and heavy box, so it will need two people to get it inside. Once opened, the mattress expanded in no time and had very little smell. One plus of this mattress is there is very little motion transfer. I really couldn't feel my husband tossing and turning. It also does not sleep hot at all. If it was a little softer, i would have kept it.
 Pretty comfy. It’s a bit firm, so I put my 3in mattress pad on top of it and I look forward to jumping into my cozy bed every day.<br/>I’ve only had it for 2 months, but so far no sagging.<br/>The only mattress I’ve slept on that was more comfortable was a very expensive plush pillow top mattress.
 We've bought our first mattress from Tuft &amp; Needle - and couldn't be happier with the purchase. It's been a month since the purchase, so comfortable. The price ($750 total with taxes + 5%cash back thanks to Amazon Prime credit card) + quality = 5 stars!<br/>Plus, Amazon delivered it even faster than they predicted. Thank you guys for the great job!
 AmazeBalls!!!! Love love love this mattress! Super comfy. Even my somewhat “particular on what I sleep on” boyfriend loves this bed. Now we don’t wake each other up if one turns or gets in/out of the bed. Really superior product and well priced compared to all the other online mateesss stores!
 There is something to being able to try a mattress before you buy it.  This is a great super comfortable mattress, it was just a little bit to soft for me.  I returned it and went with a Helix which has a bit more customization to it in regards to support.
 The best mattress I've ever slept on.<br/><br/>No, but seriously. This is the best mattress I've slept on!<br/><br/>I was a little worried it would be too firm for me, but it's just right.<br/><br/>I'm a side/stomach sleeper and my pillowtop was leaving me with a sore back the past few months. I've heard nothing but good things about the T&amp;N mattress. I've had it for about a week now and even since day one, not broken in at all, I slept through the night and awoke feeling refreshed and without any back pain!<br/><br/>I love it. It also sleeps very cool so I don't find myself overheating.<br/><br/>Thanks, T&amp;N. This mattress is beyond amazing!!
 very comfortable and I have some serious back issues. No more constant flipping. Easy set up, good return policy if not happy.
 Softer than expected which isn’t for me, overall pretty nice mattress but would’ve rather gone with a different one
 We have given this bed nearly 8 months to try out to give a TRUE HONEST REVIEW.  It came is a nice small box. Super manageable carrying up a flight of stairs. We let the bed air out for over a day to rid of any smells. There was a tiny bit of a smell when first opening but went away quick.<br/><br/>The only problem, I'm not sure if it's the mattress or our kind sized bed frame, but there is a gap on the ends no matter which way you turn the bed.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews said the bed was pretty firm but I disagree.  I would say on a 1-5 firmness level it's about a 4.  For the first few months I had EXTREME back pain when laying on my back, that has not subsided.  I'm not sure if it was my body adjusting to a new bed or what.  Now, I can lay on my back and sides no problem.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!
 My wife and I both LOVE this mattress.  We bought the metal frame and mattress which looked a little small when first set up.  But we both sleep well, feel rested and wake up with no pain, how Wonderful!
 I slept better on the first night!  This was a significant improvement over my previous mattress, a Select Comfort mattress (basic model), which I had for about 7 years.  My lover back pain and stiffness had been getting progressively worse from my old mattress.  The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress felt great and I was able to sleep all night for the first time in several years.  A great product at a great price.  Thank you T&amp;N!
 I bought my mattress in September, and it's great so far. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the 10 inch thickness,  I would like it better if it was deeper.  It hasn't gone flat anywhere, is medium firm, doesn't feel hot, puffed up fast, did smell a bit when I took it out of the box,  but that was gone quickly. I am considering buying a gel top to add to it's thickness, and because I think I would like more of a sinking into it feel. But, all in all, I like my Tuft and Needle.
 I used this to sub for a hospital bed mattress for my mom.  Even after having to give up her comfy queen mattress she hasn’t complained. I put this mattress on an adjustable bed from Lucid.  It’s not a hospital bed but it allows caregivers to access each side which was my main concern anyway.  Love the Lucid too.
 Great mattress!  Very pleased-This purchase was long overdue but well worth the wait.  After lots of research, looking at multiple stores and websites, Tuft &amp; Needle was the way to go.  You have 2 choices of mattresses based on desired thickness, which makes it simple and easy.  Buying a mattress should not take hours and hours out of the day.  Another great aspect is that it gets mailed straight to your door.  No hassle with hauling it home, etc.  The price point is very good based on my previous comparison with other mattress prices.  I would not have guessed I could be excited about purchasing a mattress, but when you consider how much time you spend sleeping in your lifetime I'm definitely excited and refreshed.  Sleeping the best we have in years-no joke!
 Possibly the best mattress I have ever slept on. Not too firm not too soft. I was worried about it being to hot bc of the foam, but its just right. Also, there is no risk in buying..if you dont like it donate it- love the culture. Love the product. Not to mention the price is great!
 This mattress is crowned in the middle.  One has a tendency to fall off the bed easily which is not really a good thing if it is purchased for a man with congestive heart failure.  THere are better mattresses out there.
 Best matress we have ever had. We just upgraded to a king. We tried 5 different mattresses before, from sleep number, to memory foam. This is by far the best matress for people with bad backs or necks.
 Pretty comfortable, but no edge support, feels like you're rolling off the edge
 I let it air out for 2 hours and slept on it no problem. No smell at all. Very soft for me. Also lighter than I expected. I love it so far.
 This mattress is way too firm, not comfortable at all.  I wake with back pain and headaches daily.
 Am very pleased with our new mattress. It is a little firm but getting use to that. The fact that it was a consumer report best pick in 2015 led me to choose a Tuft  and Needle mattress.  And the 100 day warrenty sold me.  The ease of shopping online and having it delivered in a box that was manageable was such a plus. Not having to go to a store and choose one from among dozens was so nice.
 My wife and I bought this as a guestroom mattress. Tried it ourselves after the trial was up and had terrible back pain even after giving it a shot for a month. The mattress warms up and gets softer and softer through the night eventually leaving no support and we both wake up with terrible back pain. Do not buy this product.
 Great bed for our spare bedroom. Soft on top and firm when compressed. The bed keeps you insulated but cool at night. $350 is a lot for a twin size bed but this one is worth it! FYI Same price to buy directly from their website and you get 100 nights to try it out!
 Slept on my new mattress for the first time last night... so comfortable! It feels like sleeping on a cloud. My lower back is very sensitive to mattresses and I awoke without the stiffness and pain that I often have. Setup was super easy and T&amp;N recommends only a few hours to fully expand, so I was able to sleep on it the first night. Also, there was a slight "new synthetic" smell, but nothing "bad" or overwhelming (like reviews I have read of other mattresses). I am so satisfied with my purchase!
 By the time the return window is up you will have a $700 marshmallow. Booo. Back hurts every day now
 I have only had this mattress a few days but so far so good. A little on the hard side but good none the less. The delivery was fast, unpacking and putting on top of my old boxspring was fine. I didn't detect any oder or off gas. my sleep has been sounds and feels well in any sleeping position.
 I was really excited about replacing my 7 year old mattress with TnN and got my new mattress delivered four weeks ago. I was very comfortable the first couple of weeks, but last 10 days or so, I've developed a discomfort/slight pain on my middle back. I'm a back sleeper and the pain get more intense towards middle of the night, so I keep twisting around. Initially, I thought I pulled my back during a workout, but I realized that it is as a result of the mattress. I'm completely fine during the day and only feel this during middle of my sleep. Not sure if it being a little on the firmer side is causing it or if the middle of the bend is dented. Have requested for a replacement to see if it still is causing it. Fingers crossed.
 I think this is a great mattress for the money.  It's still fairly new.  I think it's not settling in the middle, meaning it's taller in the middle, so I will keep my eye on that....hopefully it will settle.
 received 2 twin size for my king sized bed and we love them . we are senior citizens and it has helped my back very much. we handled them very easily. You sold me Tuft &amp;Needle thanks for a wonderful product and good nights sleep.
 Purchased two for my daughters/hubbies in my summer home. Both said comfortable and happy! I had bought a different brand of mattress on Amazon earlier this year and the smell of mold was so bad I had to toss it away! This one barely has any scent when opening.
 I bought this for my sister who has a lot of pain. She sleeps mucth better on this . it fits her needs, only being 5"1 and 95lbs.
 I've spent my entire life sleeping on the old mattress and box spring beds. This mattress doesn't have any springs that dig into your back and there is no need for box springs. For the price and quality this bed is simply outstanding. I absolutely love this bed.
 Contemplated this purchase for a while before pulling the trigger. Both my wife and myself feel as if it sinks too much but we added a couple of 3” memory foam pillow tops which made a HUGE difference. Very comfortable!!! Bottom line is we spent less than $1,000 for the bed, steel frame and two pillow tops and we couldn’t be happier.
 I love this mattress!  It is comfortable and cool!  I was sleeping on an older mattress and it was causing back problems.  Imagine how thrilled I was when I slept on my new Tuft and Needle mattress and got a great pain-free night of sleep.  Since then I have continued to enjoy this mattress and I am so glad I bought it.
 I was nervous about purchasing an out-of-the-<br/>box mattress, but I could not be happier. I’ve had the mattress for several months and have loved it. It is very comfortable and I no longer wake up with an aching back. My dog seems to love the mattress and now even prefers the bed to the couch. My only complaint is that now I enjoy sleeping too much.
 The mattress was delivered on time and has the right amount of firmness.  The box was damaged but the contents were OK. The only issue was lack of instruction on how to unpack and install.  I have previous experience with a Casper mattress so we pretty much knew what to do.  It took about 8 hours for it to fully expand, so don't install it just before bedtime.
 This is by far the best mattress I've ever slept on. It's surprising how soft, supportive, and cool it stays throughout the entire night. I was skeptical about the box delivery and the fact that it's quite a bit cheaper than Casper for the California King, but the Consumer Reports article calling it the highest-rated brand made me pull the trigger. I'm very glad I did.
 The best mattress I've ever had! It really is very comfortable. It's firm but not too firm. It arrived in two days and it was very easy to set up. I'm very happy with this purchase.
 Smelled like Vanilla when it arrived. Very durable. I would recommend some sort of box spring or platform, however, as that does improve the overall feel. But very supportive - and that's coming from someone with a bad back who carries extra weight.
 I love this mattress so much! Very affordable price. Super quick delivery. Very easy to pull out of the package and unroll. And extremely comfortable for me and my two cats.
 Awesome mattress.  Shipped well in a compressed rolled tube and heavy box. Fairly lightweight and easy for one person to move. "Uncompresses" from a vacuum packed state in about 2 minutes.  I slept on mine about an hour later as I set it up around 10:00 pm.  Mattress is what I would call extra-firm. Foam mattresses tend to be hot, but this one is neutral. I dont sink into it very much, but it does support me on my side at most every location.
 Very nice quality matteress. The outer cover is nicely done and hints at the overall quality of the product.  I think it is a good price balance between the $1,000+ and the cheap made in China alternatives.<br/>How it sleeps is a very subjective so all I can say is I prefer a firmer mattress but I am not too picky and I slept well.
 We love this bed!  I was hesitant to buy a foam mattress as my parents have an old temperpedic in their guest room and it is not comfortable.  That is not the case with the Tuft &amp; Needle. I have no hip and lower back pain with this bed.  Great product with a great price. Will definitely buy from T&amp;N for future needs.
 This is the most beautiful foam bed I've seen.  GORGEOUSly made.  It could be firmer for my back so I am going to donate mine.  But if you're ok with medium to firm please treat yourself.  Lovely.
 LOVE IT! I've never slept so deeply in my life, AND I hardly snore at all since we got it! Arrived flat and rolled up in a box, inflated almost instantly!
 Most uncomfortable mattress ever.  I was going to burn it, but my stepdaughter wanted it for herself.
 I have been sleeping on this for two years and it is by far the most comfortable mattress I have ever used.  My girlfriend loves it and I have recommended it to multiple friends.
 This mattress is great for the price. We bought it for a guest bed and it is super comfy. We own a Caspar queen and were pleased to see that the Tuft and Needle is just as good.
 This is by far the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever slept on and it keeps me cool at night. In my old mattress, I woke up every morning sore and drenched in sweat after waking up several times during the night. This mattress is so comfortable I sleep through the whole night and wake up with zero pain and zero sweat! Can not recommend this strongly enough!!
 So far, I really like this mattress. It was easy to unpack, and it filled out immediately. The smell was not bad, after 24 hrs, I barely noticed it. I must say it is pretty firm. 7.5 out of 10. But I like it, and it seems to be softening a bit more every night. It seems like a good quality mattress so far. Time will tell.
 Easy to unbox, set up with 1-2 people. Mattress is comfortable if you want a firmer mattress. This is in a guest room so it doesn’t get much use, might would soften if it was used every night.
 I really like this mattress.  It is relatively firm, it grew to its final size right after opening it.  I recently also bought a 'lucid' mattress and I wish I had bought another of this brand instead.<br/><br/>Only negative comment is that there is a pretty strong smell initially.  I would recommend giving it several weeks to air out before asking anyone to sleep on it.
 I love this product as well as this company.  I have had nothing but good results from their mattresses as well as their customer service. I have them on all of my beds.  Guests that stay here comment on how there was no adjustments to a new bed.  I take that as a high compliment. I was around a group of melennials the other day and heard them all talking about "their" Tuft and Needle".  It's a great product and I'm happy to tell all I know about it.  Comfort plus!
 We bought this for our guest bedroom. We wanted something of good quality, but we didn't want to spend a ton of money. This mattress fit that need quite well. It is extremely comfortable and will made for such a reasonable price.
 Outstanding in balance between firmness and comfort -- possibly the best mattress we have owned.  Which is why we bought three of them, one for our main house and two for our vacation house.  Highly recommended!
 I read all of the reviews and the unbiased analysis at the sleeplikethedead website and I thought this would be a good mattress.  It has been a month so far and I love it. firm (but not too much) so far hasn't felt warm (although I need to wait for a summer night in texas to judge that).  Edge support is not as good as a spring mattress, I would buy this again.
 The mattress has been great for my neck and back issues.  It is firm, but cradles your body, just as I believe it should.  It arrived timely, in great shape and was inflated in no time!  My husband and I's only complaint would be that it sleeps a little hot.  I would have hoped for a little cooler mattress.
 I bought a T&amp;N mattress (directly from T&amp;N so we could have a longer return period) for our guest room, and it turned out to be so comfortable I looked for excuses to sleep on it. Finally decided a few months later to just order a second one. I was really skeptical before ordering initially, but It's amazingly firm and comfortable. We have needed to let both air out a bit before sleeping on them because of the smell, but it dissipates after a few days.
 i wish it was softer its too firm and ive had it over a month and still wake up with backpain
 Very soft and comfortable. It was a change in fe from having a box spring. Been sleeping on it a couple of months now.
 I decided to try this queen mattress after having a fusion operation that removed three discs and added a rod and four screws in my back. Our old mattress was not comfortable for me any more even though it was rather high price five year old. I waited over two months to do this review so that I would have better idea on comfort and I have to say it is the most comfortable mattress I have ever had. The first time I that I got in it I was not sure I would like it but within two minutes I was sold. I highly recommend this to anyone.
 VERY happy with this mattress!! I was hesitant to buy a $700 mattress online, but I am glad i did. Not too firm, not too soft. My husband is just over 300 pounds and this mattress holds up wonderfully. No body impressions - but even if we end up with them later, the warranty covers it!
 This matress is awesome. It offers just the right amount of support. I no longer have issues falling asleep or getting up because my back doesnt hurt. I highly recommend this. If it's time to ditch your old one you will love the switch
 One of the best mattresses we have owned. It was a little on the firm side for my wife at first so we put our old memory foam topper on it. After a few days we did not need it. I sleep much better on this mattress than I did on my old inner spring from Serta.<br/><br/>If you are hesitant due to the price, we were also. We assumed because it was affordable it would not be as good as the latex/foam hybrids at the bedstore for $2500, but it definitely met all our expectations.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews complained about a chemical smell. We did not experience this, we took it out of the box and slept on it the same night that it arrived.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. I have used several different well known, high dollar mattresses in the past and none of them have even come close to how comfortable this one is. The low price of Tuft and Needle is just a bonus—I would have gladly paid three times the price, but their commitment to affordability is amazing! In addition, their return policy, which directs customers who wish to return the mattress to donate it instead to a local shelter (for a full refund) is inspiring. What a great give back.
 Love this mattress! It's firm and yet very plush for me. I am a fluffy person and it supports my weight. I am in love with the fact compared to other mattresses in the past this one has a great warranty, when my 85lb dog fly's on the bed I am not disturbed and the price is perfect.
 I love this mattress. It is a bit firmer than I am used to, as I switched from a select comfort. However, I sleep like a baby on it.
 It was delivered in a box folded up, after taking out of the box I let it sit for a day, and after that it has been extremley comfortable. I would recommend this matress to anyone, it's not too soft or to firm, somewhere in the middle.
 Very comfortable. I went from a pillow top to a T&amp;N and there is a big difference. It is not as soft but it contours to your body. The packaging was great and the mattress was in great conditions.
 Too firm for people who have shoulder pain. My shoulders were squished into my neck and both hurt pretty bad. Other than that it was comfy sleeping on my back.  It was a pleasant experience getting it set up and easy to make the bed as well as getting up and down in the night without disturbing spouse. Didn't sink much at all. Amazon was amazing in refunding my purchase!
 Finally, a mattress that is as amazing as promised.  It is everything all the reviews and advertising promised and then some.  We could not be happier.  After 3 months, if we could spend all of our hours on this mattress, we would.
 very firm Husband tried the toooer and it still wasn’t comfy. Great customer service but def not a fan of the mattress
 I had slept on a Tuft and Needle mattress before. So I was so excited to be able to get mine through Amazon. It arrived in great condition and didn’t have any issues with its expansion. Love my bed. Firm enough and not too firm. Would recommend and purchase again!
 I like the looks of it but I have not slept on it.  It is in the guest bedroom and my sister slept on it.  She said she loved the comfort.  However the mattress sits on a boxspring and it slides to one side or the other.  I may have to put a non-slide material between the box spring and mattress to keep it in place.
 I highly recommend this mattress. My 18 year old is very happy with it. Amazing price. Could not believe how small the package was, then we opened and out popped this regular sized mattress - great that they were able to not have to ship in a huge oversized box. Mattress offers support and comfort with the best price I have seen! Worth trying this.
 After one week of use-the biggest concern so far is the smell of the foam. We don't like it and hope it goes away. Mattress feels quite firm and might require some adjustment.<br/>Will add to review if smell does not improve.
 So far this bed has been amazing. It's only been about a week but my boyfriend and I are very happy with it. I don't sink into the bed when i sleep on my stomach like I used to with our old bed. I wake up feeling refreshed instead of having to stretch out my back due to bad back pain. It is very firm but so comfortable.
 Simple to set up. Sooooo comfy. Will update if I find any issues with it. But for now, I think I'm in love, ha.
 Arrived on time. Mattress is not too squishy, nor too firm, and bounces back well. For a 100lb person who sleeps on their side and back, it feels on the firmer side but conforms a little. For a 180lb person, it does give a little more, but is supportive.
 LOVE! I am a frequent prime user and never write reviews, but this product is deserving. Was a little skeptical after seeing some reviews about the firmness of the mattress being too much, but I think it's the perfect balance. I've gotten the best sleep in years. Setup was easy and seamless and you don't have to get harassed by a salesman. I will recommend this product to anyone that will listen.
 The mattress arrived. I opened the package and let it "freshen up" for about 36 hours before moving it to the bed frame to be made up for sleeping that night.  So far I LOVE this mattress; nice to awaken with no back pain.
 Arrived and unpacked as explained. Unfortunately, it is spongy, but hard and the edges are not solid.  Both my wife and I felt like we were about to fall out of bed. Returned it.
 I normally do not write reviews but this mattress deserves a 10/10!! I suffer from a herniated disc on my lower back which makes it v difficult for me to find a mattress that is completely comfortable for me. T&amp;N mattress is just the perfect amount of firm and soft! The mattress truly molds into the shape of your body and hugs your body without being too tight. It also has a cooling sensation so it keeps me nice and cool through the night. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
 I'm not sure about this mattress. We have a king size that's 2 years old and ordered a new queen one. The queen one feels WAY softer than our king sized one. It's been up for about a month and hasn't gotten super firm like our king one. The queen one feels amazing! And the king size one is pretty okay. Just not sure why they feel so different
 so comfy! i am delighted with my mattress.  im not hot at night either, like with last mattress.<br/>came rolled up, easy to unwrap. opened and left them to settle for a couple days. did not detect any odors.<br/>edges are firm enough to sit on<br/>works great with the adjustable frame we got
 Very comfortable mattress for regular sleepers without special needs, e.g. orthopedic or back problems. After trying one out we gave up our spring mattresses and bought one for every room in the house. Ninety day free return. Have not had to use it but good to know it’s there for those who may not take to it.
 Update 10/29/15 - Increased from 2 stars to 5<br/><br/>Shortly after posting my review, I noticed a response from T&amp;N. Their customer service agents were quick to follow up to my subsequent inquiry and got me set up with a topper to help remedy the too firm mattress. It might seem silly that someone would buy a new mattress just to turn around and throw a topper over it. I thought the same at first but was willing to give it a shot. I picked up a 2" topper at the recommendation of the T&amp;N service agent (the cost of the topper was covered by T&amp;N). Having slept on the toppered mattress for a week now, I can say with certainty that I have never slept on a better bed than what we have now. In addition to the 2" ventilated 15-ILD Talalay latex topper (from Ultimate Sleep) we outfitted the bed with Protech Performance sheets. The Protech sheets are made of a material that is very similar to exercise stretch clothing - thin, silky, and a bit stretchy. The slight stretchiness of the sheets is what allows the topper to fully conform where as conventional cotton cloth sheets would tend to stiffen up the foam topper response.<br/><br/>Imagine a bed that is firm enough to fully support your body so you don't sag in the mid-section, yet feels cushy enough that it feels like you're sleeping on clouds, and all at the same time breathes amazingly well. The impossible combination of characteristics in the holy grail of beds! Although intuitively, it would not seem like the T&amp;N mattress itself contributes much, it does make a difference. Out of curiosity, we tried just the topper on the carpet floor in our bedroom - the floor was just too stiff and even with the topper, it was uncomfortable after 10-15 minutes. Next, we tried the topper on our old spring mattress - too much sag, not enough support led to our mid-section sagging into the bed (Both my wife and I are 5'6" and around 150 lbs). The T&amp;N mattress provides that middle ground of a supportive base with enough give to really bring it all together for us.<br/><br/>Also, the service agents at T&amp;N were super pleasant to talk to and helped make this a fantastic purchase experience.<br/><br/>****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br/>I purchased the 10" Cal King mattress and it arrived about a week ago. Packaging was good, and getting the compressed mattress rolled out and released from it's plastic vacuum bag proved easier than expected. It more or less fully expanded within the first minute or two. Over the next few hours, it might've puffed up just a touch more.<br/><br/>The outer fabric case has a nice velvety feel and initially, the compression/softness felt pretty good. After airing out for a few hours, I got a mattress protector on it, and some sheets. Sleeping on it the first night, was unfortunately, quite uncomfortable. While it felt cushy enough at first, it firms up  with just a little compression. Over a few hours, my wife and I were both feeling sore. Felt almost like sleeping on a carpet floor. Just a bit of cush, and then surprisingly firm.<br/><br/>The instructions said to give the mattress a week to break in so here we are, a week later. I can't say it's been the best week of sleep. I'm still waking up sore every morning. We ended up removing the mattress protector and eventually, even the mattress sheet in order to improve the cushiness. Additional layers of sheet tend to stiffen up the response of foam mattresses.<br/><br/>I'm a back sleeper, occasionally I'll rotate to my side during the night. This is definitely NOT a the mattress you want if you're a side sleeper. It'll work it you over undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Aside from the intense firmness however, I do like that the mattress breathes very well. I don't over heat sleeping on this mattress. But unfortunately, I also don't stay asleep much either.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm thinking I might be returning this mattress. I really wanted to love it but it's just tooooo firm!
 Very comfortable. It’s soft, but firm at the same time. I’m used to a pillow top mattress so I was hesitant at buying a mattress that wasn’t. So far  it’s one of the best beds I’ve had.
 Will take a bit getting used to but pro is that i dont feel my bf whale flopping like I used to.
 We purchased a twin mattress from Tuft and Needle several years ago.  It never seemed to change in it's level of comfort.  Recently, I moved the mattress and noticed some patches of mold on the bottom, between the  mattress cover and the box spring.  I enquired through T&amp;N about what to do and they assured me that their main concern was health and safety and this situation and they would NOT take the risk of just having us clean the cover.  Within a matter of days of us proving our purchase, sending pics of the mold, and emailing them our concerns, we had a replacement mattress sent to our home.  The customer service has been phenomenal with emails and phone calls.  We will definitely be making sure our next mattress purchase comes from T&amp;N.
 Mattress got delivered on time.  Per Tuft &amp; Needle, you only need to air out the mattress for about 2-3 hours before using it, but we waited for about 1 day before actually laying on it.  Unlike other mattresses where you have to wait for days to air out and expand, this was ready to use almost immediately.  It is not too firm, and not too soft.  Very comfortable and good quality.  Love it!
 I'm not one for hyperbole. I simply cannot wait to get into bed in this thing. I used to turn every hour or so at night. Now it happens maybe twice per night, and I wake up feeling incredible. I look forward to sleeping! (I just realized this makes me sound depressed)<br/>Additionally, memory foam (which this is not) isn't very conducive to "adult time", this thing is great for it though.<br/>If I had a warning, it might be that it could be too firm for some people, but I recommend just getting it and seeing, then returning if you need to.<br/>Smells went away after one day but were not strong. Great product overall.
 I was surprised that a mattress for $500 that comes in a small box could be so comfortable. I've had it for about 6 months now and it is still comfortable.
 Simply put this mattress was a miracle for me. For years I’ve struggled with lower back pain from sports injuries when I was younger. Within about 3 nights of sleeping on this I noticed an immediate change. Several months in now I’m extremely happy and pain free. Firm but not too firm, stays cool, and you can’t beat the price!
 My son really likes it.  I'm sure there is a lot of personal preference when it comes to a mattress.  It is firmer than their main competitor (Casper, which I also have) so it really depends if you prefer a firmer feel or a more sinky feel.
 The mattress was good for about 6 month. Then I start feeling it was lack of support especially my lower back. I did some research and found it has only 2 layers so might be the reason. I no longer feel refreshed when I was waking up so I decide buy a new one with other brand.
 It's a good product but I find it a little hard for my taste.  I had slept for years on an air mattress and miss the adjustability.  I'm still in the trial period and could "return" it (actually they donate it to a local organization) but I probably won't because it is still very comfortable and who wants the hassle of a return?
 Without a doubt the most comfortable mattress me and the wife have slept on. Been on it for two weeks now. Hope it stays this good as time goes on. We were a bit nervous at first given how inexpensive it was compared to the others like leesa for example, but were pleasantly surprised.
 So far I love it. My former mattress was 22 inches thick and weighed so much it was hard to tuck in the sheets. This one is comfortable and easy to make and I was able to unpack and install it by myself, even though it's a California King.  Would I do it again?  You bet.
 Buying a mattress online was a little concerning, but we love it.  My husband says it is my best purchase.  The mattress is firm and that is what we were wanting.
 My first foam mattress so I'm getting used to it. As a 5 foot tall single woman I was able to lug the box inside, up the stairs, and get this thing set up by myself pretty easily. Comfortable. Definitely better than my 10 year old discount mattress.
 I wish I had not bought it. I learned a valuable lesson—don’t ever buy a mattress without trying it out first. It shifts really easily. If it wasn’t such a pain to return it, I would have sent it back. An expensive lesson to learn
 We had not purchased a new mattress for almost 12 years and it was time. First off I couldn't believe the price and the fact that I could order it from my couch and return it if I didn't like it. It's been just a few weeks so far but we're extremely happy. My wife who is 8.5 months pregnant is absolutely in love with the support she gets but also how soft it is at the same time. It's worth it to give it a try!
 I've had this bed about 2 months now and so far it's great! My 2 year old chocolate lab sleeps with me, and he has severe hip dysplasia and needs both hips replaced. Normally he sleeps on his back as it helps keep the pressure off his hips. On this mattress he sleeps soundly on his side...no pressure on his hips! Bed is well worth the money, though I was a bit irked to log in to do the review to find it now selling almost $200 cheaper than when I bought 2 months ago. Of course Amazon doesn't do price adjustments. Still, a great bed.
 Where do I even begin........  I have struggled for some time with the mattress industry trying to find the perfect fit.  After days of pondering and reading reviews of T&amp;N competition I decided to give this a try.  From the moment we layed on the mattress we knew it was a good fit.  We have been sleeping on this for 2 months now and oddly enough, it seems to be getting even better.  We are in love with this mattress and tell everyone we know about it.
 Can't find a better priced mattress that meets this comfort level and quality. After months of having this, my teenager can't sleep on anything else. I will be replacing all the other kids twin mattresses with these.
 Wow! Super comfy...<br/>First, I LOVE a nice plush mattress... and this is NOT soft and plush, but strangely really really comfy!! I sleep like a baby every night (when my baby lets me sleep). It has the perfect amount of support. Haven't woken up with a crick in the neck yet! Awesome!  I have Malouf, low profile pillows and the combination is heavenly.  I hope you give it a try!  PS read up on their company... they seem like a great group of people :) MADE IN THE USA!<br/><br/>Update: Still love it! My husband was diagnosed with MS and this mattress is perfect when he needs extra support.<br/><br/>Update 02/2017: Yep, still love it! I only wish they made a crib mattress because my toddler loves it too! HAHA!<br/><br/>Update 05/19/2017: Just bought one for our son - hopefully this will keep him in his big-boy bed! :-)
 My favorite bed I have bought so far, came really fast, easy to set up and soooo comfortable. I always liked the memory foam matresses, but they always seemed so soft and hot. This breathes nicely and is a bit more firm which is great for my back.
 fantastic buy, is perfect for a great nights sleep,have been using it for 2 months,everything it is cracked up to be
 Shipping status was always updated and correct. Arrived exactly on time and box was not damaged. Mattress is perfect and identical in every way to ordering directly from the manufacture's site. I was getting errors while trying  to purchase on the Tuft &amp; Needle website; I called customer service and Tuft &amp; Needle specifically told me that I would probably be able to buy the same mattress on Amazon using my PayPal account. It worked smoothly and I got what I intended to order on another site right here with zero issues!!
 i flipped the mattress and sleeping on the other side. im 28, never had back problems.. but now i do.<br/>wouldnt reccoment.
 We only got to sleep on the mattress for 6 nights at the location where we put them.  I slept pretty warm and I thought it was more firm than I would have wanted.  But, I woke up refreshed with no stiffness. If I were to buy again, I would stick with Tuft &amp; Needle but look for something a little softer.  They shipped fast! The mattress was easy to set up and move around.  We put it on a Zinus platform that worked great.
 I have now had my mattress for 2 weeks. It is the hardest mattress I have ever slept on. It is actually painful.<br/>I would not recommend this mattress at all.
 Arrived in 2 days. Packaging was perfect. My husband and I had no problem getting the mattress out of the box and onto frame. It expanded quickly. We have slept on it for week+. Very comfortable. The perfect balance of firmness with softness. Does not sleep hot in our opinion. We are very pleased with our purchase and very pleased with the price!!!
 I am in love with this mattress!! It was easy to set up and every nights sleep is perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better mattress. It's the perfect balance between soft and firm.
 Mattress started giving me pain in my upper back, which i think its a little too firm for my taste. Its all subjective though. Im going to stick with it for a month and see how i feel..
 Firm but not hard!  We let it sit for a few days to get used to the air here and the initial odor was gone.<br/>We find it very comfortable.  We had a different brand of foam mattress previous to this one.  For the price<br/>and the comfort, i will recommend this to friends who are looking to purchase a new mattress.
 Got it for my first apartment after graduating college. Bought a cheap IKEA bed frame (no box spring, just the slats, model name TARVA) and put it on top. Soft enough but also firm enough to give support I need. Easier to put sheets on since the sides pull up nicely, rather than normal mattresses that have a wire around the edge. I'm only ever buying a mattress in a box again. Just make sure you are strong enough to move the box and get it upstairs if you need it.
 First night we slept on it. It is absolutely the most comfortable mattress we have ever owned! It is soft, yet at the same time, has support. The cooling is perfect for my husband. We both slept like babies. Thank you for this product.
 Was very impressed with how quick I received the bed and the packaging. Bed didn't have any weird smell like I had heard in some reviews. Mattress has a nice look. I was hoping that the mattress would be perfect since I had heard such great things. I'm thinking it's just too firm. Trying to decide if I should return or if a mattress topper may help.
 I ordered this matress for my daughter and her husband for a housewarming gift.  After a couple of months she said it just felt harder and harder, but if you ordered on amazon instead of their actual website, they won't do anything for you.  Very much a waste of money for us.  I will start ordering from the website of the companies from now on.
 Very easy to set up. If you’re coming from a traditional mattress, this will take some getting used to and a few weeks to become fully comfortable. It’s very stiff at first but worth the weight. I can’t imagine sleeping on anything else.
 I was skeptical of switching to memory foam mattress but I gave it a shot because of the great return policy. I have to say I've really enjoyed it well worth it and the price was excellent. Though I was a bit upset when it when on sale for $50 couple days after I bought it but overall great buy.
 I wanted to sleep on it for a few weeks before leaving my review. I can see where it might not be for everybody but for me, 5 stars!
 This mattress is wonderful! We  came from a pillow top spring mattress. We paid over $1,000 for 4 years ago. It's now sunk in the middle and you feel every spring.<br/><br/>I've had this mattress for a month. It keeps you warm but not hot. You feel comfortable but don't sink in. In the mornings you just feel good. All this sounds crazy but get this mattress and don't look back!
 Don't know what all the hype is about. Can't sit on the side. Can't sleep near the edge have to move around or you sink in
 Great bed, has been a couple months now. First few nights it seemed a little too firm compared to the pillow top spring mattress we had but I actually like it this way. I have had a lot of lower back pain last 10 years and it is 90% gone after sleeping in this bed. Most of the pain must be from the spring matress's I had my whole life, highly recommended!!!
 Fantastic mattress and I switched from a tempurpedic. I can sleep well in any position. Snug enough to be memory foam with fantastic support for those with back problems. I've fought back problems for a while and this mattress seems to have helped tremendously.
 It has been a month since we bought our mattress. This has been a great purchase; it is affordable, comfortable, and easy to buy. It took me a few days to get used to the feel of memory foam, but I no longer roll around at night. highly recommended.
 1 month .. so far really like it.  4 stars because it is a little hot if you stay in one position a while, but same as any other mattress I've had. I was expecting it not to be.
 I've had my mattress for over a year now. It's holding up great!<br/>They delivered on time, it was easy for me to haul up 3 flights of stairs. The price is right! I'd recommend. I tested this and the casper and I really couldn't feel a difference with the Casper mattress.
 We ended up returning the mattress because it was too firm, but the customer service department is AMAZING! They were so kind and helpful getting us a refund after we had issues in the amazon customer service department. The Tuft and Needle rep took the time to do a three-way call with me to make sure I got the issue worked out okay with Amazon.<br/><br/>We were also very pleased with the quality of the product and it would make a great mattress for someone that likes a firm feel. You really can't go wrong here if you are interested in trying it!
 I did a ton of research on mattresses before splurging.<br/><br/>Here is the deal.  If you want the best mattress in the world, you will go buy a Sealy Posturepedic mattress.  You will also spend upwards of $2,000.  I wanted a high quality mattress, but I did not want to spend $2,000.  Consumer Reports led me to Tuft and Needle.<br/><br/>Consumer Reports ranks three different brands as "best buys" when it comes to mattresses.  The Sealy brand is one, and the brand that Costco sells is another.  The third is Tuft and Needle.  Perhaps the mattresses that Sealy and Costco sell are better, but I think that the Tuft and Needle mattress is the best value.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a firm mattress, but it isn't like sleeping on a hardwood floor.  In fact, I found little in the way of pressure points while lying down on this mattress.  I tend to be a stomach sleeper.  I know, that's horrible for my back, but I've had sinus issues my whole life, and sleeping on my back or side causes horrible pressure to build up overnight.  I usually fall asleep on my side and then find myself on my stomach when I wake up in the morning.  The first night was a little weird, but the insert that came with the mattress advised to give it at least a few days for the mattress to completely air out.  After a couple of nights, I had adjusted, and I can say with certainty that I like the mattress.<br/><br/>The interesting part is that it didn't seem, at first, like it was all that great.  Yesterday, though, I tried to take a nap on my old bed because I was washing the bedding for this one.  It wasn't the same.  It's kind of like internet speeds or HD television.  It doesn't seem all that great when you first use it, but you definitely notice it when you try to go back.<br/><br/>I give this mattress five out of five stars.
 Oh gosh, how did I not hear of this company before this year?  Very happy with the mattress we selected.  Seems like all my aches and pains have disappeared overnight!  Honestly!  Best investment in my sleep I have ever made.  And will do so again and again!
 It is so good that I ended up getting second one directly from T&amp;N since Amazon wasn't carrying Queen size at that time. Have been using it for 8 months and loving it.
 Thank you Tuft &amp;Needle. Wonderful product. Very comfortable. Just in time for my family visit. I bought this with the zinus sage grey low profile frame. Beautiful addition to the mattress.
 Update on 3/30/2017 - still in love with this mattress.  See below for more thorough comments.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>WOW.  WOW.  WOW!  Love this mattress.  We've had it for just about two months.<br/><br/>I read about it on Consumer Reports - it was their highest rated foam mattress, so I decided to take the plunge and buy it without "testing" it at a local mattress store.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did.  We had our previous traditional mattress for twelve years - it was a great mattress (and twelve years ago, still cost $500 more than I paid for this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress).  It was a great mattress, so it would have been easy to be disappointed with our new mattress.<br/><br/>But, thankfully, that has not been the case.  I weigh about 250, and my wife weighs half that much; nevertheless, we're both happy with this new mattress.  Highly recommend it.
 We're loving the new mattress, great product at a great price, came with a cover which is not mentioned in the description. Very fast shipping, came earlier than planned.
 Very comfortable mattress. It arrived very promptly, and I slept it within a few hours of unpacking. I noticed no odor. The mattress is firm, as I prefer. I had been experiencing considerable hip pain in my old (very old) innerspring mattress. That has eased considerably, and I am sleeping much better, it has been about a week so far, and I'm very satisfied with this mattress.
 Very comfortable, arrived promptly. The free 1day shipping was very nice. It takes some time to get out of the plastic and be careful not to cut the actual mattress if you use sissors to open.
 Best bed I've ever had.  My disabled body wakes up mostly pain free, fit and stronger following 34 years on many horrible beds.  I have a new lease on life--energy, strength,endurance,flexibility, daily routine and Well Being.  Yeh!! Tuft &amp; Needle for making a great bed affordable<br/><br/>LA
 You can believe all of the ads - the mattress is awesome and holds its form without being too firm or rigid. If you like memory foam to envelope you while you sleep, this one won't satisfy - but if you're like me where you want the feeling of support yet the mattress softly adjusting to your body movements and positions, this product is the best. I've had it for a month and enjoy it more every night.
 This was the first time purchasing a Bed in a Box.  I wasn't sure how we would like this but this mattress didn't disappoint.  Very happy with the quality and comfort.  Would definitely purchase again.
 At first I thought it was a bit too hard for my taste, but I got used to it and now feel it's very comfortable. For me, it feels more comfortable sleeping on my back than the side.
 Have been sleeping on this for more than two months now, and couldn’t be happier.  It works great with my new adjustable bed frame but sleeping flat is very comfortable too.<br/><br/>No issues at all with odors, it was ready to sleep on minutes after it was out of the box.  Very easy.
 I like it a lot.  So much I ordered it in a queen for the other bedroom.  After the second night I woke up and after a while I realized I didn't think about how the bed felt. Not too hard, not too soft, just right!
 The bed is mind blowing. Thanks Tuft and Needle!<br/>Firm but soft<br/>Partner doesn't get disturbed if I move<br/>Sleeping all the way thru the night<br/>Shipping is very convenient
 It is so uncomfortable, way too firm. I feel like I am sleeping on the floor.<br/><br/>At first, I figured I was just too used to soft mattresses and would adjust. A few weeks later, I am in PAIN. My entire back hurts so bad. I take Tylenol constantly throughout the day and have been sleeping on the couch, waiting for our mattress topper to be delivered.<br/><br/>Save yourself the trouble of buying. Or burn another $150 on a mattress topper to make it bearable ... At least hopefully it will be.
 I cannot say enough positive things about this mattress.  My wife and I purchased the Cal King on a recommendation from a friend.  They had purchased a $4000+ mattress for their home and then bought a Tuft &amp; Needle for a guest room.  Lets just say they no longer have the $4000 mattress and now have a Tuft in Needle in their master bedroom as well.  Best sleep I've had in ages and my wife loves the fact that when I turn over in my sleep (I'm not graceful) she doesn't even notice.<br/><br/>Just placed an order for 2 full size mattresses for my daughters
 I was skeptical about buying a mattress online, but I'm so glad I made this purchase. After doing a lot of research about the popular mattresses on the market, I settled on the tuft and needle. I tend to sleep on my stomach and many of the mattresses seemed unsuitable. This mattress is firm, but not too firm. I've slept better than I have in years and much of my back pain has dissipated. I would highly recommend this mattress.
 This is our main bed, which replaced a 25 yr. old Sleep Number bed.  Have been sleeping on bed since Oct., but still not used to it's firmness.  Both my husband and I are experiencing more back stiffness, also difficult to turn over.  If it can't be replaced at this time, is there anything I can add to make it softer and more comfortable?
 a very good mattress. Took a couple of weeks to adjust after a lifetime of spring mattresses. Now very happy with the purchase
 We had a very expensive queen bed / mattress before upgrading to a King bed but didn't want the expense of another mattress so decided to try T&amp;N.  We LOVE IT- had it for approx 6 months now and still love it.
 I was a bit skeptical at first about buying something I've never seen or tested but I took a leap of faith based on all the positive reviews. It arrived promptly and once set up, I was instantly hooked! My husband likes firm, while I like a softer mattress and this was perfect for both worlds. So happy I made this purchase and I would buy again and again!
 Super comfy!! We decided not to keep the queen  because we wanted a King. It is a hassle trying to return through Amazon, but the product is good quality.
 I waited for several months before reviewing.  I really like this mattress I find it to be a perfect balance between soft and firm.  It did not have a chemical smell and was ready within 5 minutes.  I did purchase a mattress pad because the foam was wierd feeling without.  I would like to point out that I prefer firm mattresses over soft and memory foam.  I never wake up achy and tired like I was before.  II didn't give it 5 stars because even though I really like it, it still misses something for me.
 We went from a traditional mattress with a memory foam topper to this mattress and are disappointed.  It’s quite a firm mattress compared to our traditional mattress with a memory foam topper.  Both of us have had trouble sleeping on it as it is much firmer than we had expected. We upgraded the size of the mattress, so we will purchase a topper for this to hopefully make it more comfortable.
 I love the mattress, my wife finds it a bit too hard.  To make it better for her I purchased a three inch foam topper and now we are both very happy!<br/>We both ooh and aah whenever we lie down to sleep.
 So far so good!  We are only into day 10 of 100 so we will see.  Mattress arrived when they said it would.  Easy to remove packaging.  Expanded completely within 2 mins.  Only had to let it sit 2-3 hours before able to sleep on the mattress.  No smells as some have described.  Slept like a baby the first night.  They say its great for all sleep types however occasionally I like to sleep on my stomach but I always find that my back hurts like heck when I go to get up on all mattresses and this one is no different.  Other than that, as of now I have no complaints.
 I rarely review what I purchase, but tought i should in this case given all the hype/antihype about the mattress and its raving reviews on Amazon.<br/><br/>Bought the twin size 5 inch for my 2yo son who i spoil by laying down beside every other night until he gets to sleep.  So while i am not the prime user, I do have experience with it.<br/><br/>It is VERY comfy, and just last night I was wishing i could sleep on ot for a few nights to compare it to my new bought Casper bed (the other NKOTB in the mattress industry). My wife likes it as well, and the prime user sure likes it.<br/><br/>I cant really compare the $200 value to say, the ikea od casper twin mattresses, but it sure is a great product and delivers what it promises.<br/><br/>On a side note, it did have a very very faint material 'smell' that was gone after a week... and 2 leaked diapers. ;)
 Its been a great mattress for me so far (6months+). I sleep great every night in any position. There is an adjustment period going from a spring mattress to this style though.
 well they don't give me enough stars, I need like 100 to get across how much I love this bed, it is truely helping my back feel better, I have never loved being in bed so much, lol, I wake in the morning and think "naw, I'll just stay a bit longer:" and I am stealing naps now so I can be in this wonderful bed. So very amazingly comfortable, I hope it holds up because I am now getting the Sound sleep I have been needing for a very long time. Thank you so much tuft and needle.
 Tuft and Needle is a great company.<br/><br/>My wife and I purchased the mattress on Amazon and it was delivered, as promised, in a relatively tiny box. We unfurled it on our existing box spring and gave it a whirl.<br/><br/>It took about one week to find the mattress comfortable. The first few nights were pretty bad. I woke up feeling very stiff and sore. After my body adjusted, I fell in love with it. Unfortunately, my wife didn't feel the same way. After giving it a go for about 75 days, we decided to cash in on the return policy.<br/><br/>After reading the fine print on their website, it appeared that because I purchased on Amazon, they weren't going to honor the 100-day warranty. I prepared a very intense speech to deliver to the customer service rep, but it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Their customer service couldn't have been better. They walked me through the entire process of donating my mattress. Upon proof of donation, they confirmed that my payment would be processed. About 7 days later, a check came in the mail for the full purchase price, including sales tax. In order to avoid any issue with service, head on over and purchase the mattress directly from their website.<br/><br/>I still honestly still can't believe it. You can buy one of these mattresses with absolute confidence that if you don't like it, you can get your money back. I regret that it didn't work out for my family. We ended up buying a mattress at a local store for 4x the price...
 3 days since delivery and I have slept like a baby took only 10 mins to reach full size not sure about longevity of mattress yet but so far am 100% satisfied with my purchase will update in 30 days see if I still feel the same
 I am very happy with my purchase of my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. I had surgery on my back and before that time I was looking into other mattresses and compared. I am glad I chose this mattress. Not only that, the team at Tuft &amp; Needle responded right away to my questions. They definitely care about you. It is hard to get any good service these days, but they care!!! I would definitely recommend Tuft &amp; Needle! Thank you so much for the exceptional service to all the employees at Tuft &amp; Needle!!!
 This mattress is perfect. Bought it to replace a very old spring mattress at our vacation home which dipped in the middle. It's difficult to believe that it arrived almost flat and once we opened the huge bag it grew to its full depth almost immediately. It is very dense, unbelievably comfortable, not too hard not too soft, I'd say it's firm but not hard, supportive. I will be ordering a king size next month for our home. If I had one suggestion it would to add handles on the side to make it easier to move or turn.
 Firm yet comfortable
 I like my mattress although I think it's a bit hard. If it were a bit more plush I'd be sold on it.  The lack of softness may cause me to return it.<br/>It needs a topper or something to raise the comfy level for this body.
 I do not like foam mattresses! Until now. This is great and I do not realize I am sleeping on foam. Best sleep in years for me and my partner.
 Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress did it! Every night, I wait with eager anticipation, sleeping on my new Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress! So cozy, firm and calming! My body feels more rested, after a nights sleep than on any other mattress! My last mattress was a 3K from Orth** Mattress and I kept trying to convince myself it was a good bed; but always tossed, unable to get comfortable. Right out of the box, Tuft &amp; Needle was great! I sleep like a baby and never have a problem trying to find a sweet spot. Always supportive and comfortable! Thank you T &amp; F! Super happy and grateful for getting great sleep every night on my mattress! I can also feel the cooling effect; as a person going thru the change. This mattress, does cool my body, after night sweats. I love how firm the mattress is to; not a sagging soft bed; FIRM and Supporting!  I will always recommend folk to skip the expensive store brands and have this Tuft &amp; Needle shipped right to their door!  Top shelf! Heck, i even did a commercial for a HUGE Bed Store, and Tuft &amp; Needle is Better by far! No dials or bells and whistles....just pure mattress L O V E!
 Been using this bed for months.  My backache is gone.  The mattress cover could be a bit better, but already 10x better than most mattresses without covers.  I just bought a second cover and no problem.  As described should be aired out for a day or two before putting sheets on it. The factory smell went away in those days. Absolutely no smell left.
 Purchased the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress for a surprise gift for my daughter.  Her back hurt constantly and she couldn't sleep at night.  The first night that she actually slept all night and felt great in the morning.  She loves it and the price was one I couldn't turn down.
 I really wanted to like this bed, but it was somehow simultaneously too soft and too hard. Probably better for people who weigh under 200 pounds. I woke up with back pain every morning (which did subside after being up for a bit) so I returned it. Very happy with the return process, though.
 So comfortable!! I’m really pleased with this mattress. Best sleep I’ve ever had. Loved the way it was packaged too. It was folded in a smallish box. When I got it open, it expanded. Very cool.
 We own a queen and a king! This bed is so comfortable!
 I’ve only had it about a week, but I unfortunately need to return it. I’m really curvy and I need a mattress that has a little more give to it than this one does. I sink in a little but the supportive layer isn’t deep enough for me to feel comfortable. If you don’t have big hips &amp; scoliosis, the bed is still made well &amp; feels better than any innerspring mattress.
 I fall asleep on this and wake up in the morning. I haven't tried to use the mattress for any other purposes (tried and failed many times) but I think it will work well. I'll keep you posted.<br/><br/>Update: it was great and so was the mattress.
 Ordered this mattress after seeing billboards all over Orlando. Was a little skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. First night sleeping I slept a full 8 hours and woke up feeling great. It's incredibly comfortable and doesn't get uncomfortably hot during the night. Honestly considering ordering another one just for the guest room. And the price is fantastic too. Queen size boxspring mattress was easily 800$ plus. Definitely consider giving it a try.
 How do I get a refund? How am I supposed to return a Queen-sized mattress? I'm rolling off the edge after less than 2 weeks and my side is sinking in more than my husband's side. Liked the firmness at first.
 After years of sleeping on over-priced mattresses that never felt firm enough and always ended up sagging in the middle, I decided to try Tuft &amp; Needle. I will never go back! It was so easy to order, unbox and set up. And I like that I can use it on any surface. I also trust the materials used to make the mattress and love that there are no added flame retardant chemicals. When my toddler was ready for a mattress of her own the choice was easy - another Tuft &amp; Needle!
 At first the bed seemed great especially considering the price. Now that I’ve had it a few months I absolutely hate it. There is no support. My back and neck hurt every single day. It may be ok for one person but it’s not for two. My husband and I both wake up complaining every morning. We are super disappointed with the bed.
 We finally got rid of our teenage son's bunk bed and this was the replacement we chose.  He loves it so far and is sleeping well in it from day one.  So easy to setup, unwrap and let it do its thing as it inflates up to size.  Hoping it holds up over time, but the 100 day guarantee gives us plenty of time to try it out!
 At 165 lbs. this mattress is a bit firm for me, but I still love it. I'm going to try a 1" memory foam topper and see if that helps.
 I have to give this a mixed review which I will explain here. First off, the packaging was great, very compact and fun to watch it expand once fully unwrapped. It is mostly as described, very firm and feels like it will give you just enough play to be soft. However, my sleeping experience with it was not ideal, it stayed a bit too firm for my liking. I decided to return it which Amazon was amazing about so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Please keep in mind this is a very firm sleeping mattress, I have multiple gel pads and mattress toppers at this point to try and make it sleep-able.
 We've had our Tuft and Needle King Mattress for a few weeks now, and it gets better all the time! Several years ago, we bought a regular mattress, twice the price, that bent like a cooked noodle on the way down the steps. I'm disabled and have to spend a lot of time in bed. Our old mattress did NOT hold up, and when I called about the 1 1/2" dents in it, their remedy was to buy a new one. We did just that! We checked out all of the newer ones online and T &amp; N was the one we chose. It was the right choice! I used to be in terrible pain if I slept in bed, and I started sleeping in the recliner downstairs. Problem solved! Now I don't WANT TO get out of bed! I wake up feeling refreshed, I've had a great nights' sleep for the first time in years! I also love the fact that we're supporting a small business, and one that really cares about their customers! Made in the USA means a lot too. The customer support is second to none! If you have a question, they answer you within 24 hours. I'm sure we made the right choice, and with the NON PRO-RATED warranty, we won't be buying a new mattress until at least 2027, and it will be another Tuft and Needle! With my disabilities, good sleep is precious and had been hard to get. Not anymore! I sleep so much better, and $750 for a King Size mattress is a steal, especially for THIS one! I'm more than thrilled with this mattress, and I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who needs a good night's sleep. Get it and see how great sleep can be! You won't be disappointed!
 I’ve slept in this bed for 3 nights now and so far it’s been very comfortable. I typically prefer firmer mattresses but this one feels good. I’ll update my review if something new comes up.
 After sleeping on it a few nights this mattress is really soft. Too soft you seem to sink all the way down to the box spring. For 700 dollars. I wish we had of spent it somewhere else. Very disappointing.
 Its a soft bed, i'm 6'4" AT 280 (BODY BUILDER) and this suites me good.<br/><br/>At first when i got it i felt like i was sinking BUT wit was actually just me, meaning the last mattress i had was 8 years old and thin, i was sleeping on the box literally. So i say you have to get use to this.<br/><br/>Also, this is a heavy mattress as it is made from LDPE, it is heavy (for moving reason)
 This is the best mattress I have ever slept on, I would without a doubt recommend it. I have back issues and this mattress has made a huge difference.
 When I first set up bed, it felt very soft, but when I called Tuft and Needle, they explained that it took about 72 hours for the inside layers to expand.  They advised me it was ok to sleep on it in the meantime.  I was amazed that after a few days the bed was firmer.  I had been suffering from back and neck pain from my old mattress, and that has now completely gone away. I could not be happier with this purchase.
 Very comfortable! Bought for our 2-year-old as the first “big kid” bed. Immediately loved by all. A bonus is I can get out of the bed without waking our toddler up!
 I love my new mattress.I put it on my adjustable bed and it is so comfortable.It is making my back and hip joints feel so much better.I wish I had known about Tuff &amp; Needle mattress earlier and wouidn't have endured so back pain
 I've been sleeping on this for eight months. This is the first time I have ordered a mattress-in-a-box.<br/><br/>I sleep so well now. Was a little worried because buying this via Amazon you only get a 30 day trial as it is subject to the standard Amazon return policy. Purchasing direct from T&amp;N gets you a 100 day trial I believe.<br/><br/>This may sound a little weird but it doesn't feel all that comfortable while you are awake but as I mentioned, I sleep great on it. Like I mentioned, eight months sleeping in the same spot and it is solid as the day I purchased it.<br/><br/>I did let it air out for about 36-48 hours before using, as others mentioned there is a mild "non-toxic" odor when it firsts is unpacked.<br/><br/>As of now, I would buy another and I have already recommended one to a friend in the market for a new bed.
 Can't seem to fall down enough onto it it... it's grand.
 What a fantastic mattress!  I can find no fault to it at all.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  i have since ordered a pair of their standard sized pillows (from the company since Amazon did not have them) and they are just what I needed,
 I bought this bed to replace an air bed I was temporarily using in a second home while it is being remodeled. The air bed was not working for me or my need for a firmer mattress. The "bed in a box" seemed like the perfect solution. I loved it from the first night I slept on it! It is truly one of the most comfortable mattresses I have ever slept on. Easy to transport and easy to set up. I will keep it for future guests when we finish our remodel and completely move in to our home.
 So I've been sleeping on my Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress now for four months and I can unequivocally say that it's the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. The recurring back tension I had been experiencing is gone.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the cushiony feel of the mattress. It's amazing how something so soft can be so supportive.<br/><br/>Add all of that to the fact that I didn't have to go into one of those horrible mattress stores and deal with the salespeople and try to make a decision by lying down on bed after bed after bed.  I'll never go back!
 I’ve slept on a memory foam mattress for years. I was looking for an upgrade so I bought the TnF. It was very soft the first night but immediately stiffened. I haven’t slept in over a week. My only option is to buy a mattress topper or return the mattress and go with another company. I’ll give it two stars because I can return it but I wasn’t very happy with customer service pushing me to buy a topper.
 Set this up on a daybed in the living room so my mom wouldn't have to negotiate any stairs.<br/><br/>Mom loved it. Really good with her kaiphosis/ dowager hump. This mattress gave enough so that her hips and shoulders were aligned yet supported her enough so she had no soreness when she woke up
 I purchased this for a guest room and now I wish it were my master bedroom mattress! Everyone has commented on how well it sleeps, from age 10 to 60. Buy it!
 I'm 6'1" and 160lbs. I would be sore all over on my previous mattress after a night of sleep and not very well rested, but I haven't had that problem with this mattress. It's worth mentioning that I've had my previous mattress for 10+ years, so I'm sure any other modern mattress would've been better.
 4months sinks hubby can't sleep on it wakes up with bad back horrible bed. Don't buy.
 I mean it's not life changing like some sponsored reviews seem to make it. Definitely doesn't have a quicksand feeling like other foam mattresses may have (I don't know, I went from spring to this). Had some bad shoulder pain the first few nights but its been fine since. Without having felt any of the other $200-300 mattresses on amazon I'd say it was a good choice. Definitely am not uncomfortable now.
 great mattress. very comfortable. there was a slight smell when I first opened the shrink wrap but it was gone within 24 hours. very happy with this mattress. my son loves it. his first big boy bed.
 Love the bed but it doesn't feel as thick as my Tuft and Needle Bed I purchased a year ago? My daughter is thrilled with this mattress compared to the one she had on it.
 This was my first time buying a mattress and I was fairly nervous.  I ended up going with this one on recommendation from a friend.  I got to say this is one of the most comfortable sleeping experiences I have ever had.  It's not too soft or too firm.  I partnered this up with some Bamboo pillows and I sleep like a baby every night.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this mattress.  Awesome quality and very price effective.
 I slept on this mattress for the first time last night and I can truly tell the difference between how I slept before vs. How i sleep now.<br/><br/>I have back and neck issues from prior car accidents, and I woke up this morning with no pain and my back felt pretty darn good. This mattress feels like I'm sleeping on cloud 9 :).<br/><br/>I am very satisified with this purchase.
 REALLY firm mattress. But, we like it just fine, have been sleeping on it for 6 months now. The price was really good too!
 My wife and I thought we would try this over our old conventional pilllow top mattress that was due to be replaced. We’ve both slept on memory foam before and really liked it. Specifically the Casper Mattress. I figured with all the great reviews and low price we would be happy with the Tuft &amp; Needle. After a couple weeks I was literally getting angry with how uncomfortable I was. My wife was complaining of neck pain. I was dealing with middle back pain. It was terrible and very frustrating. Needless to say it was out with the new mattress, and in with the new Casper mattress. Fell in love after one night. Spend the few extra hundred and don’t waste your time with this mattress.
 I love the bed and have tried it for a couple of months, the suggested one I ordered is to hard for my back, who can I contact on exchanging for the next softer size down
 We got this in May, and over the last few months it seem like we have to flip the mattress direction due to sinking every few weeks. It's not firm and feels like you just sink into the mattress causing a lot of pain points/pain. We have been waking up with back pain :( Looks like the company only let's you do returns within 100 days.
 We've had this for about 9 months now and it's still holding up as expected.  Worth the purchase for sure, and I was leery purchasing a mattress online.  Should we need another mattress in the future, for a guest room, I will probably purchase another
 Read about this mattress and others to do my comparison before making the purchase.  This mattress is WONDERFUL!  After the first night of sleeping on it, I woke up with no backache!
 This is absolutely the best mattress I have ever slept on!! Give it time to soften up when it arrives though (like a week). I am a picky sleeper and the prices of the other leading memory foam mattresses were well out of my price range. I will tell everyone looking for a decent mattress to give this one a try.
 Loved the bed from the start.  It’s very comfortable and I don’t overheat on it.  However, I’m loving it even more now.  I’m 8 months pregnant with my second.  With the 1st pregnancy, around 5 or 6 mos, I needed the full loop double body pillow to be remotely comfortable enough to sleep.  Now I am using just a small pillow between my knees and am completely comfortable, and I attribute that to this mattress.  My hips sink deep enough into the mattress that my ever-growing belly is supported on the top.  I get much better sleep this time around, which is great.
 Durable and comfy! I have intermittent back pain and this mattress helps to alleviate a lot of that. It's more firm than soft but it's perfect for me. The packaging was great too! Only complaint is that there doesn't appear to be a great deal of circulation/ ventilation through the mattress so it does get a little warm and stuffy - but comfy nonetheless!
 Got the mattress so excited that I had to share thought it would be a bit more plush but it's sturdy. Hopefully after I get the grandkids &amp; myself to jump on it it'll be just what I wanted. But boy oh does it wear a comforter well yikes. I'll update in 6months.
 After reading the reviews and purchasing this product I couldn't be more happier. Very comfortable firm but not too firm. no odor or smell detected from the beginning as other reviewers have complained about. This fit my budget.
 While they are a great company to deal with in terms of cutosmer service, you do get what you pay for with this mattress. I am 6ft 210 and my shoulder and hips are begging for a transition layer for this mattress. Should be good for lighter people, but heavy side sleepers beware. Luckily the 100 night trial can and will be used.
 I researched mattresses before I purchased this one. I spoke with people who had purchased this mattress. I have been very disappointed with this purchase. After a couple months of sleeping on this mattress, it started to become uncomfortable. In less than 6 months, it developed "divots"  or permanent dips in it where my husband and I sleep. We are now in the market to purchase a different mattress after only 6 months of sleeping on this one. For us, this was a big waste of $800. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Tuft-amp-Needle-Mattress-King/dp/B00QBZ25SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress, King</a>
 Got this to replace our old sunken mattress. It's nice but was a little too firm for my wife. We ended up putting a 2" topper from our old bed on it and it's all good now.
 We love this mattress. It just right. I don't roll into my husband anymore. It's really perfect. Easy to unpack.<br/>Heavier then we thought it took two of us but really perfect. I might order another one.
 Had this for a month now and absolutely love it. My body wakes rested and comfortable with no aches or pains. This is truly a marvel. The easiest and most economical mattress purchase I’ve ever made. Can’t recommend enough!
 Will never go back to a futon or spring mattress again knowing foam mattresses can be this comfy. It's so supportive but yet still soft when you sit on it. While laying down, it doesn't feel like I'm sinking in at all and I'm 220 lbs!! I'm a side sleeper and only have back issues if I've been extra busy at work, so it's no fault of the mattress. It's holding up remarkably well too. I sit on the edge while playing Xbox1 but there is not an area there that feels worn out or softer than the rest of the mattress. Also I don't feel the cats jumping on and off the bed in the night anymore. Woohoo! highly recommended like so many other ppl have too.
 We found this to be a very comfortable mattress.  Its support is gently firm, providing even skeletal support but with just a little bit of soft "sink in" when you lay down.  Temperature-wise, it's very neutral, getting neither cool nor hot.  We like it a lot!!
 I'm a bigger guy, can't get comfortable on the mattress it compresses at the edges of the bed. So if you're laying not in the dead center you basically fall off. Maybe that's a feature of latex beds not sure, never owned one before. Can't get comfortable, maybe if I went Queen I'd have a better experience.<br/><br/>Bag ripped when I was unboxing it, not even sure if its possible to send back now.  Update: Was told I could send through ups pickup, will update if it works. Good customer service.
 Read the whole story: We ordered two of these in XL about 3 weeks ago.  They smelled awful!  For over a week, and then badly for another week.  Unfortunately, we missed the company's comment to the original review for five days.  I contacted them and received EXCELLENT service.  They said the smell was completely unexpected and suggested a defect.  They arranged to have the original ones hauled away and sent new ones.  The new ones arrived today and they are incredible better.  They have about 1/100th the smell, and the smell is a different odor.  They've only been open about 10 minutes.  I still plan to give them 1-2 days before sleeping on them.  If they continue to work out, I hope to return and give the fifth star.  I'm still upset we had the horrible smelling ones in the house for so long, but other than better testing at the factory (arguable something they should do), there is nothing better the company could have done.  We chose these because they are supposed to smell less and be healthier, but the original pair smelled toxic.<br/><br/>Again, the customer service was excellent.  I wish we'd seen their comment earlier.  If you order one of these and it smells bad, contact the company right away to see if you should get an exchange.  Based on the other reviews here, that situation is rare.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------<br/>Original Post:<br/><br/>Purchased two of these to make a king.  Very disappointed with the strong off-gassing smell.  We even left them in the garage for four days set up on frame to try to let the smell dissipate.  Now 24 hours inside and we have to have the Windows open and fans blowing.  The smell is reducing but is still unpleasant and worrisome.  They seemed comfortable last night but we probably will sleep in the guest room tonight because neither of us can stand the smell.<br/><br/>Edit 6/9/2016<br/><br/>After nearly two weeks, we still have a strong smell.  We somehow missed the offer in the comment from Tuft &amp; Needle for five days, but quickly contacted them.  I have since received detailed, timely, and considerate service and offers of exchange.  They assured me that it sounds like these were a manufacturing defect, which they seem to take seriously.  I am not yet adjusting the star ranking, because the continued issues suggests losing a star and the customer service deserves earning a star.  They assured us that if we have a problem with these, we can still start the Amazon refund process during our 30 day window.  If the exchange process goes well, I intend to return here to add a star.  If I never update this, it probably means things went very well and I forgot to return it.<br/><br/>Despite the smell, one of us slept on it 2 nights and the other 3-4, and both loved the comfort.  Didn't love the smell and even seemed to get a sore throat from it, hence why we stopped trying it.<br/><br/>Hoping for the best!
 Bought this after buying a new platform bed and an exhaustive search for a new mattress. Save yourself the time and money and just purchase this mattress. The mattress is supremely comfortable and my girlfriend who is supremely picky loves it. She is a back sleeper and I'm a stomach sleeper and we both love it. One of the best decisions I have made, and I recommend this as opposed to brick and mortar shopping for a mattress to all my friends.
 Been sleeping on this for a week and absolutely love it! I've never had a foam mattress before and was worried it would be too soft (i prefer my beds fairly hard and was considering getting a Japanese shikifuton to sleep on the floor with) but have been really pleasantly surprised with this bed! Provides plenty of support but also feels nice and soft, the best of both worlds in my opinion. It was also very fascinating seeing the bed plump up almost immediately after cutting the vacuum sealed plastic.
 I have used it for a week now, no hip pain during the night. That is huge for me.
 We paired this with a self-assembly box springs to use on a long visit with our son in a new home. This mattress sleeps as well as our "home" mattress which came from a high end department store. This mattress fulfills all aspects of what the description promised. It shipped well, was easy to unpack and slept like a dream! I would absolutely suggest this for the emergency need for a new bed!!
 While the Queen mattress itself is quite comfortable, the edge support is TERRIBLE. This means that the edges bend downward if you put any weight on them and you lose some of the overall width. I actually felt I might slide off when I rolled towards the edge. Because me and my girlfriend had to sleep inward from the edge, the spacing felt no different than our old Full mattress.<br/><br/>I'd recommend you looking elsewhere if you are a larger person or you sleep regularly with a companion.
 Bed was great in day 1. 2 months in it had already softened up and became uncomfortable. You could visibly see a slight slope from the center to the edges of the bed where we slept.<br/><br/>My wife and I are both under 200 lbs. disappointed this didn't work out because it was really comfy on day 1 and the reviews were fantastic so my expectations were high.<br/><br/>Amazon made the return process really easy.
 I purchased this mattress based on all of the 5-star reviews for the product. However I have tried this mattress out for the past 100 days and I absolutely hate it. Unless you enjoy sleeping on a very firm mattress, this is not for you. Also keep in mind that the mattress is very thin so finding sheets that fit tight are hard.
 Sleeping better than ever. Bought the Pinzon Hypoallergenic Overfilled Microplush Mattress Pad to go over it and that took care of any initial smell. I need the Pad as I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. The pad, however, does not allow any cooling effect from the mattress if that is what you want.
 I really tried to make this work - been sleeping on it since December and read the review hints and found advice online on how to try to tune it for me but it just won’t soften up even a little. Read that it will break in over time but not for me (and I’m 6’1” 172 lbs so hoped that this advice might be true). I am a side sleeper and this mattress gives me hip pointers and I wake up several times with lower back pain. It does make me happy to get out of bed every morning! I then purchased a SleepJoy topper thinking this might give me just enough cushion but it’s only slightly better than being in a sleeping bag on a floor. Now I’ve tried too long and I can’t send this back :( Note my previous mattress was a hybrid with pillow topper and ironically was rated a 5 for firmness but over time became too soft for me so this seemed like it would be perfect. Sadly I’ll be looking elsewhere and learned a pricey lesson.
 Getting this mattress was the worst decision ever.  Now it just sits over there, all "It'll just be a short nap" or "you can just *sit* on me, you don't actually have to sleep..."  And then I spend all day lounging in bed and nothing gets done.<br/><br/>As someone who's gotten back twinges from sleeping in hotel beds, I wasn't too sure about any mattress, much less this one.  In addition, the T&amp;N had other strikes against it (in my mind): (1) it was foam, and I've just had terrible experiences with foam anything, because I overheat easily--even gel foam doesn't help. (2) I couldn't lie on it before buying it.  (3) They rolled up the mattress for delivery!  Madness.<br/><br/>There were only two things that made me consider it: I was so tired of mattress shopping (what a nightmare) and a trusted family friend had recommended it.  So it was with great fear and trepidation (and much desperate prayer) that I purchased it and had it delivered.<br/><br/>What a godsend.  I don't overheat; the mattress doesn't collect body heat.  (The website has an explanation for this.)  Moreover, the mattress is so comfortable, and I get no backaches no matter how I sleep--on either side or on my back.  I sit on it with my backrest pillow against the wall, lie on it prone to read, and am always comfortable.  Even falling asleep sitting up doesn't do anything  It was also ready pretty quickly: directions said to give it several hours after unrolling in order for it to reach regular size, but it was just a few hours for me before it was ready to use.<br/><br/>Customer service at T&amp;N is very responsive.  I wrote to ask about using a bed frame (SleepMaster SmartBase Mattress Foundation) and got a very prompt answer which was not only actually helpful (mind-blowing!) but also from a real person - a very friendly and personable one, too.  It sounds ridiculous, but given how customer service is like these days, getting such a prompt, personal, and friendly answer was quite nice.  (And the answer is yes, that frame works with the mattress.)
 Very comfortable for the two of us!  Easy to unpackage and not as heavy as an innerspring.
 One of the best purchases I have ever made in my life.  I was worried about a blind buy of a mattress but with all of the great reviews and incredible return policy I took a leap of faith and could not be happier.  The first night I slept on this mattress was the best night's sleep I've ever gotten and it's just gotten more comfy ever since
 I hurt my back during my move and I was super nervous to try out a brand new bed just a few days later.  Add in the fact that I am 6'3'' 300+ and I was completely stressed out.  I put the T&amp;N mattress on a Floyd Detroit platform bed, laid down, and woke up feeling tremendous.  While it does compress a great deal (that's more of a my size thing) I could feel the bed pushing back and holding me in all the right places.
 I've only had this for a few days and so far I haven't had any problems. I liked the price and quick delivery.  Setup was tricky but I was working alone and still only took about 15 mins.  For my first few nights I noticed I do get hot and need to shift positions. But at least I haven't any back pain. Overall I'm glad I bought the bed.
 I wanted to love this mattress.  More important, I wanted it to love me.  I gave it about a month.  While I realize a body needs to adjust to a new mattress, mine is simply not adjusting.  I limp out of bed every morning, trying to tweak my back into a happy spot.  Maybe it needed to be more firm?  I am not sure, but it does not love my back.
 This is an excellent mattress! We have slept on it 4 nights now and we love it. Soft enough to make you feel like you are floating, but firm enough to avoid back pain. Very happy!
 Looking at the video on T&amp;N site, we were impressed with concept and approach of the company so we tried the product.  The Cal King mattress was easy to setup.  Our biggest unknown was whether the engineered materials would be too hot but this was not the case at all - very comfortable.  Playing ice hockey much of my life my back has seen some damage over the years and this mattress allows me to heal at night feeling great in the morning.  Highly recommend.
 This is an excellent mattress! My husband was a little skeptical but after the first night he was sold! Thank you Tuft and Needle for an amazing mattress.
 I run an air bnb, and bought this for my guests to use. My first guest hated it , said it was the most uncomfortable bed she'd ever slept in and thought I'd given her an air mattress. I think it's an acquired taste, not good for first time users.
 Purchased this to avoid dealing with a salesman and overpaying at a brick and mortar store.  The mattress was very simple to set up and worked for the first few weeks or so.  Unfortunately,  it appears that the mattress has lost its firmness and my back/body sink down into it.  At this point it is unbearable and I regret purchasing it on amazon due to the 30 day trial in lieu of the 100 day trial :/.
 We donated ours because it didn't work out for us, so why 5 stars?<br/><br/>Because Tuft &amp; Needle customer services RAWKS! Quickly answered my call and email.<br/><br/>Full easy refund, because the mattress wasn't firm enough for us. We donated it to a friend who was in need.<br/><br/>Hand written "receipt" of donation was send as a picture to support@tuftandneedle.com and in 2 days we had are full refund.<br/><br/>A company that operates with this amazing of a business model for 100% customer service deserves 5 stars.<br/><br/>Way to go Tuft&amp;Needle!<br/><br/>We did really love the smooth stitching free mattress top delivery method! Again only refunded because we need something a bit more firm, that is our need.<br/><br/>Thanks!
 You will not be disappointed. The zero-interest monthly payment plan takes the sting off of the price, which is already much lower than everybody else.
 Bought this mattress a couple months ago and I couldn't be happier.  Set up was easy.  I am a tall guy,  6 feet 4 inches and 240 lbs. I have no issues with lack of support. I sleep great every night.  I would highly recommend this mattress and will buy again in the future.
 I ended up returning this mattress. It's ok but I wasn't in love with it. It slept a little warm. It's not terrible, especially for the price. Makes a better mattress for a guest room rather than your primary bed.
 I love this bed! Just what we’ve been looking for. We have a hundred pound dog that sleeps with us. This mattress stands up to the extra weight and somehow keeps me cool sleeping with lava-dog. It’s soft but springiness keeps us all from sinking together. Finally sleeping well!
 Without a doubt, the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned or slept on.  Have been sleeping on it for the last 8 months and I just can't even imagine life without it.  Unless you end up with a faulty one, or you just flat out ordered the wrong mattress, I very highly doubt that this is a purchase that you will regret.
 I am usually not one for leaving reviews, but I am so happy with this purchase. On my previous mattress, I was waking up frequently with shoulder and neck pain with headaches to go with it. I decided after much debate between two other more expensive brands to go for the Tuft and Needle. This baby arrived on my doorstep on time, was easy to set up and the best part is that I don't wake up with neck/shoulder pain or headaches. 5 stars! If you purchase this mattress give it some time for your body to adjust! Love it!
 If you are looking for the best value, this is your mattress! This mattress is on the firm side which was perfect for us. Our sleep quality improved substantially after just one night, no more sore back or shoulders. And at a fraction of the cost of simalar options I think it’s a steal. It shipped vaccum sealed in a box, expands quickly and had minimal off gassing. Totally recommend!
 Bed was comfortable the first week but, then caused me to have back pain. Thought maybe it would go away. Should have returned it but I didn’t. Might be a good mattress for a lot of people just not for me and my wife
 I was recommended by a friend and Reddit to check out Tuft &amp; Needle mattress when i was looking to upgrade. The webchat with the agent at Tuft and needle answered all the questions i had in regards to my concerns about the weight limit and the cooling factor.<br/><br/>I am a heavy set tall guy that loves sleeping in the cold, and this mattress did not disappoint. I rarely feel warm when I am using it, and that to me was important for me to get a good night sleep.<br/><br/>I bought the Saferest protector based of the recommendation of the Tuft &amp; Needle rep, but sadly could not use it after about two weeks. it got too hot for me. and since I cant return it, its money down the drain.<br/><br/>Overall it was a very solid purchase. just watch out for which protector you buy as it can change the mattress itself.
 Clearly, I have been sleeping wrong all of these years. My first night I couldn’t sleep. My body just couldn’t get used to the comfort. A week later I’m having no back pain, pressure point issues or sleepless nights. Sleeping all the way through the night is the big thing. Great mattress. Have recommended.
 Quality seems great.  The mattress is quite soft for me, but guests who have slept on it say it has been fine for them.
 I guess it all depends on the person, my mom loves hers, I don't. It is too firm for me, I put a mattress pad and still. Amazon told me to contact Tuft and Needle directly for a refund.
 I bought this mattress instead of the Leesa, which was my second option. It is a replacement for an almost eight years traditional coil 18" Euro top mattress set on box spring. It arrived when expected and once opened and unrolled it filled up quickly (less than 24 hours). It didn't have a chemical smell. No smell at all, so that was a plus. At first try it was instant love affair with it. I bought the king size and will place it in a platform bed with slats (2" separation), but for now and to test, is on a hardwood floor. I protected it with a King Size SafeRest Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector - Vinyl Free (good choice). I have slept on it for six consecutive nights. First couple of nights, it felt hard for what I was used to, but I decided that it may get better with time. I've noticed that after eight years of the Euro top, I am liking the less softer mattress I've slept in hotels in last few years. I don't like a too soft of a mattress, but after the third night with my Turf &amp; Needle, I think I need a mattress top to make me happier. I am mostly a side sleeper and found myself turning way too many times last couple of nights. I do like this mattress; no doubt about it, but a little softer top will be nice. I am just debating on which mattress top to buy. Any recommendations?
 Very firm mattress. Requires a mattress topper for those that prefer soft beds.
 This is the fourth mattress I have purchased online and quite a bit different than my previous purchases.  The mattress is quite a bit firmer than one would expect from a traditional foam mattress.  I am a side sleeper and am still undecided as to whether or not I will like this mattress.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes a firm mattress but would caution those that like to sink a bit into the mattress.  For context, I have a owned a quite expensive pillow top mattress that remains my standard but this will due if you need something quick.
 This is my first foam mattress and I love it. It is firm yet seems to cradle you at the same time. I usually sleep on my side and the body support is perfect for me. Motion transfer is very limited. The mattress is  extremely easy to open and set up. Happy customer!
 The first night we woke sore.  Probably because we are used to sleeping on a very high-end pillow top.  The next night all was well and we have never been more happy with a mattress.  We sleep throughout the night with no tossing and turning.  I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone.  We love ours.<br/><br/>You wont get that bed hug feeling when you lay down like a pillow top but who cares.  This bed is way more comfortable all night and you wont want to get out of it in the morning.<br/><br/>Get this bed.
 We've had our T&amp;N Queen mattress for about two weeks and love it. It's firm enough for both of us (1 back sleeper and 1 side sleeper). We're switching from a Sealy innerspring mattress and definitely find this much better.
 Owned this for a couple months. Movement transfer isn't good. I can feel my partner rolling over. Still feels kind of like an expensive blow up mattress. I prefer a softer mattress. I think I like the quicksand feeling of memory foam better. It is cooler to sleep on but you pay in comfort.
 This has turned out to be one of the best mattresses I have ever bought.  I had bought it for my guest room, decided to try it and have been sleeping on it for several weeks now.  It is great.
 It's everything they described. I absolutely love it. Firm, yet soft. My back needed this along time ago. A few of friends asked me how I liked it. They are getting one too. Thank you to Tuft and Needle for charging the right amount for a bed and not gouging your customers! You just might put the others out of business or at least cause them to rethink their pricing.
 Great mattress!  We ordered this as we finalized the lease on our new apartment.  Living in a hotel and not yet having a car, there was no question of visiting any of the large number of mattress retailers around our area.  Our seven year old pillow top mattress had already gone to the trash.  We needed a mattress, and fast!<br/><br/>I had heard of Tuft &amp; Needle from a podcast and decided to give it a whirl.<br/><br/>It showed up in a box!  We unraveled it and poof!  It formed into a mattress!<br/><br/>It is extremely comfortable and offers just the right support.  Both my wife and I sleep like logs on this thing.  There is no bowl effect from another person lying next to you, no lumps or bumps, and no soreness in the morning.  You just settle into perfect support.  Accords to Fitbit, I last an average of only four minutes before falling asleep.<br/><br/>The size is perfect, too.  Unlike the pillow top mattresses, this one fits standard sheets and won't make your bed look like a small mountain.<br/><br/>A big part of our decision was that it costs about one third as much as a standard mattress from one of those mattress stores.  It is also made in the USA.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.  If you don't like it, they'll even take it back for 100 days.<br/><br/>We plan to buy another for the guest room.
 I love this bed! It is so comfortable that I could live in it. Standard king sheets fit just fine. We have had zero problems with it since getting it.
 Sorry. Seems to be just another bed out there . Thought it would be a bit softer but it is a huge improvement from our old bed. Not going to return it because than we would be without a bed and not going through the bed search thing again. It works.
 I waited to do this review because when I was researching mattresses, I wanted to know how they held up.  After owning this mattress for over a year, I can honestly say that this is the best mattress, hands down, that we've ever owned.  We traveled recently and kept telling each other that we only had a few days left before we would be back to our own mattress.  Falling into bed after we got home was an exquisite relief.  We've owned innerspring, memory foam, and sleep number beds, and they don't hold a candle to the comfort offered by the Tuft and Needle.<br/>Every part of the mattress supports you so that there are no pressure points, just like the memory foam, but it doesn't hold your shape, so if you roll over in the night, you don't roll over into a hole--it springs back immediately to cushion you again.  It holds a small amount of heat, but my husband, who is sensitive to temperature when he sleeps, doesn't have any problem.  For me, it's enough to ensure comfort. After over a year of ownership, there are no sagging spots or indentations, and no loss of firmness.  The mattress is just exactly firm enough for us because there's support without pain.  My husband needs a very firm bed for his back, and I prefer a softer bed.  Memory foam was too soft for him, innerspring was too hard for me, and the sleep number was just a miserable experience for us both (yes, it's sort of like the Three Little Bears around here!).  The Tuft &amp; Needle has what it takes to meet both our needs, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
 I bought this for my teenage daughter.  Unfortunately, she just told me today that it is extremely uncomfortable and I just passed the 100-day mark.  Now, I have to either drop $150 on a mattress topper or throw it away.
 I've been a Tempur Pedic sleeper for years , but the heat generated was too much , This Mattress is an Absolute Dream to sleep on , Love Love LOVE it ! ! ! ! ! !
 This was the single greatest purchase I have ever made on Amazon.com, Infinitely better than the 5lb gummy bear. Besides wrestling the 5 ton box up three flights of stairs, the whole process was super simple. Cut the plastic, the mattress inflates, and then you may rest on a bed that can only be made entirely of plump cherubs, and some sort of future age foam holding them prison. Best night of sleep ever.
 I've had my Tuft and Needle mattress since about May (2015) and have deliberately held off on reviewing it until I'd slept on it for awhile. It's by far the best mattress I've ever owned. Never any aches and pains. I sleep through the night and so does my dog - she loves it, too.  I just can't believe you can find a mattress this comfy that isn't THOUSANDS of dollars and requires a 4 year interest free payment plan.
 I was skeptical at first but it’s a good mattress. I’m convinced so far. It does take 72hrs to fully expand then you’ll feel the difference.
 Look I'll keep it short and sweet: I've moved many times, traveled all over the world, and have slept in many many beds. Some that were very expensive, and some that were literally just a boxspring. This is one of the best mattresses that I've ever slept on in my life. I would choose this mattress over the expensive ones you'd buy anywhere else. The future is now, it's time to stop buying what everyone else does, and move on to mattresses like this.
 Did not like the mattress not worth the money looking for another brand
 Should have bought this sooner. There may be better mattresses but they’re all more expensive. My old air mattress messed me up, and this one fixed me. Plenty of space, and I haven’t rolled off yet.
 It felt grate at first but after a week it soften up so called amazon and I got my money back no need to return it since its already expanded to full size withch it dose in a blink of a eye.
 Damn this is a comfortable bed. Wife and I were crossing our fingers that it wouldn't be a huge mistake to order a bed online. It wasn't - it's the best bed we have ever shared. And what a great price in combo with the Zinus Tuscan Metal &amp; Wood Platform Bed with Wood Slat.
 Love the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. This is the 3rd one we have purchased. The first two we have had for a couple of years now, bought them directly from them. They still are not sagging in the middle.
 Love love love it. We actually feel it’s noticeably wider than a regular inner spring mattress, probably due to the fact you can roll right up to the edge and not feel like you’re going to fall off. We both noticed it on the first night. Queen sheets fit fine though so it must be the standard size.
 This mattress was wonderful for the first 5-6 months. Am now experiencing muscle aches, neck pains (that I don't have during the day)and can't relate it to anyhting other than the mattress.
 My wife had been noticing these billboards in our town, about mattress companies being greedy. I don't pay much attention to billboards, but they apparently worked in this situation. We decided to upgrade from a Queen to a King, and we're trying to decide what to get. We had a Stearns &amp; Foster queen, which was good, but we didn't feel like spending that kind of money again. And that's when the wife said 'mattress companies are greedy' and next thing you know we're at the website on the billboard and researching it. And then I saw they sell them here on Amazon, and the reviews were great here too. And the price was awfully attractive for a King. So we bit the bullet, ordered the mattress, and a Zinus platform bed also from Amazon. And man are we happy. I'm sitting on it as I type and it's a dream. I like a fairly firm bed but with softness on the top, and this delivers. Highly recommend!<br/><br/>UPDATE: After 2 years, we still love this mattress! We've moved cross country with it, through three different homes, and it's the one piece of furniture we couldn't do without. Even when we're away on vacation, I long for this mattress and greet it with kisses when I return.
 We spent so much money on our last mattress and thought that the more money you spend the better the mattress.  This bed is incredible! I would highly recommend and buy again.  So easy and simple.  Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle you have a customer for life and I will always recommend.
 This thing is amazing. So comfy and you sink into it like a cloud. We had it in our garage for a year before opening, we were planning on moving houses but didn't. It was a little hard to get open but
 We are so in love with the mattress!!! It’s firm but soft making both my husband and I happy! It’s a cool mattress as well and I even feel safe sleeping with our 14 month old on it!
 Pretty good. A bit too soft for me. I added a natural latex topper,  and now its perfect.  No smell or fumes. Nicely packaged.
 Was optimistic, but  after talking to customer service felt like it was worth a shot. Have no complaints about this mattress aside that you can't sit on the side of it and it moves easily but is extremely comfortable and does not bow. My husband and I are larger people and both have not had any major back or neck pain  since using it. Looking forward to getting pillows in the future.
 I was hesitant to get this bed. The king bed was only $700 (my last queen bed from some mattress store was $1,500). I usually have to lay on a bajillion beds before finding one I like. I was also afraid of it being too hot. And it’s been fabulous! I didn’t realize I had back pain until it was gone after sleeping on this bed. I love that the bed doesn’t move or creak. I’m pregnant now and this bed is still insanely comfortable.
 I like the concept of the foam mattress. But My wife found this to be waaay too firm for her. I will say that the test sleep plan and refund policy was exceptional. Glad I have it a try
 Very comfortable if it wasn’t for how hot it sleeps. Update: after having beyond the warranty period, I can confirm: never slept so poorly. My wife and I regularly make trips to the guest bed with a very basic inner spring Costco mattress as an oasis from this. Couldn’t regret the purchase more as I write this after another sleepless night.
 Wow! Love this mattress.  I had mixed feelings about buying a mattress online, but reading other reviews and with the 100 day guarantee, I figured it was a safe bet. Very comfortable, I’m sleeping great.
 Saw the ads, did some research and decided to try the mattress out.  It was as firm as some of the reviews said, which is what I thought I wanted.  Girlfriend thought it was too firm and badgered me into buying a mattress foam topper after trying sleeping on it for 30 nights.  Based on the recommendation from another review on amazon I, I got the 2.5" gel infused foam topper (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1POX8Y).  I have to say, as much as I thought I needed a firm mattress, I am sleeping a lot better and happier (girlfriend is much happier as well) with the topper.  my Fitbit Charge HR has also validated that I am tossing and turning a lot less.  I used to sleep happily on carpeted floor or a thin futon, but I guess getting older has changed what I need.<br/><br/>That said, I am quite happy with the quality of the mattress, have no regrets, and believe I will be sleeping happily on it for quite some time.  I didn't have any issues with smell of any type.  Simply unraveled it on top of the metal bed frame, took off the plastic wrap, and watched it inflate!
 First night sleeping on this mattress was great. The reviews from Consumer Reports rated it very high. I am a back and side sleeper...very comfortable.
 Super happy with this mattress. Our old boxspring mattress was way too firm. We paired this with the LUCID L300 Adjustable Bed Base and for under $1,000 for both, you can't beat the value. The wife and I haven't slept this good in years!
 I'll never own another brand of mattress. I tell all my friends to try it and they all want one. This coupled with a slat bed frame and a couple my pillows and it couldn't be any more comfortable. I sleep warm and I'm never too hot on this mattress. The mattress cover included is super easy to remove and wash with a cup of bleach in a full cold water washer. Cannot recommend enough
 This mattress is amazing! I was nervous ordering something I could not try out first, but the reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I decided to give it a go. I am so glad I did! It was easy to unpack and I I could hardly wait to sleep on it. It is a little more firm than other mattresses I've had, so I was a little nervous about sleeping on it the first night. Let me just tell you I couldn't have been more wrong. It is incredibly supportive but also has such a light springy feeling to it, and I get the most amazing sleep every night. I've had it a couple months now and I have to be careful because I want to lay on it all the time! I cannot recommend this highly enough. It is by far the most comfortable mattress I have ever owned, and I am constantly telling everyone I know about it. I can definitely see owning Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses for years to come!
 this mattress is very comfy and firm. i was not expecting to enjoy this mattress, buying it only because we were moving and unable to bring our current mattress. this is soft, yet supportive, and i have recommended it to many people in the week we’ve been sleeping on it.
 This mattress is great. I purchased the tuft and needle mattress to replace an older memory foam mattress that was starting to give me back issues. Let me tell you....best $750 bucks I've spent in a long time. Highly recommended.
 Great  mattress at a very reasonable cost.  No pressure points on the back so I wake up with no soreness.
 was ranked as the best value on Consumer Reports. I like mine easy to unpack and no unpleasant oder. My only complaint  is I seem to roll off the edges more easily.
 Was looking for a lower cost memory foam mattress. Read a few reviews online and decided that this was a reasonable cost of $600. Comes in a box and you really need two people to move it around (but I got away with using a handtruck to transport it from my car to the apartment).<br/><br/>If I wanted to take the time to do more of a benchmarking comparison, I'd buy the memory foam mattress that Costco offers at the sale price of $400 and see if there was any difference. I'm not super sensitive when it comes to these mattresses so I wonder if the cost difference would be worth it.
 This bed is really comfortable. I've had it 2 months<br/>It's my first foam bed, and I love it. I can't explain it, but it's soft and  supportive at the same time.<br/>Really fun to unpack too. Pretty amazing how they pack it in such a small box.
 While I've only had my mattress for almost a week now, I can't say that I"m sold just yet on the comfort and relief of pain/pressure to hips and back.  I will give it a few more weeks, but may need to consider the topper but would prefer not to spend the money after spending on the mattress itself.  Perhaps a return.  Anyone have these issues/concerns that might be able to lend advice and/or suggestions
 These Mattresses are wonderful.  I have several properties and I have bought them for each.  They are delivered right to your door and so incredibly easy to set up.  They come wrapped in a vacuum sealed plastic and a big white Tuft &amp; Needle Box.  You simply take the rolled up mattress out cut the outer plastic and unroll it on the bed frame, then cut the inner plastic and within moments, the mattress fluffs up.  I gave mine about 4-5 hours and then I made the bed and MAN,....  it is comfy!  The number one comment I get on my rental reviews is how comfy the beds are!  This is a WONDERFUL deal and a super wonderful bed.  The folks at Tuft &amp; Needle are amazing and very responsive.  If you are looking for a new mattress, don't hesitate ordering one of Tuft &amp; Needle.
 I purchased this mattress for my teenage son.  After visiting mattress firm, I went online looking for something a little more affordable and chose this product based on the description and price.  It is very plush but still seems very supportive.  My son loves it!  I was skeptical about a mattress in a box, but so far it has been great.  I may purchase the pillows next.
 UPDATE: After 2 months I've decided to return it but I still think it is worthy of 5 stars as I believe the problem I experienced (pressure points) is due to my weight and hip replacements.  I began experiencing pain in whatever hip on which I slept (side sleeper).  I went back to my old spring mattress and box spring, now in the guest bedroom, and after a few nights the pain disappeared.  Next I ordered a competing product a reviewer said had two 3"  layers on top of the base foam layer instead of Tuft and Needles one 3" layer.  The competing product doesn't feel as firm as the Tuft &amp; Needle, but it also hasn't caused any pressure points.  I would prefer a firmer mattress but I can't live with the pressure points.  Again I think it is my weight (240lbs) that is the problem, not so much the Tuft and Needle mattress.  Someone under 200 lbs who wants a very comfortable firm foam mattress would probably find the Tuft and Needle to be excellent.<br/><br/>Just 4 nights on it but so far very good.  I'm 6'3", 240 lbs.  This replaced a mid-level mattress and boxspring with a 3" memory foam topper.  I paired the Tuft and Needle with a Zinus Modern Studio 14 Inch Platform 1500 Metal Bed Frame and a Casper Sleep - Foundation/Box Spring.  The first three nights I had to use my old box spring because the Casper foundation had not yet arrived.  Last night I replaced the old box spring with the Casper foundation.<br/><br/>1. Way cooler than the old memory foam topper.  I set my thermostat to 58 at night as i sleep hot.  I was always removing covers in in the middle of the night because of the heat retained by the memory foam topper.  I didn't notice any heat buildup with the Tuft and Needle mattress.  I even turned on the foot portion of an electric mattress pad last night for a few hours in the middle of the night when my feet felt cold.  That never happen with the old memory foam topper.<br/><br/>2.  Perfect amount of firmness for me.  I'd class it as between a medium and ultra firm non-foam mattress, a little firmer than my old mattress.<br/><br/>3. Very comfortable sleeping on my back or side. The first three nights with the old box spring seemed a little more difficult to roll over than with my old setup, but after replacing the old box spring with the Casper foundation, that slight difficulty disappeared.  I could have easily continued using the old box spring without out any significant detriment.<br/><br/>I have had 2 total hip replacements and 1 total knee replacement, and an arthritic spine.  I'm still very physically active riding a bike two times per day, hiking on weekends, and working around my house climbing ladders and carrying heavy items.  With my old set up I would often feel stiffness in my back and joints when getting up in the morning.  That stiffness seems to have disappeared with my use of the Tuft and Needle mattress combined with the Casper Foundation and Zinus bed.<br/><br/>That may be because I've increased the firmness just by using a bed frame with full slats and a foundation with full slats with a brand new mattress - in other words, a new coil spring mattress on top of that bed frame and foundation may have had the same results.  I'll have to give it more time to be certain that the Tuft and Needle mattress is going to keep me satisfied, but so far I'm very satisfied with it.
 We got our Tuft &amp; Needle Queen size mattress in February and love it. Much better than what we were sleeping on before, which was a very old mattress. My husband and I sleep differently (sometimes both on our sides, more often he sleeps on his back and I sleep on my stomach with my arm under my head), and no matter how we lie, we're both comfortable. The bed stays very warm, which I'm not crazy about, but I'm not sure if that's because of the mattress, or the protector that we bought for it, or the blankets that are on there, or any number of other things. The box is heavy, if I remember right, my husband carried it upstairs by himself, but it would probably be better to have two people lifting if you have to go up a level.
 Maybe we just had a really terrible mattress before, but this mattress has been so good for us. We got the queen as an upgrade from our 12 year old full bed. I was worried it would feel too much like memory foam which I don't like, but it hasn't. I am usually a side sleeper but sometimes sleep on back or stomach. All positions have been very comfortable. Can't beat it for the price.
 I am not sure how this mattress could be soft and firm . . .but when I laid down . . .I felt my spine straighten and felt firm support yet felt like I was floating on air. I am thrilled with this mattress and with getting a full night of sound sleep :)
 Got this as a fast cheaper option for my bedding needs and was not disappointed. Not super soft or firm, just right on the support. Really happy with this product for the quality and how much money it saved me for a bed
 I've had my mattress for a week and love it so far! Super comfortable, even on the floor although I will be getting a bed frame. My one question is why the Queen-sized mattress went down in price by $75 on Prime in less than 2 weeks... I bought it for $750 and it's not $675, which is quite the fluctuation (I didn't know these mattresses went on 'sale'). My advice would be do your research and track the price!
 15 weeks pregnant with twins/ suffer from pregnancy insomnia &amp; I can still happily state that I have never slept better on any mattress in my life. I am a side &amp; back sleeper; my hips haven't felt such relief since before I started having children. I highly recommend this mattress not only for comfort, but obviously for price too! I only wish it stopped my husband from snoring.
 While we thought the bed was too soft, we were blown away at the customer service we were showed during the return process. We bought a twin which could be the reason we thought it was too soft. Sometimes the sides of these mattresses can be pretty weak due to the foam and no "bones". I think if you were to buy a larger tuft and needle mattress you would be happy with it.
 My wife and I purchased this bed in February. We LOVE this bed! After reading many reviews, I was worried about the bed being too firm. Before the  bed arrived, we went to Kohl's and purchased a Serta memory foam mattress topper. We got the 2 1/2 inch. We put the mattress topper on the first night and have not slept on the Tuft and Needle without it. I did have an adjustment period for about two weeks where my hips hurt. But, after that, I was fine. Overall, we love this bed!!! I never want to get out of it.
 We love love love this mattress. It the perfect mix of firm and soft. I love a very firm bed and my husband loves a soft bed but somehow they managed to please both of us. We got it during the prime day deals but worth more than regular price!! Great mattress!!
 This is the best mattress I have ever owned. Plus it is super fun to unpack. Make sure you have the mattress in the room you want it before opening the box!!! The mattress will just pop out one air gets inside.
 We returned our fist one because one side did not expand with no problem. The replacement was ok. I sleep very warm/hot and this was cooler than most. Support was good for about a year. Now my back hurts and my wife has hip pain.
 Love the mattress.... but..... if u r a side sleeper it may b a little bit stiff ... ? my wife says its to hard for her to sleep on her side now but she is also 100lbs lighter than me, but i have no trouble sleeping on my side,.. front or back either...i really like it.... no smell either, nicely done
 Very firm. Not like typical memory foam mattress. you sleep on it rather than in it. low odor.
 If you like sleep on a mattress that doesn't give and is really really stiff than this is for you. NOT FOR SIDE SLEEPERS would be happier with a tiny bit more give. Was infantry in the Marine Corps so I can sleep on anything.
 I bought a Tuft and Needle mattress late last year. At first I was not sure, very firm. After about a week of use, it was "broken in" and now I love it. Before I bought it, I would often wake up with lower back pain and pain in my arthritic hips. Now I sleep well and wake up pain-free. I recently bought another T&amp;N mattress for my daughter, and she is one happy camper!
 I was skeptical to buy a mattress over the internet specially this kid on mattress , but I love it , Great materials ,  very comfortable,  class A , highly recommended
 Very easy to unroll and NO smell at all.<br/>I had another brand name mattress that developed a serious dent after only a few months and had a back ache every morning.  I have slept on this mattress for a year now and so happy it's just as comfortable now as it was on day 5!
 We received our Tuft and Needle mattress yesterday and I was able to get it set up by myself (I'm a 5'2" woman). The mattress is lightweight, but so incredibly comfortable! Last night was our first night on the mattress and I don't think my husband and I have had that good of a night's sleep since before we had kids. I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase and will absolutely recommend this to everyone!
 Tried several similar style but none compared. Very subjective thing but for me, firm but still able to sleep on side, this one was perfect. Very nice quality.
 Very happy with this purchase. So much easier to sleep through the night now. I defiantly plan on replacing both of my kids mattresses with one soon.
 We were scared to purchase a bed online.  However, this was the best decision we ever made.  Delivery was great, right to our front door.  Set up was super easy.<br/>From day 1 to several months later, we love our mattress.
 My wife and I have had our Tuft and Needle bed for around two weeks and I can't imagine us ever going back to a traditional mattress. You cannot beat the price for this mattress and the quality is top notch. I couldn't imagine going back to a traditional mattress after the great sleep that I've been missing out on for awhile. Anyone on the fence of trying this mattress should give it a shot, especially with their return policy. This is an outstanding mattress and I'm glad that we went with this!
 I was hesitant to buy a mattress without trying it first. I have had some back and knee pain over the last few years so I’m quite picky when it comes to beds. This mattress is hands down the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever slept on!!! Easy to get out of the box (did it all by myself). I highly recommend this!
 We’ve had this mattress for almost a year...it’s still PERFECT.  My husband and I sleep better than ever and our aches and pains are massively reduced.  I recommend this mattress to everyone!
 My only concern and only reason of returning the mattress is lack of edge support. I had queen size bed. I sleep with my wife and dog. I always end up sleep on the edge. If you sleep on the edge side it sags  badly. Which is so uncomfortable to be. My previous spring mattress I didn’t have this problem.
 Great mattress!  We received the mattress prior to our new bed frame arriving and we slept on it for two nights.  It was not comfortable at all (too hard) until we put it on our new bed frame.  On the slats, the mattress is perfect for my wife and I both.  I prefer soft mattresses, while she prefers hard mattresses and we are both in agreement that this is one of the most comfortable mattresses that we have ever owned!
 Im 24 years old and never had an injury in my entire life. Ever since I started sleeping on this mattress I've experienced old people back problems; stiff neck, shoulders, and upper back. I've been hitting the gym less because of it too, worst purchase of my life. Don't cheap out on mattress folks. At least customer service is top notch and got my money back.
 Excellent choice for RV or guest room. I would purchase this product again.
 After years of sleeping on a spring mattress we decided to get a foam. After much research we found that Tuft &amp; needle had great reviews.  We never actually tested it person so I was very apprehensive when I saw the tiny box it came in, but wow are we happy. It has only been two weeks but so far it is amazing!. Love how soft it is but still provides support. the fact I can't tell when my husband moves in the bed is wonderful. He has shoulder problems and so far he is waking up pain free. Hope it continues!!
 Bought this for my son a couple of months ago.  He still really likes it and is sleeping a lot better than he did on his old mattress- and his back feels better, so I plan to buy one for my daughter too.  saving up.
 As a side sleeper this is way too firm for me and has caused severe shoulder and neck discomfort. Its great for back or stomach but may be too firm if you are a side sleeper or have issues with your arms.
 It's good but on the hard side.. thought it would be softer.
 I love this mattress. We bought it on Black Friday last year, and it is still just as firm. I have severe scoliosis, and this mattress really helps keep me comfortable. I paid twice as much on our last mattress, and it didn’t last nearly as long.
 These mattresses are amazing!! We bought one for the master and guest room!! Love them so much....don't want to get out of bed!!  You will not be unhappy with your purchase!!
 A bit soft for my tastes but the wife likes it and my back is not sore when I get up in the mornings anymore so a quality purchase.
 I really had no idea just how poorly i was sleeping on my 1990 model year no flip innerspring mattress. I have, and i love my mission style platform bed that originally came with a very high quality futon style mattress, which is still in intensive 24/7 therapy from all the disgusting abuses its been through, LOL/JK. Along with the aforementioned innerspring which committed hari kari in my garage by stripping off its skin and cutting itself up and jumping in the trash bin. R.I.P. buddy, hope you find peace! Anyway . . . .  I have an ex girlfriend who had one of those memory foam mattresses, which was hideous to sleep on, it was like sleeping on warm flesh, i dont know how you memory foam people do it, i really dont. I actually sank down in it below the level of the mattress top, WTH!! So i was naturally leery of it at first.<br/> Well let me tell you something, this is by far the most comfortable mattress i have ever owned. Im a hard mattress sleeper and this one has just the right amount of give and support without overwhelming you in mattress sink. I can turn and it instantly gives where it needs to, i can look across the mattress when im in bed. Dont get me wrong, it sinks, but only a few necessary inches, after all, we are curved not flat. I can still do my morning ' sit on the side of the bed and do emails and whatnot" very comfortably. Some have said it sleeps cooler, i haven't noticed this, but im a cold loving sleeper (turn down the heat, and pile on the comfy blankets!) Honestly, i cant find a complaint, but i have a few tips!<br/>Tip #1 Things heavy! Which is a good thing! However your gonna be peeling plastic off of it initially in a compressed state, be aware of this.<br/> Tip#2 have it positioned where you want it when you cut the vacuum seal, its lofting instantly, by the time you get the plastic out of the way, its past done expanding out. BTW it fills my platform beautifully, and came out to be 9 inches thick, so all my sheets still fit(why people need or want 18 or 20 inch thick mattresses is beyond me)<br/> Tip#3 Its formless. By that, i mean trying to move it is like trying to maneuver a hundred pound wet noodle. Be aware of this and plan in advance if your gonna be moving around. Haven't looked, but a huge vacuum bag would be real freakin handy.<br/><br/>As always, i spend my own hard earned money on the things i review.
 It has been a week and my wife and I both concur........it is too firm. We both have trouble sleeping through the night and wake up with sore backs. I personally always have a few day adjustment period for new beds for me to get comfortable. But, I do not see this bed getting any less firm so we are planning on getting a mattress topper to provide some relief.<br/>About us: I am around 71" and weigh about 180lbs and my wife is around 60" and weighs about 110lbs. We replaced another memory foam mattress with the Tuft and Needle because of their reviews and generous return policy. We haven't decided yet to return it, but we aren't exactly thrilled with the bed either.........<br/><br/>Update: 31 July 15<br/>We are seriously thinking of exercising the return policy. My back aches when I wake up. We have a queen sized memory foam mattress in the guest room that cost us less than half of this one and we find it far more supportive. Will give it a few more days but it doesn't look good for the Tuft and Needle.<br/><br/>Final Update:<br/>We returned it. Why buy a mattress topper for a bed when we can get a bed that doesn't need one?<br/>Warning: UPS will not take the bed. We found out the hard way. When UPS came to pick up the mattress, they refused it because it was too large. Funny, I explained to Amazon that the bed would never fit back in the same box and it was a King Sized Mattress. They assured me it was fine. So I had to contact Amazon again and they had to contract a freight company to pick it up.<br/>Still waiting for my refund.....
 I rarely write reviews, but I think this warrants a few words. We have been sleeping on a king size T&amp; N mattress for one week. We were switching from a sleep number bed which was due to be changed, but we didn't want to pay the ridiculous prices for another Sleep Number bed. It was nice, but not THAT nice. Even so, I was used to being able to customize my mattress, so how soft or how firm the bed was mattered a lot to me.<br/><br/>The first night on the T and N was a little weird. It definitely felt different than my SN bed, but wasn't bad. I was skeptical if I would ever really love it, but was willing to give it a try. I woke a little sore and was aware that I hadn't slept very well. The second night was better, but strangely, with no other changes whatsoever (same bedding, same blanket as on the SN) I was very cold that night. By the third night, I was ready to have some other adjustment to note in the morning, but I woke up feeling like I had slept like the dead. My fitbit tracks my sleep patterns and I had stopped wearing it at night because my poor sleep being recorded for me every morning was depressing. I decided to track it again--My sleep patterns are GREATLY improved. I'm getting much more deep sleep, my body temperature doesn't go from hot to cold (from throwing off all the blankets), I am waking up with no aches and pains, I am refreshed and rested. When I lie down, the best thing is that I don't feel the mattress or have any thoughts about getting in a good position. I just feel comfortable, fall asleep easily, stay asleep all night and wake up feeling great. I'm very, very pleased with my purchase.<br/><br/>As a side-note, I used my cash-back credit card money that I had been saving for a while, so I essentially got the bed for next-to-nothing. That makes me like it even more, but doesn't have anything to do with T and N...just an idea if you collect cash back like I do and save it for a big purchase.
 I am a big dude and sleep on my side. It wasnt comfortable to me. I woke up after 6 hrs with lower back muscle pain every morning. Not for everyone i guess.
 I own and have used this mattress 1yr now. After numerous toppers I gave up and it is now in the guest room. I think it is made of a good foam but not for people that are not shaped like a log (hips and shoulders of equal width). My husband hated it and he likes firm mattresses. I have wide hips and an Apple shape. Felt like the mattress was fighting my bottom weight giving me the feeling of sleeping downhill (head down). The pressure on shoulders and hip became to much. After 4 different toppers that with or without covers would not stay in place I gave up.<br/>I believe that this one size fits most mattress definitely does not work for heavier and disproportionately shaped persons. Maybe a mattress model with the same base but 2 additional inches of cushioning would work.
 Let me first say that this bed was great... At first. The shipping was fast and easy, it was inexpensive, and it was super comfortable. However, the more I slept in it, the more I realized this wasn't gonna work. It's not that it's losing shape or sagging or becoming softer, it's that my body can't handle how firm it is. I'm 26 and in fairly good shape, but I'm a side sleeper. I can't sleep on my side now without waking up in the morning incredibly sore. I've tried sleeping with a pillow between my legs. I've tried sleeping on my back. There's no relief. I'm going to have to buy a mattress topper to try and get some relief as I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it. I will say my boyfriend doesn't have any problems with it so I think it's just not right for me.
 This is a very comfortable, if you like firm, mattress.  I've had it about five months now.  If you don't like spring mattresses, and are looking for something firm, then I would suggest this mattress. I also had a Tempurpedic and I found it spongy, hot and saggy after 3 years.  You can't beat the price and it's delivered to your door shrink-wrapped like bacon in a box.
 Purchased this mattress one week ago.  My lower back pain has been alleviated, hip pain gone...shoulder pain gone, restless leg gone....  My fit bit shows I am having longer deep sleep cycles and my bed doesn't look like a tornado blew through with my constant tossing and turning....The mattress was very easy to set up and there was no chemical smell....Very pleased with this purchase!!
 I love the bed, it is very comfortable and convenient. However, it smelled like formaldehyde, and the odor does not go away quickly. I have aired it out for the past 3 days, and it still smells. Though I am not positive it is harmful, because I do not know what is causing this odor, it does smell like what I know to be formaldehyde. I will continue to air it out until the odor dissipates or reassurance comes.
 Great price on the mattress, but now I have to go buy all new sheets and a new bed frame. The T&amp;N queen (60x80x10) hangs over the sides and foot of my queen platform by about 2" all around. I cannot get my queen-sized fitted sheet (standard queen size from Vermont Country Store) onto the mattress without the sides curling up. Kind of disappointed that I'll have to toss a lot of perfectly good, not inexpensive set sets. The platform bed I have was actually too big for an Ikea queen. Wish all these people would standardize their measurements. Not real happy.
 I initially purchased this mattress with high hopes and it really has been a pleasure to sleep on. It was slightly too firm for me initially. (I wouldn't worry about it I like a super soft mattress) and Tuft and Needle really went above and beyond and sent me a mattress topper and it significantly improved the softness of the mattress to my liking. Overall, I would say for a good amount of folks, you are going to be very happy with this as is without the topper unless you like sleeping on a super soft mattress.
 Got it. good product.  I am happy with the purchase.
 So easy to haul upstairs and unwrap, and it expanded right away. I slept on it not a few hours later and it seemed perfectly full. The difference from my five year old Ikea mattress was immediately noticeable - no more back pain. We also went on vacation a week later and I missed my new mattress so much - our first two days in the hotel I was so sore.
 After two or three nights of sleeping on this bed I’ve woken up with little to no back pain, I’m so relieved! As someone with chronic back pain I would dread waking up and feeling how bad my back would hurt when I got up but now that’s not a problem. It’s definitely soft so it took a few nights for me to adjust but I’ve had the best most comfortable sleep since. Would definitely recommend!
 I looked into Tuft &amp; Needle beds after reading an article on Kotke.org about the inflated prices of mattresses:  ...]. I liked that these beds are made in the USA and inexpensive. It turns out that all the other Amazon reviewers are correct- this is a great bed. I have had foam mattresses before and I expected this one to have a powerful chemical smell for a few days after I opened it. I was pleased to find that there was no odor at all. This bed feels just right-- not too soft and not too hard. So pleased to have found this brand.
 I was nervous about spending so much on a mattress when there are less expensive options out there but I’m so happy I went with Tuft &amp; Needle. It’s hands down the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever owned. Being in a box made delivery so easy and all I had to do was remove it from the packaging. My husband can get in and out of bed at night and I’m none the wiser. It’s that quiet. Seriously, the best item I’ve purchased on Amazon.
 Love it! Inflated immediately to full size about 10 seconds after the plastic was cut. Still let it sit for 48 hours before use just in case. A little on the firm side for me, probably about a 6-7, but perfect for my husband so I’ll deal. Much more comfortable than our previous mattress.
 I love my new mattress!  It is really comfortable.  My only complaint is that it is shorter than my other mattress.  I'm short too so it ended up being ok. Next time I'll just be more aware of how long the mattress needs to be.
 Well i have upper back and neck problems and i have been searching for a mattress for almost a year because i didnt want to spend 2500$ on a Tempurpedic and all other memory foam mattress were just sub par or over priced. I thought my effort was futile and i would be forced to cut off an arm and a leg to pay for the mattress. I was explaining my plight to my physical therapist (who kicks butt btw) and she being ever helpful went straight to her phone to call a couple of her other physcal therapist buddies because she heard of this great mattress at a nerve damage seminar a few weeks back. Within fifteen minutes we were both looking at this mattress on amazon right there at the Cleveland clinic. She was excited to tell me that this mattress out-preforms the Tempurpedic as well as having a 10year warranty all for a quarter of the price. The story in the physical therapy community is that the guy who created this mattress used to work for tempur but left due to what he thought was price gouging. So he left and started his own company with the same technology for a quarter of the price. I was sold before she explained the benefits (simply due to her never steering me in the wrong direction) and even more thrilled when another dr called her back to explain how several of his patients got it and swear by it.<br/><br/>So long story short, i went for it. It arrived last night and after night one i am 100% sold. This thing rocks and i have never been as comfortable as i am now when sleeping. The difference in quality and feel are intangible compared to a Tempurpedic. The support is great all the way to the edges and it comes with a nice zip-off cover just like the Tempur. Again, this mattress rocks and i have never slept so well in my life!
 a little firm because I just purchased it.  Hopefully it gets softer over time.  It is quite comfortable so far and very easy to set up
 This is a good bed at a good price. I find it a little softer than I would like, but the cost offsets any criticisms. Would buy again.
 Moved our toddler to her first big bed (twin). Love this mattress so much I keep falling asleep after reading books to her! It’s on the soft side, but that’s my preference anyways. Great price, quick ship, super comfy and cozy. Win win win!
 Perfect bed. I bought it after my wife fractured her pelvis and it worked great for her and on the plus side my hip feels better than it has in years. Works great with the adjustable bed frame.
 Probably the best mattress you can get in this price range. In between firm and soft, definitely not too firm imo. My bf has back issues and he is very happy with it.
 Sleeping on this mattress is a highlight of every day! It is extremely comfortable. It fits perfectly on top of an old box spring that went with our now-discarded conventional mattress.
 I love this mattress!  Great support, no sinking down in. Not hot, no sweating. Has a nice bounce.<br/>Easy to unpack. It immediately “grew” to the queen size as soon as I opened the plastic covering for shipping. Easy to move onto my box frame. Very satisfied. Excellent product. Fantastic price.
 Purchased for my mother-in-law based on great use reviews and great price. Arrived quickly.  Set up easily.  Most importantly - she has loved it since day one!  Needed it to work on her adjustable bed frame and it does without creasing under her back.
 There are definitely good things about this mattress: reasonably priced, easy to order, easy to set up. It appears to be well made,and I barely notice when my husband tosses and turns each night. It is perfect for sitting on....firm with lots of support. The problem is that my husband and I are both side-sleepers, and sleeping (for both of us) has been very uncomfortable since we bought this mattress. We have slept on it every night for about 5 weeks...I keep waiting for the "breaking in" period to end, but there has not been any significant change in comfort level (in my opinion). We do plan to return it, and I'm not looking forward to that, as some of those who have purchased from Amazon have complained about the process. Though it seems to be a quality product, I can't recommend it for side-sleepers. UPDATE (4/28/17): Called the return line for Amazon "Specialty Items" and it seems as though the return for this won't be difficult. They said I should donate or dispose of the mattress and they would process the refund. May be worth trying this mattress out considering mine is a subjective view and there is really no risk. I'll increase my star rating if the refund comes as easily as promised by the customer service rep I spoke to.
 Most comfortable mattress ive slept on! Before that a casper was #1. Girlfriend returned it because she didnt like it, cant understand why... Anyway, the tuft and needle perfectly distributes your weight, almost feels like sleeping on a waterbed, but much more comfortably without all the movement. Its also elastic feeling but soft at the same time. Excellent combination! Love it! Highly recommended! Well worth the money! Superbly crafted!
 So far I like it.  My back is not as sore in the morning.  One thing is it slides around on the box spring but that really a big deal.  Time will be the big test - does it hold up.  Package arrived when it said it would, in a large box with hand hold cutouts.  Mattress expanded as expected.  Overall happy with the product.
 After days and weeks of deliberation, I chose this over Casper. It's basically the same thing for half the cost. And frankly, I put a Lucid topper on it, and it's the cuddliest thing in the world now.
 I like a very firm mattress, and the Tuft &amp; Needle is much closer to a medium. It caused me some back pain, and I had to return it.<br/><br/>Be warned! If you purchase and return through Amazon, you'll need to find some way to re-package the mattress for UPS to pick it up. Once it's picked up it'll take a few weeks to see the credit on your credit card...these are things I was not aware of when I purchased the mattress, and wish I'd known.
 Super comfy bed. I had to sleep or not rockhard futon and stare at my new mattress for almost a month before I could use it due to a bug infestation. It was worth the wait. I bought an elevated metal frame with springs that act as a box spring and I've never been so comfortable in my life
 I bought this mattress based on price and reviews. It ended up being to firm so we got the topper from T&amp;N. The topper just slides around, which is a huge pain, and it's still too firm for me. Overall, not too bad but not good either.
 A must get.. my back has never felt better, takes a little getting use to but once you do, you will sleep so good and actually wake up with no pain... I would recommend this to anyone..
 My fiancé and I have been sleeping on her old mattress for way longer than we should of. My back started to hurt when I woke up so I knew it was time for a new mattress. The mattress came with 5 days on the free shipping which was nice. After a couple of days on the mattress, I can already tell that I am getting better rest. If you are looking for a cheaper mattress to replace your current one, this would be the one I recommend. I don't see the need to drop over a thousand dollars on a mattress.
 Soft on top layer then semi-firm. I'm impressed that it has no smell or toxic fumes that cause allergic reactions (at least not for me).
 This is so far the Best mattress I’ve ever slept on... did have some smell after lunch unpacking but tolerable. Left uncovered with windows open for 4 days just because.<br/>I used to have back pain and shoulder pain using the classic spring mattress. I’m a light sleeper so I easily wake up when my husband moves. Been sleeping really good since I got this.<br/>Great job Tuft &amp; needle!
 I love this bed!  Comfortable and no Springs. I'm a big guy and I toss and turn a lot. Doesn't seem to be a problem. We've only had the bed for a little over a week and it is great!  My only concern is that it holds up over time. I guess I will wait and see.
 Really nice mattress, firmer than it feels at first, and extremely comfortable.  I have a tempurpedic in my master and I think it's still superior, but this mattress is very very close.  For the price, you just can't beat it.
 I liked the way it came, even in my powerchair I could get the box in the house and unraveled.i picked the semi hardness one but should've gotten a firm one.but it's too much trouble now to do that.
 Awesome Mattress for Price! Will buy again!<br/>It is a foam mattress so it is firmer than coil spring at first laying but after you lay it fells better and better. The mattress had the typical foam smell for about 3 days but after that it's perfect!
 Awesome, over a year later and worth every cent!!  I was sick of spending thousands of dollars on regular mattresses from the store that would go lumpy after barely a year.  This mattress has held up wonderfully and I love that I can wash the cover. Best part is that this is Made in the USA!
 I've slept on this mattress for over a week, and so far it's a blessing.  It was easy to get accustomed to.  It's just the right firmness for me.  I'm totally satisfied.
 Mattress arrived as promised. Expanded quickly with no weird smells. After about a month have found it to be very comfortable and I get a good nights sleep. How it holds up only time will tell. So far I am delighted!
 Good value. Casper is much more expensive and it's basically the same mattress.
 Bought this based on other reviews - Glad I listened to them, I'd Highly Recommend!  Super comfy, no chemical smell....just make sure to have enough room to let it naturally unfold.
 Everything as advertised - easy to set up, comfortable and best value bed we have ever owned.
 Good quality mattress.  Great customer service.  We've had it for about a year I think, and just recently my husband and I both realized it was just a little too firm for us.  We decided to get a latex mattress topper, and that has helped considerably.  If you like extra firm, you will like this.  We are both smaller people (125 lbs and 160 lbs).
 Bed is quite firm - I wanted a firm mattress, and it's more than I thought. I am buying a slightly softer mattress cover to go over this one.  Every bit as thick/firm as the original Tempurpedic mattress.  Delivery was right on time - had to unbox and unroll it (as expected), and had no issues.
 I came from a very soft box spring, and now I can't go back. I used this on the floor while setting up my apartment and it was so comfortable. Very supportive, didn't take long to get used to, and easy to ship and move. Pro tip, if you have to move it- you can fold it in half and a queen will fit in the back of an SUV. It's not recommended but it works.
 So cool the way this expands from vacuum compressed packaging, but still have not been able to sleep on this as I am still awaiting now one week for the horrible smell to dissipate.
 We weren’t sure when we ordered it if this would be ok. We had picked it based on Consumer Report.  Great surprise. Very comfortable mattress, neither of us has back or hip pain. Highly recommend it, would definitely purchase it again.
 We have bought 4 mattresses in 5 years all with disappointing results.  All of them developed "valleys" of significant depth on the sides which we sleep (we are average size folks in a king size bed).  It was such an issue that I had to sleep with a pillow in the valley just to turn over in bed!  We bought 3 of these mattresses online and one at an "off-brand Serta" hybrid-mattress store.  We shopped at another mattress store and found the prices so high ($3000+), we just couldn't possibly buy one on our fixed income.<br/><br/>With a lot of searching online, we decided on Tuft &amp; Needle.  They also offered a "monthly pay program" where others did not. It was delivered in 2 days and we let it inflate in our guest room.  We didn't have; any "smell" associated with the mattress.  We have a platform bed and since we're both in our late 60's we had a bit of a problem getting it to our bedroom because of our age! We also bought a protective mattress cover.<br/><br/>We've been sleeping on the T&amp;N mattress now for 3 months and it's wonderful!  It's more on the medium-firm side which is fine for us.  There is not a hint of a valley and it's cool even with the mattress cover on it.  AND we can use the whole mattress and not prisoners to one side of the bed "dips". In addition, you get an extended warranty free and a 100 night guarantee. In short, we are patting ourselves on the back for making such a smart purchase and you will too!  Thank you, Tuft &amp; Needle for making this great mattress.
 I totally love this mattress. My wife also loves it because she cannot feel me toos and turn throughout the night. Great mattress at a great price.
 Don't waste your money on the big box store mattress places.  This one was reasonably priced, easy to set up and comfortable.  Medium firm if your asking.
 This is our second of these.  The first one we bought for the cabin.  We liked it so much we replaced our Stearns and Foster at home.
 So far the Tuft &amp; needle king size matteress is wonderful. We slept on it the first night. We did not smell any odor like some have mentioned I measured the height of the mattress before we slept on it &amp; it was 10 inches high so we slept on two nights already. &amp; we just loved it. No complaints what soever. Thanks Tuft &amp; needle.
 I purchased a pillow-top mattress 12 years ago for nearly $4,000!! It served me well over the years and I had no intention of getting a new one, as I can be quite frugal when it comes to large purchases. Besides, I had grown so accustomed to the his and hers trenches on either side, that lying flat might have sent me into shock. At night, my body yearned for the comfort of such familiarity, but my husband expressed feelings that were the polar opposite of mine: he dreaded going to sleep. So I had reached a conundrum: I loved our bed and didn't want to waste money on a new one, but my husband was insisting that he would keep making me feel guilty if I didn't. Of course, I had to swallow my pride and begin my search for a new mattress. After days of reading blogs, research articles, shopping reviews, and any other information relating to sleep that I could get my hands on (my hubby prefers firm and I prefer soft, so I had a major obstacle to overcome), I reluctantly decided to go with this one. I say "reluctantly" because I was worried about 2 things: 1) the price was less than 1/4 what I paid for my old mattress, and I assumed cheap meant crappy; and 2) memory foam seemed much less appealing than my beloved pillow-top. But if it meant my husband would shut up...I mean, feel better...then it was worth the risk.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the new mattress in place: the first night on it was miserable. I barely slept. I was hot. I was uncomfortable. It was just plain misery. Then we decided to buy a 2" foam mattress topper to add to it. Why add foam to foam? I have no idea. Maybe it's different because it's gel, and one side stays cool for the warmer months, while the other side stays warm for the cooler months. We already have one of these on top of the regular spring mattress in our motorhome and isn't that great, but a friend assured us that it was the perfect addition to a memory foam mattress. Well, that friend was right! Less than $1,000 and 2 months after I hesitantly clicked "Buy Now", I LOVE my bed!! I sleep quite well, and my husband's neck and back pain is now non-existent. Of course, I slept well before I bought this, but in case you are hesitant to click that "Buy Now" button, you needn't be. I did add something to make this mattress ideal, but it obviously has its own appeal if the same addition makes no difference on a spring mattress. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I will absolutely recommend this brand to others.
 I was very excited to receive my mattress, since i have been sleeping on an air mattress at my new place for 15 days now. The mattress looks comfy, but the moment i opened its package, i realized there are some stains on it which makes it very unappealing to embrace as a brand new mattress.
 Best night of sleep I've had in a long time! This mattress is perfect for me. I was surprised when the box arrived because it was so small and was concerned that maybe they shipped the wrong size. However when I opened it up there was indeed a queen mattress in there, densely compressed. It poofed up after we took off the plastic wrap. I love this mattress and am buying another one for our son. It arrived on the day they said it would.
 Off put gas was not evident by smell, BUT we both had a chemical sensitive reaction to polyurethane foam and chemical fire retardant. DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON.Go directly to the manufacturer !  A return means boxing this thing back up. Any other resolve will not be heard of by Amazon. "You bought it from us, so return it to us."  Fair enough, but the manufacturer has a Local pickup service for returns. Do not assume as I did...  We ended finding this as a blessing as it promoted research on sleeping with polyurethane and chemical fire retardants. DO IT ! Wool bed Company did it for us. Good luck and healthy sleep to all.
 I've tried a few beds over the years and have had a lot of pain and discomfort in my lower back and neck.  With this mattress I have been able to sleep soundly without pain in the morning.  By the way I'm 6'1'' 305 pounds and I sleep on my side, back or stomach any given night and all positions are actually quite comfortable.
 my first impression of this mattress was....ITS SUPER SOFT! just the way i like it. tonight will be my first night sleeping on this mattress. Hopefully, I'll remember to write an update review about it. If all goes well, I will buy a King size mattress for my two friends who are getting marry soon as a present.
 I don’t like the mattress. It’s very firm. No bounce and no cushion. I wake up sore every morning. Don’t want to hassle with finding new mattress so hoping it gets better as we use it. Don’t know what all the raves about with this mattress.
 This is the very best bed I have ever slept in. No more back pain. That's all I really need to say. I sleep. I wake up. I don't hurt. Buy it. You will not regret it it. This company is rad.
 I had a Beauty Rest pillow-top mattress on top of a hard platform (boogie board?). I was not happy with my quality of sleep but had made the investment and was determined to ride it out. After too long a time, I investigated other mattress solutions. Recently, I purchased the 10" Tuft &amp; Needle Queen Mattress. There was a smell initially, so I left it on my covered patio for 1 day, after removing the packing material, to air out.  After a week, I am sleeping better and getting up less each night. This new mattress seems to be the right amount of firmness for me and is slightly lower than my old pillow-top, which makes getting out of bed easier (I'm a senior with a bad hip). I weigh 290 lbs and this mattress retains it'd shape and firmness. Overall, I'm very satisfied and give it a 5 star rating.
 We bought this mattress while my wife was pregnant. She had been uncomfortable due to the pregnacy, so she didn’t really object to it at first. 2 years later and she doesn’t like it. She thinks it is way too firm. When she contacted customer service they told her the topper was not available to us for free, because we bought the bed from Amazon.
 So far so good! We have had the bed a couple of months now and we have not seen any sagging or discomfort so far!
 We have had a high quality coil/spring mattress for 12 years.  My husband was having mid/lower back pain, so we figured it was time for something new.  We are both moderately small people and side sleepers, so we were not looking for too firm of a mattress.<br/><br/>We went to a Sleep Number and was impressed with their beds, but they are just unbelievably expensive.  Most of the Amazon mattresses that allowed returns looked to be very difficult (how exactly do you expect to be able to ship one of these back to manufacturer...).<br/><br/>We were impressed with Tuft&amp;Needle for their price, reviews, and return policy.<br/><br/>On to the mattress... it is initially very soft, but after a few seconds you realize it really is quite firm.  We sleep well on every mattress and this one has been no different.<br/><br/>The main complaint is there is very little (well, none actually) support around the sides of the mattress.  If you get close to the edge, you'll roll right off.  It isn't a huge deal, but does effectively make your bed smaller.<br/><br/>Also, the setup of the bed is very easy and it is amazing to watch it "inflate"... the reviewers complaining about the chemical smell are just looking for something to complain about as the smell is very minimal and dissipates quickly.<br/><br/>My husband's back pain has been marginally better since the new bed, but time will tell.  Thus far we have been using the bed about 2 weeks.
 Simply the best mattress I've ever slept on, period.  Cool and comfortable.  Look no further, this is the best.
 I can't even begin to tell you how much my husband and I love this bed!!! Best investment we've made in a long time. So comfortable. We sleep so well and hardly toss and turn now. When we do, neither of us feel it!

 Been using it for 10 months. It might be the best mattress I’ve ever owned.
 I just bought the mattress and it pops right out when opened.  Pretty cool.  Unfortunately, I bought the bed frame from West Elm and it was supposed to be delivered two weeks ago and still has been delivered.  #EpicFailWestElm
 Overall, it is a well built mattress and I like it.  Most importantly it is made in the USA: This is the reason why I opted for this over other similarly priced foam mattresses from Costco and other retailers.
 We are impressed with this mattress. We always got hot on our other mattress but this one is cool and nice. We are happy with it, especially with the price!!
 Love everything about it. Not too hard, not too soft. It was delivered in two days and took just about thirty minutes to set up and get the bedding on it. We will be buying another for our son’s room.
 Easy to set up. 2 people made it easier to manoever. Comfortable and cost effective. People warned it might be warm, but it was fine for me.  I bought a queen and a full.  Good reviews from the family.
 We love our bed! I would recommend getting the topper from tuft &amp; needle if you don't like it super firm. The topper really took it from too firm to perfect!
 We didn't need to use it though because WE LOVE this mattress!  Sleep is so much better.  What a great bed and a low price.
 my husbands back is not sore any longer when waking in the morning. Time will tell how it holds up.
 I can’t believe we ordered a bed in a box delivered in 2 days. Welcome to 2017! No more back pain. I sleep mostly in my stomach and side and this is firm enough for me. I now sleep on my back too!
 This is the second mattress I've bought from tuft and needle and everyone who has layed on it absolutely loves it. I bought this mattress for my uncle who has everyone come to stay at his house. It was a hit! Ive had mine well over a year and my partner and I absolutey love how cozy it is, we often dont want to get out of bed.
 My son bought this with one of his paychecks and loves it. We are bigger people 200 plus and noone sunk down in it like so many that are mushy.....he is 6 foot, 220 and loves it.
 LOVE our new mattress! California King, unfolded in perfect shape, no odors, clean, beautiful, easy-peasy! We could not believe how user-friendly this is! IMPRESSED is not a big enough word! :-) Sleeps cool. gentle firmness, perfect support. We will recommend this mattress to all of our family &amp; friends!
 We've had this mattress for a little over 3 months now and I feel like I can finally share my final thoughts on it. I LOVE IT. I did weeks of research before making the decision to purchase this one. The other mattress we considered was the Casper, but after testing one out that was in our local West Elm store, we decided that it sunk way too much and probably wouldn't be supportive enough. I wanted a soft mattress and my husband wanted something firm. We found ourselves in a "3 Little Bears" story and were worried we weren't going to find something that was just right for the both of us. But after seeing that T&amp;N gave a 100 day return policy, we took the plunge and bought a king size. It delivered in TWO DAYS! Amazing! I was concerned when we first purchased it because it was very firm, especially in comparison to our 13ish year old tempurpedic mattress (gross!) But it just showed me that having that old mattress was causing so many back problems for my husband and myself. Our tuft &amp; needle mattress took a couple of weeks to "break in" or maybe we just adjusted to the new feeling of it. I purchased a zip mattress cover to prolong the life of it and protect our investment, and then I also purchased a 100% cotton mattress pad, it's not very thick so it doesn't compromise the true feel of the mattress, but just gives a little extra comfort.I wake up hot some nights, but probably because I wear sweatpants, sheets, blanket, and have a heavy goose feather down comforter. I call it my marshmallow bed, because it really is that comfortable. I was not paid to give this review, I just felt like contributing my opinion to those who are finding themselves in the same position as I was in. Solid ethical company, affordable product, comfortable, and chemical free.
 Wow! That's all I can say. Was a bit skeptical at first because of the cost and how different from a "normal" mattress this was. We purchased a king and after a week I am absolutely in love. The first two nights were as little rough adjusting, but now I sleep like a rock. Will be Tuft and Needle supporters for a very long time.
 I really want to like this mattress but I'm about a week in to using it and its really, really firm.  I'm a side sleeper and it doesn't seem to be that forgiving in the hip area, and I've been waking up with a sore lower back.  I'll give it another week...but I'd echo other reviews on firmness (and I like firm mattresses!)
 The quality of the Tuft &amp; Needle full size mattress I ordered is great. My daughter really likes her new bed. The people at Tuft and Needle were great to talk to and corrected the wrong size mattress that Amazon sent with speed and they were so helpful. I'm recommending this mattress to my friends and family!
 Got this for my friend, saved her from back problems she was having. It's very comfortable while feeling firm and supportive.
 This bed is a tad firm, but I bought a down mattress cover for it, and it’s amazing now!! My husband no longer tosses and turns. And NO MORE SNORING!! Yea for me!!!!!!
 Supper deal ! This save me big bucks from buying local . Fosbrooke is a A+ Amazon Seller with a great product. I have went thru multiple mattresses since I fractured my back and this is by far the best I have ever come across . I would recommend their mattress to anyone for back relief !
 Looking at all the reviews, i thought this would be a really good mattress to buy. The first couple of weeks, i started to get back aches and i thought maybe i need to try it for a longer period and i did for almost four months. Even now, every morning, my back is really stiff and sometimes i still get those back aches. I have another bed which i tried it for a week in between and that was fine. I would be more than happy to return it and purchase something instead. This is not "for everyone" kinda bed.
 Wow!  I only had this mattress one night but this is the first time I can remember getting up in the morning and not feeling stiff and achy especially in my lower back.  Very comfortable and I did not feel movement when my husband moves or gets up.  We both had a really good night sleep, in fact, the first in a long time.
 We love this mattress! We were a little unsure about purchasing a mattress without laying on it first, but their 100 night trail made that decision easy! Super easy to set-up, great price, and super comfy. It's been great for my husband's back pain. Previous mattress was too soft and no support. This mattress is soft, but offers great support! Highly recommend. We just purchased a Twin for our son too.
 So far so good, had it for a couple of weeks and it's firm but cushy and doesn't dip, I don't sweat as much, better than the Tempur-pedic II used to have... and so much cheaper.
 Bought this when it was on sale (-$200.00) and never looked back. Extensively researched more expensive competitors like Purple, Endy, and Casper but felt the price points too high on my budget. Not a single complaint about this mattress, and I sleep incredibly well on it. One word of caution if you're prone to a stiff neck you may need something softer.
 Amazing comfort. The warranty speaks to the quality of this mattress.  The price is unbeatable for the quality of the mattress.  Shipped right to the door and expands in seconds.
 Got two of these for a loft apartment, after reading all the positive reviews. Have not been disappointed. In fact they are so comfortable, my husband and I often sleep in the loft, even though we have a mattress that was double the cost.
 I had a sleep number bed and after time it was uncomfortable with the "bumper" between my husband and I's sides. I started researching beds a year ago and after researching the Casper, Leesa, Bed in a Box, Bamboo with green tea,  this was the one I chose. We love this bed. Will buy more of these for our kids and guest room.
 I was a little leery at first I've heard great reviews about these mattresses but I must say that all the hype on them has proven me to be a fan I get so much better rest than I did before now if I could get the wife to move over I might get even better sleep lol
 Comfortable mattress. Much lighter weight than our old mattress and box springs. It did take a couple of nights of sleeping on the mattress before my body adjusted. Since then, absolutely no problem. Sleeping well.
 Very comfortable able, helped my back problems with in a few days of sleeping on it. Easy to unpack. Nice not having to go to a mattress store.
 This Mattress is FIRM!!! I am a side sleeper so I wanted to get a Memory Foam mattress that would alleviate the pressure points. Unfortunately this Mattress is too firm. The good news is I don't question the build quality. I do expect it to last for many years. Ordered a 3 inch memory foam topper to go on top and now sleeping wonderfully!
 Wow!  What a wonderful mattress!  Bought this for when visiting daughter out of state because we have an IComfort mattress at home.  This is better than the IComfort.  Weighs so much less that I can move it myself.  No odors and opened up and filled out within an hour.  Did walk on it for a short bit to soften it up (like we had slept on it a week already) and we slept wonderful!  Will be ordering another for guest room at our home.  We put it on a slat frame where slats are four inches wide and just two inches apart.  Works great!
 I like my mattress to be on the firm side, and this fits the bill. Combined with the price, level of comfort, and ease-of-purchase and delivery, I will never shop at a mattress store again - thanks Tuft and Needle!
 I've been using this mattress since the end of December ( about 2 months) and it's been incredibly comfortable since day one. I unpacked it around 1 pm and was able to sleep on it that night. There wasn't a strong foam smell or anything either. Every time I lay on it I'm excited to be in bed. My back pain cleared up fairly quickly once I started sleeping on it as well.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on! It took a few nights to adjust (being used to traditional springs) but now I’ll never be able to go back. I actually crave going to bed ❤️
 From the very first night we have slept well.  No adjustments necessary such as additional padding, etc.  We also purchased the same mattress for my 83 year old mom.  She absolutely loves it as well.  I'm so thankful.  We have recently paid for overpriced mattresses and been so disappointed and frustrated with back issues and too much "bounce" when my husband or I rolled over or got in/out of bed.<br/>Once again...LOVE THIS MATTRESS!
 Forget Casper. They're more expensive and I can't see how they could possibly be better than this. I bought one last year and this is my second one!
 My dad researched the best mattress for me since I suffer from back problems and came across Tuft and Needle. This mattress has made the biggest difference in my life and I will never go back to using other mattresses! I have yet to lie on another mattress and think that it exceeds my Tuft and Needle mattress; soft and flexible with just the right amount of support. Not to mention their awesome customer service, they make sure you're happy and satisfied, working way beyond standard customer service.
 Too hard to slee on my side, barely can sleep on my. Ack. Strange since it feels soft.
 I've had this mattress for a week now. I was able to move the mattress upstairs and unbox it there, but as they describe this is really a two man job. (And where are the side handles?) Sleeping on it is much like sleeping on a giant marshmallow. It's supposed to be firm but I wouldn't call it that. I'm heavy and I sink right in. Turning to sleep on my side is difficult - it's like trying to roll up hill. A mattress that wasn't as thick might not have this problem. Once I do wiggle into position the quality of my sleep is as good and maybe better than with my previous mattress. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and do not expect to return it.
 This is one of the best things I've ever bought in my life. I love my TN mattress. No springs. I'm 6'5 and heavy and it's held up great these 6 months.
 It's firm. But we like it. It is in my daughter's room who weighs about 60 lbs. Her room is the guest BR when we need it. When I have slept on it, it's a bit too firm for me.
 I had been looking to buy a new mattress for quite some time.  But, price and different brands, models, specifications etc. made the task very confusing as to which one was the right one for me.  Recently, I stumbled upon a “Tuft and Needle Ten” mattress review from my long time trusted consumer review magazine.  I took immediate interest and decided to check it out.  I went on the Amazon website and read many of the posted reviews.  I started with the negative ones first.  Basically, the major criticism was the firmness of the mattress which concerned me.  Despite the comments I decided to purchase the mattress.  It arrived a day earlier than scheduled and I could not wait to try it out.<br/><br/>First of all, I did not notice any odor whatsoever  a minor criticism that I read about].  When I finally got to sleep on the mattress, WOW!  What a pleasant experience.  I felt the mattress form itself around my body with every twist and turn I made.  Unlike the foam I had on my “old” bed, the spots I moved from did not leave a divot.  The mattress immediately bounced back to its flat shape, once again embracing my body.  Needless to say I was extremely impressed from “night one.”  Better yet, I had a beautiful nights’ sleep and woke up refreshed. This mattress was the perfect blend of firmness and softness that suits me perfectly.  Needless to say, I could not wait for my second night praying that my first night experience was not a dream.  I am happy to say it was more of the same “heavenly sleep.”  I have given my mattress a nickname; “CLOUD TEN.”<br/><br/>Although I would normally give it more time to write a review, I was so impressed “right out of the box,” I decided to waste none and to share my experience as soon as possible.  I suffer from spinal stenosis and I have had two herniated discs.  A good mattress is very important to me and I believe I have finally found it.  To top it all off, the price of the mattress was just unbelievable and it came to me in a box.  WOW!<br/><br/>I understand that if the purchaser is not satisfied they can send it back.  Well, I personally would not "dream" of doing that.<br/><br/>I extend a very special thank you to my “Consumer Reports” magazine for reviewing this product and Amazon for making this mattress available.  My back thanks you also!
 Purchsed at doctor’s recommendation...memory foam as I’m struggling with arthritis, manifesting in my bottom.😳. Overall, good product; however, purchased another brand with less depth...feels much better.  Will keep for now, but will eventually replace.
 I was hesitant to order a new mattress online without trying it out.  Amazon featured this mattress at a discount during Prime Days. It was a great deal and decided it was time to try it out. My husband and I could tell a big difference the first night we used it. I have been sleeping great since we purchased it 4 months ago. if you are looking to replace your current mattress, I would recommend Tuft and Needle.
 The mattress is really perfect for me. I have back issues and this mattress has allowed me to sleep through the night. It's really the perfect combination of softness and support. I was definitely hesitant purchasing a mattress online but the 100 night sleep trial put me at ease. I think I'll be sleeping on this baby for quite a while.
 Feels like your sleeping on top of jello. I was given full money back and gave to charity.
 My husband and I were very skeptical about purchasing beds online based just on reviews. We are happy to say these beds have worked out awesome! They are very supportive and very comfortable. My husband used to wake up every day with shoulder pain and now he can wake up pain free! Its only been a couple of weeks but we are hoping they continue to be great, and for the price its not going to be terrible if we have to replace them every 5 years.
 We have only had the mattress for 3 nights, but love it so far!  We feel fortunate to have found this mattress company online before we spent big bucks for a coil mattress at a store.  This mattress is the best value in mattresses!  And the customer service is outstanding, couldn't possibly be any better.  We're keeping it!
 Bought it at a time it had 5 star reviews and there was a lot of product hype. Slept great for about a month. Now I have to flip and spin the mattress every month to stay comfortable. It has been great for stomach sleeping, not that great for side sleeping (tingly arms), and bad for back sleeping for me personally.
 I ordered two Tuft &amp; Needle twin XL mattresses for a split king bed.  I received one mattress on a Thursday and the Second on a Friday.  Much to my surprise they have different covers and different model numbers. When I called T&amp;N they said I could return one but there was no guarantee that a replacement would match the one I keep since they have no control over Amazon's shipments.  This is likely my last Amazon purchase.
 Still sleeping on it, miss it already - definitely put it through some work (me, fiance, 6 cats, 2 large dogs) and it's been a dream to sleep on
 It's been a few months since we've had this mattress. I purchased it because it had good reviews and I didn't want to go into a mattress store and pretend im testing out a mattress. I never understood how laying down on a mattress for 3 minutes will give you an idea of how you will sleep for the next ten years. In any case, this company offers a 100 day warranty through their own website and 30 days on amazon. I purchased on amazon even though I would be on vacation for the next 3 months, thereby voiding any type of money back warranty, but it's still good to know they stand by their product. I think they were one of the first to sell directly, via free shipping to your home, and now there are others; however, I did not buy the others, Just bought this one and we love it. My wife is picky and she loves it too.  We never get hot in either and never wake up with back pains and I have had many years of back pain. All in all, this is a great mattress, we bought one of those iron box springs because our bed doesn't have the slate system. 750 easy deal.
 Excellent mattress.<br/>Did extensive research before buying and am very please with T&amp;N. Can highly recommend this mattress. Sleeps so much cooler than my old memory foam mattress.<br/>Would buy again.
 I've been sleeping on this for 3 months and it is very comfortable, especially for the price. It sleeps harder than I prefer, but my back doesn't hurt, so I will be keeping it. It sleeps cool as advertised. I put a water resistant mattress cover on it and it slept very hot. So I took the mattress cover off and it's sleeping cool again. I definitely suggest people look into this bed.
 I’m about 30 nights sleeping on this mattress.  Had to get a box spring &amp; this has been the remedy to the softness.  Having been someone who has awaken many times throughout a night I am getting a solid 4-5 hours with this mattress!  I would recommend &amp; have to others.  The caution is in the box spring, if you are accustomed to firmer you will need a box spring.
 Very happy with this mattress. Comfortable, does not get hot. We've used it for about six months now.
 This mattress is just what we were looking for at  a great price! My husband and I both have bad backs and after a few days, we really felt the difference in our muscles because of the perfect firmness. We are totally satisfied with this purchase. Similar mattresses cost twice as much.
 Buy it.... stop thinking about it. Just buy it. As soon as I opened up the bed I gave it a few hours to gather itself and I went to sleep in it.... this was around 4-6 pm. I woke up the next day at twelve. ...  ON ANY OTHER BED I CAN ONLY SLEEP FOR 6 HOURS OR LESS!!!<br/><br/>Buy it. Spend the money.<br/><br/>As for heat I am an extremely hot sleeper. I don't understand the magic used, but it felt like the bed is sucking away the heat. Easily the best thing I've ever felt<br/><br/>Now the one question I haven't seen, how is the bed for super heavyweight people. Well... it's fantastic haha. I don't feel like I'm going through the bed I feel stable and even jumped in it a few times to be sure. It's an amazing bed. I'm 295 pounds.<br/><br/>Buy the bed
 This mattress has been incredibly comfortable! Initially, my husband and I were worried about how firm it seemed (I like my side firmer, he softer) but we have been impressed with how this mattress provides support and is firm enough and soft enough for both of our preferences. The price point was perfect and the quality is above said price point.
 Good bed.  We had a queen size Casper before this for 2 years and was not impressed buy it.  This is much more firm than the Casper and around same price at the time of purchase.
 My wife loves it! I love her!
 We purchased the mattress in hopes that it would work for us, but it is just too firm for us. My boyfriend recently had hip surgery and it is too firm for his current needs. The only reason we decided to purchase this mattress was because of the trial. However, we have been trying to return it, and the process has been difficult. We do not have a vehicle to transport the mattress to a UPS location and we do not have a box that fits the mattress. The mattresses come deflated and once you take it out, it inflates and is impossible to deflate. I have tried talking to both Amazon and UPS, but neither offers any help with this situation.
 The bed arrived, I opened the box, cut off the plastic and she expanded away. I have noticed a significant change for the positive in my sleep quality since night one. This mattress has an amazing combination of comforting softness and supportive underlying firmness. I highly recommend this mattress.
 I love this mattress. I was first worried since I prefer a firm mattress and this seemed fairly soft, also I haven't had much luck with memory foam type material. But after sleeping on it for a few weeks I have no regrets. My back doesn't hurt when I wake-up even after sleeping on my side. My wife says it makes her hot but I haven't had that experience.
 Can get a little hot, but it's overall good support and has worked for me for about 2 years now
 This comfortable mattress replaces my 10-year old inner spring mattress. My 50 pound lab/beagle mix and I love it.
 Been using cheap mattresses for as long as I can remember, so I was looking forward to this. Packaging made it a lot more simply to get it down my narrow stairway than I expected, and even after a few days of break in it's very comfy. Right from the get go, in fact. What else can you want?
 Best thing , you don’t need help to install this.it comes as a roll and just put in on frame and voila ur bed is ready .its very comfortable.we will unit again
 I just received this mattress and I immediately unpacked it. It’s just amazing!! I previously got a more expensive mattress from Mattress Firm and returned it after 7 days cas I woke up every morning with a neck pain.<br/>The T&amp;N mattress expanded in just 20 seconds. I already took a nap on it after gym and it’s just perfect. I totally recommend it!!
 good packaging,timely  delivery by amazon, no smell upon opening. Sprang to full size right away. Extremely comfortable. Its def on the firm side so if thats not your bag this might not be for you, but we LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Got it for both our guest rooms and now thinking about getting for your master bedroom, because all of a sudden the guest beds are more comfortable than our 8 year old spring mattresses.very good product. and they deliver to PUERTO RICO, huge bonus
 Dont feel to admit and it may sound cliche, but this mattress  indeed is as good IF NOT BETTER than my old $2500 brand .<br/>Thanks to the guys who managed to create such a product
 The mattress is comfortable however we had to exchange it once because it did not expand to the full size to the point where our sheets looked big. Upon receiving the second one, even though we let it expand for 12 hours, it has been 1 month and it still has not fully expanded so we will be returning it. If you don't care about how your sheets look, it's a great mattress for the price.
 Amazing<br/>But a topper &amp; cover to protect the mattress for years to come. No more weird back pain.
 Had the mattress for a little over a month now. Very comfortable, not a hot mattress which is great because I run warm. Not too firm not too soft and good edge support. Worth it!
 This had an intolerable chemical off-gas. Luckily the return policy was excellent as promised.
 Finally found a bed that I like. I used to deliver furniture for a living, which isnt the best for your back. I've tried soft, firm, pillowtop, and I toss and turn all night. Great mattress
 Cannot compare with premium products but this mattress does indeed meet modest expectations. Has withstood "moon landing" exercises by infants.
 Very high quality, soft enough and keeps body cool enough. Love the smell😊
 I love my bed! I’ve had it for almost 4 months now and have zero complaints. I owned a Tempur-pedic before which was way too hot and became too soft very quickly. This one keeps me the perfect temperature and still feels the same as the day I got it.
 I was in the market for a new mattress, and was intrigued by the concept of ordering a foam mattress online.  There are now a lot of companies and foam mattresses to choose from, and I settled on the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress based mostly on price and the positive reviews of other customers.  When I received the mattress, setup was easy and I enjoyed watching the thing expand to full size after removing the packaging.  Once I had the bed set up, I was disappointed to find that the mattress was too firm for comfort.  I decided to give it some time, though, because a lot of folks recommend breaking in the mattress and letting your body adjust to it.  Unfortunately, it didn’t get any better, so I decided to return it – and this is where I discovered that the 100-day trial period prominently advertised on the T&amp;N website and in many online review sites doesn’t apply to T&amp;N mattresses ordered here at Amazon… only 30 days.  So if you didn’t catch that little note above, you’re out of luck.  Just be aware if you’re going to order here… don’t spend a lot of time evaluating whether or not you like the mattress, or you’re going to run out of time to return it!
 After reading the reviews, i took a chance and got one, first few days was a challenge for my body to get used to it, but after a week. No more back pain. I am a side sleeper and this matress is too firm for that so i had to adjust and sleep on my back to get the best results. I wake up more energetic and ready for the day!!
 We had just bought a new bed 6 months ago... woke up every day with a headache and sciatica. Was really desperate for a good nights sleep so I bought a new bed, the Tuft and Needle King. AND WOW. Can a bed be TOO comfortable? Haha. My wife and I never want to leave it. It's a perfect mix between firm and conforming. If you are feeling anxious about purchasing something online (like I was) let me put you at ease... I would GLADLY pay the normal 1000+ price of a normal mattress for this bed. It's worth every penny.
 I do not think I got a brand new for this purchase. This is my second T&amp;N mattress. I brought my first one right from T&amp;N company. This purchase I bought from Amazon and it is quite disappointing. The inner plastic bag was already cut. It came with a regular plastic wrap outside. There are two spots of stains on the mattress. And I do not know how can I return when I live here on the second fl apartment. Very disappointing.
 I haven't slept this well in many years. This mattress is amazing; my husband and I are sleeping great and I'm waking up without the back pain I've become accustomed to over the past three years. This is a wonderful mattress that is affordable as well. Thank you!
 Its a great mattress and seems like it will hold up fora long time. Its the quality of a casper but at a lower price. What I love is that it stays cool even though many memory foam mattresses don't. It is definitely a medium-firm mattress and is a little too firm for my liking, but I have only had it for a 6 weeks so it may get softer over time.
 Pretty good matress. Personally feel it's a little overpriced for it's comfort level. Not as comfortable as it's lead to believe. Overall, not a bad product. Shipping was good.
 I have sciatic nerve problem &amp; tossed &amp; turned all night do to leg pain with my old mattress. From day one, with this new mattress, I've been able to get a decent nights sleep, without any pain. It appears to have helped with my pain during the day also. Wish I had this long ago.
 This product is too soft. Im only 120 lbs and I bought a queen mattress hoping that it was going to be firm enough for my back because I have spine problems. But when I finally opened it and tried to lay on it, it caved in on me! I want my money back! Advertisement is false! On the picture is my daughter who is 8 years old, and look how it’s already making a dip by just sitting on the side...
 Love,love, love this mattress. I purchased one for my husband after sleeping on mine for a month. Just got rid of an $$$$ mattress a year old that was killing my back. The Tuft and Needle is the most comfortable ever had.
 Loving it. My husband likes firm and I like plush and we've found a happy medium. No as great for side sleepers but has been good for my back and sleep.
 I have never had a better mattress. My sleep quality has significantly improved and the same for my partner. I also fall asleep faster and stay cooler than my previous box spring mattress. Would highly recommend for anyone who likes to sleep.
 So i have been using it for a month now and i love it. I was afraid when i ordered it because i like firm mattresses and wasnt sure how this was going to turn out but its firm enough. I would def recommend it to others.
 So far so good. Mine does smell a little funky, but it is improving with time. Definitely supportive and comfortable. I'll check back in a few months with an update. I was having a difficult time deciding between two specific mattress companies and went with his one. Having not tried the other, I feel like I might be missing something...
 We have had our mattress for about 6 weeks now and we love it. It takes a few days to get used to it but we sleep so well in this bed! Not too hot, soft, hard, ect. It is just right.
 its what they say , but is not as good as I thought my older gelled memory foam mattress I loved was, but my wife loves it ... so we kept it ...
 This is not firm at all.  I have the IKEA MATRAND on my other bed and that is not as thick, but much more firm.  I'm getting another one of those.
 I bought this for my 4 year old and it's SO nice! I think I am going to buy the King size for my hubby and I because it's such a great quality mattress.<br/><br/> I loved that this came directly to our house, easy to set up, and SO comfy!
 I waited a couple of months before writing this review. This mattress is awesome. Keeps me asleep throughout the night with no back or neck pain. It is very high quality and keep its form and shape. It is thicker and less expensive than the Casper brand mattress. Not sure why they say the cover is not removeable because it is... unzip, remove, wash...
 Purchased this in December and very comfortable,  I was worried about buy a mattress online but saw all the good reviews , very happy so far
 I've had this mattress for just under a year now and still love it. I've always been a back sleeper and it's great for that, but this conforms to my body no matter which way I get comfortable. It's a great mattress at a great price.
 We love our mattress, and no, we are not getting paid to say this.  This mattress is not for people who love super-soft mattresses.  It's firm, but oh, so comfy.  DH thinks it took about a week to get used to, but says it's totally fine now.  I loved it right from the start.  Our only complaint is the smell; it's not horrible, but certainly noticeable.  Will try to air it out a little more this summer when we have more time on our hands.  :)
 I have owned this for 2 months and I just love it. The unpacking is super easy and fast. The mattress is perfectly flat with a nice-firm support (e.g. firmer than Casper). No heat, no pain, good for all positions. If this is your budget, look no further.
 Love my bed, arrived on time. Was worried about all the reviews saying it was too stiff but it really isn't it is perfect. Been sleeping great since the first night.
 Bad idea to buy a mattres online. This mattress is causing me shoulder pain and is not very supportive. I contacted customer service at Tuft and Needle and did not get a very sympathetic ear. Not recommended
 No chemical smell out of the box. Medium-firm. Doesn't transfer much motion. Great price. And our back problems have improved tremendously.
 This mattress is great! It's firm yet soft. I fall asleep as soon as I lay down at night and wake up feeling refreshed. I sleep on my back and side mostly. I also used to wake up hot every night but this mattress is so good at drawing away heat it always feels cool to the touch even with two in the bed all night.<br/>I have been sleep on it for two weeks now.  I will be sure to do an update soon...
 Arrived quickly, was easy to install on our bed, had no odor even right out of the box and we are sleeping much better.  Very happy with this bed and at a great price.
 This mattress is like sleeping on a spongy rock (a good thing in my opinion). It's very firm but comfortable and I like that it doesn't have the sinking in sensation that comes with memory foam. Pretty affordable compared to other foam mattress options too.
 Will be buying a second mattress for my downstairs room, extremely comfortable, high quality and great price. Comes so neatly air vacuumed in a box. Put it on a nice wooden frame and whalaa.
 It’s wonderful on the body but a but high pressure on shoulder and hips...until I put a 3” memory foam topper on it.  Now it’s very nice.
 Wasn't for me. Too hot &amp; a little to firm. Even tried it with a topper they sent, it was even hotter. Had to get a refund. Was really hoping it would work.<br/>Also makes my back/shoulders hurt. Sleep for about 4 hours with tossing &amp; turning trying to find a cooler spot.
 Best mattress ever! We've had it for about 6 weeks now and absolutely love it. It's heaven after the hideous sleep number bed we'd been sleeping on for 6 years. Firm, but softly supportive, it's hard to describe how it feels, but we love ours. Very happy we bought it.
 So far so good,I bought another one from the company, so we must like it , I'll let everyone know in 30-40 days, I pray it stays the same way, that is now!!!!!
 This bed is ok for the money, bought it for a guest room. It's better than a spring mattress but I have another bed in a box that I like better.
 I'm a heavy set side sleeper and I sleep like a baby on this new mattress. I've had it a month now and it's great. It's soft but also supportive. I wish that I had bought this sooner. I combed through Consumer Reports on the topic of mattresses and this mattress is in the top 10 and the least expensive.
 Wow, I bought into the millennial mattress hype and did huge market research and settled on T &amp; N for the price, and integrity. The lady and I are incredibly impressed. It was our first night last night and both of us had comatose sleep, this sounds unsettling but the bliss of pure unconsciousness is something we all strive for. Anyway I posted on social media and they responded and wished us the best. You will not be let down, don't buy the expensive competitors.
 While the mattress was not firm enough for us it was very convenient and well made. We returned it within the 100 day window due to it being too soft. I only recommend if you are a back sleeper.
 I only have one complaint, otherwise this mattress is awesome. Does it get a bit softer in time because I find it a little too firm unless lying on my back.
 My boyfriend and I have been actually getting more sleep and not waking up with back aches! Only thing I regret is not getting the queen bed instead of the full. We like our space, and we like to cuddle. If you have a queen bed and like the size and want a T &amp; N bed, get the queen for just $100 more. It will be worth it! I think it's too late for me to switch to a bigger size :(<br/>Oh, when you get the bed and you have a bedroom upstairs, make sure you have someone help you carry it up cuz it is a heavy box, or if you take it out of the box it still will be heavy!
 A great mattress is crucial!  Once we started using this mattress, a lot of my back and joint pain went away :-)  This is perfect for both my husband and I, who enjoy slightly different firmness standards.  He gets hot easily, but the mattress does not trap heat, so he does not end up sweating in the middle of the night.
 So comfortable!!! You don't sink in like memory foam mattresses. Great price too!!! I highly recommend!! I was skeptical to buy a bed I didn't lay in but I am glad I bought this because it is an amazing bed!!! Don't buy a memory foam bed off amazon, buy this bed!!! Me and the girlfriend both love it!!
 I heard a webcast about this company and heard the speech from the owners about how they came up with design.  I bought into the hype.  It's an OK mattress.  Nothing to write home about.  Not all that comfortable for me, but I am getting used to it.
 Great product. We are sleeping much more comfortably. The one thing that prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars is that my wife feels that it does not get rid of her body heat effectively. For myself, I think it works great.
 I thought this mattress would be a medium firm, but I think when T &amp; N changed it,  they may have softened it too much.  My husband and I both feel that there is not enough support, and it's just too soft for us. It feels comfortable when we first lay down, but then we wake up with back pain. I was really hoping to love this mattress.
 So my wife and I have been searching for a new bed and after two months of reading every review out there and going into the traditional stores we found an article about Tuft &amp; Needle.  I think it was NBC or ABC, I am honestly not quite sure but after reading that and then going to their website and then reading I think every review on Amazon we took the plunge and bought the California King size.  And after a week of sleeping on the beds I couldn't be any happier than I am.  The first day I slept in it I passed out so hard my wife had trouble waking me up and pretty much every day since then.  It is honestly not too soft and not too firm.. I does lean more towards the firm side but that is ok and makes it perfect.  On top of that when I get in and out of bed it doesn't seem to bother my wife as much as before when we had a traditional mattress.  I highly recommend this bed and both my wife and I are extremely happy customers.
 We love our new mattress. I love that it is made in the US and that they have a great way of thinking. They don't let people sell their products except for what they deem it to be. They are a great company so glad we found it. The mattress is very comfy and it is lite and easy to lift when making the bed.
 I was hesitant about buying a mattress in a box/memory foam style mattress, but since I've been sleeping on it I've been sleeping better every night. It's ultra comfortable and I don't sink into it like I thought I would. Soft yet firm at the same time. Such a great buy!
 Going on month 2 and so far, while some sleep issues have improved, this has not been the ideal reat we were expecting. It is a quite firm mattress and unless I sleep on my back I get pressure point pain.
 This is really the best mattress I have ever bought in my life. If you have back problems or any pain, I really recommend. It adapts perfect to your body and keeps you aligned (back, neck, pelvis, etc).<br/>Tuft and needle keep their word and everything they advertise is true. The mattress is not soft and neither hard, it is in the middle. Also their memory foam is different than other memory foams I have tried. Theirs is way better.<br/>Also it is a cheap mattress.
 So far, so good. Very comfortable. The only problem has my old dog, who cannot jump any longer (on her own) on my bed, since the mattress expanded to its full thickness after a week.
 So far I've had the T&amp;N mattress for 3 nights. I know it's early, but I will post an update later. I'm a pretty big guy at 6ft 300+ lbs. I was worried the bed wouldn't be firm enough, as I've slept on a 2 inch foam topper on the floor for the past 3 years because of back issues and sagging mattresses. The matress seems quite supportive so far for only being between a 6-7 firmness. The price for it is unbeatable, $500, when Leesa is going for $715 and Casper for $800. I couldn't​ give it 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. If you ask them about their IFD, they will give you the run around or flat out tell you they aren't answering your question because it's the "secret sauce". Well, as a large man with back problems and weary of sagging mattresses, I couldn't care less about your matress recipe. 2. As supportive as it is, I'm worried after a few weeks of being broken in, it might not be anymore because it's not as firm as I'd like already and it's brand new. All in all, seems like a potentially decent company to do business with that sells a quality product at a fair price, but time will tell.<br/><br/>*CONTINUED<br/>6/26/2017<br/>It's been a month and I am thoroughly impressed. Full disclosure, this is my first foam mattress, so I don't have anything else to compare it to besides the floor and innerspring mattresses. That being said, this is by far the best matress I've ever slept on. I was worried after a while it may get too soft, but it still is as supportive as day 1, and I'm a 300+lbs man who sleeps in the same spot in the same position every night. Not even an inch of sag, the first bed to ever make me feel excited to end my day. Well worth the purchase.
 Not feeling the bed. It's been a couple months, and my back pain has been worse than ever. It also isn't firm. I mistakenly thought it was like a memory foam bed, but it isn't. If you sleep with someone who moves a lot, you feel it.
 This mattress is super comfortable- it was a little heavy to get up to my third floor apartment, but to be fair I am a small and not particularly strong person. I’ve had it for about 3 weeks now and I’ve been sleeping super comfortably! Would def buy again
 Most comfortable bed I’ve slept on in a long time. Not quite as good as my old water bed, but close.
 Love my bed.  Period.<br/><br/>6'4", 195, got a Cali King.<br/><br/>I am pretty physically active and go to bed sore frequently.  This bed works for me, and I fit comfortably in it.  Setup was a breeze and it got here super fast.  Will buy Tuft &amp; Needle again when in the market.
 Came as announced, but did not work me. Amazon was spectacular in the return process.
 After several months of use I keep asking my wife how the mattress feels.  No complaints.  Actually she loves it.
 I think it’s ok and my wife hates it. Says her back hurts. It’s hurts mine sometimes too.<br/><br/>Also, It molds to the body permanently and you get these canoes in your bed.
 I usually sleep on my side so my ideal mattress is on the softer end. I've been sleeping on this mattress for nearly five months and am incredibly pleased. No signs of deformation - mattress still as firm and crisp as when I first bought it. Well worth the price.
 Our other bed is a 'by number' model with a pillow top. Very plush and comfortable, and was, comparatively, very expensive. I find this one just as comfortable, though not as plush, and like the fact that I don't have to find "extra deep" sheets to fit it. Regular ones do just fine.<br/>I had concerns when ordering about getting hot in the night. I have had a memory foam mattress in the past and would get very hot and have to find a 'cool spot', but after sleeping on this for a month, I have to say, I've not had the problem at all. We purchased an adjustable frame for this bed (due to snoring issues), and it works perfectly on the adjustable frame.<br/>This is a great value on a straight-forward product.
 Best mattress and we had 3 others in 5 yrs
 I waited awhile to review this mattress to see how it held up. It has been great!  It's comfortable and no sags or dips in it after months of sleeping on it. Best of all for me is that there was zero chemical smell to it from day one!
 Beware of this mattress for multiple reasons. 1) I flat-out don't like it. I'm a side-sleeper and it is much too firm and unyielding. It feels okay, initially, but I'm now on the 85th day of sleep on it and it already is very uncomfortable. This sounds strange, but it feels like it's trying to "push" me back out instead of letting me comfortably sink in. I'm writing this review following my second near sleepless night in a row. Odd, too, that our first few nights of rest were okay, but now nearing the end of the 100-night trial, my wife and I both are beginning to have strong dislike for the mattress. 2)  I should be pleased that Tuft &amp; Needle offers a 100-night trial with a guaranty of a full refund, but since I bought the mattress on Amazon, I am now concerned. Tuft &amp; Needle says only mattress purchased directly from them or their ONLY AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR, Huckberry, our eligible. However, Amazon's claim is that THEY are an authorized distributor. I imagine one way or another I'll be able to return this mattress, but it's already very confusing and makes me wish that I acquired the mattress through Tuft &amp; Needle instead of Amazon. Be careful if you proceed. You, too, may like this mattress at first but will be darn glad that you can return it before 100 days are up.
 I'm very happy with this mattress. It arrives wrapped up in a roll and quickly expands once the plastic shrink wrap is removed.<br/>I've been sleeping on it for months now and was so pleased with it that I recommended it to friends. It's quite soft to the touch but firm once your body settles in.
 This is my first memory foam mattress.  I find this mattress too soft and sinks in the hips and lower back.  It almost feels lumpy and does not sleep as cool as I expected.  I definitely need a firmer, more supportive mattress and plan on returning the Tuft and Needle I purchased.
 Very quality mattress at the price point having gone from a softer memory foam mattress I appreciate the firm yet soft feel to this matress
 I bought this mattress for my daughter. She's been sleeping well until recently. She's complaining of some neck pain. I'm wondering if anyone else has this issue.
 Quick delivery, easy set up.  It was in full form in less than an hour.  One of us slept great, the other terribly.  My wife said it was too firm for her, but I slept great.  Unfortunately, it’s going back.
 Not even sure where to begin! This is the greatest thing ever! I've never slept on anything better. This is the greatest mattress ever.
 I absolutely love this mattress!
 Mattress is superb. T&amp;N know how to balance simplicity and quality. We've had our king size mattress for a week. No breaking in was required. The bed was comfortable 8 hours after "popping it open". We set the mattress on a platform bed with 2 plywood size sheets of particle board for a box spring. We were warned that sweat can break down the foam so we put a washable bed protector on right away. I recommend this bed to everyone.
 This is my second Turf &amp; Needle king mattress. First one was perfect!  My mom took it.  So I purchase second king mattress from T&amp;N... disappointment!  Its soft!  Unlike the first of this same product, it's less quality... I returned it.  Soft mattress is bad for my back.
 Perfect for our guests
 We have the king sized and it is an amazing mattress. Works as advertised. We sleep better, have dramatically less joint pain, my motion doesn't disturb my spouse, great support for reading in bed, and much more. Based on our experience, both our adult sons obtained TN mattresses and love them! Customer service is incredible!!
 Loved it came in a box and the price, first 6-9 months it was great.  After that it’s all down hill.  Severe shoulder and hip pain from being a side sleeper 5’3” 115lbs and it’s too firm it is like sleeping on the ground.  My husband debeloped back issues and neck pain as well.  Do not buy this mattress.  Most positive reviews are writhing the first 30-60 days.
 Its a little too firm for me to be honest. When I sit upright I sink in quite a bit (as in sitting on the side of the bed). However when I'm sleeping on my back, it feels a little too firm. Overall though I'm still pretty happy with it, I do sleep pretty well.
 Wife and I have come to the conclusion that we are just not meant to sleep on foam mattresses. It's an amazing mattress and great quality but we can't seem to get a good nights rest on it. Tried different pillows and even a mattress pillow-top but nothing seemed to work.
 This is a firm mattress.. just know that. Also, I ordered the king which should be 76" wide. Mine after one week is still only measuring 71"?! I've read several other reviews regarding this issue. Its a HUGE inconvenience to have to stuff this bed back in the box and return.
 Broke my back in four places and was always waking up sore and miserable...but now I just wake up miserable! The firmness is great and I don't feel too much pressure on my pressure points like other reviewers  noticed - I also don't use a pillow top just the bare mattress covered in sheets.
 I had carefully researched mattresses and had my eye on the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress when sadly the price went up.  Nevertheless, I went ahead and bought the mattress and I have to admit it is worth the money.  One night's sleep left me free of pain that had haunted both hips for quite some time.<br/>Three nights, later the pain is still gone!  I managed to set it up by myself by drag and push method.  No problem.  No salesmen. No confusing sales pitches. Made in the USA. Happy customer.
 I was skeptical buying a mattress online but when I looked at the return policy and 30 day trial I decided to give it a try. I didn't want to deal with the pushy salesmen at the store and was surprised that I received my mattress within a week from ordering. When I first sat down I thought it was a bit too firm for my liking however sitting on it and actually sleeping on it felt completely different. I have organic cotton sheets on my bed and it feels amazing. Excellent support for my back. I am a stomach/side sleeper and I haven't slept this comfortably since ever. My husband and I share our bed and now my kiddos are jumping in too lol. This is a firm but not hard mattress I think people should know there's a difference in those. Best mattress I have owed and decently priced. I sort of feel bad for those who didn't have a similar experience.
 Bought this for our guest bedroom.  Quite honestly it seems every bit as comfortable as the Tempurpedic we have in our master, at a fraction of the price. It did take a few days for the strong smell to dissipate and instead of having to cut the plastic liner, I'd suggest that they have a tag that you could pull, but other than those two minor suggestions, we are thrilled with our new mattress. Hopefully our guests will enjoy it just as much.
 I am a side sleeper, and when I researched mattresses I found I should go for a softer and more conforming mattress. This mattress is way too soft! Providing hardly any support. Comfortable at first, then after a month or so I have developed neck and back pain like I have never experienced before. Buying a new mattress is a pain. It's overwhelming, and expensive. Even worse when you buy the wrong one. Don't be like me, do your research!!!!
 I waited sometime before my review, because it started out very firm.  I wasn't completely happy with that but bought a foam pad to compensate.  This helped for awhile.  Today I'm sleeping on the couch because the mattress kills my lower back.  From the reviews, it looks like it works well for many people, but I am truly wishing for my old 10 year mattress back...
 The best! Buy with confidence! So comfortable for me! In my opinion, the jerk on TV tells you not to buy a bed in a box because he does not sell them! GREAT BED!
 A friend told me she just bought a Tuft and Needle Mattress and love it and I had to try.  The mattress is comfortable but gives lots of support.  Once I opened the mattress covering, you could see the mattress expand and it took only minutes.  Would definitely buy again and recommend!
 We were looking forward to receiving this mattress after reviewing the feedback left by other buyers.<br/>Very disappointed to have received the mattress in King size almost 4 inches smaller than the bed.<br/>The gap is way too much to be filled in with bed-sheet/comforter. Not at all what we were expecting.<br/>This is our third online mattress purchase and never had to deal with this kind of problem before.<br/>NOTE: The dimensions of this mattress are 73.5 inches x 77 inches x 9.5 inches<br/>NOTE: At the bottom it clearly has a visible indentation already<br/>UPDATE 7/29/17- Thanks for responding. We opened the box immediately after it was delivered. It's been few weeks since then and there is no difference in the dimensions. We liked the mattress however, not happy with the fact that it runs much smaller than our bed and bends at the  edges when we sit on the bed we almost sink into it, not sure this because it runs smaller in size and doesn't get support from the bed itself. We have hence decided to replace the mattress and give it another try. Please..please make sure that this time around it doesn't run smaller in size and fits right. We are looking forward to the replacement mattress and hope it fits into the bed.<br/>Other than the edges and dimension we are happy with the mattress itself.<br/>UPDATE 8/3/2017- The replacement mattress was shipped immediately, only two days of wait. Unfortunately this one too runs much smaller than the dimensions mentioned. I have two king size beds and one king size mattress. The previous mattress I had fits perfectly on both the beds. We are disappointed this time around too, the mattress is much smaller than the bed. If the difference was small enough to be compensated by adding a thick comforter, we would have had no issues. However it runs so much smaller that its very evident by just looking at the bed and is too much of an inconvenience. If Tuft and needle can provide a filler instead of replacing this second time would be much better.<br/>On another note, this mattress is amazing. I am prone to minor back pain every now and then, but since the time we started using Tuft and Needles mattress I do not recall having back pain at all. It's just right, not too hard not to soft that you sink in. I would highly recommend this mattress if they can resolve the issue with it's size.
 The mattress arrived on time and was easy to pop open and place on the slats!  however I wake up sore at my pressure points - shoulder, hips, knees.  Need to buy a mattress topper for ease.<br/><br/>This would be a great "second mattress" or cottage mattress -- just not forgiving enough for my body.
 This was our 2nd purchase and they are great!<br/>Company stands behind their product really well too!
 This mattress has changed my life!  I replaced our 20-year-old mattress with this one, and I am finally able to get a good night's sleep again. Fast delivery and set up was so easy. Very happy customer!
 Love this bed. It definitely is firm, but supports my back and hips. Since getting this bed my back pain is so much better and I am not spending so much money at the chiropractor. This is our second T&amp;N bed. Just ordered the topper for my sons Ikea mattress. Love the mission and values of this company. Absolutely no off gassing. Can sleep on right out of box.
 This is my first review, I usually don't write reviews but this is something worth writing.<br/>My husband and I both have back issues making it extremely difficult for us to buy the right mattress. We spent thousands of dollars on mattresses that after a while  give us more problems and discomfort.<br/>I am extremely satisfied with these mattresses (Tuft&amp;Needle) they are not only the best and most comfortable mattresses I've ever owned but the company has excellent customer service. I ordered 4 of the XL tween 10" mattresses but had issues with one of them but the problem was resolved immediately. I highly recommend these mattresses and highly appreciate the quality of the company and his employees. I wake up fresh and with out pain 5 stars+ LOVE them.
 Bought the queen size, got it in 2 days, delivered in a box I couldn't believe had a queen bed in it.  Have slept on tempur pedic so thought this would be similar but costs much less, it is made in the USA of all locally sourced materials which did influence me.  It really does expand soon as the plastic is cut, I can't stress enough how important it is to have the bed on your frame when you cut the plastic and to be careful cutting, it is easy to cut the actual bed, I used scissors not a box cutter and did it very slowly.  There is an odor, I can't describe it, but it isn't good.  I put a fan in the room and febreezed it but that didn't make a difference, seems to be coming from inside the mattress.  Didn't get a headache or scratchy eyes from whatever the smell is it just didn't smell good.  It DOES go away.  The fabric cover on the bed has a zipper so it can be removed and washed (like tempur pedics do) which is a nice plus.  Heard how firm it was, which is why I bought it, it IS firm but the top layer is soft so it gives support but isn't hard at all.  I really love this mattress, this is the least amount of money I ever spent on a mattress and a decision I'm glad I made.  And the Tuft and Needle website has online chat for questions, which I did use, these people working the chat have a lot of energy and seem to really love their jobs.  So that was kind of fun actually.  I got the box in the house and all set up myself, I'm 58 and 1/2, average sized older broad and I did it myself.  This is a great mattress, great price and really great support by Tuft and Needle.  Wish I could buy 10 of them, really love this mattress, nothing is made in China which is a huge plus.  Good quality, delivers on support, great price no hassles at all.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
 We tried it, not a firm bed for support, you really need to be 300 lbs to use it
 I couldn't believe the mattress was in that box, but it was.  It'll unfold and puff itself up.  Very neat to watch.<br/><br/>Had the mattress for about 5 months, and we like it a lot.  It's dense - not bouncy.  I like firm support so that works great for me.  Not hard though either.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on!<br/><br/>I was told by a friend that this mattress was the way to go, so I ordered (from Amazon, I needed it quickly. Yay, Prime!) and haven't regretted it even for a second!<br/>It comes in a nifty, compact package. It's vacuum sealed, and once you open it…POOF! it's wonderfully comfy, and normal sized.<br/>I don't find it too firm at all. It offers the perfect amount of comfort AND support! No back or neck aches when you roll out of bed in the morning (if you can even force yourself to leave the bed).<br/><br/>I don't think I'll ever buy another brand of mattress again!
 Our innerspring mattress had developed a sag in each of our sleeping positions that was causing us extreme back pain.  We really didn't want to shell out another 2 or 3 thousand for another mattress, especially since we had just purchased the one that had developed a sag 3 years prior.  We decided to give a tuft and needle mattress a try.  It arrived about a week later in a huge box that was very heavy to move.  I'm not sure that I should have expected anything different since it was a king sized 10 inch mattress, but it was larger than I expected.  I was able to get it upstairs and unpack it and let it expand.  There weren't any odors or any other issues.  Our first night on it, I slept better than I had in a long time on our sagging mattress, but my wife complained that it was too firm.  I'm a back sleeper, and it felt fine to me, but she's a side sleeper and complained it hurt her hips.  The second night I slept ok, but did notice that it was pretty firm, and if I happened to fall asleep on my stomach or anything else, it was very uncomfortable.  After a few nights, my wife was sleeping in the other room on our old bed.  I was about ready to call it a nice experiment and return the mattress, but read some reviews about getting a memory foam topper.  The next day I went to costco and bought a memory foam topper and we tried sleeping to see if it would work for us.  Luckily it wasn't too soft for me, but was soft enough for my wife.  If you are having firmness issues with this mattress and don't wish to return it, try a memory foam topper.  It is kind of annoying that we had to spend another 170 dollars for a topper to make the mattress comfortable enough, but we are now happy and sleeping well.  We are still within our month trial, and I'm still not 100 percent sure we will keep it, but so far so good.
 We're building a small vacation home and wanted quality beds without spending a lot of money.  We ordered one and slept on it for a month.  We liked it so much that we ordered another queen and two XL twin mattresses for the other 2 bedrooms.  The mattresses are firm but not hard, with just enough give to experience some very sound, comfortable sleep.
 I sleep so good. Great packaging, easy set up. I was able to carry and set it up myself. (I am 6'1" and 230 lbs, active lifestyle). Super comfortable. My pregnant wife and I love it.
 I love this mattress.  I am 55 years old, overweight, and I have arthritis in my neck and knees.  This mattress has brought me back to life!  My neck pain has diminished, my back no longer hurts, and I can sleep on my stomach for the first time in years.<br/>We'd been suffering on a 15+ year old mattress but I hated the idea of dealing with a mattress store.  I saw a Tuft and Needle ad on my Twitter feed and did some research.  I figured it was worth a shot.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it shrink-wrapped in the package.  Really?  Is this for real?  Watching it expand was entertaining -- it was QUICK.  It is amazing to me that anything that is that much air could also be firm and supportive, but it is wonderful.  We purchased a heavy duty steel frame platform that works very well with it.<br/>The mattress takes a little getting used to because it feels very different from my old inner spring.  It is also much warmer--I set my thermostat several degrees lower than I used to in winter weather--I don't yet know how it will feel in the summer.  Movement is dampened tremendously so my husband no longer wakes if go to bed after him or wake up earlier.<br/>There is definitely a smell that takes a long time to diminish.  We have had the mattress over 2 months and I still smell it, but just barely (but I am super sensitive to scents.  My husband never noticed it!)<br/>The only other drawback is that I am spoiled now!  I cannot sleep on hotel mattresses anymore!
 A very comfortable mattress. Much more comfortable than my older and more expensibe "pillow top" mattress.
 I guess for the price point it's a good deal. However, it's rock hard. I'm slowly getting used to it, but since I'm a side sleeper, it could be more supple.<br/>Sleeping on the back or stomach is another story - absolutely comfy.
 Soft but good support.  Very good mattress.
 My husband sleeps just fine, but for me this mattress is so stiff it is causing different limbs to fall asleep during the night. We've only slept on it three nights so far, but I'm not sure I can keep going. We may have to return it. We're both about 5-8 and 140lbs<br/><br/>(Update) We were able to get the mattress topper for free!
 Was a little skeptical going to these new 'foam' style beds but my husband and I love this bed! Not too firm and not too soft, molds to our body at night perfectly. Dont feel hot at night. No 'new bed' smell at all. Highly recommended!
 Good quality great price. - pretty soft so if you like a firm-very firm mattress this may not be for you. But it's super comfy cozy.
 I've had this mattress for about a month. It is very comfortable and I recommend it.
 So comfy! Customer service has been excellent. They contacted me just to make sure i was happy. Worth every penny.
 I hemmed and hawed for so long, comparison shopped for way too long. It’s been a few months now and still comfortable as hell.
 So far so good.  No more back pain!  We moved recently and decided to replace our old inerspring mattress and spent months researching.  We finally settled on this and it was definitely a good choice.
 Have not slept on this mattress, purchased for tiny home but is very comfy to sit and lay on.  It was recommended to me by a neighbor who loves theirs.
 Great, high quality mattress. Very supportive. If you’re not used to a memory foam mattress, it may be worth testing one out first, since it definitely feels different than a spring mattress (for me, in a super positive way). Can’t beat the convenience of having it delivered to your door with Prime shipping.
 So far this has been the best large purchase I've ever made! I was not getting good rest before, but now I am revitalized when I am awoken! I hope it continues to be this way.  I also bought an over stuffed mattress cover for protection.
 Had it for a month now and its incredible. I wish they would make pillows. The material smelled for the first few hours but not chemically nauseating like memory foam. It has the perfect amount of firm and give.
 I like that this product is "clean" and healthier but it just didn't provide enough support my me and my hubby.  We would both roll to the middle.
 The best thing is how it decompresses itself from a sad raisin to luxury mattress when you break the hermetic seal of the plastic.  Get your video camera ready and gather the kids to watch.  It will only happen once.  Oh, and it also feels as comfortable as my old foam mattress, which cost more and weighed a ton.
 I love my new mattress!
 Honestly, the best mattress I’ve ever purchased.  I have struggled with purchasing the appropriate mattress my entire adult life.  This mattress fits every single need you’ll ever have.
 I've struggled with back and hip pain for several years and have had back surgery as well.  Traditional mattress caused pain and stiffness in left hip especially.  This matress, while just a bit on the firm side, provides great support and has aleviated a lot of the hip pain.  I've also noticed a lot less tossing and turning and more restful sleep overall.  Would highly recommend, especially at the price!
 GREAT VALUE! Took a little longer to come than estimated. The smell took about 4-6 days to fully dissipate which we were able to do in another room.  INCREDIBLY comfortable.
 It's a very comfortable bed. We've had it for six months and there's no sign of denting. It might be worth mentioning though that we are both tall and athletic, so not a ton of weight being put onto the mattress.
 We love it. Our old mattress had a dip in the middle and we knew we had to get a new mattress but didn't know where to start. A friend of our who just built a retirement house and needed a mattress quick for the new house bought one and was singing its praises. So we bought one. It was very reasonably priced. It came compressed so it was easy to get upstairs.We put it on top of the old box spring because we wanted the same height.  It is so comfortable and  I highly recommend it.
 We tried these mattresses for over two months, we live in florida and they retain heat and are too firm. felt like was sleeping on floor. Tossed and turned all night because it cut off circulation. I thought with use it would get better but it did not. So will return them.
 Great matress- noticed a big difference right away &amp; I think it contributed to me not having to get back injections suggested by my doctor.  I  am on the road to recovery.<br/>Shipping was quick &amp; packaging was amazing - I loved watching it go from one inch to 10 inches with an immediate good night's sleep.<br/>Great product &amp; have recommended it to many people!
 Although it feels a bit more firm than my previous pillow top, I get a better nights sleep and wake up with less pain. Never going back to a standard mattress.
 Way too firm. I’m a side sleeper and had crazy back pain after sleeping on this mattress the second night. I had to spend an additional $60 for a mattress topper. If you are a side sleeper then buy another matress.
 We originally ordered this mattress in king size for our bed. My husband absolutely loved it, we were both having back pain from our old one, and were both actually feeling relief finally. After sleeping on it for about 2 months, I was just having a hard time feeling very comfortable. I’m just not crazy to the ‘stiff’ feel of memory foam, I’m more partial to a softer pillow top. We ended up returning it- which was probably the easiest thing I’ve ever done in my life. Completely free of cost, quick &amp; easy. But then re-ordered a twin xl so my husband could have it on his side &amp; I could get a pillow top on my side. Overall, I would say the mattress is excellent quality &amp; as long as you like the memory foam ‘sand sink’ feel (which I think almost everyone but me does) you will be happy. The price is awesome. The customer service is best in industry.
 Much nicer than my old mattress. The bed does tend to run a little hot, so plan on making sure you invest in sheets and what not to mitigate. For the price...I would definitely purchase again.
 After 16 months it is still a great mattress! The firmness is just the right amount.
 Too hard.
 Took a few days to get used to it. I started to realize I was getting a good night sleep with no twisting or turning all night like i did with my old bed. I felt rested and no shoulder or back pain anymore. I am not even sweating like before. If I start getting too warm. I just move a little and its cool again.<br/><br/>I definitely feel more relaxed and when I fall asleep I am still in the same position when I wake up. Which is great cause I am actually sleeping and not turning all night and waking up with side and back pain. I am a hard sleeper and this bed has definitely improved my mood.<br/><br/>I have laid on other foam type mattress and you just sink in which i don't like This bed actually stays firm enough and supports your body at the same time. I recommended this bed to my sister and she tried ours and liked it as well.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this bed or at least give it a chance. Everyone is different so It might not be for you, but it can't hurt to give it a try.
 Well, honestly I'm still kind of torn. The reviews for this were all staggeringly high, but so far is really hasn't been anything special. I haven't hated it, but I wouldn't call it the most comfortable sleep I've ever had. It's been about a month I'd say. This mattress is fairly firm and took my back about a week to get used to (woke up sore in the mornings). It does seem to be getting better as I spend more time getting used to it. Overall, it's a step up from my old mattress, but I don't think I can give it any more than three stars at this time.
 We have been sleeping on this for over a month and my wife's back pain has mostly went away. It is firm while still being supportive. We really enjoy it.
 I bought this for my daughter's guest room for us to sleep on when we visit.  We stayed with her for 10 days.  It's very heavy (75 pounds) but arrived in a compact box which helped.  Followed the directions in opening it and let the foam bed expand on the platform frame.  Worked perfect without the need to lift it.  I can see moving it not being an easy task once you have it expanded.  My husband was hesitant about it as we are use to a box spring bed, but after sleeping on it found it very comfortable. It doesn't make you hot like other memory foam beds.  You don't sink into it like other memory foam beds.  My husband gets back aches at times.  He had no issues with it.
 It came packed very nice, but this is the hottest bed, even the devil couldn’t sleep in it. I don’t sweat even when I work out and this thing has me dripping and sticking to my sheets. Bought a cooling topper and still sweat. Sending it back.
 This is our third mattress from T&amp;N!<br/>To say we love these mattresses - to say nothing! They are absolutely the best!
 Comfortable, soft yet supportive.  Good quality.  It had a faint rubber smell the first night, nothing offensive to me, and was totally gone in a few days.
 This was a necessity purchase as my previous mattress was destroyed during an unfortunate turn of events involving copious amounts of wine a flight of stairs and a houseful of people. Sadly I was not present to witness this debauchery personally, but I did in the end need a new mattress. I was looking for a mattress to replace it for the next year while I finished school, and this seemed like a good price for something that would be a nice middle ground of comfort.<br/><br/>After reading reviews online, Tuft and Needle seemed to be the best choice. Overall I was most impressed with the delivery and deployment of the mattress, The whole queen rollup fit in my Mustangs back seat, (not a big car) and I was able to climb the flights of my apartment with it with no problem.<br/><br/>Unpacking is a dream, simply unroll and watch as it suddenly becomes a full mattress. It is a lot of fun to watch<br/><br/>Sleeping on it however is a bit of a problem. I like a firm mattress but this is a FIRM mattress almost inexplicably so. Initially it gives, but I find myself turning quite a lot during the night to relieve pressure. It sleeps very warm compared to a traditional coil mattress, and in general I find myself gravitating toward the more "squishy" edges to take out some of the strain. The material is interesting, and I can sit up and read or work in bed, but I do sometimes find myself having to shift to make my back more comfortable. Motion is largely dampened in this bed, and I can honestly say that I have never been woken up by anything short of my significant other preforming what I can only assume must have been a flip to get into bed. That being said the motion dampening can sometimes be too effective and can make certain activities a little more challenging.<br/><br/>Overall This mattress makes me do what I have been doing since I bought it "This is only until I finish graduate school and therefore temporary"
 Comfy, easy to take out of its box, poofs up in about ten minutes. Definitely is more comfortable now that it's on a platform bed with slats (when I first got it, it was on the floor).
 I have back problems and my old mattress was not supporting my back.  The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress works great.  Back pain completely disappeared after 2 nights of sleeping on it.  Would definitely recommend it.
 Disappointed. if the mattress is so delicate that it tears while moving, It's not a very good one. Also the mattress sags in the middle after just a year of use. Wouldnt recommend.
 I like it.  Seems to hold its shape very well and doesn't wear in any way despite my, sleeping pattern!
 It's too hard! Hurts my shoulders when I sleep on either side I keep waking up in pain :(. This is NOT the cushing memory foam mattress I had hoped. Im disappointed :(.
 Got this for the guest room at the same time as a Purple for the master. Not as quite as comfortable as the Purple but way better than the spring we had before and much cheaper than both.
 My fiancee thought it was perfect. I on the other hard find it a tad too firm- so we got a 4 inch mattress topper and now my bed is literally my favorite place. I feel snuggled and supported and it's wonderful!!! However, even without the topper this mattress is great!!! As I said, I just am a wimp about firm beds. :)
 My daughter LOVES this mattress.  She says it is so soft it basically cuddles you!  It had a slight odor but the dissipated within 2 days time.  She slept on it the second night and didn't notice the odor at all.
 This mattress was too firm for our liking, per other reviews we were hopeful they would help with a topper. We were told this would be the case if we had ordered directly from Tuft and Needle, but bx we bought it from Amazon they cannot/ will not help in anyway. Returning our mattress
 This bed is amazing! And you get 100 days of sleeping on it and if you don't like it by the 100 day you can donate it and get the donation receipt and send it in to Tuft and Needle and they will give you your full money back.
 Our order for this mattress &amp; the delivery was easy &amp; efficient. It turned out to be too soft &amp; hot. We always had a mattress w springs &amp; we have gone back to that. I want to mention that our adult Dau thought the mattress was too firm. Hard task to satisfy everyone.
 Queen sized mattress.  Three weeks in, and the thing still smells bad.  First two weeks it was overpowering.  Made the whole first floor of the house stink for a week.  Second week the room stinks, now still the room but mostly the mattress.  Sort of a mildewy glue stink.  If a regular mattress smelled like this I'd have returned it immediately.  As for comfort, and sleep it's great, but will this smell ever go away?
 We've had this mattress for about a week and are really pleased. It's firm but very comfortable. We were in the process of moving when it arrived and had to leave it in the box for ~ 2 weeks before unwrapping,did not affect the mattress at all from what we can tell. Easy to wrap and fun to watch expand. Definitely recommend, esp. for the price!
 Bought for our guest room. Every who has stayed in it always comments on how comfortable the mattress is.
 Perfect for my twin girls. Great quality for the price. They both love their new mattresses.
 1 day late. Slept on the floor with my wife. Good times. Not.<br/><br/>Box shows up damaged and partially opened. That might explain the delay...<br/><br/>Mattress seemed unharmed, I jump with excitement and open it up. See attached picture as to why I almost jumped out the 2nd story window. It has been 12 hours and there's a dent in the mattress, right where it was folded in half. A 10 inch mattress everywhere else has 1 inch of deformed padding here. It extends to the very middle of the bed. Unusable on one side of the bed. Seems perfect on the other.<br/><br/>Not thrilled with this purchase, and now I have to figure out how to return this thing. I may take a replacement but this whole thing has left a sour taste in my mouth.
 Best sleep I've ever had. It's a lot more firm than what I expected, but it doesn't make my body ache like others I've had in the past. Completely worth the money.
 This was great... at first.  I purchased in December of 2016.  Now that I've had the mattress for over 8 months, it is no where near as comfortable as it used to be.  I wake up every morning with a backache.
 Since we got this mattress a year ago, the consistency has changed. We both travel a lot for work, and for whatever reason, we only but always have back pain when sleeping on this mattress. The only explanation is that it's gotten softer over time, which is too bad given it's meant to last for years. Disappointed in the quality of the purchase!
 The quality of this mattress is amazing. I have lower back pain and stress on my back with a regular mattress and with this mattress I have no pain or discomfort.
 This is by far the best mattress I’ve ever slept in. I actually spend my whole day at work thinking about how excited I am to go lay in bed. The mattress is supportive and cool and you never feel your partner moving in it. My boyfriend can get up and back in bed a bunch of times in the night and it doesn’t move the bed at all. Really an excellent mattress
 What can I say? The reviews don't lie. This mattress changes lives without breaking the bank.
 Perfect! Perfect sleep, and perfect value.<br/>Slightly narrower and longer than a King size, we love this Cali King.
 A bit of smell for me, but I am super sensitive. As far as comfort, I am so happy. I am guarded as its only been 2 nights. I am a chiropractor and would love to be able to recommend these to patients. The price is right, and the return policy is no risk.  If the customer service is as good as I've read, then this is the perfect company.<br/>After almost a week of sleep on this bed we are so happy we bought this bed. Even a night with a fever and body aches was comfortable.
 My wife is small and the need was comfortable for her (a bit firm). I have a bad back and am about 225lbs and it hurt my lumbar after a few days. For the right person it would work great.<br/><br/>Customer service was fantastic. They processed the return with no hassle and even wrote a hand written card along with the return check.
 I bough this last year (upgraded from an 20? year old king), and basically, it's amazing.<br/><br/>It ships in a box, you get the box, you assemble the frame (purchased separately), you open the box and watch as the mattress unfolds. Leave it alone for at least half a day or so, and then put some sheets on and pass out onto a cloud.<br/><br/>I have some issues with sciatica (and sleeping on a 20+ year old mattress was not helping them), and after a few months of sleeping on this, it's pretty much gone. I'm a heavy dude (last weight was something like 260), and this supports me and doesn't flatten out. It's comfy as hell, and honestly worth every penny.<br/><br/>They give you a 100 day/3 month sleep try out period, where if it doesn't work out for you, you can get a refund. (They might not still offer this, I don't honestly know) I kept track of it, and after the first week my back wasn't hurting as much, and even now, about 6 months later, it's only seemed to settle down a bit.<br/><br/>It's really a terrific mattress. Can't recommend it enough.
 We've had this mattress for over a year and we still love it! This mattress was especially comfortable throughout my entire pregnancy. I recommend it to everyone I talk to.
 All of the other reviews made it sound like it would be decently firm, which is what I was looking for! but it turned out to be softer than the other bed I had just bought that was too soft. maybe shopping for a mattress online isn't for me. the quality and delivery are great tho! it took a matter of days to get it outside my door and if youre into soft mattresses, go for this one!
 Love my bed!! I've had it for at least a year now and it's still as good as the beginning. Extremely comfortable and I don't wake up sore like I used to with my old bed. I got a full size and it is the perfect length. I'm 5'7" sooo happy with my purchase and way cheaper than the bed I originally was going to buy.
 We struggled through the first week but now, we love it. Stick it out. You'll be fine!
 takes some getting use to compared to a traditional mattress.......but i like it
 This mattress is awesome! Had it for almost a year now and no complaints. I put a mattress protector cover on it right away so the foam has stayed clean &amp;intact. I will say that it is HEAVY once it is unboxed and full sized - I used ratchet straps to cinch it down and fold it in half when I moved to a new place.
 The best mattress EVER! It is on the firm side but I love it. I bought a mattress topper from elux, which I highly recommend if you like a soft bed. It was the best $600 I ever spent! I can't believe I can actually wake up rested and refreshed every day! Buy this, you will not be disappointed!
 Great replacement mattress!!  Got it at a great price!!  Very comfortable,  we sleep much better now.  Very quick shipping!!
 I loved everything about this experience with Tuft &amp; Needle! The simplicity of their product, how quickly I could receive it, the reasonableness of the pricing, the friendly customer service and Amazon as well when I needed to call. I shopped on both Amazon and tuftandneedle.com - same pricing, etc. so I went with Amazon Prime and the mattress arrived in two days! It's a big box but not overwhelming considering there was a queen mattress inside! It expands quickly, no smells, is clean and ready to go (instructions say it will fully expand within a few hours). With a 30-day guarantee, we slept on it for several weeks. It was firmer than we are used to, so I added a mattress topper, which satisfied me. Unfortunately my husband continued to have back problems (one reason for buying a new mattress) and we decided to return it. In dealing with both Amazon and Tuft &amp; Needle, everyone was friendly, accommodating and gladly assisted me. Customer service is king and both companies proved it. The mattress just didn't work out for us but I would enthusiastically recommend it to others based on our customer service experience.
 I really wanted to like the convenience of purchasing a bed online, and having it come in a matter of days. However, it did not meet my expectations.<br/><br/>The bed wasn’t true to size, and didn’t fit our queen size box spring. It hangs over 4-5 inches. The bed is also very firm, causing discomfort and restless sleep.<br/><br/>The other inconvience that comes along with buying from amazon is we live in a townhouse with limited space, getting rid of the box was a must shortly after opening. Now I have to find a way to return the bed with no box or ability to compress the item in a similar size box to ship back.
 It's comfortable, but it doesn't keep you cool.
 Got the mattress for a twin bed.  Very comfortable and far superior to what I was using.  Have used the mattress for about two months and no complaints.  It was easy to set up and the terms of the guarantee were more than fair.<br/><br/>Very pleased.
 40% of my life is sleep. Needed comfort. Got it finally with this mattress. Thank you to the founders!!
 One month in and we're in love! It's soft yet supportive and we are excited to go to bed every night.
 Bought this to fit up a tight stairway, but it’s more comfortable than my old mattress. Very happy with this purchase.
 Best bed I've ever owned. Very comfortable for both my husband and I.
 This bed is simply amazing. We’ve had it a little over 2 months. The mattress was a firm to sleep on (for me) so I notified their customer service and they sent me a topper for free! I cannot tell you how incredibly comfortable this bed is! If you’re on the fence as to whether or not to buy, do it. You won’t be disappointed!
 We tried a Leesa before this one. It was just too soft, even for me. The Tuft and Needle is perfect. Bye bye back and shoulder pain! Oh the joy of waking up rested and full of energy!<br/><br/>The Tuft and Needle mattress has changed my life, literally. Buy it. You don't need a more expensive mattress, trust me.
 Very soft. It does retain heat a little so might not be the best for some but otherwise very good.
 Mattress arrived 7 days after order and was easy to unpack. Offgassing was not bad at all. I let it sit undistrubed for 8 hours and then slept on it the first night.<br/><br/>I slept 2 hours less than usual and had good energy the next day. Also did not feel my normal body aches. Already looking good and not even broken in!<br/><br/>One week later used to mattress now sleeping long restful nights. However, now that I am used to foam instead of spring; I am finding it to be too firm. I wanted to get rid of my mattress pad but I had to put it on this mattress. Now I think it is just right. I will need a few more nights to decipher however.<br/><br/>Will update review after another week.<br/><br/>6’ Male. 165lbs. Side sleeper.<br/><br/>Edit - 8 months later.<br/>After about 5 months this mattress became very painful. I have not slept very well because of this. I was given a mattress topper by tuft and needle and that was not enough to save it.<br/>I have lower back pain every morning and feel beat up.<br/>I bought originally for the price, which has made me consider other purchases in my life. I have purchased a “real” mattress and will be sleeping on that very soon, and I can’t wait!<br/>Thanks for attempting to be a good deal T&amp;N, but I can’t risk sleep quality for that.<br/><br/>P.S their sheets are very nice.
 It's somewhat firm if you are a side sleeper but comfortable.
 Ok, read the reviews, saw the rating that had it "graded" as a ~6.5, in terms of hardness.  That seemed like it would be pretty soft, if with enough structure to keep my back straight.  If this scale has this mattress at 6.5, then what about 10?  10 is f'ing diamond, the hardest substance known to man.  You will not believe how "firm" this foam mattress is.  Especially since it comes vacuum sealed in a bag about 1/5 the size of the actual mattress.  The idea of "memory foam mattress" should convey a bed of soft, furry kitty cats, not a concrete platform with a blanket over the top--for cushion.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do like a firm mattress.  This one is just too much of a good thing.  I am a side sleeper and my shoulders are sore, and my hands are numb when I get up in the morning.  Like I have been sleeping on the floor.  (I've had to do that a time or two in my life...I know what it's like).  So, off to Target where I got a 2" topper...SOOOO much better!  So, if the mattress is so bad, why the 3 stars?  In the end, I like the mattress, just wish it came with another 2" of soft memory foam...
 This bed was the best decision. Economical, practical, easily moved into the bedroom and put onto the bed frame. We bought a pillow top mattress pad for this bad boy and we don't even need it. We're so glad we went with Tuft &amp; Needle for our first ever king sized mattress for our family of three.
 Great Mattress! I was very hesitant to purchase this mattress due to the low price point - however, it's one of the best purchased I've ever made! Highly recommend this mattress. Had it for about 6 months and never slept better. It did have a "new" smell, but it quickly went away after a couple of days.
 I just got this mattress out of the box, and I already love it! Though it was rolled up super tight in shrink wrap and stuffed into a box, it took it's proper shape within a few minutes. The mattress is nice and firm, but still has a bit of bounce to it, and there's no chemical odor - in fact, the mattress smells kind of good for being straight out of the package! Can't wait to sleep on it tonight.
 Excellent mattress so far.  It's very firm to the point it was uncomfortable.  We bought a 3" memory foam topper and it is now the most comfortable mattress we've ever slept on.  The firmness of the mattress underneath coupled with the softer top later of an add on topper is a dream.
 A great bed that is nice and firm but also lets you sleep comfortably in any position. It came in a simple rectangle box, we opened it up and took it out of its plastic bag. After two days of letting it breathe it was ready to sleep on.
 Inexpensive, convenient delivery, and a great sleep. What’s not to like? Oh, and easy to recycle or dispose of unlike regular spring mattresses.
 My adult sized son has slept on this for a few months now and still LOVES it. Says it is super comfy. He is not waking up stiff like he was with his old mattress.
 This mattress is like a firm marshmallow that gives my body a hug!
 Sleeps cool. Easy to pen and set up.<br/>Although, The mattress cover was visibly dirty on one side.
 Once unpacked you have to let air out some 12hrs or more. The smell isn't to bad though. I kept reading on how the cover was so thin, but it really isn't. Glad I made the purchase.
 Brief review:<br/><br/>Love it. Comfortable, no sagging, holds shape well. Lightweight in comparison to other foam mattresses. Affordable!<br/><br/>It's actually pretty firm so it suits my taller/heavier partner more so than myself, but we both sleep well regardless.
 Extremely comfortable bed and a staple in the bedroom. Have definitely gotten quality sleep.<br/><br/>I sleep in just about every position and it works very well for me. Great warranty and return policy for those on the edge.
 Was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said "too hard" and some said "too soft." Well my review is just right. My husband (220lbs) and I (135lbs) love this bed.
 We have had this mattress for 3 months now and it was the best investment I have ever had. No divots and my husband is 300lbs and I am 280. It is firm but soft like a marshmallow. Sleep like a baby.
 I bought my first Tuft &amp; Needle mattress four years ago and recently upgraded to a bigger size. Love both of them, and the old one went on to a now sleeping-much-better friend. Arrived quickly, easy to put together along with their bed frame and box spring (though the latter isn’t necessary if you’ve got the right frame).
 Best DAMN mattress I've bought. I'm so proud of my husband and I for going out of our norm and buying it because it was worth it. Only gripe would be on our end for not getting a bigger size but we already have decided to pass this one on to our kids soon and us getting the same thing but only bigger.
 It's comfy and a little firm when properly supported. I had some problems with the size but amazon immediately sent me a new one! It's good for bouncy activities as well.
 The whole ordering process was really easy. Mattress arrived quickly and we had it setup and ready to sleep on the same day. No airing out like other brands. We had the mattress for a little over a month - it was super comfortable and I really wanted to love it, but it's just not firm enough for me. I woke up every morning with pretty terrible back pain. Had to return - trying a different brand that should be firmer.
 For the cost, i doubt there is a better mattress in the market. Its on firm side for a foam mattress, yet very supportive.<br/>Stay decently cool. Tuft and needle has a 100 night return policy that gave me a piece of mind but i never had to use it as the mattress worked perfectly for me.
 Have it in our 2nd bedroom &amp; has received rave reviews from our guests.
 Now I know why everyone raves about this mattress. It is the best sleep I’ve ever had. Just the right firmness. Great value. Get one!!
 Very comfortable mattress, does not give us any back issues. Comes with a cover and it is very soft and smooth. It can be one notch firmer in our opinion, however, I understand that everyone has his/her own preference when it comes to firmness. Very good deal for its quality. Buy it!
 I have had it for about 60 days now. I feel the side I sit on to get dressed in the morning is softening up. I still toss and turn at night, but I can not say it is due to this mattress. I just know that I still do it.
 The mattress was more firm than I expected but that was perfect for me. I like a firm mattress. But it was described as medium and my wife likes a softer mattress. I’m 6’ 240 lbs. she’s 5’2 130 lbs . Both side sleepers
 Very comfortable mattress, however, it’s on the harder side. The price is really great for the quality!
 You are not going to find a better mattress than this.  I waited a few months to post my review and I love this mattress.  My husband and I have completely different tastes in mattress firmness and this mattress is perfect for both of us.  My back hurts to sleep on anything else.  Can't beat the price either!!!
 Mattress does not provide support. It is hard. My back pain is worse than when I was sleeping on a 16-year-old pillow top.
 OMG, spent weeks reading, reviewing and searching for a mattress that my 7 mos pregnant wife and I could get a full nights rest. Eureka ! We found it. Affordable, and as good as mattresses twice the price. Love it.
 Very comfortable.  Its not as firm as my old Sealy (heh, even after 20 years), but it is firm enough for me. My old Sealy is as firm as you can get a mattress, and I love it.  However, I needed another mattress for a 2nd home in the mountains, and I was ready to try something new and different.  Thanks to all the great reviews, Tuft &amp; Needle won.  And as I was saying, it isn't as firm, but for me, it works great.  You do sink, but the support and comfort is there.  I am a big guy (nowadays), and it supports me fine.  Slept like a baby.  I also didn't think it slept hot.  Like some, I don't like sleeping hot, in fact, can't sleep when it is like that.  I thought this was fine.  Granted, I am not in a hot climate, would it be different then?  Maybe, but my own body heat didn't have any ill effects either.  Now, I know some people are like furnaces (I don't know why), but I'm not, and it worked for me.  Finally I liked the price, and shipment was good too.  I was able to fit the boxed mattress in my SUV without a problem, and deliver it to my other place easy.  As of now it is sitting on a Zinus frame comfortably.  Great purchase.
 Very comfortable. I sleep like the dead. There is a rather strong smell, but that went away after 2 days.
 Very comfortable and I was amazed with how quickly it was ready to use once opened. It was literally ready within seconds!! Talk about easy setup. My picky fiancé was even impressed #winning
 You need this. After a hx of discount mattresses &amp; off brands I decided to spend the extra for this baby. So happy I did.
 It took a night or 2 to get used to the feel of it, and now I love it. My back issues have been much better.
 I've been sleeping on the mattress for about a month now and I am extremely happy with it.  It is easy to get in and out of and is very comfortable. I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone that is looking for an alternatives to these overpriced mattresses that are on the market.
 I was worried about buying a bed online.... This bed came and it was pretty awesome. It is definitely on the firm side, a lot firmer than my brothers Temperpedic, but also only 10% of the cost. This bed works well on my adjustable bed. I was sleeping on a futon for almost a year now and it was killing me. This bed gives me a good nights sleep. If you are really sensitive it might be too hard but I sink in and I am a heavy guy about 235 lbs so this bed was perfect and supportive. The smell went away after about 2 weeks, I just left it on the frame 2 days and then put sheets on it. I could still smell it the first two weeks it is now gone.
 My touchy back isn't thrilled but husband loves it.
 Amazing and better than I expected.. I've woken up feeling better with less aches and pains and more refreshed than I have in a very long time.. Thank you for making me feel better
 Best sleep in a long time. I have not experienced any sagging or indentations. I've been using the mattress for about 3 months and it's been a dream. Easy shipment, no odors, and great sleep!
 Great mattress. We love our king but my mom felt the twin xl was A little on the softer side. Customer service was great in regards to returning as per their satisfaction guarantee
 Got this for our tall 11 year old. She loves it and says its super comfortable!
 Love, love, love this mattress! For the money this is it!!<br/>The last two nights, I have had the best sleep in years!!!<br/>For me this whole process was easy! Ordering, shipping was<br/>right-on, easy setup, and let the great sleep begin!<br/>Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle!
 I'm a customer for life with tuft and needle. Their products are incomparable.
 This is such an amazing mattress.  We enjoyed it so much, we bought a second one.
 If I do remember correctly, this company use to have much lower prices on their mattresses.  I have been using this mattress of the past 3 months now and love it.  Disclaimer: I am a back sleeper.  My back feels great on this mattress and I sleep well.  What more can you ask for?
 Firstly Amazon Customer service is awesome.. Kudos to them.<br/><br/>As far as the mattress goes  Folks should be aware  THIS IS NOT A FIRM mattress.. Contrary to the myriad of reviews.. the product seems to have been updated.. It is very very soft.  My comparison for what a FIRM mattress are<br/>1) Sterns &amp; Foster Firm mattress<br/>2) Dreamton Cotton Firm Mattress<br/>3) Ikea Firm foam mattress.<br/><br/>I have owned all three of them and can say they were very firm and supportive. The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is definitely not anywhere near firm as any of these .  It is very soft, kind of like sleeping on a pillow. I tried it for 1 full week with the hopes that things will get better, but no. There was just no support to the lower torso.  My back start hurting pretty soon.<br/><br/>Of course my wife and kids who are much lighter.. really liked the softness of the mattress.. So if you dont mind a soft mattress then definitely give it a shot (the foam feels very high quality and less smelly than other options) , but if you are looking for a firm mattress, i will not recommend this version (unless the manufacturer adds a specific FIRM version).<br/><br/>Given there is no store to go sit on a mattress to test the firmness, my recommendation for Tuft &amp; Needle is they should have an option to ship a small block of the FOAM for people to understand and compare how firm their mattress really is.
 Happy with it, good night's sleep
 Very comfortable.<br/>Much better than my last foam mattress
 Works great. Glad we had it on the bed when the grandkids slept here. . It saved the matress and is easy to wash, easy to remove and put back on.
 I've been in the market for a king sized mattress to upgrade my bedroom. I came across tuft and needles and decided to take a leap of faith.<br/><br/>Took two seconds for the mattress to unforl and it took me additional five seconds to fall asleep while trying it on. Overall, this is one of the best investments. I know that it may be too soon to write a review, but I can already tell that this mattress is a game changer.
 So far after a month, I'm very happy with this mattress. First time with this style so I'm hoping the future holds true.
 Baby bear would love this bed. Not too soft and not too hard. Doesnt hold too much more heat than your standard bed. Will update if this changes. Had it for 2 months now.
 Love the mattress. And we have a temperpedic that we hated for a year. This is temperpedic already broken in - and no sinking if you stay in one spot too long.<br/>Wish there was a better way to open. I was terrified I was going to stab the mattress with scissors while unwrapping.
 Unpacked perfectly,  inflated instantly,  sleeps very well. Im satisfied with this mattress.
 We’ve had this mattress over a month &amp; I have to say, I’m so impressed. I was skeptical buying online, but I have to say this is one of the best beds I’ve slept on. We let it sit out of the box for 18-24 hours so it could properly form up. Mild odor at first, but not bad. We loved it so much, we got the T &amp; N pillows to match (also wonderful).
 bough this on the recommendation of my daughter - very comfortable - easy to set up by myself
 not comfortable wish i could return it
 Happened upon Tuft &amp; Needle quite by accident and read all the reviews.  The only complaint some people had was that they really wanted a soft mattress and this T&amp;N was too firm for them.  So I thought it was exactly what I needed.  Firm support, soft top and not sweaty.  I live in Hawaii and it really is important to have a mattress that breathes otherwise you feel like you are in a sauna.  It arrived promptly, I unwrapped it per directions and voila, instant mattress.  I thought my back was getting worse because of my age, and guess what?  It was because of lack of support while sleeping.  I sleep well and my back does not hurt now.  A VERY worthwhile investment for me.  Needless to say, I am more than pleased.
 Came out of the box easily .immediately "came into shape".  Fits platform perfectly.  I hope my guests will like it!
 This mattress is like nothing I have ever purchased.  I heard about it on Dennis Prager radio show initially. When it was time to purchase a new bed, I read the reviews and the website about the bed. I will never buy any other mattress other than a Tuft and Needle !
 I like the easy set up and it looks wonderful on my platform bed frame. However if you prefer a more firm mattress, I'd look elsewhere.
 I was nervous about buying a mattress without trying it BUT it's great. Both my wife and I sleep well. She's got a bad back but that's been no problem.<br/><br/>Setup was easy, too...Unroll it and remove the package. Within a short time, the mattress is "good to go."<br/><br/>My only concern was that it didn't look wide enough when we rolled it out...but the package said "Queen Size" and it expanded in two directions.<br/><br/>I would recommend Tuft &amp; Needle to anyone! (Thank you!)
 I never slept better. While there's great satisfaction in watching the rolled up mattress pop out and expand, the real treat is a good night's rest on this baby. I've been known to toss and turn in my sleep, but I actually woke up feeling good!<br/><br/>I'm a side sleeper so my arm sometimes goes dead in traditional spring mattresses, so I'm glad this bed can provide me enough support and comfort. I feel like Goldilocks here, the bed's firmness is just right! Hopefully this holds true in the upcoming months as well!
 The bed is very well made and definitely a quality mattress. My only complaint is that it is stiffer than I expected.
 We got one for our vacation house , because we did not want to spend a lot of money on a mattress we would hardly use . After sleeping on it , we were liked it so much , we ordered another one for house .
 After doing a fair amount of research and reading through the numerous positive reviews here, I decided to purchase my mattress back in June of 2016. It pains me to have to write a negative review, so I’ll start with what I do like because I’m a positive person, dang it.<br/><br/>The shipment was fast and well packaged.<br/><br/>Unrolling the mattress was a breeze and fun to watch! It puffed up to full size quickly.<br/><br/>There was only a slight chemical smell that completely faded within a couple weeks.<br/><br/>The mattress is firm so that if you sit on the edge you don’t sink down too much or slip off.  Because of the bed sinking in so little it almost seems as if the bed is more spacious than a traditional spring mattress.<br/><br/>There’s very little transfer of motion with this mattress so you won’t disrupt your partner.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that’s where the benefits end with my experience. I was really excited to get a new bed, especially after reading the overwhelmingly positive responses from other purchasers. From what I’ve seen, the company seems to be really interested in making sure the consumer is pleased which really appealed to me. I was also swayed by the fact that they have stores based in my state of Arizona.<br/><br/>That being said, this mattress is killing my body. I’m at the point that I have to take pain relief pills before I go to bed to stay asleep throughout the night and after I wake up to deal with the amount of discomfort I’m in. I bought this bed to replace my old spring mattress that was getting up there in years and was losing its firmness.  This was my first experience with a foam mattress and reading that it was firm appealed to me, but as a few displeased reviewers mentioned, it is firm to the point of being incredibly uncomfortable. I find it difficult to describe. You can press down on the mattress and it is soft to a point, but as you lay down your body’s weight is so evenly dispersed to where you don’t sink down at all so it is indeed like laying on the floor. It’s as if the mattress is pressing back against my body instead of gently cradling it.<br/><br/>Sitting on the bed is pleasant enough, I can type away on my laptop for hours without issue, and in fact I enjoy the support it offers as I sit. However as soon as I lay down to rest for the night I feel pressure in my neck, shoulders, and especially my lower back and hip. The first few nights I slept on my new mattress I didn’t feel especially strongly either way, but I wanted to wait it out. I read that it would take two weeks for the bed to reach its peak softness, and while I think it may have softened up a tiny bit (maybe?) I’m still in agony and wake up multiple times throughout the night.<br/><br/>For reference, I’m in my early thirties, female, 5’5” at 160lbs. and work out 4-5 times a week. As someone who prefers a firmer mattress, I cannot for the life of me gather why this bed hurts me so much. Is it just my body type? Could there be a manufacturer defect with the mattress that could somehow maker it firmer than intended? I’m unsure. The worse part about the discomfort that I experience from sleeping on this mattress is that it lingers with me throughout the day and is beginning to affect my daily life. I’m experiencing issues I’ve never had before, like hip pain that I feel all day just getting in and out of chairs or climbing into the car or simply walking about. It’s intense and extremely upsetting. My fiancé is also experiencing restless sleep and waking up sore, however not to the same degree of discomfort I am having. I attribute this to fact that he sleeps more on his stomach while I can only sleep on my back and side.<br/><br/>This if the first negative review I think I’ve ever written and I feel guilty considering how other people seem to really love their mattress. But the truth is I haven’t experienced a single good night sleep since it’s arrived. It takes me longer to fall asleep because the pain sets in within minutes of lying down, I wake up numerous times throughout the night to adjust my position and wake up before I need to because of the pain. The longer I sleep the worse it is. What good is a mattress if I can’t get a restful night’s sleep, instead suffering body aches and feeling tired throughout the day? Even as I sit here and type this review my back and hip are aching, despite waking up hours ago.<br/><br/>I wanted so much to love this mattress to the point that I tried to convince myself that it would work out, much to my detriment. I thought maybe my body needed to adjust to the difference but things have only gotten worse as time has progressed. I am in so much pain because of this bed. I’ve never suffered buyer’s remorse to this degree. I’m out over $500.00 and have no other bed to replace my current mattress while I try to sort this out. I’m kicking myself for trying to force myself to adjust to this bed instead of just contacting customer service right away. Knowing that my only option may be is to spend at least another $100+ for a mattress topper as a temporary solution for my situation is truly disappointing to say the least. Please don’t make the same mistake I have, if you’re uncomfortable be sure to contact Tuft and Needle right away, don’t wait it out and force yourself to suffer!
 Going from a traditional spring mattress to this is an adjustment, for sure. But it's great! I like my mattresses on the firm side and have had little success sleeping on foam mattresses before but this is just perfect. And you really can't deny that it's a great price. We've been sleeping on it for almost a month now and I couldn't be happier.
 We ordered this bed for my son's college apartment, because it needed to be portable and comfortable. It's fantastic-- popped open, smelled fine after 13 hours, and is really comfortable. We love the  Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation/Platform Bed  with it.
 My wife loves it, I think it is good but for my back issues I need something a little harder. All in all it is much better then the last one owned.
 A few days in and I sleep wonderful. Happy with price and purchase.
 we loved our California king size so much, but our daughter was begging to have one just like it, so we bought her a twin size mattress, she loves it!
 So after reading so many great reviews about this mattress, I decided to go ahead and order it. I was going to order directly from the company but remembered Discover had a promo for 5% back on Amazon purchases. Shipping was fast! The mattress came to my doorstep within a few days. Setup was easy... you basically just cut open the two layers of plastic that it is wrapped in and let the mattress expand. The mattress is on the firm side, which I kind of prefer, but it took about a week to get used to the mattress. After that, everything was awesome. I used to wake up with back pain with my old memory foam mattress, but that totally stopped after I started sleeping on the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. Very happy with this purchase!
 It took a while to get used to this matress, as it is much firmer than my old one. There has never been a problem with smell or overheating, and it was much easier to transport than a standard spring Queen mattress. Only time will tell wether it is a long-term good investment. Thanks for making an affordable product!
 My wife and I had been wanting to get a new mattress for a while and most of our immediate friends and family had made the move to a tempurpedic-based mattress. While I love the feel, I don't love the cost of tempurpedic.<br/><br/>I read about Tuft and Needle months ago, and it's been on my radar since then.<br/><br/>After coming into some unexpected money recently, I suggested to my wife that we order a Tuft and Needle mattress. About 2 minutes later, we had it ordered.<br/><br/>Delivery was quick with Prime and setup was fairly easy for the most part.<br/><br/>One thing that was difficult was during the unpacking of the mattress, I accidentally rolled it out upside down and the mattress began to "inflate." I am 6'5", 220 lbs, I lift weights, run, etc. I'm not a strongman, but I'm very capable of moving heavy things. Due to the fact that my bedroom is relatively small and this was the king size mattress, it was pretty challenging flipping it over without knocking things off my walls, hitting ceiling lights, etc. However, I was doing this by myself. If I had the help of someone else, it would have been pretty easy.<br/><br/>It's honestly a great mattress, especially for the price. It's comfortable and appears to be of high quality. I hope it holds up over time.
 No complaints. We got a great sale, it arrived quickly and set up easily. It’s on the firm side for a foam mattress, but works great for our 3 year old. No odor at all.
 We love this bed! After being on a conventional mattress for so long, I saw this on Twitter, read a lot of reviews, compared it to Casper and others. My wife and I are completely satisfied and have never had a better sleep. The bed is light, firm, and just a great deal.
 My husband and I are pretty picky when it comes to mattresses and this is hands down is the best mattress we have ever slept on! It feels soft yet firm at the same time. We prefer a more firm mattress and had trouble finding one until this one! I
 This is the best mattress I've ever owned. It's got a soft top but underneath, it is firm enough for me. Delivery came way before I thought it would, which was a pleasant surprise. Setup was extremely easy, except for the fact that it's pretty heavy. I will review again in a year to tell how well it has held up. As for now, I would highly recommend this mattress.
 This is a solid mattress for the price. I have had the mattress for over a year now and it has held its shape well and continues to provide support. It was easy to set up and is comfortable for sitting or lying on. The downsides are that the mattress is a little too firm for me (a good topper can account for this), and also that it off-gassed for about a month after purchasing. I would buy it again with a low budget!
 So far, so good. It's already changed in firmness, after only a week or so. It arrived with a weird grease stain, but we'd also bought the mattress cover.<br/><br/>I'm waiting to see how we feel in three months of sleeping on the mattress, but all in all, it was easy to get into the house, unpackaged and set up.
 We are very happy with this mattress.  It took a little getting use to.  I sleep on my sides and about rolled out of bed the first night because this mattress doesn't have side support springs like a typical mattress.  There was no smell at all when we unboxed the mattress either.  We will update as time progresses.  I'd buy again......
 This is amazing! If you are wondering if you will like it....you will 😉
 A few months in, and no complaints.
 Wow. I thought the reason why I was unable to sleep through the night (waking at about 3 am most mornings) was anxiety. Evidently it was my old mattress. Since getting this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress I have slept through the night, every night. The mattress has a great balance of firmness and cushioning and is quiet (my old mattress had an embarrassingly loud set of coils...). I love this mattress!!
 great bed! bed is more on the firm side which i wanted. price is great conpared to the competitors. will buy again when the time comes. cant go wrong wth this bed
 Gift for my sister.  First time she's been able to sleep in a bed in a few years.  She's very happy with it.<br/>Crazy impressed with the packaging too!!  WOW.  Who knew something so large could ship so small.  Beware, it's monstrously heavy to lift alone tho!
 I needed a bed for a second home.  The mattress and a platform bed were ordered and promptly delivered.  I was able to handle and assemble both quickly.  By myself.<br/><br/>It is a better sleep for me than any traditional box springs mattress.<br/><br/>I like the minimal appearance.<br/><br/>It does appear to offer more insulating properties than a traditional mattress.  Leaving me to turn down the thermostat at night for a cooler sleep.
 Probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned. Easy setup and ready to sleep on the first night. Highly recommend this.
 I had just bought another mattress for almost $2k in my other house. This mattress is amazingly good for the price. I could have bought three of these for the price of one standard "name brand" mattress.  It is shipped in a strange shrink wrapped form - an innovation. Pop it out. Voila, you have a fine mattress.
 It will smell for a few days, that's the nature of foam beds but the quality is good. I'm about a month in.
 I found it to be overly firm, but once I put a quilted topper with memory foam, I really like it.  Nicely packaged for shipping and produced in US.
 After reading other reviews I was really hesitant about ordering mattress because I thought it might be too firm. I was so pleasantly surprised. It is the most comfortable mattress I have ever had. Everything about ordering, shipping and receiving was the best service. Needless to say I love the product.
 Terrible horrible back support<br/>If u have back pain, stay away. It’s not firm at all, I don’t understand, most “complaints” was that it was too firm. I almost thought they made a mistake. But no, this is their mattress for real.<br/>I sink all the way down the moment I sit on it. Not buying again, and will not recommend for people w back pain like me
 I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it.  He says he doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning.
 Not too soft and not too firm. Have had it for almost a year now and hasn't shown signs of sagging
 This bed is....AMAZING!!! I would give it a hundred stars if I could. I have severe back and neck issues and it's so nice to wake up in the morning and not be in extreme pain. It is so comfortable, I will always recommend Tuft &amp; Needle to anyone.
 Great packaging and easy to open and install.  So far, a very comfortable mattress.
 Love it. My ex and i broke up which is why i needed a new mattress. After one night of sleeping on it, i woke up refreshed and my back was not hurting from sleeping on a hard mattress. I love it a lot and would recommend it. Only problem i am having is that my dog loves it too and refuses to get off of it.
 I was really nervous when I bought this, but i needed a new mattress that would be easy to move into a NYC apartment. It's been holding up great, I've been so impressed. It is firm and comfortable to sleep on, a little soft on the edges, but other than that it's really good and you can't beat the price.
 I love this bed! Slept on one at a BnB and HAD to take the sheets off to see what it was. Ordered it immediately for our guest room and now swapped the one in our room too. Ten times more comfortable than our Stearns &amp; Foster that cost 3x as much. Beat sleep ever!
 i love this mattress! the first night i had it, I slept over 12 hours. I haven't been able to get very much sleep in a long time, so that was great!
 Have had it for 9 months now and it is still as comfortable as when we first got it. There was not too strong of an odor opening it
 Saved my husband's back, the best bed we could have hoped for. Perfect balance of soft and firm. We will never go to a mattress store again. Only getting Tuft and Needles from this day forward.
 OMG!  So gentle a night's sleep for my arthritic joints.  I highly recommend this mattress.  I used to wake up several times a night aching and needing to reposition myself, often being too sore to resume sleeping. Now I barely know when I'm turning over.
 I love how this came easily in a box! It felt a little too firm for me so I added a 1 inch memory foam on top and now this is the best bed I've ever had! My back, shoulders, and hips rearly are hurting now when I wake up! Compared to hurting every morning with my last mattress:) I'd recommend this mattress but definitely with a small memory foam on top.
 This bed is truly in a class of its own - superb comfort &amp; comes with a 100-day trial money-back guarantee.
 While you may need a day or two to adjust to a new bed, and I imagine that's true for any new mattress, I can say a month later that I am loving my T&amp;N mattress. Best ever! It is supportive, but soft and comfortable. Really wonderful. I'm very glad I made this purchase.
 This mattress was comfortable from the first night; and it works perfectly with my adjustable bed. Love it!
 I was accustomed to a waterbed and an air bed. I was concerned about going to a foam mattress because of comfort and heat. This is a wonderful and comfortable mattress. It feels very similar to an air bed; and thankfully I stay cool. I would highly recommend this mattress.
 Noticeably good sleeping mattress.  Easy to buy and have shipped to home. Easy to set up. Less expensive. A good idea who's time has come. Just bought a second mattress.
 Best best mattress I have ever slept one, I wish every hotel would order these!
 This mattress is unbelievably comfortable and so easy to set up and move around. My back pain has improved significantly since sleeping on this mattress. We absolutely love it.
 I found the mattress very comfortable. I have a hospital type bed and it works very well. Was getting up 6 times a night. now only once or twice a night. No more back aches. Great Mattress at an affordable price.
 If you need a firm mattress, this is a great option at a good price. About 2 months+ in, holding up perfectly, getting great sleep.
 We’ve been sleeping on this bed since August of 2017.  My wife and I both love it.  No more back/neck pain.  Sleeps cool. It has been holding up well no indentations etc.  We like it so much we are getting our sons one and putting one in our guest room.<br/><br/>Cannot say enough good things about it.
 Wanted to give it a couple months before writing my review. Cooler than other foam mattresses we've had, but a bit too firm!  I often wake up with low back pain.
 It was way above my expectations. There is an adjustment period of about a week or two, but once you get through that, the mattress is very comfortable.
 I had to buy a topper, as it was too firm for me.  I love it with the topper.  The best thing about this mattress is the stability.  When my husband moves, I don't feel a thing.
 HOLY crap, were has this mattress been for the last 5 years.  I would give it 10 stars if I could
 Just purchased the T&amp; N king size mattress, I was first impressed with a king size mattress  being packed inside a medium  size box,<br/>cut open the box unwrap the plastic wrap and the mattress puffs up into a full size mattress, the mattress itself is really amazing, you just<br/>mold into it, im a side sleeper and it just forms to your hips and legs,no more back pain in the morning after a great night sleep<br/>I would definitely purchase this mattress again, delivery was on time and no damage at all
 This tufts and needle queen mattress is advertised as 10" thick. The one we received expanded to 4.5" after leaving open to expand for over 72 hours.
 We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  It was very easy to unpack and set up.  The mattress fits snugly in her wood platform daybed.  Her twin size fitted sheet is almost too small so I would suggest deep pocket fitted sheets.
 This mattress is so comfortable and buying it was so easy. BUT, the first one we purchased had a chemical odor that after 4 days was still too strong for us to sleep on it. We are not particularly sensitive to chemical smells in general. Tuft and Needle was very helpful and said this was not normal and likely a manufacturing defect (the mattress foam wasn't cured long enough). As I purchased through Amazon, return was handled by them instead of the company. Amazon was great in handling the return--once I spoke with the "large item" team since repackaging the mattress was not possible (used the help chat for the first time and worked well). I received the second mattress in two days. It has a slight odor but after one day it was already better than the first mattress. Expect it to fully dissipate. So now that I have a non-stinky version, I LOVE the mattress and would give 5 stars except for the smell problem. Very comfortable. Easy to unpack. As long as it turns out to be durable, I will never buy a mattress in a store again.
 Overall, great mattress. Super comfortable, doesn't squeak or poke you with any springs, and I never have problems waking up after a restful night's sleep. Downside: have you every tried pulling a solid block of foam up some stair while moving WITHOUT HANDLES?! Probably the most frustration I've ever had moving a mattress. Or anything, for that matter. Pretty massive oversight there, guys. Might want to think about that for future production. Otherwise, well done.
 Love this mattress. Not too soft, not too firm, just right for me.  Decompressed in like a day or so, and retained full rectangular shape. A very wise purchase on my part!
 Really like this product.  It is firm but not too firm.  It is not hot in the summer.  It has been working out great.
 I read all the reviews and was excited about this bed. I was also interested on the return process if I did not like the bed. The mattress arrived quickly and was easy to set up. We spent about 14 nights on it before we decided to send it back. My husband reported no sleep in those 2 weeks and on numerous occasions I woke up with numbness in my hands and fingers. This bed was just to firm for us.<br/>The return process was easyreturn process was easy. since I purchase it through Amazon Prime I submitted a request for return and they were at my door the next day to pick it up all I needed to do was put it back in a box. luckily we had a box big enough because I don't know how else to get a king size mattress in the mail!
 Bought queen size. Wife &amp; I slept great. We knew we didn't want memory foam. New tech; very nice. No foam smell either, no smell at all. Love it.
 I was delighted with the delivery of my "mattress in a box."<br/>The firm mattress is ideal for me.
 This mattress is amazing. I've never had a particularly comfortable mattress before but I have slept on my friend's Casper. She warned me that a Tuft and Needle would be too firm for someone as light as me, as she requested an extra layer of memory foam for her Casper. I have to say the Tuft and Needle is definitely soft enough but doesn't feel like I am sinking. During my first night I only opened my eyes once in the middle of the night which is impressive as I am a light sleeper. Aesthetically I also love the look of the Tuft and Needle. So far it's perfect for me!
 I'm a side sleeper and I am very happy with this mattress.
 It's only been about a month now, but my husband and I love this bed! Totally recommend to others. I have faith it stands the test of time. But we will see. Thank you for your commitment to your customers, and the community Tuft And Needle. &amp; thank you Amazon for your quickness in delivering the mattess.
 Love it.  It is great for laying  down not so much for sitting on.
 I really wanted to love this mattress. The first few weeks it was soft and heavenly, and maybe that is because I replaced a firmer mattress with it. I fall asleep on my back but usually end up on my side. Over the last month I've been waking up stiff and have pain in my shoulders and hips. So unfortunately going to have to return this one and try a traditional bed. I need something that is more forgiving on my wide shoulders but still supportive under my stomach hips when I side sleep. I really wanted to love this mattress.<br/>On the plus side, easy set up. Hoping return is just as easy.
 Brought this for my daughter for a Christmas present but she was in Japan for the semester when I brought it so I had to wait til she got home for her to try it out to give me a rating. She seems to love it and I’m Thankful.
 My wife LOVES this comfy mattress and so do I.  It does not disappoint.
 What an awesome mattress! Replaced our old, lumpy mattress with this--sleeping better than I have in years! No odors, no lumps, nothing to detract from this great mattress. We put it on a new platform bed, and it's just wonderful.
 This is the most amazing mattress. I absolutely love it. Specially after my surgeries
 Excellent comfy mattress. better than the original I had on  my adjustable bed. Not hot, firm yet soft feel.
 This mattress is comfortable and so easy to set up. Packaged so it was easier to handle (had to move it upstairs) and was ready to go in a couple hours. I felt it was worth the price especially since it's made in the USA. Hard to find that anymore.
 We have had it months now. Best mattress we have ever owned. No more $2000.00 mattresses for us. Only T&amp;N
 It was so easy to unpack and unwrap. then it just swelled up!<br/>It is a very comfortable mattress!
 Great product, my grandson has two and he recommend me to try it. Price was right and I'm so glad I did. Sleep like a baby.
 This is one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on. I like it more than the sleep number bed. It has just the right amount of firmness.
 Wish I had a head board and queen bed frame to match! How can I get one tomorrow?
 Amazing bed, have not had a sleepless night on it. Roomy, doesn't bounce around when my dog gets on/off bed which is great. I do not regret this purchase at all, I cannot advocate for it enough.
 I'm pregnant 🤰 and I was having a lot of problems sleeping well,and since I got this,it's been so wonderful,no problems at all sleeping.<br/>Thanks,it is a quality product,I would recommended it 100%
 Why there is no box outside the mattress and no any manual or certificate attached? The mattress was just wrapped with dirty films... big dispointment compared to what described in the ads movie. I need an explaining for this.
 Seemed like a good compromise between too soft &amp; too hard; however, ended up putting a 4" memory foam topper on it for better sleep.
 Wow! I was worried to buy a mattress without ever sitting on it. BUT this has lived up to our expectations! So comfortable and so far holding up nicely. No craters yet like all of our other expensive mattresses. We are thrilled with our purchase!
 I was so nervous picking this bed. I watched the company video, i like what they had to say,I liked American made and I loved the trial period. I could rave, but bottom line is try it.. you will be glad you did.
 Had it for about a year now and it is still lasted longer than my $2500 mattress and more comfortable.
 This is used in a guest room but I did try it out myself and it is very comfortable. I am happy with my purchase and the price seems fair.
 Best mattress ever. My husband and I absolutely love it. We have never slept so well till now. We love it so much that we ordered the king pillows to go with it. Will be ordering our kids each one soon.
 A god send. My boyfriend loves my bed more than his own and vows to get a queen when we move in together. Thanks T&amp;N.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I have slept on. Not too soft and not too hard.
 Great product so far. Helped my upper back pain and I'm sleeping better than I have in years.  Customer Service for Tuft &amp; Needles is great.  I had an issue and they resolved it quickly and beyond my expectation.
 Very comfortable. Have one on the floor for my toddler and one on a metal frame in our guest room. We get lots of compliments.
 My queen sized mattress came 5 days after I ordered it on Amazon. It took less that 15 minutes to set it up on top of my box spring. I am very happy with my purchase after doing A LOT of research on this mattress. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about all of the five star reviews, but they were right on. I have slept on my mattress for the past two nights and it feels amazing- not too soft, not too firm. I have issues with back and hip pain when sleeping on conventional mattresses, so I was pleased that this mattress was all that I had hoped for. I can even sleep on my stomach again, which is something I haven't been comfortable doing with my previous mattress. I'll try to come back and write a follow up review in a couple of months. So far though, I'm a happy Tuft and Needle customer!<br/>Update: I've been sleeping on this mattress fora month now and I still love it! And no hip or back pain like I was having on my previous pillow top mattress.<br/>Another update: It's been two years now and I still am so happy with this mattress! It's the best mattress that I've ever owned. So glad I read the reviews on this item before I bought it. They were right- it's wonderful!
 The bed is really comfortable, but since it's memory foam it causes my body to overheat at night after about 4 hours. For the remaining 4 hours I end up having a restless night of sleep. I've been using it for a week and will try it for another week, but I believe that I'll probably have to return this mattress.
 The mattress is definitely worth it. After 2 nights my shoulder and neck pain have greatly diminished. We love this mattress.
 The most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on! I will never buy a mattress from a store again. I have noticed improvement with my lower back pain and my sleep is better than ever! Would buy again!
 I have been very pleased with this mattress since receiving it.  It took some getting used to but I wouldn’t ever go back.  I like my mattress firm and my spouse enjoys the mattress soft.  This is the perfect middle ground for us.  Plus is we can’t feel each other move at night.  Runs a little warm but we like to be warmer
 Got it for my daughters’ birthday. It was so easy to unbox and expand. Quite fun. Very soft mattress. Might get one for myself...
 Finally an HONEST company that doesn't play the mattress game. This is a great mattress, rated GREAT in Consumer Reports at a GREAT price! I'd call it a medium. Just between firm and soft. I also bought a 3 inch mattress topper and the combo is great!
 Wife and I love this mattress. Surprise with comfort and quality for a reasonable price.
 Amazon was amazing in helping me to answer all my concerns &amp; questions. I absolutely love my mattress!!! Best money spent which wasn't a lot. 😊
 This arrived in no time and was so convenient I can’t overstate how easy it was. There were no issues at all and it is a great, comfy mattress. Exactly what I was looking for.
 Love it. But I added a topper to make slightly softer
 Best mattress I've used yet. Firm and comfortable. I have not had any body aches from sleeping. Product description is very accurate. Mattress is cool and does not contain heat like a standard memory foam mattress. No need for a $1,000 - $3,000 mattress.
 This is just enough softer than a Casper that my wife, who likes a softer sleep LOVES it.
 WOW! I had no idea how comfortable a mattress could actually be until I slept on the Tuft &amp; Needle. I think my body is confused by this level of comfort. Even the dog has experienced a better quality sleep! It is a perfect combination of soft and firm; we slept on it a couple hours after opening with no issues at all. Our old bed became the guest bed, and the difference between the two is astounding. I feel a little sorry for my future guests..
 value is gooder than the last mattress I buyed.
 It's looks good definitely stays in shape and remains cool but it's very rigid for me and wife. We have had this mattress for a week now and we are waking up with back pains and had to switch back to our beauty rest. I was so amazed by the reviews thought it will be for me. Not sure what to do with it now.
 Firm and soft.<br/>Doesn't bounce to wake other sleeper
 Comfortable and right firmness.
 after several months, I still love it. Never thought I would buy a foam mattress
 After moving across the country we decided we'd splurge a bit and buy a new mattress. We did our research and ultimately picked Tuft &amp; Needle's product over Casper's due to the slightly lower price and comparable reviews and performance. I've been disappointed since the day it arrived.<br/><br/>We've tried to give it a chance and adjust to sleeping on a new bed. We put it on a sturdy bed frame and we bought nice new pillows. But almost six weeks into it and I still haven't slept through the night or woken up without neck and back pain and I'm tired of it. All the talk about this being a universally comfortable mattress is simply not true - if you like a firm mattress, maybe give it a try; if not, I'd steer clear.<br/><br/>The worst part? Beware that Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses sold through Amazon only have a 30 day return policy - as opposed to the 90 day return policy offered through the website. I don't think that's standing by your product, Tuft &amp; Needle.
 Bed gets REALLY hot. Seems to pack in heat if you stay in one spot for more than a few minutes.
 This mattress is WONDERFUL!!!!  I've been sleeping on it for about 3 weeks now and have no complaints whatsoever.  I have been sleeping better through the night than on my old Serta.  Additionally, I used to wake up with an achy back, not so with the T&amp;N.  I would highly recommend!
 Great bed at a great price. My wife and I were in the process of moving and we were looking for a new mattress. We have some friends suggest we look at a Tuft and Needle Mattress. It took a few weeks getting used to the style of mattress. I am a big guy and have had a hard time finding a mattress that I really like. This mattress has held up very well to my size 6'2" and 325 lbs.
 Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, as some of the reviews said, you do get hot.  I don't even need to  use my electric blanket.  I love it right now but what's it going to be like in the summer?  VERY comfortable though and I get a great night's sleep.
 Bought queen size from Amazon, very good service/packaging and product - amazing how it ‘inflates’ after a day or so. Very comfortable.
 We have about 2 months on ours. So far so good, no problems.  It sleeps well and is quite comfortable.  We are 100% happy with our purchase.
 The best bed ever. I am serious back problems and I was worried it was going to be too firm. I added a 1 1/2 memory foam topper to it and loved the results. Highly recommended.
 Simply put, all that Tuft &amp; Needle promise is true. It is comfortably supportive but surprisingly firm. It is easy to setup and magically astounding to watch as it becomes a mattress. It does seem to circulate air around you as you sleep. It isn't squishy, saggy or swampy like my previous viscoelastic foam mattress. Kudos fellas!
 i love it but i bought it at 450 and the following week it was 425. Don't know if that something amazon does anymore a 30 day price guarantee but other then that the bed is great my son loves it.Its very comfortable and good quality bed for the price.
 Most comfortable mattress, amazing price, incredibly easy to have delivered/unpack. Love the cooling materials and soft feel. Definitely recommend, and price point cannot be beat!
 Easy to inflate, only took a couple of minutes. Very comfortable and didn't take much time to adjust. We were a little nervous not being able to try it out, but after reading many reviews, we decided to go for it. Very happy and satisfied especially not having to deal with the stores and salesmen!
 Great mattress, I'm a bit heavier than the normal person, and sank into the other foam mattresses I've tried, it doesn't happen with this one.
 I bought the bed for my father in October 2018 and 3 months later he’s complaining of lower back. I’m extremely disappointed with this purchase after reading so many reviews that stated the bed was a great investment.
 I have lumbar facet pain and had a herniated disc a few years ago. This mattress did not work for me. Very comfortable but not ideal for those with back issues
 I got a tempurpedic bed 10 years ago when I was going through chemo, and while it worked and was great in the beginning, I spent the last two years sleeping more on my couch which is comfy a.f. I noticed my last mattress began shrinking, didn't have the square corners it once had, I was starting to sink in it and sheets were no longer staying on.<br/>I did my research and came across T&amp;N and felt their bed not only is affordable but they have a good background story. This time I'll be going through radiation, for a new cancer, and I love my bed. I am sleeping in my bed. I am actually sleeping and not tossing and turning. It's been months since I've gotten a good nights sleep. I look forward to my treatments and coming home and actually napping in my bed comfortable.<br/>It is a little firm, but that is what I love about it. It supports me! I'm 5'4, 175# and this is great. I finally have that couch support in my bed and I love it!!
 The mattress is too soft in the edge .make my back bone hurt cause I keep sliding down to the side.
 WONDERFUL mattress! Should have gotten it sooner.
 Love this mattress, nice firmness. Easy to unpack out of the vacuum sealer. I looked at both this one and the Casper one. There really is not that much difference other than price. Save your self $200 and get the Tuft and Needle, money left offer to buy new bedding.
 I am a very, very picky sleeper. Back issues, etc. I got this as an extra bed for nights when my boys have sleepovers, but also there are nights when I will use it myself. I always do lots of research on any product I buy, and the reviews for this bed and this company were just way too glowing to not at least check it out. Simply put, I have had a very expensive Tempurpedic bed for many years, which I love -- I was stunned that I slept just as good on the Tuft and Needle. Extremely comfortable, extremely well made. And even more, when I exchanged the twin for an XL twin, the customer service could not have been more gracious and helpful.<br/><br/>By the way, it takes an awful lot for me to take the time to write a review of a product. That's why this is the first one I have ever written. That tells you all you need to know.
 Love this mattress!!!! We put it in our guest room. Very nice and made great!!!
 After sleeping on this for a week I began to wake up with sore legs.  The return process was great, but its not as comfortable as advertised
 Not firm enough for us
 Frame needs a few more cross beams on the bottom to keep the mattress from sinking in.<br/>The mattress itself great
 First let me start of The review by saying Tuft &amp; Needle has amazing customer service. With that said, as a consumer you should never have to use a companies customer service!<br/><br/>After unboxing our mattress I sat on the edge and sunk like a led ship. This mattress has zero edge support when getting dressed ect...which isn't a huge deal as we spend little time sitting on the edge of the bed but is a little concerning prior to the actual sleep test.<br/><br/>The first few nights were rough getting use to the new foam mattress after sleeping on a Beautyrest for roughly 15 years. There is definitely a period of time needed to get use to a foam mattress.<br/><br/>After the initial first few nights I slept great, probably the best sleep I've had in years. My fiance on the other hand just could not get use to sleeping on this mattress and after a few weeks started noticing pulling in her lower back and began complaining of lower back pain. We slept on the mattress for roughly 5 weeks before we switching back to the old mattress. Needless to say while I found this mattress great to sleep on my fiance did not. In addition to lower back issues she could not get use to sleeping on foam and felt like she was going to fall out of the bed due to lack of edge support.<br/><br/>I'd wished my fiance had given it a little bit longer, but ultimately it didnt matter as the biggest issue withe the mattrest wasnt with sleeping, but with night time activities. Something that in 10,000 plus reviews wasn't really talked about.<br/><br/>This mattress regardless of how great I slept is just horrible for sex! There I said it!! Even if my fiance had slept great like I had, this mattress wouldn't have made the cut due to the sex factor alone. Sadly we returned our mattress for a full refund through Amazon. Tuft &amp; Needle did try to make our experience better along the way which I can't speak highly enough of.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you don't care about edge support and if sex is not important to you, then by all means try this out.
 It's much firmer than expected. May have to return.
 Suuuuuuuppper comfy. So glad we got this bed. Easy delivery and setup. Been sleeping amazing.
 Received mattress really quickly.  Husband has trouble with his back and this mattress has relieved his pain so far.  I recommended this mattress to anyone who is wanting a soft yet firm feeling.
 I have had lower back and hip pain for years that has kept me awake at night. After the first night on this mattress two months ago, I awoke pain-free and have been ever since. Totally worth the price.
 Never thought of going with a foam mattress but, based on reviews, I took a chance.  A month in, and I'm very happy!
 This matress was well worth the cost! The mattress came quickly and was very easy to move and set up. It is very comfortable- I have gotten some of thr best sleep on this mattress.
 Simply put, we love our new mattress.  It has just the right balance of firmness and give, is incredibly comfortable, isn't hot to sleep in and we can move without disturbing the other.  We're really glad we bought it, especially for the price!  It's an outstanding mattress.
 This thing is comfortable. Best sleep ever from the first night I opened the package.
 Was Very hesitant to buy a mattress that i wasnt able to actually test before purchase. I typically read reviews for products and make my decisions from there. This one had the best reviews for this price point. Not disappointed at all, honestly most comfortable mattress ive ever owned
 I was very skeptical about buying a mattress with $700 but after the first night sleeping on it I truly love it we recommend it to all my friends
 I've had this mattress for almost 2 weeks now and I really like it. The first night was difficult, but probably because I was use to my other mattress.
 Mattress is fantastic!!  LOVE IT!!  The delivery via UPS wasn't good.  The mattress was delivered without a cardboard container/box.  It arrived with a clear plastic cover only.  No invoice/instructions/etc.  Luckily the mattress wasn't damaged, but it easily could have been..
 Super comfortable and easy to set up. The instructions say to wait 2 hours for it to fully reconstitute, but it looked ready almost immediately. Foam smell for just a day or two, and now we're in love with our super comfy, sturdy, cool mattress.
 So far, so great.  We have only had it for 2 weeks and it is the best sleep I have had in a while.  I normally love a soft, squishy mattress (this is NOT squishy), but I have come to love the firmness and support from this bed.  As an added bonus, I can't tell when my husband gets in and out of bed (or the dog!).
 This product did not work for my husband and I due to it's firmness. The delivery was seamless and Amazon made the money back guarantee happen very conveniently. I wish it worked for us so we didn't have to search for another mattress :(
 Very happy with my purchase.  It is not a firm mattress so if prefer that keep looking.  It was easy to unpack and perfect for my guest room.
 Absolutely perfect for our toddlers first big boy bed! My husband and I have also laid in his bed with him and it's very comfortable! I searched high and low for a non toxic green option for a mattress at a reasonavle cost and finally found the perfect one!
 We have one in our bedroom and two in our vacation rental.
 This is the only mattress I will buy<br/>I’ve bought many twins -6 so far and now have the king. My daughter has also changed out all their mattresses to Tuft and Needle.
 Super soft mattress
 Had this mattress for about 8 months on an Amazon wire bed frame. I think it is starting to sag in places not well supported by the bed frame and am now shopping for a solid bed frame to see if that makes the mattress better.
 I'm satisfied with this purchase and especially for the value, it can't be beat.
 I love this bed and would order it again.
 Firmer than I had expected but overall a very comfortable mattress. Would purchase again or recommend to a family member.
 This mattress is very comfortable and yet firm.
 SO comfortable!! In love with this mattress. So much better than any of my previous mattresses.
 Very happy with the mattress.  It's comfortable and much more affordable than any other mattress.
 I weight 220 lb and have been through 3 mattress in past 5 years nothing seemed to hold up or give correct support.  Prior to getting this mattress I would wake up every night do to some back pain, and would end up sleeping on floor because it was more comfortable. As a practicing chiropractor I know the benefits of a good supportive night sleep has.  This mattress in absolute the best mattress I've ever slept on.
 Arrived promptly. Unrolled the plastic without a problem...had a slight smell (very minor) which went away after 48 hours. This mattress is VERY comfortable.  Thanks Tuft &amp; Needle!!! Good for any one who has a bad back or who would like a good nap or a wonderful night's sleep!
 Best matttess we've ever slept on. We love that it doesnt make any noise or bouncing.
 Had it for a couple of years now and it's still absolutely the BEST mattress I've ever had! When returning from out of town and back in my own bed I am still so very grateful for the comfort of this mattress! Reasonably priced and delivered to my door!
 I was a bit leeary about getting a mattress shipped to me and i had done some shopping around for a while. it took me about 2 weeks to adjust to the mattress before i had a comfortable nights sleep.  the first few i got only what i can discribe as hot flashes where i was in contact to the mattress. thgouh  that sensation only happend  for about  two nights.  there is a smell that goes away after two days, its half as strong  on day two and by day 3 almost none. and then its gone.
 Decided to upgrade to a king bed and we're so glad we did!<br/><br/>Very easy to unpackage and get set up, would recommend to anyone! Only have a few nights of sleep on it, but no complaints here!
 Very comfortable bed. Set up was SO simple. No chemical smell that I noted.
 Very comfortable, low energy transfer (won't rock your partner), excellent back support.
 Everything from set up to using our mattress for almost 3 months has been wonderful. Do not feel intimidated by the set up with instructions it is a piece of cake.<br/>So far so good.
 Slept on my new mattress for 2 nights and am in pain in the mornings. The bed is so hard, there is no give<br/>to it.  I regret buying it. I should have bought my other choice, the Leesa. So very disappointed as I spent<br/>weeks researching mattresses
 Best - Mattress - Ever! You know your mattress is amazing when you look forward to getting home just so that you can get back in bed!
 I did a lot of research before buying this mattress.  There are many on the market that charge in my opinion way too much.  My first concern with many other mattress on the market with memory foam retain body heat!  Not good for me.  I have had this mattress for only a few days and have already noticed I get better sleep!  I have chronic pain from health conditions and and a good mattress was very important but did not want to break the bank buying one.  This mattress provides cool sleeping, pressure relief adaptive foam and is breathable.  And omg it is made in the USA!  I am very very happy that I did my research, purchased this mattress and did not break the bank doing it!  I highly recommend this mattress!
 Love, love, love this mattress!  I thought it might be to firm when I first got it.  After sleeping on it a few nights, my husband &amp; I both agree that it is perfect.  Got the king size for much less then we paid for a queen size in an IComfort.  Great quality.  Love that it has a zip off cover for washing.
 bravo. we bought this for our just graduated son. Wish I would have found this before we purchased our TemperPedic a few years ago.
 This is an incredible mattress from an incredible company. I wish everything I purchased on line exceeded my expectations as this has! Great communication in regard to every aspect of the purchase.....also, the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on! Perfection, truly!<br/>I never write reviews for anything - but I feel inspired to tell everyone about thiis!!!<br/>Perfect service and perfect product. I can't believe this still exists! A miracle!
 I had been doing a lot of research to find a good mattress, I choose this mattress and am quite satisfied.  since I've had this mattress (about a month) I have not had any back issues!!  I would recommend this mattress to anyone with lower back pain.
 I have to say this is one of the more comfortable beds I've had the pleasure of trying out. Not too hard or too soft with easy instructions on getting your mattress instructions. If you are looking for a memory foam mattress give Tuft &amp; Needle a try!
 Easy to unpack and set up. One half of the mattress is soft, I feel like I'm sinking into it. Then I roll over to my right and it feels the way I think it should. Plush yet firm. I tried using multiple bases and even bought a sheet of ply wood to try and balance it out. Still no good. Unfortunately I'm passed the 100 night trial so whatever...
 For someone who is constantly tossing and turning throughout the night, this mattress has been great.  It's had a positive affect on my back as well.  Glad to have purchased.
 They arrived fast. (we bought 2 for the King size Pragma bed, the head lifts)  It was amazing when we opened up the pkg. The granddaughters laughed at how fast it expanded. It's been about 2 weeks now and I have a really bad back. (Fused from the T10 to the S1  Bra hook to the pelvic bone)  And while nothing is going to cure that, it seems when I wake up in the morning I am slightly not as stiff as before. But I do get comfortable pretty quickly on it at night.  My husband loves it too.<br/>Also about a week in, the littlest granddaughter spent the night, came to bed with us in the night.  She woke in the morning vomiting. She is 18 months. My husband removed the zip on cover, spot cleaned it and it all came out. No residual smell at all.  And the mattress itself was just fine. The cover that comes on them did not let it go through.  We were very pleased.  It is automatically registered for your guarantee and when I wrote to ask they mentioned they do not recommend a mattress cover, which I had bought, so I returned them.  Very nice purchase.  Good value for the money.
 good product. Made it less hot to sleep. But I needed something more firm and this is not it.
 I bought this twin mattress for my 10 yr. Old daughter. It comes rolled up in plastic and at first I thought it was going to be too thin. However when it expands it is very thick. It didn't give me a choice selection for firmness. I thought it was a little too firm but  my daughter says it's comfortable.
 We've owned our Tuft &amp; Needle King mattress for four months now, and are still just as extremely pleased with it as we were the very first night we slept on it. My wife and I both sleep more restfully now, and I haven't woken up with a sore back ever since we switched to the Tuft &amp; Needle. We still can't believe how incredible this mattress feels, and how great it works to ensure you're perfectly supported throughout the night.
 Returned it after one week.  Showed sign of wear after one week.  No firmness at all.  If you want a soft mattress this is the one.
 i prefer a firm mattress, this mattress is soft - but so supportive. Takes a couple days to be perfect and then you'll be obsessed with it.
 This is the second time I've purchased this mattress.  First time was for my mom and this time for myself.  But I feel like the mattress components are different now.  The mattress seems much warmer and retains a lot of heat and it is making it hard to sleep on.
 Great mattress, getting a good night's sleep finally. Delivery was on time, set up easy. The test will be in a year from now as to how well it holds up.
 Like it a little better than Leesa - both are good products.  PS I'll never go in a mattress store again!
 Bought based on the large number of 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon. I really like them - comfortable and not hot. Exactly what I was looking for.
 Update: I now have had this for a couple months now and it's still my favorite bed. It's extremely comfortable and was really easy to set up. I will for sure be getting another one for my other room.<br/><br/>Original: Amazing bed, will be getting another for the other room.
 This is one of the most comfortable mattress I've owned very happy with tuft and needle
 Been using it for about 6 months. I have not complaints. Make sure you get deep pocket fitted sheets.
 We purchased for a guest bedroom. It is so nice we are tempted to move it to master bedroom. It is very comfortable.
 This is the best mattress I have ever had.  It is half the cost of spring mattresses, it has amazing support, it does not in any way sleep hot.  I am a plus size person and have been sleeping on this mattress for about 2 months and no complaints.  It's great!!!  Excellent support!  Plus, it comes in a box about the size of a an extra large duffel bag, so it is fun to watch it inflate when you release it from it's packing!
 This bed is literally the most amazing thing I have ever slept on! I was unsure about this mattress at first because I wanted something on the firmer side but man oh man! This bed just molds perfectly to your body. You feel like you're sleeping on a cloud! I literally don't ever want to get out of this bed because it's that comfortable! Trust me you wont regret it if you buy this. (My husband and I were between this bed and the DynastyMattress but I'm so glad we splurged a little extra and chose this!)
 Have had this mattress now for two months and are very pleased with purchase.  The mattress is firm, but not too firm.  We tried out a Casper and liked the firmness of the Tuft and Needle better.  Sleeping well on it and would recommend.
 I absolutely love this mattress... I wasn’t sure when I first got it because it was a little firm but after a week sleeping on it, it is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on.... highly recommend T&amp;N
 Only had this for 3 days now but this mattress is great. I was a little nervous ordering it because so many reviews claimed that it was hard as a rock, when I it arrived it turned our it is a bit softer than what I like, but close enough.
 I am in love with this mattress! Came in a relatively small box and was vacuum sealed.  Feels like hotel quality and our dogs love it as well!  So happy with this purchase.
 It's a little soft, but way better than the $7000 Reverie I wasted my money on.
 This mattress made my back pain really worse. After 3 months I returned to my old mattress which is relatively firmer and immediately felt the different in my back.
 6 weeks in and it's still very comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect so far.
 Arrived perfectly on time and in excellent condition. Wonderfully comfortable mattress and truth be told it's pretty entertaining when you cut the plastic sleeve it's in and it starts to fluff out.
 It is less than a year since we purchased this mattress and we still like it.  We were able to lay it on top of the box springs to our previous mattress and it sits lower, which I like.  It does not make you hot.
 Edited:<br/><br/>Originally given a 5 star rating because I loved it. It was firm but not terribly firm but I guess this is subjective. Either way I loved it.<br/><br/>After 6 short months of ownership and use it is developing a sink spot! What a waste of money. It can't even last a year without sinking in right where I lay. The surrounding area is still pretty firm but right where I lay it's sinking in. If I scoot over a few inches my whole body becomes unbalanced because half is in the sunken spot and the other half of me is on the raised spot.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype. It won't last a year, in my case not even 6 months, before it starts crapping out.<br/><br/>I have not contacted the company to complain. Idk what their customer is like. I don't feel it's my place to contact anyone after just buying this months ago...
 AMAZING! Firm but soft at the same time, loving it!<br/>*update..it has been 8 months and it is still Awesome and comfortable!!
 This is our 2nd Tuft &amp; Needle -  I recommended to my daughter as well and she bought an absolutely loved too
 First time I am in love with my bed! This is our first time sleeping on a non spring mattress and it's fantastic! Easy to set up too.
 Took my a few days to get used to it, but it working great with an adjustable frame. Excellent customer service!
 This smelled horrible for about 3-4 days and made everything that touched it smell bad for a few days.  It's super soft and comfortable but feels a lot more narrow than the queen sized mattresses I'm use to.  I'm not sure that I would recommend it for couples unless they like to sleep close.
 The mattress is only good for short use, one or two nights.  Too soft and uncomfortable after couple of nights
 Very firm mattress which I love. I've had it for about 6 months now and it is just as comfy as the day I received it. Held its shape and has no divots or indents from where I sleep on it.
 After reading reviews I thought this bed would be great for lower back pain. My back pain is far worse after buying this bed. Very disappointed.
 Awesome.  Firmer than I would have thought or expected, but kid sleeps great on it.
 I purchased this based on the recommendation of the Wirecutter for a firm mattress. This is not a very firm mattress. As pointed out in other reviews, the edge support is laughable. Worse still is that the king size is not a full 80 x 76 inches. It is short more than one inch on each side.
 Very happy with our mattress!! My husband and I have never agreed on the comfort of a mattress, but this one seems to work well for both of us. We have been sleeping on it for about a month and we are both sleeping well.
 Bought this mattress about 6 months ago. I'm a side sleeper with a permanent back injury. This mattress has been great on my back and I've woken up with less pain since sleeping on it. (Due to the nature of my injury, it is unlikely any mattress will deliver 0 pain mornings.) Really pleased with this purchase.
 Sleeping on this 5 months now. Very nice. Easy to set up.
 My husband loves this!! It was bought for his rig &amp; he actually prefers it to the bed at home!!  So I'll be purchasing another one, real soon!!
 Its good.
 I wish I would have read some of the reviews better but it only took less than a week to figure it out for myself. Maybe this mattress would work better for more heavyset people considering me and my husband are very thin...but for the whole week I would actually wake up in the middle of the night with my neck, back, and shoulders aching from sleeping on this mattress. It is just too FIRM! when you sit on it it seams very nice and cushiony but when you lay flat or try and sleep on your side or stomach it’s just painful.:( going to give it to the ups guy tomorrow and not happy about having to pay almost 50 DOLLARS for the return...if you like soft comfy beds or are a side sleeper please just pay the extra cash and look into getting a different one! We are trying out the purple mattress next so hopefully we have better luck with that!
 Product delivery was fast and on time.  The matress is firm but because it is gel it contours your body. It did have that new matress smell for a day or two. I find the sizing to be a little off. I ordered a California king but king sheets fit it. For the price I would recommend.
 This bed is so soft and it was easy to get onto the bed. My 3 year old loved it and I was super jealous her bed was the nicest bed in the house
 We have this matress for like 2 weeks now. So far I am giving it a 5 star review. Let's see how long will it last lol
 Absolutely amazing. We love our new mattress!
 two nights into this new mattress and I woke up in the same position I went to bed in.
 I cannot fall asleep on this mattress. I wake up with back pains. I sleep on the couch some nights because I cant handle it.
 So far this seems to be a pretty good mattress.  When it is classed as medium firm I think that is very accurate.  I actually prefer a slightly firmer mattress but this seems to support my body evenly and I don't wake up with any more pain than I ever had before.  A lot of the pain is arthritis and a result of being in one position for hours, even though I do turn over several times during the night.<br/><br/>I also switch sides of the mattress because I get very hot.  Not completely covered with sweat like I did with my memory foam mattress, but still overly warm to the point where I need to toss off my comforter for a while to cool down.  My husband laughs at me because I start the night at the very edge of the bed.  Then after I wake up and make my potty visit I do the same thing on the far edge.  And I almost always wake up in the morning in the middle of the bed.  It should wear evenly, right?  LOL<br/><br/>Other people have commented that when you press on the top it feels like marshmallows.  It really does!  But when you put your body "in bed" that too soft, squishy feeling goes away instantly.  Amazing.  I gave this mattress four stars because I haven't used it long enough to know how it will hold up over time.  If I remember to do so, in about a year I will return and edit my review with an update.<br/><br/>There was no odor when we unwrapped it, and it puffed up to full size very quickly so I could sleep on it that night.  I'm using an old fashioned standard quilted mattress pad.  I got this one on sale at a very good price and feel it is most probably well worth what I paid for it.  I do not expect it to last as many years as my previous Temper-Pedic did, which was 15 years, but should have been replaced a year or two earlier.<br/><br/>If you are on a budget and looking for a nice mattress that is actually medium firm, this is one to consider. .
 I bought one from Tuft &amp; Needle(T&amp;N) itself, another from Amazon. I really took a leap of faith in buying this mattress, but I checked into the company, the reviews, and decided to give it a try. This mattress replaced a Tempur-Pedic mattress that cost way more than the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress and I am so much happier with the T&amp;N purchase! We had a slight snafu with the length of the mattress we received from T&amp;N and they took care of it without a hitch! They're completely straightforward to deal with, so there are the 5 stars for the company. The Mattress? OMG! I am in love! So comfortable, sleeps cool (a BIG reason why I decided to replace the Tempur-Pedic), and just the right firmness. Firmness was an area I was really concerned about. Too soft a mattress and my back will go out. Too firm and I'll feel achy. This one is just perfect! I'm sleeping better and waking up feeling so much better than I used to. It's a complete winner. As long as T&amp;N continues to be owned by the same people, they have a customer in me for life!
 This was probably the most nervous I was to purchase a mattress I'd not even seen.  However, this is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on &amp; would recommend to anyone looking for a new one.
 I'm very impressed with the quality of the mattress topper. It's solved the problem with pressure when I laid on my side. Thank you for the quick solution.
 Bought this for my granddaughter when she moved into a smaller room.  She loves it.
 It has the right amount of cushion but it gets warm and sides are not supportive
 A little on the warm side for us, but other-wise good!
 Amazing amazing amazing! Had this for 6 months now. Very good for us. We prefer slightly firmer and it's perfect! Best idea ever!
 Nothing the best mattress ever well done
 Very fast and easy setup. Had a strong odor out of the box but dissipated after a couple of hours. Very, very comfortable night sleep!
 Very comfortable for side sleeping. Doesn't seem to trap heat using the Hotel Luxury Bed Sheets Set- 1800 Series Platinum Collection-Deep Pocket,Wrinkle &amp; Fade Resistant. Used Zinus 9 Inch High Profile Metal Smart Box Spring / Mattress Foundation / Wood Slat Support / Easy Assembly, King
 been one week of use, now i'm waking up with no lower back pain and able too sleep longer. Before I usually woke up around 4 am due to excruciating back pain. Highly recommend mattress.
 We have had the mattress for 2 months and are very happy with the purchase.  It is very comfortable and we both wake up refreshed, no joint aches or pains.  The only problem is that it is not as thick as most mattresses that are now being made and I haven't found a fitted sheet to fit snuggly.
 This mattress is awesome for my daughter.  She loves this bed.  I've laid on it as well to test it out and it is super comfortable. Great for back or side sleepers.
 love, love, super comfortable.
 Very comfortable. Fun to open! Hard to believe it's a queen bed until you pull the plastic and it explodes to normal size.
 Very nice mattress for this price. Getting very good sleep every night.
 I love mine!! currently have in on the floor with no frame and it's great
 We think the matress is too fluffy. Otherwise very recomended.<br/><br/>I have to downgrade to 1 star, every time I sit in the matress I can feel de foundation on my...... it really is way too fluffy
 I'd been having trouble sleeping through the night with our previous mattress (which was a generic one). I'd wake up many times and I'd have back pain as in the morning. I bought this mattress from Tuft &amp; Needle based on the reviews and I have to say I couldn't be happier. I now sleep much better and deeper and I don't have aches and pains in the morning!<br/><br/>Within the last month my daughter (26) mentioned to me that she'd been waking with back pains as well and she blamed it on her mattress so we got her a full-size mattress for her bed ...the next morning she sent me this text
 Most comfortable bed ever, prefer it over my tempurpedic at home, purchased this forl our motorhome.  Highly recommend
 This is a quality product!  What a great find!  I heard about it on the radio. I'm surprised to see some people stating that the mattress is too firm. I think it has the perfect balance of support and comfort. It's SO comfortable!!  Delivered right to your front door.  I'm never using another brand ever again.
 In love with my new mattress! Its so comfortable. And ordering it online and having it delivered to my door was so convenient.
 Very happy with my purchase and how quickly it was ready to sleep on
 Best nights sleep ever! We love it, no smell not hot! Doesn't sink on side.
 Comfortable a bit on the firm side
 Bought this for my wife to replace the Temperpedic  XL long she slept on. I will be looking to replace mine soon. Good value and just as good/better than what we had.
 Really comfortable and a great product.
 I love my bed! It was soooo easy to order, un-package and get set up. I have plans in the works of a new one soon (guest bedroom). It took me about a month to get used to my new bed, but now I love it.
 For our guest bed
 Probably the best investment I've made. I have no idea about the longevity of it, but I can say that I've had some of the best rest I've had in years on this mattress.
 A very good mattress that met my needs perfectly
 Great night sleep. This mattress is definitely on the firm side but that's what I like. Give it a week (or two) and it will soften up.
 Mattress is great. First night of sleep on it was last night and had a great sleep.  Perfect firmness with it being just soft enough. Will update as time goes along.
 I'm a big guy (225 pounds).  The mattress is very comfortable, but I like softer mattresses.  If you're looking for a firm mattress, this isn't it, but if you're looking for a softer mattress with good support, this is a winner.
 Looks great, comfortable. It is in a guest bedroom, and I might have to try it out!
 Wow, great quality for a mattress ordered in a box, would not hesitate to purchase another. It is firm but really comfortable. Purchased for our guest bed and very pleased with the quality.
 One of the best mattresses I've had and so much cheaper than your tradition king or queen set you'd find in stores. The salesman at the traditional mattress place we visited told us there was no way to find a quality latext mattress at this type of price...WAS SHE WRONG! Great value buy and a comfortable sleep for over 30 days!!!
 Absolutely perfect! I sleep soundly and no longer wake with back pain.
 Mattress as described! Very very comfortable thus far. Wish I had purchased a full size instead of twin but budget would not allow. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable mattress.
 Absolutely love this mattress.  Have gone through several over the years and nothing compares . . . especially for the price.  Extremely happy with this purchase after 6 months.  Very comfortable, breathable and cool, and the whole ordering and shipping process is great.
 Anyone else have problems with it being to hard? Does it soften up, or do I need to buy a topper, too?
 Basically almost as good as a $4500 mattress I had before.
 Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is super comfortable, moreover, the people at the company are AWESOME. I ordered a king size bed, which I thoroughly enjoyed no complaints at all. However, me and my girlfriend broke up and I had to return it. The company is so nice to give me a full refund. Highly recommend this product, and especially recommend because the customer service they provide is truly superb!
 woke up on my back 1st time in 4eva. roofed for 18 years + breakdancing. great support for bed stretching(like a 8'x6'yoga mat)cal king
 My husband and I purchased this mattress to replace an old mattress that was making me sleep funny and hurting my back. I had been wanting to try a foam mattress and unfortunately I was highly disappointed. We gave it 30 days and by the end my back hurt worse then with my old mattress. This mattress is very hard and in my opinion, does not offer any side sleeping support! Instead of conforming to my body like it claimed it would, I ended up bent with hard spots on my hips, shoulders, and knees.<br/><br/>When I called amazon's special handling department to return it, the guy tried to give me a hard time even though the company has a 100 day money back guarantee. Eventually he agreed to the refund and told me I could keep the mattress, throw it away or donate it.
 I REALLY wanted this mattress to be all that others have found it to be. This is my 3rd mattress in the last year and only one was returnable at a cost of $150. I purchased this mattress knowing I wouldn't be sleeping on it for 6 months after purchase. It went in a condo that was rented for the winter. I new full well the 100 night guarantee would not apply and took a leap of faith based on the reviews.<br/><br/>Sadly, I only make it 4 hours before back pain prevents further sleep. There is a lack of edge support to the point of feeling like you're going to slide off when sitting. For the record, I am 6' and 180#. I'm beginning to think my 66 year old body isn't ever going to have a full nights sleep again. I'm in good health and play golf 2 or more times a week. The thought of spending thousands on a high priced air mattress is daunting, considering I may have the same issues.<br/><br/>It's only been 10 days for me, so perhaps my body will adjust. In fairness, my wife sleeps great with no issues at all.
 Two nights on it and already an amazing purchase. I will recommend T&amp;N to ALL my friends!! It's a perfect bed and the packaging couldn't be easier. I can't say enough about how much I love T&amp;N mattresses!
 This is one of the best out there and most affordable and my  guests are really happy  and sleep well!
 Excellent quality . Just right amount of firmness . I would recommend this mattress to anyone who has back problems l have had many back surgeries and is equal to the much higher priced memory foam mattress. This is super buy .
 Love this mattress! I bought it in August and have never slept so comfortably. I never felt too warm, the mattress did not hold the heat.
 LOVE THIS MATTRESS.  We purchased it for a guest room and decided to try it out for ourselves.  We loved the comfort of a great night's sleep..hated to give it up for our own room.  An excellent product that lives up to the reviews.  We placed a  1 in solid plywood underneath b/c of memory foam and added a topper just in case.  Can't wait until our guest room is empty again.
 Love this mattress. Love the price.  We got it for our guest bedroom.  It is not too hard not too soft and doesn't get hot while you're sleeping. My mother in law ( who has back issues) said she had a great nights sleep.  We also purchased a king size for our bedroom.
 This was great the first few nights, now i am back to feeling like i am sleeping on my old  12 year old spring mattress. Also my wife never has had a full night sleep on it yet.
 This is a terrific mattress, folks.  It is not too hard nor too soft.  We ordered two of them in twin XL and they have softened up just a bit over the first few days as they became more filled with air but they seem to have settled and provide firm support.  We like them very much and sleep well on them.  That, bottom line, is what counts.  I will not hesitate to recommend this mattress (or company) to anyone who is looking for an excellent value in comfort and support.
 Purchased 1 twin for a 120 lb person and 1 twin XL for a 220 lb. person over a year ago.  Both are as nice as when purchased. They remain firm, yet comfortable. The kids love them.
 I was very leery about buying a mattress in a box, not able to test it out. I like my side of the bed soft; my husband likes his firm. We have a sleep number but my side had a slow leak.  We did a lot of research on mattresses and we decided to try this out. It arrived on time and we let it air out for a couple of days before we used it.  It was the best night's sleep I've had in years.  I slept through the night without waking with pain in my hip or shoulders and woke up in the morning with NO back pain. My husband has chronic back problems and also slept great. We've been sleeping on it a week now and we both love, love, love it!
 I just got my Queen Tuft &amp; Needle mattress yesterday. I FRIGGIN LOVE THIS THING. The cost is incredible and the shipping is convenient. I feel it's better than described. 10 out of 10. Would recommend. Everyone should own one of these.
 My minor back pain went away when I switched to this mattress. Keeps you cool, which is extra useful when you live in a warmer climate.
 This was a great bed, a bit too firm for me. I ordered a different one. I have to say though, amazon has the ABSOLUTE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. They are absolutely amazing and helpful in anyway possible.
 Tuft and Needle is a great product and we are very happy with the quality of the product and comfort, BUT the California King we got was the old model, NOT the model pictured on Amazon (and there is a BIG difference in how it looks).  If I had to do over again, I would order direct from Tuft and Needle.
 I bought the full sized mattress just two days ago. I live in a room in a house so always am looking for things that can used for daily living. This mattress was a lot of fun! The box had me thinking that there was no way that this thing could be 10 inches thick and full sized. Watching it expand before my very eyes was amazing. I'd say its a fun mattress. I slept the first night on it and did not do well. Just not used to the differences. I had a Japanese style futon but it had gotten so rock hard that sleeping was painful. My second night was probably the best of sleep yet. It just seems to form around my larger body whether sleeping on my side or back and I do both. I can use it to rest on and watch netflix, prop myself up and do work, read on my kindle. Its a great purchase for a person in a smaller room with limited space but wanting to get good sleep. I have not bought a lot of stuff like this for the last years but after reading the reviews, seeing it was okay and even recommended having it on the floor; I went for it. I hope to get 10 years out of it. I think I will.
 I love this mattress... I've been dealing with severe lower back pain for several years... a few nights on this mattress and I've been just about pain free!  We've had this mattress set up for about 3 months now...
 I bought this mattress for my teenager son and after a while I asked him if he liked it and felt comfortable and he answer YES...so for me is a victory. He grew tall so I got the X-Large version and I managed to use the same sheets for regular twin size bed just a little stretching and problem solved, so no need to buy new set of sheets.
 wife loves the new bed, however, my back pain has gotten worse since getting this bed. I tried looking online for anything negative regarding this bed, but I couldn't really find anything. I guess something is wrong with me :(
 I didn't have to deal with the mattress store middle man and its accompanying price markup. This is my first non-coil spring mattress, and it provides both comfort and support. I was hesitant to buy a mattress without trying it out first, but there's a reason why this has gotten so many high reviews.
 We are loving this bed.  Total game changer for couple- King Size Bed!  Tuft and Needle, you guys nailed it. This bed feels wonderful.  We are both sleeping so peacefully.  Totally happy with this bed, no complaints.  Thank you!!1
 The bed is absolutely wonderful!!!! I finally can sleep thru the night. The price was outstanding for such an amazing bed!!!!
 I brought it because people said its firm :(. But this is not firm, it seem to go down a bit. I am a stomach sleeper and I prefer my mattress to be firm. I got back pain too..had to sleep on floor.
 Hurts my back but the wife loves it
 *updated 9/9/2017 -I love this mattress. The minor slipping on my current boxspring takes nothing away from comfort. Great mattress, great value.*<br/><br/>I've been sleeping on this mattress for 2 weeks. I purchased this mattress after trying one in a T&amp;N store. I was really please with the store experience. There is no pressure to buy and the employees were helpful. Pros- It was shipped to my door. I could move it myself (full size). I slept on it 4 hours after opening and there was only a faint smell (now gone). I was really worried about being hot. It is a little warmer than a conventional mattress but it's not "hot" like I thought it might be. I do not think it is "hard". I do not have a waterproof mattress cover but am considering buying one. Cons- it's a little bit larger than my full size box spring. I debated between a queen and full size. I went with the full because I could place it on the box spring I already have without the added expense or purchasing a new platform. The mattress slips on the box spring  and it makes me crazy. I would've budgeted for a queen and a new platform if I had known about the slipping/hanging over the box spring.<br/>Overall- I think it's good quality, made in the USA, fair price, comfortable.<br/>My four star review was based solely on the mattress.<br/><br/>I was completely disappointed with Amazon shipping. I did some research to make sure that my mattress arrived on the day that I could be home to receive it and have my old mattress removed. The shipping was "delayed" for 2 days and my mattress was stuck in transit somewhere with no explanation. When the mattress was delivered, it sat at my front door for 8 hours before I came home from work. Amazon shipping is usually great, but this will be a consideration for me in the future when making a larger purchase.
 Best decision i have made in 2018 so far. if you have back and neck problems like me, def a must.
 Wonderful mattress. I owned one of their first models of the 5-inch thickness. I was living more of a minimalist, bachelor lifestyle at that point. Once I started to change that, this full-sized seemed like a great idea. Extremely comfortable and will last forever with a sleep cover.<br/><br/>Would buy again 10/10
 This is an exceptionally comfortable mattress. It arrived promptly, and the directions to remove it from the box and allow expansion were excellent. We bought it for our slender granddaughter who gave it a big thumbs up. The recommended mattress pad fit perfectly. This is a deep mattress. We intend to purchase another in the near future.
 This mattress is very firm. Not what we expected. We ultimately returned. CxSvc was great.
 After 3+ weeks I have to say I'm totally happy. I fall asleep quicker, stay asleep longer, and feel more rested. I like the feel of the bed, I sink in just the right amount while not feeling stuck like some foam beds. And the best part is that this bed cost a quarter of the mattress it replaced.
 here at my stats.  im 6" 1, and weigh 175 pounds.  I had 4 back surgeries, the first when i was 17 and the last about 10 years ago.<br/>in the last 10 years, ive purchased two Simmons beautyrest.  They were both in the $1000 range.  The mattresses were ok but quickly lost their support and there was literally a ditch in the center of the bed.  ive been thinking about getting a new bed but i thought it would be the same exprience with the same cost so i put it off for years.<br/><br/>finally i couldnt take the restless night and waking up feeling tired and super sore.<br/><br/>a friend recommended the casper so i was leaning that way but with the price difference i went with the tuft and needle.<br/><br/>what can i say, there is no perfect bed but the tuft and needle is be far the best bed ive ever purchased .  going from waking up 2-3 a night<br/>to 1-0 is so great.  i wake up and my foot isnt numb, thats a great sign.  really happy with this bed.  i wish i purchased it sooner.
 Low odor. I like the firmness of the support. The light color cover requires a quality, moisture resistant mattress cover which any new mattress deserves.
 So far, slept on this mattress two nights and we LOVE it! Deep,restful sleep,less aches and pains and so cozy!
 We replaced our overpriced, saggy springy mattress with and were delighted the first night we slept on it! It's like sleeping on a cloud.
 The best mattress I have ever had! It is so comfortable I purchased 3 for my my 3 berm. Home!
 Oh my goodness! I have had this mattress on my radar for about a year. I went to the local show room and made the decision that this would be my next mattress, I just was waiting until the right time to buy. Then when my sister said she was coming to see me on vacation I ordered the mattress and it was here in about 3 days. (I also ordered the Linux bed frame.) I am 68 and got the mattress back to the bedroom and set up by myself so it is really easy to do! Of course I had to try it out and it was exactly what I wanted. Some people have commented that it is too firm, and it is firmer than I would consider most mattresses to be, but it is fine for me. I guess if the firmness is an issue, you could put a mattress pad on it. I ordered it from Amazon instead of from T&amp;N directly because I wanted to take advantage of the deferred interest that Amazon offers on the credit card.
 This mattress is so good that I purchased an additional one for my GF, she also love it.
 Great night's sleep, even with all my chronic joint injuries and aches/pains. My husband can't believe how great it is either. Excellent sleep and we don't always agree on firmness, so it definitely suits multiple tastes and preferences. Awesome purchase, I'm so happy with this mattress.
 Thought I was getting a great mattress but was sadly mistaken. Both ends of the mattress are curved upward and not nearly as thick as the center and it is very uncomfortable to sleep on. You would think of a foam type mattress as not being bad on the back. I got better sleep on the mattress I replaced this one with and it was the worst mattress I have ever owned.
 I don’t know how to describe if it’s firm or soft, all I know is it has excellent support! Always cool feel, helped a lot when you live in warm SoCal! Just unroll and you’v Got the perfect mattress! Guaranteed!
 So far, so good. Only problem is that there is a hard place just to the edge of the middle. We figured that was where the foam joined together.
 There are a few things that you should always buy in person to check for quality.<br/><br/>Fresh fruit. Diamond rings. Cars.<br/><br/>Up until a few months ago, I would have added mattresses to that list. Wasn't that one of the morals of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears"? Most of us were taught that the moral was that a life of crime doesn't pay and you really shouldn't be sneaking into other people's houses - especially if they are bears - but another, often overlooked moral was "not every mattress will feel JUST RIGHT. Try before you buy."<br/><br/>When I saw T&amp;N's claim of a mattress with optimal comfort, I was skeptical. What worked for Mama Bear and Papa Bear wasn't what worked for Baby Bear.<br/><br/>But T&amp;N's business model intrigued me as did their pricing structure. And if their mattress didn't work out, I would return it and they would donate it to charity. Win-win.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Goldilocks was wrong. There are some mattresses that are JUST RIGHT for everyone. This is one of them. My husband and I both sleep well on our King mattress from T&amp;N. The quality is fantastic. The business model is sublime. And my bank account is happy that I didn't spend a small fortune on a bed.<br/><br/>So I guess you could say we're living happily ever after.<br/><br/>Unlike Goldilocks. Who really shouldn't have broken into the bears house.
 Very super easy to set up!  Slight odor which I expected when first opened.  It went away!<br/>Very comfortable.  No complaints
 Was nervous about buying a mattress online that had never tried.  Love it! Have had great night sleeps every night.  I am a very hot sleeper and have never felt the mattress to be hot or warming.  Would recommend, especially for the price point
 Love how the mattress supports your entire body instead of just parts of you! Feels just like the most expensive medium firm Tempurpedic mattress.<br/>It's affordable and wonderfully comfortable. We are happy, happy, happy with our purchase. Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle!
 Decided to pull the trigger and order one after reading all the reviews. My wife and I love this bed! Not too hard, didn’t smell like some people have said, and had no defects. The only downside to this mattress is that it’s hot! We will have to get something to try and make it a little cooler.
 Great bed!  Good price and shipped to the house. Easy to unpack and set up.
 We love this mattress! Best nights sleep I've gotten in ages and I've noticed my guy doesn't snore as much. We haven't had any issues with it gettiing too hot or too plush. It's literally just right. Absolutely recommend.
 It said it  was a FIRM mattress, OH IT IS NOT, :'(  so dissatisfied,
 Love it!!
 I got this mattress a little over a month ago. I like it but it is a little stiffer than I was hoping for. Overall though it's good quality for the price and doesn't need a boxspring.
 UPDATE:  $150.00 PRICE INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD!  I love my Tuft &amp; Needle Queen mattress, and thought the $600 price point was spot on. However, I did not subscribe to Tuft &amp;Needles' assessment that cost increases by $150.00 across the board were justified entirely by an increase in materials or labor. That was beyond a sizable jump in price, where the consumer will now pay for a full size mattress what the cost of a queen size was prior to 01 JUN 2017. Subtlety is not their strong suit. I do believe that the online market for affordable quality beds will reach saturation levels, and that the growing competition is forcing their hand to cash in while the market's hot. That's unfortunate to consumers, but they want a bigger profit margin. Fair enough, and good on them. I'd understand if there were incremental increases that were much easier to digest. However, that $150.00 jump was enough reason to take my business else where.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>I held my breath, crossed my fingers, kissed the talisman and threw salt over my shoulder, and all for what...the online purchase of a mattress. I read through countless reviews, and the product may average at a near-five-star rating, but it's the one or two star reviews that seem to talk me out of committing to the purchase. So in the end, I finally decided to go with a Tuft &amp; Needle queen, and what a relief it was to find such great quality and comfort on a foam hybrid. I say hybrid because it does have some type of cooling gel layer sandwiched in the foam, which is very effective. The mattress was easy to unroll, and once the plastic covering was removed...poof, ten inches of cloud nine heaven! I've only had it for a few weeks so the jury is out on it's durability, but my initial rating is a definite five stars. There is no "sinking feeling" to the foam since it is just the right amount of firmness to its pliability. As for the claim from T &amp; N that your bed mate won't feel your movement, well, that's not entirely true. However, compared to a coil mattress, the movements aren't as pronounced. I also bought a metal box spring frame (10"), and am now convinced to never go back to the traditional wooden springy ones. It is a bit pricey compared to the many five-star $100-$300 mattresses, but it was money well spent, and certainly far less expensive than mattresses in your local furniture store.
 As good a mattress, or better, than any we have purchased in the past at a MUCH better price.
 Really like the bed
 This mattress is so comfortable, and the craftmanship speaks for itself. We’ve purchased 2 and will be back for more.
 Love it. After 20 years with a quality coil spring mattress this mattress gave me incredible sleep. My 3 sons are college athletes and we bought them new beds too. Amazing difference in the quality and restful mess of sleep. Just buy it. It's worth it.
 I've been sleeping on this over a month, I love it!.  I waited over 30 days to write this review. It's soft, but has plenty of support, very comfortable for me, doesn't sag, it's great.  I think I will always buy this companies mattress, forever!
 I sleep hot. This mattress solves that while maintaining great comfort and keeping the price point down where I could buy without any regrets. Wife loves it as well, and have convinced several friends to order also.
 I was nervous about ordering a mattress online, but I am so glad I did. I have lower back pain and the new mattress has relieved about 75% of it. Unlike memory foam this foam mattress does not make me sweat and it is softly supportive.
 Tuft and Needle are the best mattresses I have slept on.  I would rate this 10 stars if I could.
 This is a excellent mattress, and the price is right!<br/>It is as advertised - feel if spring mattress, with just a little bounce<br/>yet conforms to the body.
 The mattress is thinner than we thought. It is comfortable to lay on. Hard to sit on the edge of the mattress, and have it support you as it collapses.
 Excellent mattress. Would recommend it. Love it!!  I never want to get out of bed and look forward to crawling into bed.<br/>Amazon Prime- bit of a hassle. Sent the wrong size. Then it took 6 days to get the correct mattress and it was a bit of a hassle with mutliple phone calls to get the original one picked up. Prime- I usually love because it's a 2 day delivery.
 Kids love the bouncing Bed with out spring
 Perfect fit and very comfortable! Love mattress in a box!
 Mattress comfort is a purely personal preference, so there is only so much one can say in words. We wanted a king size mattress that was comfortable and supportive but not bulky, and would go well with our streamlined modern platform bed. This mattress divers from every angle for us. We like our mattress to be on the firmer side (no pillow top and a gazillion layers of fluff for us!). For reference, we had a "firm" Simmons Beautyrest mattress before this on our queen bed that we felt was not firm enough for us. It would not be accurate to say that T&amp;N is more firm because it is all foam and hence can be depressed relatively more than the Simmons mattress with coils inside. However, it is more supportive. A better description would be that T&amp;N is more buoyant than our Simmons. As with memory foam mattresses, movements are localized so that the other person on the bed is not disturbed. We have had it for about a month now and we are happy it. Hope it stands the test of time.
 I thought a new mattress would help my neck and back pain so I bought a tuft n needle mattress. It is not as comfortable as I thought nor do I feel that it forms to my body. This one just wasn't for me. Really disappointed because I read so many great reviews which is why I finally decided to buy one as a Christmas present to my husband and I.
 My husband and I really like this mattress. It has the comfort of memory foam without making you too hot. We are using it on our queen Murphy bed and it works perfectly.  We were looking for an eco mattress and the price plus the fact it doesn't use regular memory foam sold us.
 It was firm at first and then hip and lower back pain. Im 6ft 250 lbs. athletic.
 Got it for my 23 Y/O Son and he LOVES IT!
 Love, love, love this bed.
 We ordered the king. It inflated immediately. No smell. Everything was proportioned the way it should. I'm 130lbs and back and side sleeper and my husband is 190lbs and a side or stomach sleeper. We both hate this bed. I wish I would have paid attention to the 100 days date to return. I wake up every morning feeling like my lower back is broken. When you lay on the bed it's not uncomfortable. I'm actually pretty comfortable when I first fall asleep but through the night the bed must be pressing on every pressure point. I don't know if it's just too hard or what. We just ordered a 4 inch memory foam topper to see if that will help. My husband can't sleep on his stomach or his feet get numb. I love that it's a chemical free mattress I think it's just impossible to market a one size fits all bed. Maybe adding options for softer top layers. We've had the bed for 9 months and there's no signs of indentations or wear. I'm hoping the bed itself will be a good supportive layer and then the new topper will add the cushion we need and we'll be able to have a good night's sleep again. To be clear the quality of the bed isn't the question and mattresses fit everybody differently. This one is just not right for us.
 Very comfortable with no more back issues like we had with our $2,200 matress
 The mattress dips in the middle, and exacerbates my back pain.  I terribly regret this purchase. Whenever I'm not tossing and turning from discomfort, I wake up with backaches and soreness.
 Experience was awesome! Easy and fun. Bed took a few weeks to feel soft but we love.we will purchase the topper as I want a little more padding but don't get me wrong we love this bed and concept!!
 I have been sleeping on this for about a month and feel like I slept better on my 2 year old mattress from college still. I am probably going to return it as I get back aches and feel very unrested this whole month with sleeping on this bed.
 This is a good mattress, it arrived in short time and the packaging was good. I was able to take it out of the box and open the seal quickly and it got into shape in a few hours.<br/>The only problem for me is that the mattress doesn't have any edge support, it might not be a problem for every one but for me it make the side of the bed very uncomfortable to sleep on
 Do you like sleeping like a baby and not waking up the next morning feeling like you just spent 8 hours in the ring with Mike Tyson? If the answer is yes then this mattress is for you.<br/><br/>I'm 6'4" (190lbs) and my wife is 5'7" (115lbs), we were looking for a bed to fit our needs and weight absorption/distribution was a concern. Our previous mattress was too hard, we purchased a 3" memory foam to soften the load, both had us feeling like we were getting beat up each night. My wife use to talk about her neck and my hips and lower back hurt so bad - we honestly thought it wasn't related to our mattress.<br/><br/>It wasn't until the 2-3 day of using the TN until we talked about it, we both realized we had not said one thing about our hips or neck. Since then we've been waking up feeling like we've gotten an extra hour or two of sleep and without any pain.<br/><br/>If you've got hip or lower back pain, this mattress might be just what you need. If you're on the fence, don't be, get it done. You'll thank yourself later.
 Well constructed but I prefer a softer mattress.
 I haven't slept on it, because it is in my guest bedroom.  But everybody who has so far loves it.  And it was so convenient.  Mailed to my door, with free shipping?? Can't beat that.
 I bought the twin mattress for my son.  It expanded quickly after unpacking it from the box.  There was a slight chemical smell at first - but that went away within 24 hours.  The mattress is extremely comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it.
 This is a good mattress and excellent value compared to everything else that's out there. It is just a tad bit firm for me.
 Love this mattress only thing is it is a little to firm
 This is so comfortable. I wouldn't say it is very firm. It has great support while still being soft.
 Super comfortable, super reasonably priced, and super easy to pick up in order to make the bed. Months and months of great sleep, and family members who have used it claim the same thing.
 One week review: Great to be enjoying a new, very comfortable mattress again. First time in 60 years I have not owned a mattress with springs so I was curious how these non boxspring mattresses from the Internet would do.<br/><br/>I'm not hard to please for comfort when it comes to sleeping it appeared soon after my first night on the T&amp;N Full proved. Until that first night on this dream slumber mattress proved that to be false. My old mattress needed replacement five years ago. It was bulging like a stepped on water balloon. I figured the pain  it was to buy a new crappy one from some mattress store nearby wasn't worth the effort.<br/><br/>I found a sight that sold mattresses direct online and it looked to good to be true. It even had springs and was shipped to the door for a $99 fee. With the boxspring and frame it started getting to fat over 1k. Great deal still and almost went for it. Saw this T&amp;N on Amazon with the great return policy and great price, free delivery to boot.<br/><br/>So it was fun cutting the plastic off after it came and watching it inflate. I left it alone for 3 hours to air out. Then threw on  sheets and laid on it. Oh wow, I didn't know it would be so comfortable. Perfect firmness for me, and I lay in it a lot during the day. Hope it stays just the way it is for a decade, I think they have a long guarantee against defects too just in case.<br/><br/>Ordered new platform bed to replace these old boxspring mattresses its on now. Can't wait to see how it feels then. Will update after some time has gone by.<br/><br/>UPDATE, five months later and the bed still feels like it's new. I spend a lot of time e in bed, it's like my office in a way. I couldn't be happier with this one. So comfortable I can't begin to describe it. I've had two back surgeries and this bed does not cause any pain. For 500 bucks I can't imagine finding anything better on the market. I doubt I will have to ever buy a new one again, it seems like it's well made and I'm in my 60s, so if I die in my sleep one day I will die with a smile.
 Super supportive and best bed I have ever slept on
 we have had to many mattress over the years. The last one was a sleep number we spent thousands on. TUFT &amp; NEEDLE  THE BEST 10 STARS<br/>Finally my Husband and I can get a good nights rest. Going to buy one for the RV.
 It puffed up right away and was sooooo comfy!  Price and style. can't beat it
 So we've had this mattress for...well over a month now, going on 2 months, and I wanted to wait before giving a review. So, the pros. The fact that this came to our doorstep in a box was awesome. My husband had the most fun setting it up, getting all gleeful like a kid at Christmas when it expanded after we opened the packaging. There were no weird smells and it was definitely an improvement over our old mattress.<br/><br/>We had a queen pillowtop that I had gotten on sale about 6 years ago, and it just killed us. It was way too warm, was sinking in the worst places, and I woke up every morning feeling like 80 with horrible back pain. Sleeping on this has definitely reduced back pain for us overall, and it's surprisingly comfortable for us. I love the fact we don't wake up feeling like we're being roasted over coals. It stays cool for us throughout the night. I also like that if my husband or child jump on the bed while I'm in it, I'm not flung into the air. There is relatively little issue with disturbance from movement. If my husband tosses or turns at night, I'm usually not feeling it. There's no issues with me pretty much falling into a crevice he has created either, like we had with the pillowtop, so I'm not ending up on top of him at 3 AM.<br/><br/>Now for the cons. This mattress is about 2 shades too firm for me. I am really wanting to get a topper for it. While I like the fact you're not sinking in like you would with a normal tempurpedic or memory foam, it can be difficult for me to be comfortable if my upper back is hurting (I have anxiety disorder that causes my body to clench my muscles and cause spasms). It would help a lot to have just a bit more of comfort from some softness, but having to go get a mattress topper makes me feel a little defeated in that aspect. That's why I knocked off a star, because I know it is a really big breaking point for some people.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this. I was torn between this and Ghost Bed, and chose Tuft &amp; Needle in the end because of the rave reviews of customer service and the fact that if you didn't like the mattress, you got to donate it to charity for a refund instead. That spoke volumes. I think for people that enjoy a firmer mattress and don't want to spend $3,000, this is the one for you. Great price point and the ability to donate for a refund is a fantastic idea. We sleep quite well on this and every time we have had friends over that have talked about buying a mattress, we tell them to go lie down on ours! They have laughed, but several of them have actually really liked the feel of it and were surprised when we told them what we paid for the king size.
 Absolutely love it. Called Tuft and Needle and they said thwir warranty &amp; return policy is in tact regardless of buying it from Amazon.
 This is a very comfortable bed we liked it so much we purchased 3 more for other rooms.
 Initially the mattress was very comfortable. However after a weeks sleep my body is very stiff and sore. I’m hoping it’ll get better as we break it in more.
 I don't really have much to compare it to, but it blows my old mattress away. I wake up so much easier now rather than snooze for an hour and a half like I used to, although I still don't want to get out of bed because it is comfortable now.
 Want to sleep all the time now....like a cloud.  Delivery was fast and quick.
 Outstanding mattress. I was shocked at the value I received when I slept on it. Super comfortable and firm at the same time.
 Great mattress. Very comfortable. Shipped on time. Easy setup. Best night's sleep in a long time.
 Amazing comfort and value! Five Stars!!!!
 I bought 2 mattresses from Tuft &amp; Needle.  What a great buy!  Incredible customer service, unlike any other I've ever experienced.  Highly recommend this company!
 The mattress is great!<br/>But, I paid for expedited shipping and and received my item several days later than expected at a store ten miles away; delivered by fed-ex.<br/>It's O.K. though. Love the mattress!! And, we do live in Hawaii!!<br/> Aloha,<br/>  Bruce
 Great mattress for the price! Little firm for my liking, but got a mattress topper and I’ve never slept better.
 Awesome product. Very very comfortable. Purchased it for my 88 year old mother along with Zinus easy to assemble platform.
 We ordered a king, 6 months ago, and we love it!  So glad we took the chance and ordered a bed online.
 got this for my 18 month old son he sleeps much better now i tried it and am super jealous i have to sleep on a box spring like a dog
 I am so glad I bought this mattress! First looked at it for the price. Bought it after reading the reviews, although I was a little skeptical since I'm not a fan of memory foam. I figured with a 30 day money back, why not? I new after one night it wasn't going back. The only negative, and this is minor, is that it's difficult to sit on the edge due to lack of edge support. I will be replacing all my household mattresses with Tuft &amp; Needle.
 This is a wonderful mattress. Just the right amount of softness vs. firmness.  I sleeping is a dream.  But when I sit on it, it's a little squishy.  But that's fine since the perfect sleeping-ness is the most important.
 Easy to unpack and sleeps fabulously<br/>Envy of all friends and family who dropped serious coin on inferior products
 After using Sealy and a bunch of over advertised mattresses, I am so glad I could finally buy this and be happy with it!!!<br/><br/>I don't think I'll every use any other mattress!!!<br/><br/>Note: Using this mattress with an IKEA bedd with slatted base.
 This mattress is too soft. If you like a medium firm or firm mattress this is not the mattress for you.
 Good price. Quick delivery. Easy set up ... roll out. And a good comfy product!
 I am completely obsessed with this bed. We have had it for months and we sleep so well.
 This bed is worth every penny. I haven't slept so well since I was a kid.
 Definitely taking some getting used to as this is our first bed of this type but I am sleeping well and not as sore in the morning.
 Is what it says. Pretty comfortable for us old people. Haven't compared it to others, tho. Lot better than what it replaced.
 Best mattress! Odor and chemicals free.
 I wasn't sure what to expect. I chose to get this over a traditional Jfuton. I was worried that it would be too soft compared to a pure cotton mattress. I was pleasently surprised though. This is one of the most comfortable things I've ever slept on. Its soft, yet firm. It molds to your body and supports you perfectly. Will definitely buy again when needed.
 Love mattress just wish it was thicker. Hard to finds sheets that fit this!
 Love.  Bought another one for our guest room because we love ours so much.  I wish it could be even less toxic and closer to organic.  Thank you, Tuft &amp; Needle!
 Heard this would be great for my back due to several back surgeries. Wake up everyday in excruciating pain. 😔
 Perfect Mattress!! just that, it is comfortable, and if you are going to spend 1/3 of your day sleeping better be a good quality!!
 comfortable.  easy to make . if I had a complaint it would be that it is too light,
 Great mattress! Was going to get a Casper but decided to save some money with this. Just as comfortable.
 Perfect
 Arrived on time and was very well boxed. It was very easy to unpack and set up. We did this mid afternoon and slept on it the same night. Firm but with just a slight give to make it very comfortable. Very happy with the purchase. I studied a lot on mattresses on SleepLikeTheDead .com and got quite an education. It's a very helpful site to learn all about all brands of mattresses. I decided that because of this company and they're guarantee I couldn't go wrong. Buying a name brand like Sealy or Sleep Number is going to run you at least 3-4 times as much and more to come close to something that might last 8-10 years. I could replace this one with another of the same in five years and buy another and still be way ahead. But I don't think that will be the case based on the feel, the product quality, the company warranty and service and all the reviews I read. And now, GOOD NIGHT!
 Umm... Okay.  I had a pillow top mattress for years.  Decided I needed an upgrade and bigger bed, looked and looked.  Bought this bed in a King Size because of all the reviews.  I was quite shocked when it came to my house because it was not very deep.  It is very very firm, not comfortable.  My last bed was too soft, now this bed is way way way way way too firm... Not really happy with it.  I have heard other customers have gotten a memory foam topper, but I feel since I paid $750 (yes, I bought it a few days before the PRICE DROPPED), that I shouldn't have to pay even more money for a topper.  Delivery was convenient and quick.  But mattress quality is sub-par and uncomfortable.  My boyfriend has been sleeping on our old bed ever since.. Trying to decide if I should get a topper (spending more money, grrrrr) or return it.<br/><br/>----UPDATE, after reviewing I was contacted by Tuft and Needle, they extended an offer to reimburse for the purchase of a mattress topper for a little extra comfort.  I did, and I have been pleased with the comfort ever since!  Thank you.
 I bought this for the guest room and it has now ended up in the master bedroom all the company raved about it.
 Good quality. Has been slept on for a few months and has softened very slightly but has not lost any comfort or support. My only complaint is queen size mattress is slightly smaller than queen size bed frame. Not a huge deal to me or my specific frame, but could be an issue for others.
 The only upside is that I can afford a Queen since other companies are too expensive for me. Overall this bed was a massive disappointment!! Way to firm, my back is killing me! Sending back. Tuft &amp; Neddle more like Tough &amp; Needle! Mom Jokes coming in STRONG! :’D
 This is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! I'm sleeping much better now that I've switched from my old spring mattress. Highly recommended!
 So far this bed has been better than I could have imagined! Loving it! I'm very curious about how it will hold up over a couple years, but either way, you can't beat the price! Great buy and highly recommended!
 I was very nervous about ordering a bed online but the experience has been great! I ordered this mattress after doing a lot of research on several different brands. I was torn between this and the Casper but this ended up being cheaper and had consistently better reviews. Mostly I did not want to go to one of the dozen mattress stores in my town and be berated to spend $5000 by a pushy salesman. I ordered a king size and it showed up fairly quickly. The package is very, very heavy as it is pretty compacted so I recommend having someone help you move it. Getting it out of the package was easy enough as was unrolling and cutting the plastic wrap off so it could expand.  My husband and I have slept on it for several nights now and it is extremely comfortable. I like a very firm, comfortable bed which this is. My husband likes a firm bed less so but he still find this very comfortable as it conforms to your body nicely. There was a bit of odor to the bed when we unwrapped it but I personally like that new smell. It faded in a couple days. We use a bed frame that uses slatted rails with this mattress and we do not use a box spring. You can use a box spring but I like the low profile. Of course only time will tell how the bed holds up to any dipping or becoming misshapen. If that happens this will be updated.
 It's been three weeks since I have had this mattress.  So far, I like it.  I would have liked it to be a bit firmer.  Other than that,  it's good.
 They hit a home run with this bed. It was like sleeping on a cloud.Shipped fast, expanded quickly and was very affordable.
 Just as good as reviews claimed it to be. Set up was literally just opening the package
 Seem to be good for back or stomach sleepers but to firm for side sleepers. Hip and neck hurts some mornings. It shipped fast and didn’t smell/easy to set up.
 I've been suffering from back pain quite a while sleeping on some cheap coil mattress that bought from Costco. Mt back pain is literally gone. oh my god. this is the best buy ever.
 I sleep on it well. The mattress looks to be of high quality materials.
 Love it!! ready to use in just a couple hours of opening box and airing out. Super comfortable, very happy with this purchase
 No regrets.  I reviewed T&amp;N against other mattresses for over a year and I kept coming back to the idea of purchasing the T&amp;N mattress. I've tried many other mattresses and I was ready for something innovative and practical.  No more box springs, no more pillow tops, no air.  So far, I am very pleased with the mattress and have a 100 day "no like, just return" but it seems like I will be keeping this for a long while.
 What a difference the is bed makes. This is the best one I have ever had. Six of my friends bought this same mattress, and they finally convinced me to buy one. Now I regret waiting so long. haven't slept this great, or felt so great in years.
 Not too good, at least for me
 My teenage son loves his mattress.
 So far this bed has been fabulous. I am excited to see how it holds up over time.
 What a difference this new mattress has meant!  I'm now sleeping comfortably through the night &amp; waking up without aches &amp; pains.  The mattress was delivered on time &amp; it was packed well.  I highly recommend this product &amp; company.  The only downside with ordering on the Internet was that I was responsible for getting rid of my old mattress; but, the product &amp; price were much better than I could have gotten locally.
 Skeptical about buying a mattress online, but, so far, glad I did.  It is a very firm mattress that works well on my adjustable platform bed.
 Comfortable at first. Does not last nearly as long as a Casper.
 I was a little scared buying a mattress online but with all the reviews raving about how awesome this mattress was I had to give it a try, I have slept on this mattress now for about 2 weeks and have to say best purchase of the new year so far!
 I love it. Wish I had ordered the 12" model. But still love it.
 Comfortable, well made, and a great value. I bought the king after testing out a queen in the guest room for a few months. I will be buying more in the near future for the kids.
 Great quality mattress for the price
 I can't believe how much I love this bed. It is incredible. It feels alive, just enough bounce, and does not suck you into it like other foam toppers or beds.
 Best mattress we've ever slept on!  We had back and hip pain on our 1200 dollar mattress that was supposed to fix those issues.  Within a week of using this mattress those problems virtually disappeared.  I have recommended this mattress to everyone I know.
 On the firm side, but I like that for my back. Zero complaints so far. Packaging could have been better.
 returned, super hard. good return policy
 A bit on the firmer side, which I love. Super comfy, super affordable!
 Very nice bed. I'll never go to a mattress store again.
 All I can say is, I love my mattress!  And I'm glad I did my research.  I watched several review and comparison videos before deciding on one.  If I had any complaint at all, it's a little on the firm side.
 This mattress exceeds all my expectations and is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on
 I tried to stick with this mattress, but it’s been over a year and my back/hips are actually worse upon wakening each morning after a night on our T&amp;N king mattress. Looking for alternatives to our $750+ investment. Not a happy sleeper here!
 The box arrived in a shocking state, torn with sizable holes, tape hanging off, badly stained, but the mattress inside was thankfully still fine. Once unwrapped it expanded within seconds. So far so good, but maybe a little bit softer than expected, especially if closer to the edges.
 I Actually bought this mattress and the 10" Queen.  We only have 1 bedroom, so this one is for guests in our living room, and the Queen is for me.  So this came yesterday and I couldn't wait to try it out.  It's amazing.  Today is the first morning in ages that I woke up without aches and pinches everywhere.  Now, to be fair, my old mattress is so far gone that my couch feels decent.  But I seriously can't wait until my new Queen comes in.<br/>___<br/>So, I received my 10" Queen a couple weeks ago, and let me tell you, I have never slept better.  In fact, the first morning I overslept.  Oops! It's like sleeping on a cloud every night.  A glorious, supportive cloud.  I wake up refreshed no matter what position I'm in, and I tend to change position often. On my old mattress I would lay down and just immediately hurt (it was that far gone). I am so happy with my purchase I've told everyone about these. You need one, you won't be sorry!<br/>Oh, and did I mention that it's also nice and cool? I have a foam pillow that's all sweaty that I used to like until I got this.<br/>Now if they would make a pillow, I would really be in heaven.
 Reduced snoring . Comfy.
 I seldom write reviews, but I am so astonished by all of the positive reviews for this mattress that I felt compelled to share my experience. I've had this mattress for about a year and a half. Although my boyfriend immediately disliked it (too soft, not enough support), I convinced myself that it was a good purchase for about the first three months. The bed was comfortable but had some firmness to it, which I wanted for my lower back pain. As the months went by, however, I noticed that the bed was not holding its firmness. I rotated the mattress in the hope of preserving it, but before long, I started to feel no matter which way I rotated it that center was sinking more than the outer edges. I also noticed that my back pain became MUCH more pronounced. It wasn't until I spent a week at my sister's home sleeping on one of her cheapish -- and much more supportive -- Costco beds that I noticed that my back pain had gotten much better. I came home and slept on my T&amp;N, and my back started hurting once again. Recently, I've switched out my T&amp;N mattress for one of my older innerspring guest beds, and my back pain has gotten better again. Im done with my T&amp;N mattress. Perhaps this bed is comfy for some, but I'm really disappointed that I spent $600 on something that I used for 1.5 years and that has contributed so much to my lower back pain. I wont be getting another box mattress ever again.
 Great value,  great sleep but runs hot sometimes sleeping.
 OMG!!! what a great nights sleep we have sine we purchased the 3 sets of these mattresses.  We are spreading the word!
 My husband and I spent our first night on our Tuft &amp; Needle king size mattress! Very comfortable, did wake up a little sore could be just a matter of acclimating to it. Happy with delivery, look, watching it unroll. Hopefully will wake up less sore tomorrow!
 Side sleeper who no longer tosses and turns, arms never fall asleep and my back is comfortable!
 Super comfortable mattress, it's well made and is packaged in an easy open way, simply unroll it and cut the plastic off.  There is a slight odor when first opened, but it dissipated quickly, within a day or two.  I bought two of these, one for each kid, and would but it again in the future.
 My husband and I were incredibly skeptical about purchasing a mattress over Amazon but after all the great reviews, we decided to take the risk! It came in a super compact box....and we thought "how could this fit a queen size mattress?!" It was vacuum sealed. Have had the bed for 3 months now, still love it!
 Loving this product.  20 days in and no complaints.
 LOVE. IT!!!!!  This product is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!  No smell, easy delivery, quick to set up, wonderful to sleep on.  No pain in the morning,  I don't even feel any movement when my husband comes to bed or gets up during the night.  If you are on the fence about buying this, take the leap.  You will be EXTREMELY happy you did!
 Not a fan. I found the mattress uncomfortable and even worse after a few weeks. The top layer completely flattens and provides neither comfort or support. May as well be laying on the floor. Two stars because it can at least be improved by a real memory foam topper of at least 3 inches.<br/>This was a regrettable purchase.
 Was too firm by itself. Put a $150 topper from Costco on it and it's perfect. I love the concept of mattress in a box, especially the no-hassle return policy. I will never go back to a coil mattress again.
 This mattress is so comfortable! I’ve been sleeping on it for a couple weeks on the ground until we get a bed frame and I’ve had no issues. I like firm mattresses but have had back pain in the past. No problems so far!
 Rating solely on the mattress, so far it's been great and slept very well, not hot at all. On the shipping, I ordered it with two-day. Unfortunately, an entire day was spent sending the mattress to be shipped, so instead of sleeping on a mattress, I had to use the floor for two nights since it was supposed to be there on a Friday. Less than ideal, but product is very nice
 excellent bed for side sleeper like me. even feels great laying flat. I put this baby in our travel trailer and BOY are we happy with it! we currently sleep on a tempurpedic and i can honestly say T&amp;N is just as good. Boy do I feel like a sucker...
 This is an amazing mattress. It unfurled quickly and was able to be slept on right away. I didn't experience any unusual odors or anything like that. Love this mattress. Cushy and comfortable.
 So good. This mattress is on the firm side, but in the best way, I feel supported and hugged by the bed all at once, and I've come from pillowtops and traditional spring mattresses that require a flip. This is a welcome departure from that. It feels and looks like it'd cost more, but then you realize you've just been paying more for what should cost less.
 I had this mattress in my guest room and liked it so much, I ordered one for the master bedroom! It unfolds easily and doesn't have a strong smell as some foam mattresses do.
 She doesn't like anything.<br/>Bought it for a flexible bed to mechanically raise head and foot. Wanted light mattress so as not to have to fight to lift it. Very light and apparently quite comfortable. Great customer service.
 Very comfortable.
 Great mattress!
 We were looking for a mattress for awhile.<br/>When we saw this mattress we liked how it feels and the price was fair. Decided give it a try.<br/>It came 2 days later. It did have very strong smell but it went away in 2 days. The mattress is very comfortable, quality is very good. Thinking to buy another mattress.
 Beautiful mattress. Unfortunately i believe it is causing me mid to upper back pain..its almost like its a little too soft and sags...I really want this mattress to work.I believe in the company .I bought the product baised on that. Is it possible I have a defective product? Or is it not defective and just not the mattress for me..already gave away old bed..dont know what to do..
 This bed is unbelievably comfortable. It sprung into shape very quickly and had minimal smell the first day. We have only had this for one week...so I cannot comment on how it holds up long-term. So far I am extremely happy with this mattress.
 feels amazing! I love this bed. My boyfriend and I have bought this bed twice for our apartments
 Still getting used to it but it is very comfortable.  I was expecting it to be too soft, but it is almost too firm.  Great price!
 Mattress seems ok as of right now. I  do not weigh a lot. 136 pounds. It is really firm for me and I do not sink into the mattress at all.  My husband is much heavier than I and he really sinks into it to the point that it is difficult for him to roll over. He seems to like it but it has not resolved the shoulder pain that he gets when sleeping either. I wake up really sore every morning but am hoping that I get used to it. We are both side sleepers. I also have degenerated disk disease in my L5 S1 and I bought this mattress based on reviews hoping that it would help my pain a little. I also bought this mattress 6 days before thanksgiving received it on Monday before and on thanksgiving it went on sale for 150 dollars cheaper than I purchased it for. Neither Amazon or Tuft and Needle gave a crap. They just basically said too bad for you and your bad timing and if you want it for a better price to return it and order it again. I am going to keep it for a few more days and see if I wake up pain free at some point. Mainly because we already disposed of our other mattress and have to have something to sleep on. If not I will be returning it and going with Purple.  Right now I am not convinced that it was worth the 760 something bucks I had to pay for it.
 It felt great I had the best sleep I’ve had in a long while on my new Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. I woke up feeling refreshed.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a new mattress  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 bought one for my guest room and sent one to my brother for his birthday after sleeping at a friends house GREAT
 This mattress is great. It comes in a box that you can lift up flights of stairs with (I've hoisted it up to the 4th floor). It's not too heavy. The mattress inflates within a matter of seconds. I let it breathe over a span of 2-3 days and there was no scent to the mattress.
 So many positive reviews...I still wake with a backache.
 Love it, wish I would have ordered the more firm one
 We now own our second T&amp;N mattress as we upgraded from a Queen to a King. No complaints whatsoever. Easy to do business with, easy to "install" (lay it down and cut it open) and most importantly it's very, very comfortable.  Originally switched over from a Serta memory foam and the T&amp;N is just as comfortable while also noticeably cooler than the Serta.
 This mattress was very easy to purchase, we received it on time and it has been very comfortable and has met our expectations.  I would recommend it to anyone who thinks that spending $2,000 on a mattress is ridiculous, but still wants a great sleep.  This mattress is very comfortable and the price was amazing!
 Very comfortable and easily takes the place of a traditional mattress. I’ve been sleeping on it for three weeks and definitely feel more rested in the morning!
 I was so eager to get a good night sleep, and after the reviews of this mattress I expected to get exactly that. For the 4 weeks after receiving it, however, my husband and I both woke with gigantic Knots in our lower back. We're in our early 30's and do not have chronic back pain. To confirm the mattress was the issue, we spent the night at the brand new Full Service Marriott up the street for 3 nights. Guess what...NO BACK PAIN! Take your chances if you wish, but my advice is to protect your sleep with something different.
 We already have 2 beds with Tuft and Needle mattresses and love them. When it was time to get mattresses for the twin beds in a guest bedroom of course we ordered Tuft &amp; Needle!
 One night with it and we love it!  Amazing that a king mattress came in the mail!!
 The absolute best mattress ever. We even purchased the tuft and needle pillows to go along. Definitely recommend.
 Best price on a Made in the USA mattress in a box out there. Super comfortable, transfers very little motion. I know a mattress is a personal thing but my family has loved our T&amp;N
 So far so good. We bought 2 twins to make a king mattress. I'm definitely sleeping better then I was on the old spring mattress we had. It hasn't lost its firmness either! I will update if we notice any changes.
 Best night of sleep for the first time in ages
 REALLY FIRM!!!!!!
 A little firm for my liking but overall a great value. Made moving in to my city apartment a breeze.
 My adult son has had this bed about a year &amp; still says it's the best mattress he's ever slept on!
 Delivery was right on time, and the bed is unbelievably comfortable. I tend to like more of a soft mattress, so I was worried after reading a few reviews that this mattress would be too firm - but it really is perfect! Truly is my favorite hello and hardest goodbye!
 i really like it so far - feels soft, but sleeps firm.  no more back problem when i get up in the morning.
 I hated this bed at first.... 3 months later I'm SO glad we kept it. It took awhile for me to get use to it but I sleep amazing now. Great product!! Would recommend to anyone.
 bed was very easy to set up and shipped as advertised.  sadly the mattress is way to firm. i tend to sleep on my side and was very uncomfortable sleeping on this mattress.
 This mattress KILLS my back.  If I sleep on my side it hurts my lower back!  If I sleep on my back it hurts my upper back.  If I stay in bed more than 5 hours I can't walk when I get up!  PLEASE don't buy this mattress !!!
 woke up with extreme lower back pain the 2 nights I tried it.
 We had a 16 yr old  temperpedic mattress that was sagging. This mattress is firm and wonderful, very comparable to our temperpedic at a much better price. I hope it holds up for as long. We have had it about 2 weeks and we are sleeping wonderfully!
 It took a while to get use to the firmness, but I don't want to get out of bed now. :)
 Can't say enough great things about this bed. Price is awesome and comfort is beyond any mattress we have purchased in the past.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
 I wasn’t a big fan of the foam type besides the health benefits. I love this mattress have no pains or any aches it rebounds quick not hot to sleep. LOVE IT!!
 Best mattress I have ever had.  Well worth the money.
 I’ve had this queen mattress for a full year now and I don’t regret it one bit. I’ve gotten a wonderful year of peaceful sleep. Seriously couldn’t recommend this one more. Squishy enough to be comfortable but stable enough that you don’t sink in.
 I loved the service. It was easy to unload however the bed is very very firm. I read that it takes time to break in but I'm not sure I can wait. I am not sure to such firmness on my back. I loved the price and only hope it gets better.
 Absolutely love my Tuft &amp; Needle bed. I've been sleeping on it for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints. It's the perfect mix of material. The customer service team at T&amp;N is top notch. Very satisfied with my purchase, will certainly use them again.
 Love this---No weird smell:) let it air out a few hours just to be safe!
 I am sleeping better I couldn't afford thousands for a mattress this is great plus the price can't be beat.
 The first days my wife found it too firm, but after few weeks we love it. My back pain disappeared.
 It only took one night on this mattress to conclude I'm in love! I wish I hadn't waited so long to to purchase. Simply put, this bed is incredibly comfortable, and I don't know how anyone couldn't love it!
 I never wake up stiff or sore anymore (even at 9 months pregnant, which is saying a lot!). My husband was extremely skeptical (he loves classic, very firm mattresses) but he loves this mattress as much as I do. The reviews aren't wrong. Buy it! You will not be disappointed.
 Just like others have said, this was great to start, but after about a year starts leaving you sore. Buyer beware.
 This is my second Tuft and Needle mattress in the past year.  The first one I purchased as part of relocating to a new town, before my furniture arrived. It comes in a box much smaller than expected - but the queen size bed, while packaged pretty small is still heavy, and you should make sure you have help getting it in and up any stairs.  Once you open it, it starts "gassing off" (expanding/growing from the compact size smaller than a twin mattress to its final queen size).  The next day it's ready to be slept on.  I was very comfortable sleeping on this bed until the rest of my furniture arrived.  I decided to get another Tuft and Needle mattress for my guest room - I've had 2 rounds of visitors and they say they slept extremely well and were very comfortable on the bed.  Note: T&amp;N sleeps firm - you wouldn't necessarily know it was a foam mattress as you don't sink. I didn't want a soft foam mattress as apparently it can be hard to turn over or get out of bed - the T&amp;N is firm enough that this isn't an issue.<br/><br/>In short: I'm happy enough I've purchased 2 of these in 12 months - and my guests report sleeping very well on this mattress during their visits
 Takes about a week or two to get used to but I am partial to a firmer matress. Made me think of a hotel bed at first which is typically firm, but you can fall asleep easily
 After sleeping on a traditional Japanese Shikifuton for a decade I needed something less firm to sleep on after developing sciatic nerve issues after losing a lot of weight.  I ordered the 10 inch in Full as I was afraid the 5 inch would still be too firm and people had complained about that in other reviews.  I feel like I made the right choice.  I am sleeping better and longer without sciatic pain.  The mattress feels like tempurpedic I have slept on at a friends without out the heat retention but also springier and super supportive. Really liking it.  Highly recommend the 10 inch to side sleepers.  It unpacked and expanded within 2 hours instead of two days and there was absolutely no chemical smell whatsoever.  Fits perfect on my Ikea Malm platform bed.
 Too hot, not comfortable, my back hurts every morning. Plus how are you supposed to return it?
 This product is perfect. It isn't too soft like a memory foam neither too hard like a latex. The best thing is that it's not make you feel hot like non-gel memory foam.
 So far so good.  Had tempurpedic for 8 years. It was novel and nice at first but failed at 8 years. This bed is better at less than half the cost. It is not too soft or too hard and does not feel like quicksand as did the tempur. See how it holds up but if lasts only 5 or 6 years will be worth it for me.
 From the very first night we have loved sleeping on this
 Too firm for my liking. Wish I could return it. It's been 6 months.
 Soft to sit on, firm to lay on, breathes nicely, so no sweaty spots, doesn't suck you in and hold you there like memory foam, perfectly smooth.<br/>Best sleep I've had in years.
 After sleeping on this for the last three days, I think that the mattress leans towards being more medium than medium-firm. It's been a great bed for the price. I'll update this with time.
 Wonderful comfortable mattress. My only complaint was it took a long time ship.
 This mattress caused me debilitating back pain. I gave it a lot of time, thinking I would get used to it and would begin to feel better. The back pain did not go away. I gave up and purchased a different mattress and my back is better now. Unfortunately, I had given it too much time and Amazon won't take it back anymore. If you buy this mattress, don't buy it here, buy it from Tuft &amp; Needle directly since they give you more time to return it. It might be the right mattress for some people, but definitely not for those prone to back pain.
 Bought the twin size for my 4 year old daughter. It was super easy to open and ready within minutes. Very comfortable bed, my daughter loves it!
 AWESOME bed. Super comfortable, and brings wonderful sleeps!
 Be sure to give the mattress a few days to settle. It's been packed up a while and will fill stiff initially.
 Loved that it is shipped right to us. Pretty easy to get into place and open up. You want the mattress pretty much in place when you unroll it. We have been sleeping very well!
 Very firm. We replaced a Tempurpedic memory foam that was much softer. Maybe a topper will help.<br/><br/>Quality is there tho.
 We love this mattress! Couldn't be happier with Tuft &amp; Needle's customer service or product. I contacted their support on the chat feature online and the lady was so amazing, helped me with my selection and answered all my questions with enthusiasm. The mattress itself is really great, not too hard or soft and everyone who's slept on it says the same, it makes for a great nights sleep!
 Perfect for my guest room!
 Does what it says, and it's a good price.
 Comfortable but my home smells like glue.
 The best sleep I have had in a decade man what a mattress. It is heavenly you nailed it.
 Great mattress! Sleeping better, its quiet and cooler and no transfer of motion! We are a larger couple and this mattress serves us well! Buy it, they have a great guarantee!
 I have the lumbar disc herniation, I have been sleeping on it for two weeks, it hasn't been hurting at all.
 Great bed for the price. Not sure how it will last though. Time will tell.
 uncomfortable and small for a twin XL
 I have found it to be very comfortable. It has worked very well as an adjustable mattress.
 The mattress for me and my wife was just too firm so we returned it. Thanks to Amazon for making the return a breeze.
 Not too soft or too hard, just right for basically any kind of sleeping (side, back, stomach).
 I’ve had this over a month and I love it.  From the beginning it’s been awesome !!
 Incredibly comfortable and has maintained integrity (we've had it for about 5 months now.)
 When you first unwrap it its incredibly soft and it takes a while to fully firm up, but after a few days it was perfect. We've had it for months now and it was well worth the price.
 sleeping great
 I have reviewed this product on multiple sites. LOVE my mattress and the pillows. No more neck-pain.
 The mattress is supposed to be 72" wide and I purchased a Cal King frame from Amazon that is the same width.  Mattress arrives and I am shocked at how "small" the box is.  Follow directions and it expands, and expands, and expands.  Reaches full size but I notice it doesn't cover the entire frame.  I measure the frame, 72". Measure the mattress 69".  Check it all again.  Not sure how/why the mattress is too short in width.  Decide it may still be "expanding"  Let it go overnight and check everything next day.  Frame still at 72" and mattress at 69".  This isn't going to work.  May sound like not a big deal but 1" overhang (metal frame) is asking for shin bruises every night! :)  Called Amazon and they took care of it.  Only slept on mattress for 1 night but afraid to order another one as I don't want the same issue.  Tried to upload a video to show this but that's not working for some reason.  Hopefully this was a one off mistake but will spend a bit more time window shopping before making a decision.
 We have only spelt one night on the mattress and already love it! It's comfortable, breathable, and I woke up for the first time with no back and neck pain. It was very easy to set up and
 I was a former tempur pedic mattress owner for 12 years, and for 1/4 the price, I am sleeping even better than before. I have told all my friends how much I love this mattress!  Thank you for making such a quality product so affordable! !O:-) :-) :-) :-$ :-$ :-$
 Love this mattress so much I’ve noticed great sleep and back pain relief
 So far we love it! It's a perfect combination of soft and firm. It doesn't suck you in like memory foam (which I hate).
 I'm sleeping better than I've slept in a long time.
 So I had used cheap brands which I have no idea of the brand until I can feel the coils, to Tempurpedic (2-3 models) and recently started to look around again.  I recall Tempurpedic was nice but is expensive and began to sag too much to point that I wake up in the morning with pain.  I did not think they lasted long enough for what I paid so was about to buy in a Mattress store.  The sales rep said things I didn't trust so I moved onto to searching online.<br/><br/>I am 43 yr old 5' 8" 155ish lbs and sleep mainly on my back.  I think I roll on my sides in attempts to get more comfortable.  I started by trying the Layla (both soft and firm sides for 3-4 weeks each) and found both to be comfortable but I still woke up with low back pain.  I moved onto this T&amp;N mattress since there was a deal.  It wasn't on my radar as my next choice to test.  It was similar to Layla but I still woke up with pain.  It sleeps fine and I don't feel it's too warm.  I don't really care about responsive, bounce, end support, etc.. since main focus is just reduced or no low back pain.  I believe I prefer a firm mattress so returned this through Amazon Special Handling Dept and it was a breeze.
 Bad product...it’s not as advertised. Not firm and sinks in within 30 day. Wait whole 90 days to test it out and now realized that our return window is also closed...hence stuck with it, will be putting it the crub side tomorrow.
 If it had 10 stars that's what I'd have given. Awesome. Easy to set up and super comfy.
 Even the unboxing was neat. I imagine the more expensive beds are softer. I am pretty average 5' 11" 190-200 lbs and it is perfect for me.  I also live in AZ so the heat dissipation is a bonus.
 This mattress created more pressure points on my ribs and hips.  I spent a month not getting adequate sleep and unfortunately I'm returning this.  I was really looking forward to liking this mattress, but it just wasn't for us.
 Sleeps fine. No issues.
 awsome bed.
 hard as a rock
 Comfortable and supportive. First time my husband and I have both liked the mattress
 This is the best most comfortable mattress I have ever owned, and I've had quite a few over the years.  (I move a lot and usually have to buy a new mattress every time.)
 Bed is fine.  Gets a little warm but very comfortable
 Can't say enough as to how good this is. Before I bought it, someone from T&amp;N contacted me, I would truly like someone to do so again as I have a great marketing idea to give them.
 Excellent bed. Easy to unfold and use. All you need is a foundation, or platform-frame. The bedding is made in Phoenix, AZ - USA, so the purchase supports neighbors and community.
 Super comfortable, I will buy these mattresses again and again
 I ordered my second T&amp;N mattress in mid December for the Murphy Bed in my guest room.  Our guests loved it almost as much as we love the one in our master bedroom.  Today I have ordered my 3rd mattress shipped to my son for his apartment.  I guess you can see I LOVE THIS BED!!!  Thank you Fosbrooke for making such a great product at a reasonable price.
 I love my new mattress!  Don't know why I waited so long.
 absolutely the best mattress I have slept on, my back pain is gone and I am getting more hours of restful sleep
 I bought this mattress for my adult daughter and she loved it so much that my younger daughter asked me to buy her the same mattress.  This is a very comfortable mattress and the quality for the price can not be beat!  It's not as rigid as my snugglepedic mattress, but both of the girls prefer a softer mattress.
 I really wanted to love this mattress and for the most part I do. I bought it to replace a 10+ year old spring mattress that was causing me back pain. After reading so many reviews from people saying it gave them immediate relief, i was sad to learn that that wasn't the case for me. I'm still waking up with a stiff back. It is comfortable but its just too firm. I don't want to return it because as a base its a great bed but it just needs some added softness. Now i'm unsure which pricey mattress topper to get...
 This mattress is so beyond comfortable. It’s firm but not too firm. It’s perfect. We had no strange chemical smell like some reviews said. It expanded to fill size almost instantly after opening the plastic seal. Super easy and quick to get together. We love it!
 Too soft!!!! However the warranty and return policy was amazing!! I donated my mattress I didn’t like. I felt bad but honestly for me it was too soft to sleep comfortably on it.
 My guests said the bed is dangerously comfortable! So I tried it too and they’re right! I added a memory foam top and zzzzzzzz.
 I wasn't sure about this mattress the first few days, but now I absolutely LOVE it! I think it just took a few days to get used to it and break it in or something. This mattress is so comfortable and just the right amount of firm. My husband and I are both getting much better sleep and waking up without an achy back is a plus! This was also a very affordable mattress. Ships in 2 days with Prime and came in a nicely packaged box. It sprung right open when we unpacked it and viola! It was so easy. Best mattress ever!
 Firstly, let me make it clear that I used this for almost the full 100 days.  Secondly, let me also make it clear that, despite what the manufacturer keeps claiming on their replies and in the listing, this company's refund policy is NOT honored by Amazon, which has been confirmed by multiple staff.  More on that terrible experience at the end.<br/><br/>So, unboxing and setup was easy and simple as I would expect.  Expanded to full size by the end of the day.  At first, it felt a little too firm, but obviously it would take some time to break in.  Eventually, I felt like it felt just fine.  It still felt a little firm, but it was something I figured I'd just get used to. (for those who don't realize, this is actually slightly firmer than the average "universal" mattress such as Leesa or Casper).  I slept on it fine for a couple months, but eventually I started waking up with major back pains to the point where I would wake up early and then HAVE to get up because the pain wouldn't allow me to go back to sleep.  I eventually chose to ATTEMPT return this (again, more on this at the end), and then decided to replace it with a Brooklyn Bedding #BestMattressEver (yes, that's the name).  The difference was immediately obvious.  It was a little more expensive, but the fact that it's slightly softer AND has a top padding layer (the free extras, like 2 pillows, during their promotion didn't hurt, either) made this feel so much better.  I haven't woken up with back problems since.<br/><br/>I'm sure this mattress is great for plenty of people (obviously its different for everyone as we all prefer different softness/firmness), but it just wasn't for me.<br/><br/>So now on to the big issue, the return.<br/><br/>So, I called up Amazon Customer Support to attempt to get a refund.  First, they obliged me with the return, however I had to spend a good 20 minutes trying to explain to the support rep that, not only did I not have the original box, but it would be physically impossible to place it back in that box even if I had.  Eventually, she transferred me to another department (bulk shipping or something like that), who told me to buy a mattress box on Amazon, box up the mattress, and then to call back to finish the refund process once this was done so that they could set up a time for UPS to pick it up.  I did exactly that.  HOWEVER, upon calling them the next week, the rep informed me that they actually don't accept refunds on mattresses and even referenced the 100 day guarantee that was mentioned on this item's listing, saying that this was not something that they could honor due to Amazon's own refund policies on mattresses.  Needless to say, I demanded to talk to someone else because obviously someone was either lying or misinformed.  The person I then talked to confirmed what this rep had said:  They don't take refunds on mattresses (unless unopened), regardless of the different manufacturer's claims of refund policies.  THANKFULLY, they said that they would offer me a one-time exception due to my nearly a decade of Prime membership.  So while I did get some of my money back, this is clearly not something that will happen for many others (based on reviews, others have also had return/refund problems).  Not to mention I still had to go through with buying a massive box (not cheap, btw), breaking my back trying to get the mattress INTO the box, and then arguing with various people just to get the refund that both this listing AND the company claim they do.  Also, they still refused to take the mattress back and the local charities here don't take Queen size mattresses.<br/><br/>So, thanks, Tuft &amp; Needle. I now have a Queen size mattress sealed in a box sitting in my living room that I now have to figure out how to get rid of.  If I didn't have to deal with such a bad refund experience, I'd have probably given it 4 stars since it was still a good mattress despite not being for me.
 NOT firm - between medium &amp; soft.  I bought a T&amp;N a couple years back and it’s much firmer.
 Love this mattress!! Feels so soft to the touch but as soon as you lay on it it's full of support!! The price was much better than similar mattresses that I have researched. We purchased the king size. Fits the frame perfectly and we ate sleeping so much better than we were before! No more back aches in the morning!
 Love this mattress!!! Great quality and comfort. No complaints.
 I suffer from a back injury from a car wreck and I had high hopes that this mattress would be the one for me but it isn't. It's too hard. Only gave it 3 stars because my husband likes the bed and finds it comfortable.
 This mattress has gone from acceptably firm, and generally comfortable, to so awful that I currently have to sleep on the couch while we shop for a new bed. I was quite happy for the first six months to a year I had this product, but then it started sagging on my side of the bed and developing spots where it's much less firm. I weigh around 175 lbs, so it's not as if I'm abnormal either. I roll into my stomach occasionally during sleep, and this mattress sags so much that my stomach is essentially much lower than either my head or my feet, which generates extreme back pain.<br/><br/>Frankly, I understand their shortened return policy now. They know their product doesn't last, and basically say as much while excusing it with marketing language.<br/><br/>I'm writing this at 3:59 am from my couch because after attempting to let the foam recover and not sleeping on it for a couple weeks, and then going back tonight, I was awakened with back pain to the point where I could barely bend over.<br/><br/>This is my second memory foam mattress. The first suffered from the same issues, and I assumed it was just too cheap and thus lower quality. Well, it turns out this product is also poor quality and not built to last. I deeply regret buying this bed.
 Very nice mattress – vary happy so far using it with my new Classic Brands Adjustable Heavy Duty Metal Bed Frame/Mattress Foundation also purchased here on Amazon. Fits nicely on the frame and bends easily to fit the frame when I raise the head.
 As bad is amazing I feel like I get a better nights sleep now I feel well rested in the morning
 As a gift to my daughter, she is living it.
 We bought this mattress for my Mother and she loves it.  So comfy she sleeps right through the night.
 Nice, comfortable mattress from the first night.
 My wife and I have been sleeping on this mattress for about 6 months now.  Gotta say I'm pretty impressed.  I'm a side sleeper mostly and used to wake up a few times a night with my hip or arm asleep.  Never happens with this mattress.  Very rarely do I wake up stiff and if I do it's mostly my neck from an awkward pillow position.  My wife also sleeps noticeably better and says she has much less pain as well.  It's nice that one of us waking up or moving around doesn't wake the other one up anymore.<br/><br/>I would say this is a pretty firm mattress, but it's still soft on top.  I don't feel like I really sink in.  I'd describe it more like there is some give at your pressure points.  Overall, it's firm but comfortable.<br/><br/>Unpacking it was a pretty painless affair.  The box was heavy and mine was broken open on the bottom (needs more than paper tape to keep it closed).  Fortunately, the mattress was wrapped tightly in two layers of plastic, so no damage.  I cut it open and it took shape after about 10 minutes.  I still gave it a full night and day to get situated though.<br/><br/>I wanted to wait a while before writing my reviews I be sure I liked and nothing changed. After 6 months I don't regret buying this at all.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive mattress.
 Like this product so far. Easy to unbox and set up. Would give 5 stars but delivery took way longer than expected and then the company missed the window.
 Very comfortable, but slides around on the platform a bit too easily.
 Hey All,  So far I like it. Only problem is, not your fault. I liked it fine with no topper. She thought it was to hard. I think she should have waited longer. Either way, we got the topper today and are trying it tonight. Thanks again Carl and Roni
 Very comfortable
 Never slept better! We can actually change the contour sheet with ease. Thank you!
 I love this style of bed.  So much more comfortable than a traditional mattress.  It took a little while to get used to moving around but now it is completely natural.
 No more lower back pain or hip pain. I am a big man and this mattress is amazing, it's very supportive and nothing at all like memory foam. I can't say enough good things about it except that I am happy I made the decision to buy it. You won't be sorry.
 We have two and love these.  Very happy with the quality and comfort.
 This mattress is not firm enough for me, but my wife likes it.
 Noticed an immediate improvement in our sleep and comfort! The mattress is wonderful.
 Affordable, good quality mattress. Now have two bedrooms with these mattresses.
 We love it so far. Definitely suggest a mattress topper if you like a pillowy feel
 From day one the best mattress I've ever been on!!
 Tried this bed for two weeks hurts my back am returning bed
 It is much better than what I had
 No regrets. Does sleep a bit hot.
 The packaging system is well thought out the and Mattress is very well made however the overall comfort for me personally isn't exceptional. From a posture stand point potentially this will benefit me and by no means am I feeling the mattress will sag. I am finding now with being a side sleeper at times and sleeping on mattresses during my youth without really analyzing my experience that I prefer a lower firmness with a pillowy top like conform while maintaining a solid foundation.  I just feel to much of it under and it evokes to many points of pressure points in a non pain like fashion. Comfort sort of is dulled by a fair experience I could live with if I was at a guests house or on a foreign hotel mattress. Potentially if I add a feather bed comforter it would improve things 10 fold but to do that my base cost would put me in another tier of products to consider initially. As less of negative commentary and more towards feedback please know the mattress leans more towards a high firm no thrills setup.<br/>It concerns me I feel I have felt more comfort on some high end couches.
 Very comfortable bed.  Conveniently delivered to my house in compressed form in a smallish box.
 We have been sleeping on our tuft and needle for now 6 months, and we love it! Such a wonderful mattress.
 I have been skeptical about getting a bed in a box. However, I read reviews. Watched YouTube and this one looked like the best for your buck. Affordable and comfortable; with great customer service. I was a little worried about people saying the next day they woke up with pains because of the difference i pressure but i figured I see the Chriopractor regularly I’ll be fine.<br/>Well....<br/>1.BEST SLEEP I HAVE EVER HAD WITHOUT AMBIEN. I suffer from the occasional insomnia. I really wanted to not take my ambien on the first night sleeping on my tuft and needle because I needed to know if it was a good purchase. I slept a full 8 hours without waking up once. Mind blown.<br/>2. I suffer from a recovered torn acl in my knee. Most beds give me tingling feeling or pain. I woke up with zero pain.<br/>3. My neck is always stiff in the morning. Today I’m fine with a little bit of shoulder pain but its bc i never sleep on my side.<br/>4. My sheets stay on this bed without a problem there’s no half sheet off in the morning. I’m ocd so this is a huge factor. Most beds spring back your fitted sheets if you’re a tosser and turner. This one doesn’t! Probably because i did not toss and turn last night.<br/><br/>You spend over 1576 hours in bed a month you might as well buy something that is worth it! All my beds for now on will be a tuft and needle! Def the best bed of my 32 years of life. Buy it! You won’t regret it.
 I really like it
 Only one night of sleeping on it - my boyfriend and I are in love! He has suffered from back pain issues for some time now due to our previous bed (we were constantly rolling into each other from sagging) and his pain has significantly improved after one night. The fact that the product is entirely made in America is an ethical bonus - and the quality difference is obvious. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a high quality bed at a reasonable price!
 First experience with Tuft &amp; Needle and first experience with Cal King size.<br/>The mattress is supportive without being too hard or too soft.  Cal King size is great for tall people<br/>or old waterbed hippies!
 This is my second Tuft and Needle. I tried another brand when I upgraded from a twin to a king. After the thirty day trial I decided it wasn't for me. I went with the mattress I know was comfortable for me. It is the perfect amount of firmness without mushiness on top. I sleep better on this mattress.
 Absolutely happy with this mattress.  It's a great balance between firm and give, and the best sleep my wife and I have had in a long time.  I was afraid it was going to be too much like plain memory foam and squish up a lot, but it only goes so far and then the support kicks in.  Super comfortable.<br/><br/>Oh, and not having to struggle to fit it through doors and around corners when carrying it upstairs was a huge plus too.  :)
 So comfortable. Puffs up quickly when wrap is removed. I have bursitis and this mattress helped me.
 I purchased this bed a year ago and initially loved it. However, the matress has become much softer and I have been waking up every day with hip and shoulder pain for a few months now.
 it was too soft..and I returned it almost a month ago
 I've bought an $1800 bed and a $1500 bed this past year from Mattress Firm. I hated them. I had the worst back and neck pain the last one I slept on. Two nights on this mattress and it's completely gone. I am a believer!  AND, it's Made In The USA 🇺🇸
 Slept in a hotel recently, reminded me of how much better home is now.
 Excellent mattress
 Lightweight mattress but very comfortable sleeping. Highly recommend.
 I could not be more pleased with the comfort and price of this mattress, not to mention how convenient it is for it to be shipped to your door! My husband has back issues and even he is happy.
 Very comfortable. Only issue... there is a huge divot all the way down one side. I would assume from being boxed up so long. The instructions said it may take 1week for the mattress to be fully "inflated" but it has been a month. I don't think it's going away.
 The mattress has lived up to its hype! After about a week it was very comfortable. The only negative is the initial strong chemical odor from the mattress the first few days. Although it will be inconvenient, I recommend opening the mattress and letting it air out several days before you spend the night on it. Other than that, the mattress is very comfortable and the customer service is tops!<br/>A real bargain!
 So far so good, will see how it does with sometimes of usage.
 I ordered this after seeing a review on you tube.<br/>Please know it is not a soft memory foam. MY husband who is over 275 loves it. Someone who is 140 and under it will take some getting use to.<br/>Im a side sleeper and it does help my hips.<br/>Again it is firmer then I thought.
 Got terrible back pains from this mattress a few months after I purchased it - well after the return date. Customer service was no help. Unless you like terribly *firm* mattresses, avoid this overpriced product.
 Very firm mattress. Sleeps great and I can't feel my dog moving in it.
 We bought this mattress for our 4 year old mostly because we were a little nervous about ordering the king size 10" for ourselves without testing it out. The mattress came and it was great, I was concerned at first with it being a little thin but it's sooooo comfortable and perfect for her! We went ahead and ordered the 10" king for ourselves. I'm so excited to have a great mattress, ours is only a few years old and already a nightmare.
 I added the DreamFoam 2" Gel Swirl Memory Foam Topper to this since I already had it and it made the bed the perfect combo of firm and soft.  Definitely glad I bought it.  It doesn't weigh a ton either like some boxed beds, so that is a plus.
 still early, but I like this mattress a lot. i'm a big guy (300lbs) and it doesn't sink nor has it formed any pits. Will update if needed.
 Comfortable and firm to my liking.
 This bed is amazing! I cant believe I paid a fraction of what I was planning on paying for a king sized memory foam bed.
 I'm giving 4 stars, but if it were just me, I would give the mattress 5 stars.  My wife, on the other hand, would probably give them 2 stars.  Even though they have a 100 day trial period, and I asked my wife several times if she wanted to send the mattress back (because she was complaining about it), she waited until day 102 to decide she couldn't sleep on the mattress anymore.  So, we are stuck with it.  She says the mattress is too soft and therefore it hurts her back.  Personally, I find it just right, but I agree with her that the firmness can be described as "soft".  The solution then became to buy a 2" thick firm mattress topper (latex) to put over her side, then a 2" thick "medium" firm memory gel mattress topper for my side.  It is a king size mattress.  I notice that when my 9 year old daughter sneaks into our bed some mornings, she always ends up on my side of the bed and says she likes it better as mommy's side is too firm.  To be fair, my wife has complained about back pain for the past 25 years, so I'm not sure if there is a mattress on the planet that she and I would both be totally fine with. I suppose we could spend several thousand dollars to have a split King with adjustable sides.  But, my concern is that I'd spend all of that money and she would still complain about back paid and blame the mattress.  So, the solution we came up with (two mattress toppers of differing firmness), may be the best alternative in the end.  FYI, the firm mattress topper for her side cost $170 on Amazon and the regular memory gel for my side was $54.  In the end, we were still under $1,000 total (we paid $750 for the mattress, although the price increased shortly after we bought it).
 LOVE these mattresses!  We now have one in every bedroom and they are sooo comfortable!  I can’t say enough amazing things about their comfort and how well we all sleep!
 Nice firm and very comfortable.  Great value for the price, and free delivery with Prime.
 We bought this for our daughter's Big Girl Bed. It's soooooo comfy I want one for myself.
 Great bed and pillow.  Could not be happier with it.  The 100 night guarantee put me at ease with the initial purchase
 This is my second purchase of this mattress!!! One in the guest room and one in my room.
 So in love with my new wonderful mattress. Very comfortable. Very easy to set up. Top layer feels soft and firm and steady. I highly recommend this to many friends and family now. Excellent investment.
 Bought this XL mattress for my tall teenager. He has no complaints. Smells a bit when you remove it from the packaging, but that dissipates in a day or so.
 I have had this joe for almost a month. I think I am ready for a review. I purchased the two mattress and replaced a plain old mattress with springs from the local store. I am sleeping on just this matress as you do not need a box spring with it.<br/><br/>This thing is great. I really enjoy sleeping on it. It isn't too soft and allows bounce. It doesn't hold in heat at all and I find it extremely comfortable. There is a lot of competition in the shippable mstress industry right now. This company is doing it right.<br/><br/>Opening it up was nice too. Watching it expand was pretty entertaining as it happened so quick. I didn't notice as odd smells or anything from their factory. I would definitely recommend giving this a go. They have a 90 day return policy no questions asked. That's how you know it's a plain product. I don't think the Amazon portion allows that. You can easily order through their website if it doesn't. If  You are still going to your local mattress store, you are wasting your money and time paying a shady sellsman at a markup that is not comparable to the product. Happy sleeping!
 Bought it for my 84 year old mom and she loves it.
 Comfiest mattress I have ever slept on. I used to have a Casper mattress, but I prefer my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. Would 10/10 recommend and buy again.
 I needed a bed temporarily for a year, and these cheaper direct to consumer mattresses were key. My previous bed of eight years was a traditional box spring mattress, and I thought I would give these new mattresses a try.<br/><br/>T&amp;N is the cheapest of all their competitors. The twin is just 50 pounds shipped. there's a foam foundation and a memory foam top. My first thought with the bed was that it was way too soft and I was sinking into the bed, and my neck was killing me. After a week I was contemplating about returning it. In the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep, I said screw it I'll flip the bed over. And then the rest of the night i was snoozing away. The bottom is much firmer, and probably not its intended purpose, but at least I could sleep comfortably.<br/><br/>Short summary-bed too soft, flipped it over on its firmer side, sleeps pretty good now.
 Very pleased with our new mattress. My wife &amp; I both adjusted to the new feeling on almost the first night.<br/>Good price, and time will tell if they stay as comfortable as they are now.
 I loved this mattress, however, it was not a good fit for my husband.  Not firm enough for his 6 ft 240 lb frame.  Although we're returning the king size I am still considering buying a full size for my daughter.
 The exterior package came very dirty, but it didn’t affect the mattress inside.  This is the 3rd T&amp;N I bought, love the balance of soft and firmness and made in USA!
 Not sure how I feel about this yet. I've woken up both nights I've slept on it to back pain and troubles getting comfortable, so I lie awake. I feel it's a bit too firm.<br/><br/>Update: After sleeping on this mattress for some time, I have to reduce the rating even more. I'm waking up just about every day with back and hip pain. I'll wake up two or three times in the night to have to find a new position to sleep.<br/><br/>Update 2: Six months in and I really dislike this mattress. I only weigh about 170 lbs, but I sink in this mattress pretty far. I'm still waking up every day with an aching back. I'm only 29 and shouldn't be waking up with a sore back.
 I was definitely nervous about purchasing my own mattress, as it would be the one my wife and I were to be sharing for the foreseeable future. It's tough enough to buy something for myself, because of how picky I am with doing research, but without being able to try it in person? Needless to say, I spent about two weeks casually reading up about mattresses before deciding on Tuft &amp; Needle. Prior to this mattress, I slept on a way-too-firm box-spring mattress that I didn't quite care for, so I definitely wanted something comfortable and affordable, and that's how I came across reviews mentioning Tuft &amp; Needle. Since the purchase, it's been a little less than two months since I've had this mattress, but I am definitely pleased!<br/><br/>It arrived in a big box and I'd recommend setting this up with one other person because of the weight. Definitely doable with one, just exercise caution. It unraveled and inflated pretty quickly after opening up the plastic, but all you have to do is just let it inflate and you're done. Really quick process and that first night was already very comfortable. I was nervous about the firmness of it, as I usually like my bed a bit firmer than my wife, but we both are quite happy with the medium firmness that is advertised. It feels just right and we can sleep on it in whatever sleeping position we want.<br/><br/>With the 100 day trial, you really can't go wrong with this mattress!
 The most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on! It's soft and firm and feels perfect in any position!
 Very comfortable and easy to set-up.
 At first me i was scared since all online mattress are not good for the cost.<br/>The first day after i received the mattress ,me and husband felt too weird and we ended up in a bad sleep that night.Later on,the mattress was too good and it scratched off the fear from me and proved its a best mattress :)<br/>We had no back pain issue and every night sleep is awesome and happy :)<br/>Tuft and Needle mattress is a great buy for this cost:):)
 This is a fantastic mattress! Super comfy with the right amount of support!
 Comparable to double the price memory foam beds on the market. Shipped fast, easy to open. Made in USA. I hardly write reviews, I like this enough to bother to write a review and have recommended to my friends.
 We love the California King we purchased! We read a lot of reviews online and from our friends so we were prepared to purchase a mattress pad in case it was too firm. We ended up not needing to. Had it over a month, very happy with it.
 Great for the price.
 After sleeping on this mattress for the first time, I awoke happy, refreshed, and complete - like I've been falling apart for 30 years and that sleep reconnected by being.  This mattress is absolutely worth it.  It arrived on time and intact.  It was a beast to carry up to the 2nd floor but I do push-ups so it was no problem.
 Excellent mattress, excellent price.
 We have purchased 4 Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses, before they were a "thing".  I have turned most of our friends on to them and have become their raving fans.  LOVE is not a big enough word to describe how I feel about these mattresses.<br/>My husband and I are both former athletes and now have a daughter who is a competitive athlete, this is the absolute best mattress you can get if you are an athlete.  I have broken my back and my husband went through shoulder surgery - we have spent thousands over the years on all the latest mattresses and this by far trumps them all!!<br/>Plus we LOVE supporting a small business that is so concerned with customer satisfaction they will give you money back no questions asked (not that you would ever want to return it)<br/>Couple caviots to keep in mind when ordering - it does take a couple weeks for the mattress to "settle" and hit it's sweet spot, just work with it and trust us, they give you 3 months (no joke) and if for any reason you don't love it by then, there is zero risk get your money  back.  I have spoken to several people who work for the company and their return policy is legit (although you won't want to return it)<br/><br/>Second is this is a top mattress only, so unless you have a platform bed, you will need to have a box spring (we just kept our old box spring)<br/><br/>And no I am not getting paid to write this and I have no connection to the company, I am just a VERY satisfied customer who has swapped out all our mattresses to TN over the past few years.  you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
 I love this mattress.  Lower price does not mean lower quality.  I will buy another for my guest room.  Extremely comfortable!
 So far so good actually have had great night sleep since getting it.
 Super comfortable! I was very hesitant on buying a mattress without trying it out first. I have a bad back and this has been amazing. Would absolutely buy again!
 I was a little apprehensive to buy a mattress i hadn't tested, but the guarantee and free return made it easier to pull the trigger. I really love this mattress and am glad i switched over to foam!
 So far so good. Four nights and it feels great. We’ll see how long it lasts.
 I'm very happy overall with the product. Packaging was perfect. 2nd night on it and its fell very comfortable
 My wife and I purchased a queen-sized Tuft &amp; Needle mattress last month and we are pleased with the comfort it offers us both. Not too firm, not too soft, and the cost was more than worth the good night's sleep we get from it.
 Zzzzzzzzzzz.........
 BEST mattress, BEST customer service, BEST everything!  And they give back to the community in so many ways!  A company that I will continue to support, for sure!  You have nothing to lose by trying this mattress!
 Super comfortable mattress. I love it!
 Great bed well worth the price, very comfortable!
 Not very happy with this mattress, sides cave in and not firm enough.
 Because I live alone, I pushed the delivery box up my flight of stairs to the bedroom and unpacked according to the simple instructions.  You can figure that part out by yourself.  As far as the mattress goes, it is firm without being hard; soft without being squishy.  Very supportive.  It has allowed me to get a full night's sleep on a regular basis, and I wasn't able to do that before.  I simply love it!!
 I had minor back pain with my last mattress. This helped. Very comfortable. Love the king size.
 My son bought a queen and it came in the mail. I was skeptical at first, him having ordered a bed that he had never tried out in a showroom, but once it came I loved it. He bought it because he has back problems, and did a lot of researching on it. It is comfy yet firm. Kind of what laying on a cloud would feel like. I even find myself laying on it when my back hurts. Then I ordered 2 twins for my daughters loft beds and now they are sleeping much better and not waking up so much anymore. Soon I will be ordering a king for me and my husband. Any of our guests who've slept on this mattress have raved about it. It is a great mattress, and you can't beat the price. And it's so easy, it comes in a box and you just open it up. I've read that you should open it right away and not leave it in the box too long. We opened ours right away, and had no problems. It's amazing how the mattress just expands so quickly once you open the packaging. I'd recommend the tuft and needle brand to anyone.
 Love it.  I sleep great on it.
 too soft! processed a return after a few days.
 Love it. Had some great night sleep switching from my old spring mattress to this. It keep it cool during the night. Still have that bounciness.
 too stiff... i am a 6' 160lb man and feel like its too stiff giving me back problems.
 Great customer service, and good quality bed. Just too firm for my taste
 It's lightweight, comfortable and reasonably priced.
 I simply love this mattress. I've seen some reviews that said it was too firm but as a tall and big guy, it feels better than traditional "firm" mattresses at 3x the cost.
 I was nervous making this purchase, as I was used to a memory-foam topped mattress that was closer to $2k for the past 3 years. I'm EXTREMELY pleasantly surprised and have been sleeping so soundly! Plus, you can't beat $600 for a great queen mattress. The box that arrives is around 75lbs though so beware if you live alone/have no one to help you carry it up a flight of stairs.
 We absolutely love this mattress!! We are super picky and are so happy with our choice!! I researched and researched and this mattress had great ratings in all categories! We've been sleeping on it since last October and are super happy!! Highly recommend!!
 Purchased for our 13-year old daughter, she really likes the mattress. Easy delivery via prime and the setup was simple. No unpleasant odors. We would buy again for kids or as a guest bed. Might not be the perfect mattress for larger people.
 Little firm so I bought a memery foam topper works great
 Very comfortable, seemed almost 2 soft at first, but after  sleeping in it a couple of weeks I love it! I used to toss and turn and wake up a few times at night. With this bed I sleep through the whole night.
 Love love love this mattress! It is very comfortable. Soft, but not too soft, just firm enough. It is the best to fall asleep on at night! Had it for a year now and no complaints. It really is the best mattress we've ever had!
 It's the perfect balance of firm and forgiving.  They have fast shipping and the customer service is first class.
 This is by far the most comfortable mattress I have had. I have spent thousands of dollars on a sleep number and am kicking myself knowing that I could have had this mattress. Also, it was so easy to receive and put in its place.
 I never knew what a good night's sleep was until I bought this mattress. Slept like a rock my very 1st night &amp; have ever since. If you're looking to make purchase &amp; still debating on which brand or which type to buy, look no further - Tuft &amp; Needle is it! Legit.
 Believe the reviews and hype, this is really a wonderful product that adapts to many different sleep types/patterns and positions.  Zero smell upon opening package and no "air out" required.  A dream.
 Outstanding value for my wife.  First time she has been able to sleep and awake without a sore shoulder
 Great mattress, especially for price. Easy to move around since it comes vacuumed packed.
 I'm still working on it because it's a little firm and irritates my upper back
 So easy to set up. I slept comfortably from the very first night. Love this mattress better than any I’ve had before and I’ve had all different kinds that cost much more.
 Mattress was delivered on time, rolled up and compressed in a rectangular box. Bit of a struggle to carry it upstairs to the bedroom, really heavy at 90 lbs. for full-size. Easy to un-box, strip off the 2 layers of plastic covering and as soon as the air hit it, began expanding. Fits perfectly into my IKEA wooden slat frame. It is firm and holds its shape after many weeks of use. As with all foam styles, it out-gasses, so expect to smell it for several weeks. I used a wrap style mattress pad to mask the odor. Edge is weak when sitting on it, with tendency to allow you to slide off. It is comfortable to sleep upon and a huge improvement from my old inner spring King Coil, 12 yr old mattress. Remain very glad that I purchased this mattress, first time online for this kind of product.
 It meets my expectations, is very comfortable and is an excellent mattress for the price.
 Bought it without having tried it. Thought it'd be really hard, but not too bad. I'm only 120 lbs though. It's comfy and feels like quality for the price.
 The mattress is excellent and was a great value. The delivery was great and so easy to set up. I would buy one again!
 I have only had the mattress for 2 weeks. Not quite sure yet. Price isn’t bad. Finally have a box spring underneath of it, maybe that’ll help take this product to 4 stars.
 Great mattress.  I also have a Casper which I prefer.  This is a little on the softer side.  Still a great mattress though.  We use it for the guest bedroom and guest have loved it.
 2 weeks since I purchased..every night now I wake up with lower back &amp; shoulder problems. The mattress is VERY firm. I'm a 6ft guy, slim build and I sleep on my back and right side. If you're looking for something soft or even medium stiffness, look somewhere else. Will be returning soon.<br/>Hope this helps
 We bought two mattresses for each of our boys' bedrooms. They love it.
 Good Quality.. Suave !!!
 Best mattress ever.  Seriously, it's amazing!
 I was skeptical at first. The first 2 nights were great, but I figured it was just because it was newer than my old mattress. Well it's a month later and it is still great. I look forward to going to bed at night! There is NO way you're going to find a better mattress at this price.
 Forgot what it was like to get a good night sleep! Highly recommend to anyone that wants a firm bed that still somehow feels soft.
 Best mattress
 we like it !
 Just as expected VERY nice mattress.
 Firmer then I expected
 I must say that I was quite nervous about ordering a mattress online. I did a lot of research. The good customer reviews on this site gave me the confidence to order. The order arrived promptly. Be prepared to lug it to your room designation. Plain, simple, and visible directions are provided, and following that the bed was ready in no time. Someone  mentioned a chemical smell,and I noticed it as well, but it was not overpowering. Kept the room aired out and using a mattress pad helped. My main interest in selecting this mattress was an effort to have a more green matress. Now for the sleep experience. The mattress is less firm than I would like, but having said that, I am getting used to it and have no more hip pain- which is wonderful, and less shoulder pain. Very pleased with the purchase. The only thing I would do differently is go for about 14 inches rather than 10 to raise it up a bit on the platform bed.
 We have used this for almost a year, and it has been wonderful. We are both short and average build and have had absolutely no problems. So comfortable!
 We bought a King about a year ago and loved it so much we bought this Queen a couple weeks ago and getting ready to buy a Full size for our son's bunk bed.<br/>Everyone in the family loves these mattresses!<br/>I talked my wife into trying it since they have a 100% refund and will come pick it up if you don't like it.<br/>No risk. They really believe in their product and so do we.
 Fast delivery, once the the bag it came in was cut it didn't take very long to look like a mattress. It doesn't smell to good, but, it;s slowly getting better. As for comfort, it's just right for me. Aside from the smell, I love it.
 To firm for me
 super nice.  firmer than the other similar mattresses, which is good
 After years of bad sleep, my wife and I struggle to wake up now because we arr so comfortable
 I decided onnpurchasing this matress after thoroughly review several others out there.  I'm definitely not as stiff or sore as I used to be which is great!  I did however have to put a matress topper on it due to the fact that it wasn't soft enough for me.  I have very wide bony hips and prefer to sleep on my side.  This bed was not comfy for that for me. I threw my old topper onto it and that helped a lot.  I like my beds squishy but firm I guess. I thought this bed would be my life savor when it came to being stiff but I still have a stiff neck in the morning which definitely think is my pillow.  I think if I find a good pillow then I will be able to sleep more comfortably.
 Nice support and very comfortable!
 This bed is awesome sauce. Period.<br/><br/>I had tempurpedic for seven years and serta sleep for three years.<br/><br/>This is better than both of those and every other mattress in the store.<br/><br/>Don't let the price fool you. It's less expensive because you are buying direct from the manufacturer.<br/><br/>I have been sleeping with my mattress on the floor because that's my favorite.<br/><br/>I received my mattress just 4 days after it shipped.<br/><br/>I have not been paid or compensated for my review.
 I shopped at a few stores and was annoyed with the high pressure sales and lack of measurable info on the products. Each store carried different brands and I couldn't tell if a $700 OR A $2500 mattress was a better deal. This one is very comfortable and I'm happy with my choice.
 Fantastic Mattress. Catch it during a sale? - YOU CAN'T BEAT IT!
 We love our new tuft &amp; needle mattress. We were a bit leery on buying online, but our friends recommended it so highly we just went ahead and ordered it. Their return policy is stellar, but you won't be needing it.
 I am sleeping so much better now! Very comfortable and just firm enough. I have neck and back pain and it is starting to go away. I would join this mattress with a pillow of the same material and you're golden.
 Great mattress so far (20 days).
 So supportive!! Best bed ever! I bought 2 full size beds for my boys and they are more comfortable than my $1700 bed; wish i would have known about this before I bought my bed overpriced bed...
 A little too firm for us, but great customer service!
 Great bed, had for about 6 months now. Im a huge man and was weary of it not being firm enough. It did not disappoint.
 I don't know if I can tell a good mattress or a bad one. This doesn't hurt my back or anything else, so I guess that's a good mattress. My dogs and I sleep well on it without being sucked in like Johnny Depp
 Great product, great price, GREAT customer service.  I changed my mind about what size I wanted and they helped me stop the delivery en route and get a different size out very quickly.
 I have had this less than a week and I like it so far. It is my first memory foam bed and I am getting used to the fact you do not sit on the edge of your bed with these. I didn't realize I did much until I kept doing it with this one. Sleeping has been great. I can see how people might get hot in them if they have someone trying to sleep close to them. I read some people find it too firm. It definitely seems to be user dependent as I feel it is more of a medium firmness. I've slept well on it and didn't notice any smell outside of a remnant trace the first night.
 I'm honestly amazed how comfy this bed is! It has some give but is firm enough that I sleep better then I have in years. No regrets, except not buying it sooner!!!
 This mattress has been wonderful! It arrived in a compact box, easy to deliver up to our second floor apartment. It’s the perfect mix of softness and support! We’ve had it for three months now and have experienced continual support since day one!
 So good and made me a believer
 good night all, time to sleep on my new mattress:)
 Awesome purchase. Very comfortable mattress. A little spendy to purchase. I hope it lasts longer than my last one.
 Review # 1 - Amazon purchase and delivery were flawless.  No issues.<br/><br/>Now for the product. Unpacking and installation were a breeze.  The box/mattress is heavy so make sure it is in place before you unwrap it.  I placed it on an existing box spring, carefully cut away the plastic and watched the show.  There was a foam odor but it dissipated quickly.  We have spent two nights and so far the mattress is living up to the good reviews.  Comfort/support and coolness are there (6'1'' 220 lb side sleeper).  It is a bit on the firm side so you don't get that immediate sink in feeling you may experience on other similar type beds.  I am going to give it a couple of more weeks and update again.<br/>*Update*<br/>We have been using this mattress for several weeks now.  After the first 10 days I had to add a memory foam mattress pad because I couldn't get use to the firmness of the mattress while sleeping on my side.  I would end up turning due to the pressure point on my shoulder.  It was not as bad as my old inner spring I replaced but enough to cause discomfort.  I do have to say that those few inches of mattress pad have transformed the bed.  No more pressure on my shoulder and no more turning in the night.  I will keep the original 4 star rating since the bed is pretty much everything advertised and reviewed.  Thanks T&amp;N.
 It is super comfortable. I love this mattress! It's not too soft, and it's not too hard, it's just right. Good support while still feeling like I'm sleeping on a cloud.
 The mattress arrived really fast and is very confortable, didnt smell as bad as i was expecting
 I was very unsure about ordering this after saving for a Tempur-Pedic.  I am so glad I did, it sleeps cooler and is great quality.  It is a soft bed, but that is how I like them.
 So far I love it!  I have it on a adjustable frame and it is almost impossible to get out of bed!
 So far I love it ! Awesome support not too firm but not too soft.  I wish it was a tad thicker sits very low on my bed frame,looks a little weird, I think I can get a box base to set over the slats  to raise it up, Im hoping.
 I really love this mattress.  It is super comfortable and gives just the right level of medium support.
 It's pretty firm, but softens up in about 3 weeks. I'm 24 and 130 lbs and have arthritis in my spine. This is the only mattress that I've stuck with.
 Not sure how anyone can sleep on this bed. First of all, it is comfortable if you like a really hard bed. The real issue is it is hot as hell. I have even tried sleeping without covers on and the parts of your body that are touching the bed will be sweating. I tried many different things but could not get past how hot this bed is.
 Sleep well on this bed
 All the top reviews are right. We love our Tuft and Needle bed.<br/>We got their pillows too and they are only ok. But the bed is GREAT!
 Fits a queen size adjustable bed frame nicely. Bends well and all the features of the electric frame come through comfortably. Love the packaging and unroll...easy.
 Excellent comfort after about a week, until then a bit rigid.  Helps with your partner getting up in the middle of the night, no bounce or movement.  So much better comfort wise than our old innerspring mattress. Love, Love Love it.
 Ok, this is the first time we have purchased something like this online and just so you know I love shopping online.  I was excited because I have migraines and lower back issues and was hoping to get some relief.  We set it up on Friday afternoon.  This will be the fourth night and here is what I have noticed.  I will definitely need the mattress topper.  My husband and I will both need new pillows as the ones we just purchased not long ago are all wrong for this mattress.  The first night I felt like my heart was above my head all night.  I will say my lower back seems to like the mattress for the most part.  I was hoping all pressure points would get a little release, but not as of yet.<br/><br/>I will update this review once I get the mattress topper.<br/><br/>Update........mattress topper made all the difference in the world. No longer waking up hurting... A really good purchase online.
 I love this mattress!! It's super comfortable, I'm finally sleeping great, and I LOVE that it's made in the U.S. and is nontoxic! I wish everyone could have one
 so far, this mattress is absolutely wonderful.  easy to set up and I have not had an ache or pain yet!
 Very comfortable and would recommend to anyone
 Best mattress I have ever owned, bar none.
 using for 3 months and it is very comfortable and easy on my joints.
 Inflates quickly to 10 inch thickness. Open in well ventilated area. Nice cover. Firm but not hard.  Feels like more expensive foam in showrooms. First impression, its a good value but time will tell.
 We got this mattress about one year ago. At first, I thought it was the best mattress we had ever purchased.  It was a great price and very comfortable.  My husband and I were both very happy with it. Unfortunately, a year later, I regret the purchase,  as my husband and I both wake up every morning with sore backs. I feel like whatever material the mattress is made with, hasn't held up. It does not seem to give us the support it did the first 6 months or so.  It's too bad<br/><br/>Update : It has now been 2 years since we purchased this mattress and continue to wake up daily with back pain. The only time we have back pain is first thing in the morning, so it has to be the mattress. I love what the company is about, unfortunately, this matress has not help up for us. We are going to have to buy a new mattress soon
 I lovee the bed so far. Last night a sewing needle cam out of the foam and was stabbing me in my sleep. A little worried I'll find more now.
 It’s very comfortable &amp; firm support but gets hot.
 Very comfortable bed.
 The mattress is a bit softer than I would like. I would have preferred a firmer product but overall I like it.  The chemical odor after opening (common with these types of mattresses) was gone in about 48 hours.
 I have bought several of these over the past few months and I keep coming back for more. I think that is a good indication that I am extremely happy with the product.
 Very comfortable bed some what firmer than I expected but I added a pillowtop and this provided the softness i needed for a great nights sleep. This was an excellent purchase.
 Purchased it to hold us over until our bigger mattress​ arrived. Honestly, slept on it for a month and loved it. It is now our guest bed.
 Wonderful mattress! Had it for almost a year now and absolutely no complaints. My wife and I love it; it's just right.
 Constant back pain.<br/><br/>I'm 5'6“ @ 215lb.
 Loved the delivery and set up. Comfortable enough but I am not telling all my friends to go get one. On the firm side ... I think would be great with a memory foam topper.
 The mattress is everything described, extremely comfortable, yet firm enough that I don't feel like I'm being swallowed but the bed.
 I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it! It was not expensive, great quality, and my mom says she feels like she is sleeping on a cloud. What a great deal!
 Reluctant to order online mattress but ratings were great and true.
 LOVE this mattress!  And it didn't cost a fortune like others!
 Arrived on time,  good nights sleep, but was little firmer than expected, have to see if it softens up some
 Best bed ever ... after the first nite I was able to tell the difference ... cant ever go back
 Love the mattress now, but it takes a month of off-gassing to begin sleeping on it.
 Awesome bed. Timely delivery. Deep sleep all night. Queen
 I love this matress! For the last years I have been having problems with backpain especially worst in the morning! This matress has been my salvation to start fresh in the morning! Love it!
 Replacement mattress for my son he loves it.
 But what is going on with Tuft &amp; Needle's deals.  It was $350 in Jan. 2017, I ordered two twin mattresses a few days ago and it was $400 each.  Today 7/25 it is $375 each and we just installed them on 7/21/17.  I feel cheated on the pricing.
 Might be a little early to tell but so far I really like it. After looking at mattresses from $300-$4000 it's a steal.
 The setup was a breeze and the mattress is very comfortable. It's a perfect combination of soft and firm. It also sleeps way cooler than our previous worn out mattress that had a memory foam topper.
 Feels comfortable. Slept on it at my daughters. It is soft but has a firmness to it so you don't sink into it.
 This bed is very comfortable. I went from having an achey back to feeling no pain at all after switching to this mattress. It is cheaper than a lot of its competitors but the quality is still there for this mattress.
 I was skeptical of the price, but seriously this mattress is amazing. I love it and recommend it everyone.
 I have had this mattress for almost 2 months. It is the best mattress I have ever owne. I raised my platform up to within one inch of the side rails.<br/>Sitting on the edge of the mattress is not a problem as some reviews might make you think. I had several questions and concerns before I purchased this mattress. I sent several questions to Tuff &amp; Needle, they responded very quickly and with complete answers. With a 100 day warranty how can anyone go wrong. If you don't like it you get your money back.
 Holy cow best bed ever
 Never sending this back, best sleep Ive had in years!!!
 No edge support killed my neck
 This mattress  is probably the most disappointing Amazon purchase we have made.  We researched the options and read hundreds of reviews.  If you are fit and light you must sleep on your back.  The mattress is very firm. Sleeping on our sides we don’t even make a dent in the mattress.  My shoulder went numb the first night. It reminded me of sleeping on my backpack roll on the ground while camping. The top 2” is supposed to be adaptive, but that isn’t designed for me at 6’ and 160#.  You have to weigh more to see it work. The box arrived with no notes, instructions, etc.  The bed seems to be built well, but not for light people. After 3 miserable nights looks like we are going to seek a mattress topper or return it.
 Bought 2 months ago; very happy with this purchase.
 Heavy need at least two people to lift/set-up. Perfect firmness/softness with this mattress but have only been using it for the last seven day.
 T&amp;N is one of those rare companies that provides an excellent product and exceptional customer service to top it off. They're very easy to work with, extremely transparent and friendly as well. If you're in between a few of the mattresses in this category (Casper, Leesa, Helix, Ghost etc) and your last consideration is customer service, I couldn't recommend T&amp;N more!<br/><br/>My mattress arrived yesterday and I'm waiting on my bedframe that's coming later this week to provide an update after a few nights. In case you're curious I went with the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-Upholstered-Square-Stitched-Platform-Bed-with-Wooden-Slats-Queen/dp/B00W4DCTK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zinus Upholstered Square Stitched Platform Bed with Wooden Slats, Queen</a> as my bed frame.<br/><br/>Update - 7/5/17: I've slept on it for a few nights now and I've already adjusted to the bed. The T&amp;N Mattress and pillows are THE BEST I've ever slept on. I put together the frame and mattress before I left town for a weekend so I could let the mattress air out as a chemical smell is noticeable when you first open the mattress but it quickly dissipates within 48 hours. The mattress just barely makes it onto the platform bedframe as you can see in the pictures, but it still works great. The wood slat platform supports the mattress perfectly fine.<br/><br/>To be clear, I COULDNT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT AND COMPANY ENOUGH! I'll be recommending T&amp;N to anyone I know looking for a mattress. Only time will tell, but I'm sure it will hold up just fine over the next few years after reading older reviews.
 A little over a year on this mattress, my back has never ached this bad.. I am now looking into purchasing another mattress. Save yourself the pain and money.
 Perfect balance between soft and firm, very god mattress
 Boyfriend loves his bed more than me
 Could be firmer
 This is easily the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on. I have no problems tossing or turning and fall asleep quick. And it’s easy to make the bed! Love this purchase.
 Easy to assembly. Bit heavy for 1 person to do it, but it is manageable
 This is a very comfortable mattress—amazing for the price. We put it atop box springs and are very pleased with it.
 The bed came fast. Set up easily and quickly. Easy to handle. I sleep fine on it.
 Comfortable. Easy to handle. Recommend getting it with a topper. Much better than Tempueoedic it replaced.
 I decided to write my review some months after buying the product. At first, it was ok. Firm and comfortable. But now, 7 months later, the mattress is a real mess. It seems like it got deformed in the edges, it's very soft (I like firm mattresses and by the reviews of this one that should be the case) and I wake up almost every morning with a pain in my back.<br/><br/>If you like soft mattresses, that shouldn't bother you. But if you are like me, who likes a harder feeling one, stay away from this one.
 6ft 2in tall; 200-210lbs husband+ 5ft 1in tall; 135lbs wife+ 4yr 40-55lbs toddler<br/>This bed has far exceeded our expectations. First time owning a memory foam mattress. Our four year-old still sleeps with us, even though he has his own room (whatever I love him, he is going to be our only child so why not enjoy his cuteness while we can). Honestly, lets be realistic if you are a heavy person and have a significant other you have to be thoughtful about purchasing a good mattress to last at least 10 years. Like I mention before, I have a toddler who loves to jump on our bed and plays pretend with his cars. Both my husband and I are very athletic, I am 23 years old and he is 25 years old, and we needed something strong to hold us all and still give us the comfort we need for our sleep and for when we wanted some alone time. The mattress is very strong, not too soft and not too hard..it is perfect. I bought a Master Standing Smart Box Spring size King to go with our Tuft &amp; Needle king mattress and I must say I am very impressed with our purchase. Didn't over $1000, which was perfect for our budget. If you are and elderly person, I would recommend to buy something softer, seeing how this mattress may be a bit on the too hard side. I'm being as honest as I can possibly be, this mattress is going to get squishier maybe in 2-3-5 years from now, in other words this bed is going to get softer within the passing years and thats okay, because I am sure the older the husband and I get the softer we will also get. Can't wait to grow old with this mattress. I'll keep you guys posted. Oh and there is a strong chemically smell from the mattress. I would recommend to purchase when its warmer outside so that way you can open the window and air it out. Hope this helps. Happy shopping.
 in the guest room and it's perfect!
 I wouldn't say this a miracle mattress but its pretty good. The overall feel took some time to get used to but I'm glad to report that my wife and I are sleeping way better than we used to on our old spring mattress. But perhaps any kind of NEW mattress would have helped that.
 Love this bed! Soooo comfortable! It took a week or so for my back to get used to it, but idk how I ever lived without this bed!
 Awesome mattress.  It’s firm but soft at the same time.  I don’t know how they did it but it’s awesome. I used to have a nova form but I like this way better. I sleep in all positions and it’s comfortable in every one.
 I LOVE my new mattress. It's hands down the best sleep I've ever had. I compared this mattress with the other brands out there, and I'm glad I went with Tuft &amp; Needle. They're cheaper than the others and I believe it's the most comfortable. It's firmer than other brands, which I personally prefer.<br/>I've been wary of foam mattresses in general because I hate that hugging, sinking feeling the longer you're laying in one spot. This mattress doesn't do that at all, even when you're spooning all night. It supports my hips, shoulder and neck perfectly. The best purchase I made in a long time!
 First mattress purchase I've made and I love it. It's very firm for me, as I am a back sleeper. Also, I tend to get too hot when I sleep and this mattress keeps me cool.
 We've been through 3 mattresses in the past 8 months.  This one is perfect!
 I love this bed. For the price and the trail period of you purchase it through the tuft and needle site, it's unbeatable.
 I no longer wake up with cramps or sore back. I'm more than happy with the performance of my T&amp;N.
 I bought this mattress in 05/16 and can't rave enough about it, I've never slept better. I've always been a sensitive sleeper and would toss and turn throughout the night on my spring mattresses, now I will never buy another one.  When the package came it was so easy to set up and even fun to watch it "inflate" once out of the plastic wrap.  There was no chemical smell which I was afraid of after reading other reviews for other companies, I had never bought a foam mattress before so I was apprehensive. It's soft but firm enough to be really comfortable and now I no longer have any back issues when I wake up. This has been one of the best purchases I've ever made.
 Not very comfortable. Memory foam is much better. Regret buying it.
 Nice bed for the money
 Easy to setup; my wife and I are happy with the mattress.
 My little girl loves her mattress! Better than paying for marked up/overpriced mattresses at furniture stores. I would give a five star rating but it's slightly too firm for my taste. Still a quality product at a good price.
 The best in comfort
 love love love our mattress. Best decision ever.
 Best bed I ever owned, so comfortable
 Comfy! We like it!
 I really wanted to like this mattress, but it doesn't like me. After reading all the great things about the company, I wanted to support their business. Unfortunately, the mattress is just too hard. I'm a side sleeper. I'm also fairly muscular, which means wide shoulders, narrow waist, thick legs. When I lay on my side I feel a lot of pressure on my shoulder and my upper leg. My lower leg almost hovers above the bed because my quads are not sinking deep enough into mattress. First few nights were awful, I was waking up throughout the night from shoulder pain and my arms falling asleep and mornings were greeted with back-pain. It got a bit better as time went on and the memory foam broke in, but it's still too hard.<br/><br/>I realize my body type is not common and this wouldn't be a problem for most people, but the mattress just doesn't work for me. My wife is on the smaller side and is also a side sleeper and she loves it. If you're a side sleeper and have wide shoulders or hips, I would stay away from this one.
 We researched memory foam mattresses for a while before taking the plunge in buying this mattress. Overall, it feels great. Yes, it's firm but it isn't uncomfortable. It actually feels soft-- you just don't sink in and get enveloped like some other memory foam mattresses tend to do, which makes it difficult to change positions or get out of bed. It was not difficult to roll over or adjust myself while sleeping on this mattress. My husband also loves it and says that he feels more rested when he wakes up in the morning because he isn't restless due to an unsupportive or uncomfortable mattress.<br/><br/>Out mattress was 3 inches shorter than it was supposed to be. We called Tuft &amp; Needle and they were helpful in attempting to resolve the problem. Since then, it expanded an additional 1.5". It didn't expand the full 3" we were hoping for. However, we received an email from Tuft &amp; Needle and they're sending us a new one. They did say that because of how they're made, they may be 1-2" off. Knowing this is really helpful especially as we await the new bed.<br/><br/>Customer service is out of this world. Great customer service that stands behind the product and really seeks to understand the customer always wins in my book as it is often indicative of trustworthiness.<br/><br/>Buy the mattress.
 We were hesitant buying a mattress on line, but this one is great.  Extremely comfortable.
 Just like the title, it's comfy and firm bed. It's one of the best beds I've slept in, in a long time
 I am finding this mattress so firm that it is uncomfortable. Does it soften a bit as time goes on?
 Great bed, fast delivery as always from Amazon!
 Bought it for guest room.  I want to move to guest room and sleep on it every night but wife not happy about that proposal.  Considering my options.
 I was a little scared at first, but once I received bed. I was more than happy with it. Worth more than the asking price!
 Not as firm as expected but comfortable
 I've slept on this mattress for about two months now and generally like it. I enjoy the fact that it "sleeps cool," but have found it to be a bit on the firm side. I was hoping it would have felt slightly more broken in by now, but it's still firm.
 Came quickly and was easy to get unpackaged. It is very comfortable and I like that it doesn't require a box spring. We bought this for our child but will definitely get one for ourselves when ours needs to be replaced.
 Sleeps well
 Go for it!  It's worth every $$$$ I paid for it.
 Overall, very pleased with the mattress being firm, but cushion-y and supple at the same time. The price point is just perfect.
 Perfect firmness, no heating problems and best of all it arrives to your home. Unwrapping it feels like one of those magic capsule sponge toys that grow to 10 times its size in water.<br/><br/>There is a smell for a few days as the mattress off-gasses. Lastly while it does have a cover that it comes with it is recommended that you purchase a water proof one as well. They have a few recommendations on their website.
 We bought two of these twin XL for our boys. They are fantastic. Very comfy. Now we are wanting to trade in our sleep number bed and get one for ourselves
 I can get out of bed, come back and easily fall back to where I left off😴😴😴
 Great mattress
 Best mattress ever
 This is SO comfortable. Quick shipping, amazing comfort thus far.
 I have Ben using this mattress for a month now, I love it. No back pains and I had back surgery in 2010. The perfect firmness for a back and stomach sleeper.
 I've had this mattress nearly a year and I wouldn't trade it for any other!
 So far i do not have complaint from my Dad, so I'm safe.
 LOVE this bed! Best sleep in years! Mattress says pretty cool and has show no signs of wearing in so far. Our bed sleeps myself, my husband, and our 120 pound dog. Highly recommend.
 Great mattress, continues to get better each time I have slept on it!
 Too soft !
 Really disappointed. We heard amazing things about this mattress and although the comfort level is literally 100% it folds in the middle so my husband and I literally roll towards the middle as it caves in:(
 This mattress is very firm. I really liked the materials and there was no smell whatsoever, but it ended up being too firm for me.
 Best mattress you'll ever own
 second one - love it
 We love this mattress. Great for both a 115 pound and a 200+ pound person. We switched to very low profile pillows, regular ones were a bit excessive for this type of mattress.
 We were really nervous about buying a mattress online but decided to splurge the extra money for this over some of the others. Couldn't be happier with our decision. It's held up great and we have no complaints.
 Its super comfortable!
 Bought this for my boyfriends mom. Doesn't disappoint, SO COMFY!!!
 Great mattress for the price.  Very comfortable.  Has the springiness of a traditional mattress but the comfort of and support of memory foam.
 Quick delivery, nice quality.  The mattress is firm.  I sleep well on it but my wife says too firm.
 Great Mattress, don't believe any bad reviews. Perfect balance between firm and soft and great buying experience with excellent customer service.
 Love this mattress! It is very comfortable and true to its medium firmness label. The smell wasn’t the greatest, but expected and went away after about a day or so.
 Excellent mattress at an extraordinary price.  With our older (much more expensive) mattress I would wake up with my arms asleep and generally unconfortable.  It is a bit stiff but I like it and with a soft pillow it makes it perfect. A side benefit is that I don't feel my wife get up at night since the mattress does not bounce.  I am 6'3" and 250 pounds and my wife says the same.  We;ll see how it ages but for now I am very impressed.
 So far I love my new queen mattress.  Was surprised when the vacuum packed package just expanded so quickly on the bed.  A little on the soft side, but to my liking.
 I've had my mattress for a month now and I love it. For the first bit I was sleeping on it on the floor while waiting to get a bedframe and I wasn't 100% sold on it. After getting my bedframe though my sleep has improved greatly. So great even that I need to invest in a better alarm clock because I keep sleeping through it!
 i didn't know i could love a mattress this much.  warning: getting out of bed will be a lot harder.  t+n is the perfect mix of soft and firm, it just feels like a hug.  I LOVE IT.
 Best mattress I have owned. The first night was all I needed. I also like the fact it is a local Arizona company.
 Amazing quality.  Made in Phoenix, AZ!!
 Awesome. I didn’t need the seven days to for it to show the best night sleep.
 Ordered Queen size. It fit perfectly. The matress is comfortly firm and body movement doesn't disturb beadmate. Definately recommend it.
 This mattress has gotten me great sleep and less pressure on my lower back. My snoring is 75% less, so says my wife.
 The mattress arrives quickly and conveniently. Set up was easy and fast. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, both mine and my wifes back, neck and shoulders are sore every morning. IT certainly feels comfortable when you first lay on the mattress but the morning after sleeping is brutal. I will attempt a return.
 Slept great last night with this mattress. Hope it lasts
 I was really looking forward to this bed and the amazing reviews it had.  First, the mission and guarantee of this company was really what set them a part from the rest.  The shipping was excellent and really did come in a box, which honestly was very intuitive on their part especially for those living in high rise condos or apartments.  I loved watching this come to life as we unpackaged it.  However, despite the wonderful reviews that I truly wish I was giving, this bed has made my shoulder and neck pain worse.  I am a side sleeper and I really do not think the firmness of this bed is made for me.  I am 5"11 165 pounds but I actually have a rear end that needs to sink in a little.  This simply did not happen and now has added lower back pain and stiffness.  I have given it a go for two weeks now because I really wanted this to work for me.  My husband is a back sleeper and it is great for him.  I should have known though when I excitedly took a leap in the air to jump on it and felt like I had just done a face plant on a little softer than concrete.  My husband got a good giggle out of it though.  It does not move and this is good for when getting in bed and you don't want to wake up your spouse.  I am going to try a pillow top that cost $240.00 to see if this will add any comfort but I am disappointed that I have to do that.  If that doesn't work, I will be returning next week.  It also seems to be indenting already in the middle, which I am not sure should happen.<br/><br/>If you are a back sleeper that needs a firm (very firm) mattress this really is perfect for you.  However, if you are a side sleep you might want to reconsider, especially if you already have shoulder neck and shoulder issues.
 It's comfortable and seems like it will last a long time.
 Satisfied, thank-you.
 Love This Mattress!  My husband is 6’1” and weighs 215, I am 5’2 and weigh 110 and we both agree this is the most comfortable mattress we have ever owned.  Would definitely recommend this mattress!
 I now can sleep eight hours. This mattress is incredible.
 My wife and I have been sleeping on our queen Tuft &amp; Needle mattress for about a month now. At first this mattress was exactly what we have been looking to find for quite some time. A mattress in which is firm but not too firm just right. We have bought three mattresses in the past ten years because all of them ended up developing a concave in the middle, even the ones from some of the more expensive and popular companies. As any couple can attest a mattress that develops concave issues undoubtedly creates problems for one or both people sleeping on it. This day in age mattresses are ungodly expensive to buy and certainly so when you need to replace them every couple of years. I was getting tired of it (quite literally) so when I found this on Amazon and with its glowing reviews I had to give a try. I'm glad I did. The first few nights were great and it looked as if I had found exactly what the wife and I had been searching for but then I noticed how firm the mattress really was. This mattress is quite firm but their is one good way to remedy this by buying a 2.5 to 3.5 inch quality memory foam pad that goes on top. We did this and everything is perfect now and has been since we installed it. I would suggest buying a quality memory foam top in the 350-450 dollar price range which is what we did. The mattress is now perfect in all respects. I must also implore those buying this mattress to buy a quality bed frame to use with it and not a cheap Hartford metal frame as they are not sufficient for this mattress nor any in my opinion. We've never bought anything but the Hartford metal frames in the past and I think is is without a doubt the reason most mattresses cave in the middle. We bought a wooden frame here on Amazon for about 140 bucks. It's by and far worth the extra expenditure as the wooden planks support the entirety of the mattress and not just the sides. This is they key to getting longevity out of whatever mattress you choose to buy. I've only given 4 out of 5 stars because it's still early in the game so to speak but I will update this review in time and after I've been able to properly ascertain it's propensity for longevity. I will say the mattress seems to be well made and constructed of high quality materials. Good luck to all in finding the "one". I hope this is it for us...
 This mattress is excellent. Its firm, but not too firm and offers excellent support. PLUS it comes in a box. Fun to set up, amazing to sleep on. If you are in the market for a new mattress, Tuft and Needle is the place for you.
 Have already noticed a significant difference in only 2 days, wish I had purchased this along time ago
 Love our mattress- it's the best mattress we ever had! Great support - great give - we are getting a great night sleep now thanks to our new mattress.
 Love EVERYTHING about this mattress!!!!!!!  I slept on the number bed for 20 years and it was lovely, but requires electricity, hoses, split down the middle, this Tuft &amp; Needle is sooooooo perfect. I have a California King inside a waterbed frame I purchased in the 70's and I now slept like a princess. THANK YOU
 Definitely felt a bit firm at first and we were a little worried but after feeling great the next morning and every morning over the last month, we are sold and very satisfied, thanks!
 Excellent value, excellent quality, and most important, a great nights sleep
 10,000 review cant be wrong, best mattress i've ever owned.
 Its very comfortable and a lot less priced that these other super expensive mattresses.
 Honestly I wish I would've just bought a lower priced mattress locally. I had "heard" some good things about this mattress, but I have yet to find anything to rave about. It is a mattress.
 We love this mattress. Having troubles getting up in the morning it's so comfortable. Cannot feel movement of spouse or pets. My spouse is now getting a full nights sleep!
 Much more firm than expected. Slept hot.
 So far so good!!  Very comfy!!  Excellent item.  My bones are very happy,  Would buy it again.
 I have never posted a review on anything prior.  Wanted to add that i snore and have minor back problems. Both of which have significantly reduced. My wife sleeps better because i am not tossing and turning.  Hey this is a great mattress.
 The mattress lasted about six months before it began caving-in on the side. It is now impossible to be comfortable in. Now I know what a true nightmare is. I am 5'10" and 200 lbs.. I sleep alone. My sleeping position is on my back as well as on my side.<br/><br/>Truly wasted money. I now need another mattress.
 Five months In and I'm starting to wake up with significant lower back pain. The spot I regularly sleep in offers little to no support for my hips now. Sleeping guest bed has been my solution until we order another mattress.
 Very comfortable, perfect for our McKinnon bed!  This is the best mattress we have slept and we have had a few.
 We absolutely love this bed. It sleeps cool. It’s firm, but not too firm. I got a great night sleep even when I was 9 months pregnant.
 Good bed.
 I have to admit...when I initially laid down in this bed, I was worried it was too firm for me. I could feel my creaky bones adjusting to the bed and it felt strange and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>However, I decided to take a nap later on. Best nap of my life. No pressure points, no movement in my sleep, no nothing. It was so comfortable! I could have slept the day away so easily! I was even laying on my arm and it never fell asleep!<br/><br/>This bed is fantastic. I'm so amazed by it. It also came with a nice cover over the top to protect it! :)<br/><br/>Update 6 months later: still love this bed!  it's so comfy yet firm! my sister is going to order one too, because of how great ours has been working out!
 Great mattress.  Only took a few hours to attain full shape.  Medium firm and feels great!
 liked it but made the bed to high, sent back
 Amazing bed! I've had this for 6 months and love it!!
 This bed is so comfortable! I received it a week ago (a week earlier than predicted). At first I thought it might be too firm, but it turned out to be perfect for me, I sleep better on this bed than I did on my old bed. I like that the company is not a big corporation; they even took the time to email me that they had started making my bed, and query about my interest in this particular bed. I feel very good about my purchase.
 I had a Tempurpedic for about 10 years and my cute new puppy tore it up. So sudden bed needs gave me a very limited budget. This bed is amazing, very comparable.
 While this mattress is inexpensive I found it to be overpriced for the quality. It is basically like a thicker foam topper - very mushy and offered no support - not what i would consider a mattress. You can definitely find a cheaper better quality foam and/or latex mattress at Ikea. When it arrived in a relatively small box (most foam/latex mattresses are in really large boxes) we were skeptical and it confirmed our skepticism. When I tried to return via Amazon I could select the UPS pickup option but there is NO way I could ever fit this back in the box it came in so I had to contact via chat to get a refund.
 Bought this for my son for his first apartment in college. No time to shop for mattresses so I just ordered him this one. He loves it. He says it's the most comfortable mattress he's ever had. I waited a few months to write this review to make sure he was still happy with it after some time. Yes, he is! Next time I need a mattress for my home, I will shop Tuft &amp; Needle.
 First time buying a mattress online.  Big selling points were that it was on the firm side and was made in America.  Bed is firm but forms to your body.  Over the past few days the bed has been wonderful.  I've gotten better sleep and the girlfriend both love it.  Great product, if your on the fence just do it!  The return policy is worth the gamble!
 We are so happy with our new mattress! We are getting awesome sleep. It’s soft but firm enough to where you CANNOT feel your partner moving in the night. AWESOME PRODUCT!
 It has only been 3 wonderful nights but so far I totally love this bed!  On my old spring mattress bed I would try laying on my back but after 30 minutes or so my back would start hurting and I would have to roll to my side.  On this bed, I have spent the last 3 night sleeping on my back without moving all night and waking up feeling great!<br/>I looked at all of the foam beds here on Amazon and then read reviews on sleeplikethedead and since this bed was rated well, made in the USA, and came with a 100 no risk try out - I purchased this one.  Had it not been for the 100 trial I would still be trying to decide which bed to pick.  I know it is a little early to write a review but I thought I would get my review in and update it later if things change.  It had zero smell upon opening and only took about 5 minutes to fully inflate.<br/>As of now, I couldn't be happier with my purchase - I LOVE THIS BED!!!
 I bought this mattress to replace a super posturepeadic. I love it and my wife too. He is on the heavy side and sleeps like a baby.
 Mattress came only in plastic with NO BOX.  I believe it to be a returned/recycled mattress.  It lacks the firmness I expected especially at the sides.  My first reaction to laying on it I felt as if I was laying downhill.
 I bought two for the kids and they are very comfortable so far. I will update in 6 mos.
 AWESOME LOVE IT
 Fairly firm mattress. It’s much cooler on the surface than my old mattress. I have slept much better since getting this.
 Very soft, but still firm enough.
 Extremely comfortable!!! Like sleeping on a cloud especially when compared to my old mattress I had for over 10 years. It conforms to your body yet doesn’t suck you in. I am very happy with it!
 Still getting the feel for it
 so far its great. would recommend to anyone. i 6ft tall and this bed just long enough. very comfortable
 getting use to it. Very comfortable compared to a regular mattress, foam layered or not.
 It has been less than a month, but my husband and I are BOTH remarking on how our backs feel better and how we are getting deeper and more restful sleep. SOOOOOOOOO happy with this purchase!!!!!!!!!
 We love this mattress.  It is in a second home but we can't wait to get there and sleep.  We both sleep more soundly and longer than our regular mattress.
 No support and horrible to package to return
 I really enjoy this new bed. It sleeps as cool as my old pillowtop mattress and seems to give me overall support.
 Excellent matress
 Very comfortable. Wish I had bought one years ago. Can't remember the last time I slept more than 6 hours straight. Now it's common.
 Best nights sleep I've had in a long time. Thank you tuft and needle!!
 Very comfortable
 Easy set up, incredible comfortable, 5 stars all around
 No joke, this is the best bed I have ever owned. I will never buy a different brand of bed as long as I live! I did a ton of research then chose to take a chance and order it without ever laying on one. Best decision I ever made... Thank you Tuft &amp; needle for making this bed, I am forever greatful.
 My first night on it and I love it. I'm 6'4 and when the bed is in the frame I have about 10 inches of room at the end of the bed.
 Much easier to sleep on this mattress.
 I've had this mattress for a few months now and I love it! It's not too hard or soft, perfect for what I need. Highly recommend.
 Rock solid love it.
 Do I love it, no.  Do I hate it , no.  I would say it is OK.  Slightly harder then I expected, but fairly comfy. Thinking about putting on a box spring, instead of the Sleep Master frame.
 The mattress arrived quickly, was in a neat box, and double wrapped in plastic. Somewhat heavy, lift with a friend.  We set up a slat frame ordered from Home Depot online, and unrolled the mattress and unsealed it. Almost instantly it popped out and swole up.  We let our queen mattress air out and puff up for a week before sleeping on it, just to let it air out and completely expand. I would say this is probably the best purchase I have made from Amazon so far (except for all the great books I find)! So, after a week of filling out, we put standard queen size sheets on those fit perfectly ( so no special bedding required, and seems to be a standard fit mattress).<br/><br/>We rolled around and got comfy for the night. Had fun time. Slept really comfortably! The only negative is that we both feel like we're rolling off the sides if we get within five inches of the edges. They do not slope down or anything, and I can't tell what causes this sensation. But we are adapting to it, so no worries.<br/><br/>After our first week, here's what I have noticed:<br/>Husband has less pain and less specific aches along his back. I can sleep on one side longer without pain building up in my hips.<br/><br/>It is like sleeping on a big firm marshmallow.<br/><br/>Not experiencing heat build up underneath us like our last memory foam either, so a lot less issues with being cold on top and hot underneath.<br/><br/>Adult time is more comfortable, less issues with pain in knees and hips on this mattress. The mattress is not bouncy, but seems to absorb most movement to allow for good support and reduces movement from your sleep partners movement.<br/><br/>We're feeling more awake when the alarm goes off and less "zombie mode". I think this was totally worth it.
 Comfortable. Meets our needs.
 3 parts to this review, intro, review, finally my problem with it.<br/><br/>1.st It comes in a vacuum, shaped like a twin sized bed. Expands really quickly to queen(almost twice the size of twin) as soon as you puncture the vacuum. Be quick to rip open the plastic wrapper and settle it on your frame.<br/><br/>2. It's not too firm, AT ALL. some people who complain that this mattress is firm, don't know what firm is. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is water and 10 is hardwood floor, this mattress is like a 6. you really don't feel your partner or whomever moving if they're half a foot away from you. The only negative thing I can say is that unless you have two exits(on both sides of the bed) climbing over the other person is a bit of a pain.<br/><br/>3. I sleep WAY too long on this bed. I don't know what it is, but it's not good, and my main reason for 3/5. I bought this bed for my wife and I, since we live together now. I had a 8/10 firm therapedic mattress on my foldable couch(based on my scale earlier) before, but it was small for two people. I've slept for maybe 5-8hours every day and felt rested, 10 hours would be the most. On this bed, I sleep for 9-12 hours. I go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 9am or 10am. I've gone back to sleeping on my previous couch, because it's ridiculous. I own a business so i'm not really time-pressured to get to work(most days) but holy crap I don't know what it is. I don't feel more tired or more rested, I'm not more tired than I've been before. I know this might sound silly, but it is what it is( 2weeks sleeping on the bed)
 I was accidently sent the wrong size bed, which was kinda a hassle. The bed quality is fantastic, a bit more firm than I was expecting, but I'm sleeping great so can't complain. Would buy again.
 Took a little getting used to after a regular too-soft pillow top but we LOVE it.  Such great sleeping and no back ache in the morning.
 I have bought Tufts products in last few years and they are really really quality products.
 Great mattress.  Love it!
 We have been using our Tuft &amp; Needle KING mattress &amp; have been very pleased. You can't beat having it shipped to your front door in a somewhat small box.  A little bit of an odor but went away after a week.
 I was weary of buying a mattress online from Amazon, but after reading 100's of reviews from other brands, then seeing this one and the reviews, it's like black and white. Their customer service is THE BEST. Others will expect you to somehow ship the vacuum sealed mattress back to them, and that's only if you can get a hold of their customer service! No thanks... not for me..<br/><br/>Now for the mattress:<br/>Best mattress ever! I don't ever want to get out of bed! I love, love, love plush beds and sometimes that's my downfall because my back will ache the next morning. This bed has just enough plush to meet my needs of feeling like I'm sleeping on a cloud, as well as firmness and support for my back. Bonus: I've added a 3 inch foam mattress topper on top and a down topper as well and I feel like I'm at the nicest hotel in the world. I never want to leave my bed. My dad was worried that the cold would seep through from the ground (bed is on the floor) and cause me to be cold at night. Let me tell you. I feel no cold at all. I sleep like a freakin princess. The only thing I have to worry about is not being productive because all I want to do is lay down in bed. 5 stars! Great buy!
 I'm in love with this mattress. I was struggling with Morning back pain but have had any since we got this mattress. It is cool and very comfortable.
 I have slept on this mattress for 3 nights now.  The delivery was extremely quick and I loved that the mattress was shipped to my door.  VERY convenient!!  The first two nights were rough, as this mattress is very firm and I am a side sleeper.  Although my previous mattress was very soft (too soft) and I was expecting (and hoping) for a noticeable difference, this was a little much as  I was unable to sleep on my side without my arms falling asleep... so, last night, I went and bought a 3 inch thick  memory foam topper which made a big difference and made for a much better nights sleep.  The bed felt great... supportive under and soft on top.  I do like that the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress feels solid and provides a firm support, but I really needed the soft top in order to be comfortable.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the cost of the foam topper ($299!!), especially since it was an unplanned expense - however, with my bad back and neck, a supportive mattress and a good nights sleep are too important!!
 Showed up in a timely manner, expanded quickly, but had a good size stain in the center-side of the mattress when opened just now.
 cant say how much I liked the bed, was very skeptical about buying it online but was blown with the quality and comfort. 10 stars!
 What a comfortable bed for stenosis and sciatic pain.
 Very comfortable and pretty easy to get unpacked and set up.  No nasty smell that I can discern. No more backache when I wake up!
 I bought this for my teenage son and he really, really likes it. Super comfortable, well made. i would recommend to anyone looking for a quality bed.
 Unreal bed and so worth it and glad I saved more getting this vs. Casper and Leesa which I am sure are great but this bed is so comfortable and will recommend it to anyone.
 Sleep better and wake up without pain. Best money I have spent in a long time. Bought a king for myself and wanted guests to feel great also.
 Amazing mattress so far. I hope it stays amazing.
 Got this for my daughter's new bed. Very comfortable! Box is pretty heavy, but it's a mattress so that's expected
 so far so good!! just got Friday. started sleeping on it on Saturday.  I am still waiting for the bed frame I ordered so I am sleeping on it on the floor .. still VERY comfortable!!
 Sleeping! Got it for my son who suffers with back fractures for a better nights sleep. I seems to be helping.
 Came in a box!  Easy to unpack. Very firm as advertised. Early mo the of use make me feel that I bought a quality product
 I have to say that it's a bit firm for me and my husband, so it's going to become the guest bed, and I will be buying a bed that I can customize.
 Worst mattress. It sleepa hot. I have used it for an year.
 It's hard prying myself away from this thing.
 Durable, good quality, comfy, no offgassing. 3.5 year old loves it.
 This is our second T &amp; N mattress and we LOVE them both.  One (King size) in our house and the other (Queen size) in our RV.
 LOVE THIS MATRESS! I’ve had it for four months and it is hands down the best matress I have ever had, I would definelty reccomend it. Great for back, side and stomach sleepers.
 We recently stayed in a long term rental that had Tuft and Needle mattresses.  I thought they were a tad soft for my taste, but comfy all the same.  My boy really like the mattress, so we decided to buy one for him.  I was shocked to discover that the mattress we purchased was sooooooooooo much softer than we used in our rental.<br/><br/>My boy still likes the mattress, so that is a win.  However, I was planning on buying a King, but there is no way I will buy this mattress now. It is absurdly soft.  Even my wife, who prefers much softer beds, thinks it is too soft.  Either we got a defect or the design has changed.  This earned a very disappointing 3 stars.
 Love love love this mattress!!!!!!!! Worth every penny and so afordable too!
 love it, wife thinks its a little firm. I bought Casper also and pretty much the same. not sure of long term quality of either.
 My girlfriend finds it a little too firm. I sleep very well on it. I think if it is too firm one could always add a cover on it.
 Very firm, took some getting used to but I love it now.  Great condition and delivery.
 Perfect firmness for both me and my wife. Easy to transport and set up.
 I love this mattress. I was a bit hesitant at first, I'm used to the standard mattress with a box spring. I needed something for a one bedroom apartment and this was perfect. Super fast shipping, sets up in literally minutes and so comfortable.
 While it feels hard the first week or so, after that it wears in and is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!
 purchased this mattress for my son.  He had trouble sleeping through the night.<br/>He now sleeps better and I have told him his snoring has basically stopped!! Would buy again in a heartbeat.
 I purchased a much higher end foam mattress 2 years ago and moved across country so I purchased a new mattress instead of shipping it. This one is just as good as the one I spend $2300 on. I have zero complaints, it falls right in the middle as far as firmness and I haven't seen any signs of the foam losing it's form from being used every night.
 This matteress is amazing!! My husband and I both love it so much!
 Great bed! Great value! I have had back problems for a long time that have caused me to have difficulty sleeping. I did a lot of research on memory foam mattresses, specifically box mattresses (i.e. purple mattress, casper, etc.). Not only is Tuft and Needle a fraction of the price, the reviews were so positive, and much more pervasive than other similar brands. I purchased the bed two months ago and my sleep has improved greatly. This bed is not exactly a cure-all, and will not solve all back problems/pain, but this bed is extremely comfortable and will help improve your sleep. Tuft and Needle specifically provide a product with a much more breathable material that keeps the mattress cool. I live in Florida, and was concerned about reports from other memory foam mattress brands that claim the bed captures the heat and traps, elevating the temperature. This was not my experience with Tuft and Needle. This mattress provided great value and great quality!
 best mattress ever.....and we've had quite a few in 35+ years
 I'll start with saying that this mattress turned out not to be for us. However, we had a super positive experience with Tuft and Needle. If you are reading this, you have already learned, or will learn soon, that shopping for a mattress is easily one of the most challenging purchases you will ever make. My wife and I hate the pushy salespeople of traditional mattress stores and the fact that you really can't tell whether or not a bed is going to work for you by just laying on it for a few minutes in a mattress store. Additionally, there is no such thing as the best mattress because what is best in a mattress is really a matter of individual comfort level. On top of that, some mattress stores make returns more complicated than they lead you to believe.<br/><br/>That is what led us to Tuft and Needle. We loved the company story and concept for the bed, we loved that we wouldn't have to deal with any pushy salespeople, and we loved that it really would be returnable (for no restocking fees) if it turned out not to be right for us. The bed arrived on schedule in a large box. Unpackaging was easy, however, after sleeping on it for a few weeks, we decided it was too firm for us to comfortably sleep on (my wife and I are both side sleepers). We contacted Tuft and Needle, and the return process really is as easy as they say; this bed will be going to a local charity soon, however, if you like a firmer mattress, this is a great one and Tuft and Needle's customer service is hard to beat!
 Very comfortable
 Comfortable and easy to set up. Reasonably priced. Very happy to have.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned. It's the perfect firmness, I don't fell like I'm stuck in a ditch like I did with my last memory foam mattress. It's also very cool to sleep on and I never wake up sweaty or sticky like most memory foam. Highly recommend.
 Quality and service was great. My wife LOVES the bed but it's way to Hot for me.  Have to keep the air conditioner on most nights.  Might be better this winter.
 LOVE THIS MATTRESS!! And the price!! I almost bought a Casper mattress which is about double the price.
 This bed saved my sleep! I went through several mattresses and almost gave up until I found Tuft and Needle. I love this company! They are top notch on customer service.
 GREAT TO SPLEEP ON, SUCH A GOOD VALUE
 Love this mattress!
 We have had this mattress since June. We absolutely love it and it has been great on my sensitive back.
 Great Product
 I wish it were taller but turned out to be a great value
 Its like this mattress was made for me, covered it with a 1 inch thick  mattress pad and its perfect!
 the quality of the mattress is excellent but I have arthritis and I wake up hurting in my lower back &amp; hips because the mattress is so firm.
 So far so good, came promptly, and didn't require 24 hours to "air out". First couple nights sleeping on it and I definitely noticed it molding to me and woke up with no discomfort in my hips or shoulders like I usually do. Takes some getting used to but I'm looking forward to this bed.
 Arrived in excellent condition.  It provides comfortable sleep...it meets high expectations.
 Great so far! I'm impressed. I really hope this ends up being the answer to all my tossing and turning and constantly waking up.
 Easy directions and clean up. Super comfortable!
 This mattress changed our lives for the better! It is absolutely the perfect firmness and temperature. We had a queen bed for so long and desperately needed a king since our baby sleeps with us. We couldn't afford the insane prices out there so we took a chance on tuft&amp;needle. Now we all sleep so well that we dread having to sleep on other beds while on vacation. We want to take this mattress with us!
 love love love this mattress! Arrived on time and as promised! Will definitely forego the mattress shopping nightmare in the future and just order from these guys! thank you.
 Top rated! Amazing back support! Super comfortable and a deal! There was a mix up in my order and the company quickly shipped out the proper item, expedited!!! I am very satisfied and thankful.
 Amazing!  This is much more comfortable than we expected. I do wish the mattress cover was machine washable though.
 As expected!
 So comfortable!!! Great mattress.
 better feel
 Wonderful mattress! It is very supportive, but not hard.
 Love it! The size, the comfortable feel, and everything about it.
 Expecting the mattress to be little firmer(I wanted to give 4.5 star if I could) but my husband and I are pleased with this product so far.  We live in Chicago so maintaining body heat while sleeping is very important for us.  After purchasing this mattress, we don't need to turn heater on while sleeping. It's awesome!!
 One of the best things I have purchased on Amazon.com.  I have now slept 10 nights on my mattress, and can say this is the best sleep I've had in a decade.  The mattress contours perfectly to your body, doesn't get hot, and doesn't make noise when you move.  I did a lot of research before buying this mattress. Slept on multiple beds in different hotels and tested beds in a few mattress stores. The Tuft and Needle mattress was as good or better than anything I tested.
 We ordered this mattress on a Saturday with Amazon Prime it was delivered by Tuesday, so that was a win! This mattress is everything we hoped it would be. A great price, great quality, and a very restful and supportive night's sleep. Neither of us have had back pain since buying this mattress and it is perfect for us! Thanks for making such a high-quality, affordable mattress. The difference between our old springs mattress and this one is night and day!
 I returned 2 1/2 month old mattress that was to soft, causing Sciatica in my right leg. I returned that mattress and bought the Tuft and Needle, which is working great!
 Best mattress I've ever owned. Great follow up customer service.  Wish if known about this 20 years ago. My only regret is not buying a king size.  My lab likes the mattress too.
 Very soft. I love this mattress I think the foam idea is brilliant. I had two beds in one year prior to this one and a few nights on this and my back felt amazing. I also appreciate the simple/sophisticated design, simple and true to bed sizes.
 This is the most perfect mattress ever!!! So happy with out purchase!
 This mattress is like sleeping on a cloud...my hubby and I LOVE it
 Very, very firm but comfortable
 I like the mattress very much.  My only regret is that it is a bit firmer than I had expected.  I am considering buying a topper for added softness.
 Would love it to be a little firmer, but a great mattress at a good price.
 After four months, this mattress feels like new. Still stays cool, is supportive, holds its shape.
 Most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on; good for people who like a firm sleeping surface.
 Delightful mattress, feels great, relaxing and supportive, the shipping was fast and packaging was perfect.
 Bought for overgrown 11yo lol he loves it. Cream of the crop. No chem smells. And expanded almost instantly
 I'm thrilled with this mattress. Comfortable both on the floor and on a platform. Great price for a King mattress, and no motion transfer at all.
 Too soft for me, I prefer firm and wish they had a firmer option. Refund process was very simple. Definitely still worth a try.
 Exactly as advertised, firm enough to support (for me) and soft enough to be comfortable (for my better half).<br/><br/>Doesn't run hot like other foam mattresses I have slept on, which is super key for me.<br/><br/>If I had to give it a con the only thing I'd say is be careful getting in and out of the bed, this isn't an inner spring mattress so the edges aren't going to support sitting there or leaning on them, you'll flop onto the floor if you aren't careful haha.
 Just unpacked my TnN mattress and couldn’t be any more pleased with this purchase. I suffer from chronic neck and back pain as I’m always on my feet for work and this bed is amazing. Can’t wait for my first night’s sleep.
 The bed seems like good quality, but unfortunately I still wake up with a back ache every time I sleep on it.
 Havent slept this good or gone to sleep as fast EVER. I love this bed!!!!!!!
 After sleeping in it 1 night I believe we made the right choice.  Coming from a a tempurpedic that cost us $3200 8 yrs ago this is a blessing.  Even if we had to buy new every 3 to 5 yrs.  A new tempurpedic was going to cost $4000.  So far so good.
 I thought mattress was comfortable and arrived promptly- unfortunately it was too soft for my husband- refund process was smooth just needed to find someplace to donate and have it picked up-
 Very comfortable, light, and I awake with no pain and need less sleep.  Made in USA
 We have been really impressed with our new bed. Others have said it's too firm but we don't find that to be the case. For the price, it can't be beat.
 So comfy!!! We do not move the entire night. Peaceful sleep!!
 I unfortunately have to give this item 1 star. I am deathly allergic to this mattress. I am allergic to latex and apparently this is made out of a synthetic latex. Of course it has taken me past the trial period. I couldn't figure out why i was suffering from breathing issues and waking up to swelling eyes. If you have allergies to latex I highly recommend be careful ordering this mattress.
 this is my bed and it is comfy
 Purchased item in March 2018 we have been really happy with the queen mattress we purchased. No complaints so far.
 Absolutely perfect combination of softness and firmness. I'm so happy with my purchase.
 This is by far the best mattress I have ever purchased.  Firm and supportive yet comfortable. And most importantly, it has held up after 1 1/2 years of use--no sagging!  LOVE it!
 Great mattress
 The bed isn’t comfortable at all, my wife and I wake up throughout the night and it also doesn’t stay cool I literally sweat in this bed. Is it a cheap price? Yes!
 Life Changer!!
 too firm not worth the money
 This mattress is amazing!  I sleep better than I have in years!
 Most comfortable mattress have ever had. I sleep for longer periods of time now, truly. So affordable.
 Wow!! Best investment ever! Replaced pillow top with this after waking up everyday with a sore neck and body pains, hips and back. Not only is the stiffness gone, but so is pains and even the headaches that would come later in the day from my stuff neck! Highly recommend to at least give it a try! Nothing to lose, except more sleep if you don't try it!!
 Is it possible to get a stained mattresses? Well that  is what I unwrapped. I didnt notice the stain when i put the mattress on the bed frame. I followed the advice and let it sit for 72 hours. This evening I come home to put the sheets on the bed and noticed the stain and still a strong chemical smell, like rubber cement,  Im not happy and will be returning the mattress.
 Comfortable and affordable. Would recommend Tuft &amp; Needle to anyone.
 Love this mattress! Would highly recommend! Used to wake up with sore joints. Not anymore!
 Just ok mattress.  I will update after a few months use.  I really could use the topper.  May make a difference.
 We needed a new mattress for our spare bedroom and bought this in a queen.  Wow!  Soooo comfy!  It might even be more comfortable than the mattress we paid 4K for a year ago.  Highly recommend!
 Too soft.
 Not a terrible bed for the money, but not good for side sleepers or back problems. Overly firm and short. Hard to find sheets that fit well.
 It is a medium firm mattress. Slept great on it starting the first night. Highly recommend it!
 Very comfortable, no complaints,  was shocked by the package never thought it would become a full sized bed.  One thing was the chemical smell was a little bad at first but it was gone after a couple of days.  Used for almost three months with no complaints
 My rating is strictly on my experience and not the material or workmanship of this mattress. My back went totally out on the 3rd day of sleeping on this mattress, in my opinion if you have back problem, this is not the mattress for you.
 Very comfy and you don't sink in. I slept great on it. However it sleeps hot.
 So far so good! Almost a year into it and I've never slept more comfortably.
 Bought 2 to make a king, so far so good.  Bought them with an adjustable frame, sleeping like a baby and my back pain has gone away!!
 This is the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever owned!!  We LOVE it!
 First night and I'm in love! And I'm a picky picky person when it done to mattresses especially.. It's soft, and firm in a gentle way.. Amazing!!! Buying another this week.<br/>**Update after 7 days-<br/>On the 4th evening I noticed the mattress seem to be retaining more heat than it was and it seem to be sinking and a little more due to heating issue. I think it's important that you do not overdue the mattress with heavy sheets or blankets. I'm still considering on whether or not I would like to return it. I weigh approximately 135 lbs and I was hoping that my husband would be able to use this mattress as well if he chose. But he is 175 to 180 lb and I think it would be too soft for him. But as of now since I have switched up on my sheets it's back to how it was for the most part. I was told by customer service after I was concerned that it could take a little longer for it to fully inflate to the firmness that it can.. I also was told that I could send it back but I explained that I cannot get it back into the box and was told that I could give it to a non-profit organization and send the receipt to them for a full return... If this is true I am truly amazed by the customer service from Tuft &amp; Needle. I wish for the price that I paid for my twin XL at $375, that the pillow would have been an added bonus like many other companies do.
 Amazing product! You can tell from the moment you lay down you're going to sleep like a baby.  Get a nice platform frame and you are set.
 I LOVE this mattress. It was a little hard for the first few weeks but has softened up considerably. I sleep great. It also is going to be a breeze to move when the time comes.
 NICE AND FIRM, EASY TO PUT UP, COMES IN A LONG BOX.
 Good mattress - everything stated is what it is. I would recommend it to anyone
 Wasn't comfortable for me, but my grandmother loved it. I think it's a hit or miss. Tufts and Needles has great customer support and is very true to word about the trial period. Honest company.
 Goo quality, some work to put together. Looks good
 LOVE this mattress for our 2 year old. We have had it for several months now and have not had any issues with it. However, we have only had it on the floor so far and have not tried it on bed frame.<br/>It's very comfortable.
 its so comfortable! but im tiny and light. my friend sank and said my bed was too soft! but for me, it was perfect!
 I am enjoying the new mattress very much.  Firm yet not so hard as to feel uncomfortable.  I have noticed a huge difference in my low back pain that is chronic, much less, wake up moving better.  I am happy with the purchase.
 So far I think it is GREAT.  We'll see a couple of years down the road.  Staff at T&amp;N are very, very nice.
 Firstly, the packaging was fantastic. I ordered a Twin XL so it wasn't heavy at all and the box had convenient handles. After unwrapping and letting the mattress expand the length was short by 5". So even though the box was marked clearly as Twin XL it was only a twin. After contacting Amazon rather than trying to re-package the mattress I asked and received the difference in price (really would have preferred the extra 5" in length though). Amazon rocks! Back to the mattress--I have not noticed any chemical smell in the mattress. I have slept on it four nights--this mattress is very firm even for me. Seems to hold well when sitting on the edge. I ended up getting a 2" memory foam topper and added it last night. Much better rest on the 5th night. Will see if it continues. Kudos to Amazon.<br/>Update 1/27/18-After sleeping on this twin for one month I have to downgrade my review- two stars. This twin mattress is okay for children-but I would not recommend it to any adult. I sleep on my side and rarely am able to sleep in the absolute middle. Sleeping within five inches of the edge the mattress compresses as though you were sitting on it and I find if I don't wake myself and physically move to the middle I will have back and hip pain in the morning. I would not buy a tuft &amp; needle twin again.
 SOO COMFORTABLE
 Love this bed, have had no problems with it. Support is firm, but for me that is excellent. If you are considering this mattress go for it, I am completely satisfied with my purchase and you will be too.
 We were skeptical but figured we'd give this mattress a try. This is by far the best mattress we have ever had. Been sleeping like a rock for almost a month now.
 Life changing mattress!  A little on the firm side, but has definitely helped with my back pain.  Thank you T&amp;N!
 we've owned this mattress for a few months now and are very happy.
 For the price this has been a wonderful bed.
 Haven’t had it long enough to judge durability but so far love this mattress
 Seems to do the job. Not much else to say.
 So far, so good. I have had it for 2 weeks and already noticed a big difference in how I sleep. Had a bit of a 'chemical' smell to it, but that went away after a few days. Only thing I can say that is not 100% awesome-I do wish that there was some sort of contouring on the top of the mattress, it is so flat it looks like a box.<br/>really happy!<br/><br/>hope this helps!
 This mattress blew away expectations.  I warn against using it on a weekday because I definitely did not feel like going to work after using sleeping on this bed.<br/><br/>There are couple other mattresses I was evaluating Casper and, Yoga Bed were amougst them.  This mattress was about $200 cheaper.  I can't see how the extra money would be worth it.
 Arrived promptly and slept great from the first night on.
 Purchased for a child. Pretty darn good quality, definitely on the firm side. Would purchase for my bed in the future.<br/><br/>Recommend.
 Comfortable , no odor ; we love it!!  So comfortable; doesn’t lock you into a sleeping position where you can’t move!  Recommend!
 Love our new king size mattress. Very comfortable. Pop open the box and watch it expand! 24 hours later, you can have a restful nights sleep on it! Perfect!!!
 Back pain after 6 months of use. They'll make you run around when it comes to warranty by requesting all sorts of photos and information.
 Nicely packed. No odor. Firm.  Satisfied.
 impulse buy that turned out great. Can in a small bundle which made it Easy to get in place and setup. It's firm
 Very comfortable
 I got mine dirty, like it was used or something
 Great matress. Doesn't reflect my own body heat back at me. Sleep really well on this matress.
 Great value!
 Please note- we have only had the mattress for 3 nights- I am not giving up on it yet. I thought it would be helpful to give a review from the beginning stages. A bit about us- my husband and I spent months researching mattresses. The choices are truly overwhelming. We were sleeping on a Serta pillow top for years but it became so uncomfortable it was hindering our ability to get through the day. We are both heavy and have back issues. We were going to make the big purchase last year but then I was diagnosed with cancer (yay me!) and medical bills started rolling in by the truck load...so big purchases were put on hold. But...we finally got to the point the horrible mattress was impairing my ability to heal it was so bad. After surgery I had to "sleep" in our living room chair...I have another even bigger surgery coming up and my husband decided- money issues or not we needed the new bed. I am sharing this because I want to emphasize how important this was to us and how seriously we researched mattresses. So we picked Tufts and Needle for several reasons-<br/>1) We LOVE their whole attitude and approach as a company and wanted to support that.<br/>2) This is a big purchase for us and we were impressed by their return policy and their customer service. They seem to actually care about their customers!<br/>3) The reviews seemed to be overwhelmingly positive.<br/>4) 100% made in the US. That matters to us.<br/><br/>What we like so far-<br/>-Amazon improved their return policy and we could pay over time which was huge to us.<br/>-Fast shipping<br/>-Easy to open and fun to watch it poof into shape...don't know why that is so fun to watch..I need a life...<br/>-It really did expand into a king size (corners a wee bit rounded- but not by much)<br/>-Mattress cover fabric is very soft and seems durable and of high quality.<br/>-So far it's a tiny bit hot at times but easy to fix by changing positions.<br/>-I don't get ejected when my husband gets in to bed- I can hardly feel the bed move...now if I just didn't hear him....<br/>-Side support was very impressive.<br/>-My husband built a new slat bed frame that I really like and looks cool-  bonus =]<br/><br/>So after all of that why am I giving it 2 stars (hopefully temporarily). Because I think it is too firm. I say I think because it isn't "hard" and it's only been 3 nights. We are still recovering from our old mattress so I am hoping it will get better. I didn't "sink" into the mattress which is a drag because I like that feeling but I also understand that is what makes you feel so hot...I'd rather be cool. It does feel like it is "supporting" me- while laying on my back I can't slide my hand under the small of my back so I do sink in a wee bit.Yet this was the first morning I could sleep in and I had to get up because of pain in my lower back. I have been hoping (and am still hoping) that we are still recovering from our old mattress.  I really want to like this mattress.  Almost all of the other mattress reviews seem to list this mattress as one of the least firm..so not sure what we would do. And I hate to think we might have to spend another $100 we don't have on a mattress topper.  So I will update this review as time goes by...<br/>wish us luck...
 We love our new Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress. We both sleep well and no more heat rising to the surface from our old foam mattress!<br/>The mattress is very firm the first week but breaks right in after about 10 nights. Love it!
 So comfy!! Love this mattress!
 Awesome mattress!!! Soooo Comfortable!!!
 I've heard many great things and read many great reviews about Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses, I had no doubt that I wouldn't be satisfied. It's more than I thought it would be, my nights have been amazing. Typically with new mattresses it takes about a week or so to get use to them while waking in the morning with a little pain in your body. Not this one, I've felt great from morning one! Grant it it's been just a few days, but I haven't had that I'm not use to the mattress feeling. Setup....was that quick! Hubby ran downstairs to get a box cutter, and while he was gone I ripped opened the box, took the plastic off the mattress and poof it was ready to sleep on. I had our king size mattress un packaged, flipped over on the correct side, and sheets on before he made back up stairs....no joke. Okay he was a tad slower than me. It was that easy! I've made the right decision, and hubby is pleased.
 Great mattress and my backache is no problem with mattress.
 I have been eyeing this company for years. It's actually the first bed-in-a-box that I knew about. My old mattress was no longer working for me. I was waking up in pain everyday. I researched many other companies with similar types of mattresses (in a box) for months, and I kept coming back to Tuft and Needle. I read many reviews, and it sounded like this could possibly work, since many reviews says it is firm but works for side sleepers. I am a side and back sleeper, 5'11" and 250 pounds.<br/><br/>So, I ordered this from Amazon. It arrived within 3 days. Opening it was easy, and it popped right out to full size. There was no smell, and the mattress appeared to be good quality. The mattress is also cool; I sleep hot and this did not make me feel hot. That is the only good thing about this mattress. This is as hard as a rock. My husband said it was like laying on cement. I knew it would take some time for it to soften up, but goodness this was too much. I was unable to sleep on my side because my arms would start to tingle, and feel painful since the mattress did not conform to any curves. So I had to sleep mostly on my back. I would wake up stiff and some pain. I was in less pain than my previous bed, but still not much better. So, after a week of sleepless nights, and stiff mornings, I ordered a plush mattress pad. It helped just a little bit more, but still uncomfortable. After two weeks, I finally added two comforters that I had on top of the mattress and the pad. Finally, I had a decent nights sleep, but still not 100% comfortable.<br/><br/>After 3 weeks, I said this is not working, but I still didn't want to return it. So I caved, and purchased a cooling 3-inch foam mattress topper from Serta. I finally had the best sleep in a long time, sleeping 10 hours, and then an additional 2-hour nap the following day. I also finally wake up pain-free and less stiff. I have now had this for 4 weeks.<br/><br/>So, this mattress is fine if you are looking for a very firm mattress- this is probably a 9 out of 10 for firmness, not 6-7 like I have read in some reviews, but if you need a little bit more softness and you a side sleeper, this is not the best one. I am also upset that I paid $675 for the queen size, and in less than 2 weeks it drops down $100 to $575. I am now rethinking of returning it, even though I bought a decent topper.
 Great price for a great bed. My only complaint is that with two people on it, it seems to dip excessively in the middle so that you end up rolling toward each other.
 My son loves his new mattress!
 Bought one for the master bedroom, and after sleeping on it for 3 1/2 months, just bought a second one for the guest room. Firm but soft. No hot spots. Great mattress!
 Way better sleep than my old mattress. No getting hot issues. Would definitely recommend.
 The mattress is comfortable and sturdy. Doesn't sag anywhere. Crazy packaging. Would have never expected a 10" Queen sized mattress to come in a box that small.
 I am very pleased with this mattress and as a result, I just ordered a 2nd one for my guest bedroom.
 Walking into mattress stores literally made me feel sick to my stomach. Decided to give this a try and could not be happier. Fantastic value buy.
 Comfortable and perfect for our camper
 Literally best purchase ever
 Awesome! Just right, BEST mattress we've ever owned. Slept on it for over 4 months now for a review.  Perfect, haven't slept so good EVER. I will be buying this for future beds from now on. Great value!!
 At 84 years of age, I can say this is the best mattress I've ever slept on!
 I worte a terrible review at first but now im back after a couple of months sleeping on it. after a almost year it still hold shape and its comfortable. So far i never had anything better for 400$
 Great mattress. Extremely comfortable.
 For the price this bed is awesome first time buying a non Spring matress and I love jumping into bed without the squeaks. It is slightly to firm for my taste I am seriously considering buying a memory foam topper and hoping that will help me sleep through the night. I really want to give 5 stars but it's just a really firm matress going on a month sleeping on it I def love it. ❤️
 It leaves impressions of body weight. Wish it were a little firmer
 Best sleep. I have the twin XL and I am 6 foot 2 inches and weigh 300 lbs. I sleep like a baby.
 Very comfortable mattress. It provides great support without areas of pressure. Perfect for an adjustable frame. I bought a second mattress for my father and he says he is sleeping well.
 Old memory foam mattress was getting too soft, bought this one thinking I would like something firm, unfortunately it is just too firm for me. I sleep on my sides, sometimes wake up with tingling in my arms and fingers from too much pressure on my shoulders. I tried to give it a few weeks to adjust but after about 1.5 months it has not gotten better. I unfortunately made the mistake of ordering from Amazon which only offers 30 days refund vs. ordering directly from manufacture which offers a 100 day refund now. So if you do decide to try it, order direct as 30 days is really too soon to figure out if you want a mattress. I am looking for topper to alleviate the firmness problem.
 this mattress feels soft but it is firm to lay on great matress love it so far
 My wife and I love this mattress. Cool and comfortable and works for sleeping on back, side or stomach. Shipped right away. At first I was doubtful, but the vacuum packing made shipping and moving it inside our condo easy, and the opening and its unfolding to full size was amazing and worked perfectly. We will never go back to old-fashioned mattresses.
 Very comfy bed...no issues YET!
 My son loves his new full size mattress. Super comfortable! Highly recommended.
 The product comes with a promise of quality and ground breaking research for a medium firm, but unfortunattely both are false as  I received the product few days ago<br/>1) not UNIFORM firmness -- could be a faulty product but no excuse - some sections of the mattress are super soft and some sections are soft.. so I'm unable to find medium firm<br/>2)  I ordered Cal King and I its a bit short than my frame - not sure if the frame is big or mattress is smaller<br/>3) The reviews had no smell but since  I received  I do smell and looking forward for it to go away in the next day or so. Will update shortly here. .<br/><br/>Saw 12K reviews and was hoping for that level of quality.
 So comfortable! Enough support yet soft enough on top.
 Great mattress for the guest room! My mom who sleeps on a temperpedic thought it was very comfortable.
 I have no idea how this mattress is so popular. I was suckered by all the glowing reviews, but I suffered through this mattress for a full 2 months and had to go buy a different mattress.  My back, knees and neck have never been so sore just from a dang mattress.  It's somehow too firm and too soft at the same time.  Buy at your own risk because there is no way to return this hot mess. (Oh that's another thing...it gets really hot!)
 After reading the reviews, and comparing the materials to other top selling memory foams, my wife and I made the plunge.  I ordered the mattress and within a few days it showed up on the front door step.  The UPS guy was probably disgruntled because it weighs significantly more than the average delivery!  I dragged it inside, because it was large and awkward in the box.  The directions were simple, I rolled the vacuum sealed mattress into the bedroom, plopped it up on the box spring, and cut the first packaging.  Then once I got it into position, I cut the second layer, and bam, new full size queen mattress.  I know you are supposed to give it time to expand, but we have it about 6 hours.<br/><br/>The first night was amazing.  My body was so relaxed.  I have slept on memory foam before and felt like I was sweating the whole night.  Not with the Tuft &amp; Needles memory foam.  I felt comfortable in temperature throughout the night.  The only issue I had was my amazing new mattress was so comfortable, my outdated pillows were killing my neck!<br/><br/>So a few weeks later, a couple new pillows, and multiple nights of great rest, I am thoroughly impressed and thankful we made the plunge!
 My only regret is not buying this sooner. Was easy to set up by myself, and is the perfect blend of firmness and support - especially for a side sleeper. Mattress instantly popped up to full size.
 Love, love, it
 Buyer Beware!!! This brand of mattress was just fabulous for the first year we had it, it was comfortable and did NOT sag badly in the middle. The past few months have been absolutely the worst. It has sagged into a taco shape in the middle. We have flipped it to no avail. Now we have piece of thin plywood on it covered by comforters but I wake up miserable every morning. We cannot affort to replace it as I paid $800. Now looking for a coiled mattress with padding to put on top of it till I can get rid of this misery. Memory foam needs additional support. It might be ok for one person but not for a couple.
 Before receiving our T&amp;N Cal King mattress, I awoke daily with Level 8 back pain. We've had our new T&amp;N for 3 weeks now and my back pain level is down to 3. I'm sleeping better and longer than I have in several years. This mattress is ex-trembly comfortable (firm) and well<br/>made. Throw in the excellent service, and our T&amp;N Mattress became one of the best and smartest purchases we've ever made.
 Wow. I was so nervous to order a mattress online but I am so glad we did! We nearly got suckered into buying a $3,000 mattress from a popular store because my husband prefers a softer mattress while I prefer firmer. Our old mattress was giving us a great deal of pain (we are in our late 20's) and after a few nights on this mattress we are pain free! The firmness is a great happy medium for the both of us! This mattress also has a great score on consumer reports! It's certainly worth a try if you need a new mattress and are thinking of a more expensive one, give tuft and needle a shot first!
 This is an amazing bed! We bought it as a guest bed but I find myself napping on it all the time. It is really quite great!
 I have purchased several memory foam mattresses for all my grandchildren....even from Walmart for less money that seem more comfortable to me. This bed is just too soft.  I had read all these reviews and had a rather expensive latex gel mattress in my guest room and was told it was too hard by two guests, so I replaced it with this.. Not good.  Too soft.  Slides about on foundation too easily. Regret this purchase. 🙁 I am glad it works for others as a comfortable sleep is the best thing ever.
 I have purchased 2 T&amp;N mattresses over the last year, and both experiences have been wonderful (although for very different reasons). The first one we got has been a dream - no hassle in ordering and getting it shipped and out of the box, and we've loved the mattress ever since. Since we loved the first one so much, we decided to buy another one when we upgraded to a King bed. That particular mattress unfortunately didn't fully expand, and it left a gap on either side of our bed.<br/><br/>Both purchases we made were through Amazon, so it was a bit weird trying to figure out how to navigate an Amazon return for the King mattress. After basically giving up, I reached out to T&amp;N directly, and they were incredibly friendly - and unbelievably helpful. They apologized for the problem, let me know what I needed to send them for their records, and sent me a new mattress immediately. Considering I didn't even buy the product from them directly, I was pretty amazed. They even let us keep the defective mattress, either to donate or give to a friend.<br/><br/>I can't imagine getting a mattress from anywhere else from now on. Well done Tuft &amp; Needle - you've got yourself a lifelong fan.
 The best and ultimate mattress ever in my life.<br/>Good investment for a good and comfortable sleep every night
 Talked about for 10 years. Finally spent the money and so glad I did. High quality product.  And economical.  Get yours
 Got this for my daughter some months back. She loves it
 But this for my daughter and its more comfortable than my 4x$ tempurpedic.  Great delivery, would buy again.
 We are very happy with the mattress. The box arrived damaged. We took pictures and sent it ti the company. They offered to change the mattress if we thought that this one was damaged. Once we unrolled it, we found that everything was fine. We received excellent customer service. Very happy with our purchase
 All the hype seems to be truth rather than hype. My mattress is unbelievably comfortable.
 Excellent value.  Works perfectly for us and our backs.  Would highly recommend.
 Super comfortable and a great price.
 We are happy with our purchase. Loved it so much that planning to buy two more in King size.
 It's been a couple years and it's still as awesome as ever.  Never even flipped it because I'm a terrible mattress owner.  It feels no different than day 1.  Just make sure your frame has a way of keeping it in place, because it can slide around a bit.
 Very comfortable
 After a few nights in it it grew on me was seriously considering returning it
 Customer service for both Tuft and Needle and Amazon were great.  However, the bed did not live up to our expectations.  We slept in it for about 3 weeks and did not have one restful night's sleep.  We are tired.  I'm a back sleeper and it's too firm for me.  There is zero give; you are sleeping on top of the bed.  It also sleeps hot.  We were so hopeful due to the high ratings on Amazon, but it just didn't work out for us.  If you like a very firm bed and sleep with fans on, it might be right for you.
 Outstanding mattress. The T&amp;N folks have hit it out of the park with this product. I will never buy from the big mattress company cartel again.
 I have slept so well since getting this mattress.  Super easy to unpack, super comfortable
 This mattress is great. Just open the box and POOF!!!! you have a great mattress that has a lot of support. Both my husband and myself love it.
 After wasting thousands on averages mattresses, I found the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on for $700. Go figure. The reviews are right. You won't be disappointed. This mattress is fantastic.
 I have been sleeping on my Tuft &amp; Needle queen mattress for just under six months now and i love it so so much!  when i purchased it i needed a mattress fast, i had recently gone through a breakup and was in a new appartment sleeping on an aero bed for far too long when it sprung a leak.  When i ordered it my main motivations were convinience and cost it was very well reviewed and coming in the small box from amazon in 2days was a big big plus.  i easily moved the mattress into my second floor apartment by myself and unboxing it was pretty easy.  Historically i have been a fan of pretty firm mattresses, i am pretty heavy for my size and on soft mattresses i feel like my ass sinks in and i am laying in a hammock which is really bad if i am on my stomach so i was a little concern that this bed would be too soft.  I went with the tuft and needle because it consistantly reviewed as being firmer than the leesa or the the casper.  The first day i was in heaven because i was off the aero bed, but by the end of the first week my back hurt because i thought it was too soft.  I was a little disappointed but I figured i would follow their advice and give my body some time to get used to the mattress and by the middle of the third week i was sleeping like a baby.  this mattress is firm in a way that my previous mattresses weren't, you sink into it a bit more than a normal mattress but it is more supportive and so my back stays very flat and well aligned, i have found that i am also much more comfortable on my side than on any other mattress i have owned.  Overall i have noticed that my back is less tense since sleeping on this mattress, i am a big fan!  For reference i am in my mid 30's 5'7" tall i weigh 190lbs and am reasonably fit.
 Very comfortable but edges are soft. Comes in a compact package.
 The bed was slightly more firm than what I normally like, it after sleeping on it for a week, it's actually very comfortable &amp; I sleep great on it. There was no off gassing which was a plus.
 I'm small but I got a full size for some extra room and it is very thick and comfortable! My roommates love it too and everyone who sits on it can feel the softeness and firm support. This was a bit of an investment for me but overall I think it was definitely worth the money as it seems like it will last a while.
 My husband talked me into this bed- I've had it my whole pregnancy and guess what?? No body pillows, and no aches and pains in the morning!! It's amazing- my last pregnancy I slept terrible but we both sleep so much better now. My husband is a wild sleeper and I don't feel him move hardly at all anymore. WORTH IT
 It is a very nice bed. Not to soft and not to hard. The wife and I are sleeping better. Thank you
 Very comfortable... are use this for my main bed and my Guestroom. I guess there are some very comfortable
 This mattress is great any so easy to set up.
 We had an ikea queen sizes mattress and moved to a King sized T&amp;N mattress. I certainly don't want to speak poorly of the ikea mattress, however, the T&amp;N mattress is light years beyond in terms of comfort. Without a hint of hyperbole, honestly we've slept better than we have in years.<br/><br/>Previously I would toss and turn a dozen times before sleeping. Now with the T&amp;N mattress I fall asleep in exactly the first position I choose and will only shift positions 3 or 4 times in an entire night.<br/><br/>Very satisfied. Highly recommending this mattres. It is almost too comfortable; I say that because I can barely bring myself to get out of bed :)<br/><br/>Thank you. I'll update my review after a month or two.. Stay tuned!
 Very comfortable.  No more back pain.  Price was less than most of the competition.  Quality product.
 Fantastic bargain!
 Most comfortable bed I have ever slept on can't wait to order the pillows!!
 My husband said he hasn't slept so well in many years he loves the mattress
 I don't usually write lengthy reviews, but that's how good this was: this is the most amazing mattress I have ever slept on. I had been saving for a new mattress for ages and was nowhere near my goal, but my back pain became so severe that I caved and bought this one on sale for Black Friday. I originally intended to get the Casper, but at almost half the price, I went with this, then immediately worried that I would regret it. When it arrived, watching the bed expand was really cool, it didn't smell and it was up to it's full height in an hour. When I finally tried it out, I knew I made the right call; this bed feels amazing. It's just firm enough that I don't sink or feel like I'm being "hugged" like many foam mattresses, but it's still so comfortable and soft. I am a side sleeper and this feels great, even better than the $1500 foam mattress my aunt just bought.<br/><br/>It's so rare to go with the budget option and still have your expectations met, but this mattress went above and beyond. If anything changes I will update, but I doubt it will be necessary. My only complaint is that the pillows were so expensive, I couldn't afford to try them out. Where was the sale on those, T&amp;N? I'm desperate to try them!<br/><br/>In conclusion, BUY THE MATTRESS!
 To the 655+ (and counting) reviews, thank you for giving me the most comfortable and solid hours of sleep I've ever had in my existence.
 I love this mattress.  It's cozy but firm (even the edges); and it maintains the right temperature through the night.  I recommend it!
 I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!<br/>I did a lot of research and this is the least expensive, most comfortable foam mattress you can buy. Hands down.
 The bed is simply not comfortable. My wife and I used it for 3 weeks before giving up and starting the return process.
 nice mattress, just a little too soft for my tastes.......If I had it to do over again, I would buy a more firm mattress --I may contact T &amp; N to see about getting a firmer mattress.
 Was sceptical when it arrived but after cutting the plastic and watching swell with air  it turned into the most comfortable matress we have ever had. We are completly satisfied
 The absolute best purchase I have ever made. The team over at Tuft and Needle are wonderful people and I love my mattress
 A great decision to buy this mattress.
 I Love it.  Better than I expected!
 This our 2nd mattress from Turf &amp; Needle we love them and the price is right
 Love it! Best night sleep ever. It’s comfy but still had great suppport. Couldn’t be happier.
 So comfortable. I usually like a firm mattress, but this mattress was ideal for back and side sleepers.
 This Mattress is very comfortable
 So far after 9 niights of near perfect sleeping, and in spite of moving fatigue, I am ver very pleased. Check with me again soon.
 My daughter luxuriated in this bed that we bought for guests. Only later did I read that this mattress satisfied the Consumer Reports best buy rating.
 Think twice before ordering - if you dont like it, you will pay the difference for shipping to return. 80+ lb king size bed is a lot. The springy foam has a lot of resistance to being folded as well. My back hurts.
 I've had terrible back pain in the past.  I finally found a mattress that really is perfect for me.  Yes, I love that the mattress is firm.  I've gotten such good rest lately.  Thank you, Tuft and Needle!
 We love our king size 10" mattress.  Our old spring style mattress started making my back hurt after just a couple of years.<br/><br/>I was hesitant for two reasons:  No reviews of somebody that had it for years showing how long it lasts, and so many positive reviews that it might be a scam.  But with such a low price and the awesome return policy what did I have to lose.  I sleep much better on this mattress than our old one.  It is the perfect firmness.  It looks much more sleek than our giant pillow top spring mattress with an extra memory foam topper on it.<br/><br/>I still have no idea how long it will last, but it seems well designed and constructed.  I don't feel like it is degrading so far.
 Had to get a memory foam topper cause it really started to hurt my neck and shoulder from side sleeping. I’ve had the mattress for about 4 months and want to get a different mattress. Such a bummer.
 I have been struggling with lower back pain for over 2 months that started not long after I go the mattress. After feeling pretty good after sleeping on a harder mattress on an 8-day vacation, I realize my new tuft and needle mattress has not been helping my back. I called T&amp;N about the return, but they said that I need to go through Amazon, which usually only has a 30-day return. Not sure where to even start with Amazon. It does not give me an option on the order to return it. So frustrated. My husband likes the mattress, but I don't want to live with back pain forever.
 Great value! I'm pleased with the mattress and the buying experience. It's a little soft for my taste as someone used to a relatively firm memory foam matress but my wife and son (who the bed is for) love it. I'll be interested to see how it holds up over time but for now I couldn't be more pleased.
 I have been using this for over a month now.  The mattress is not as hard as I've expected, but not too soft.  Just the right amount of softness for me.
 It feels amazing. The quality seems pretty nice, too.
 I can't say enough good about these mattresses.  I waited a bit to write this to see how they'd hold up.  Well, after one month I can say they're doing GREAT. My husband, grandson and I put these on our new adjustable bed bases, and it was simple as pie.  Unzip them quickly, as they start to "blow up" to full size very fast once you expose them to the air!! Some people say there is a smell to them, but we never noticed anything - we let them sit all day, and made the beds up that night.  We find the firmness perfect for us -- not too soft, but not too hard either.  I am amazed at the quality of this product for the price, and if and when these ever need replacing, I won't hesitate to buy another set.
 Purchased this to use in the loft and it was easy to get up the stairs. I have Aireloom Mattresses that are 3-4x the price and I love these too but for price &amp; quality this is a great mattress.
 excellent<br/>i am 8 months pregnant now and the support is unbelievable. great purchase
 No smell! All of our guests love this bed!!
 Bought T&amp;N for the whole family! We LOVE T&amp;N! My mom loves staying at our house because she loves the mattress!
 This is the most comfortable bed I’ve ever had. My back feels better since using it. I have plantar fasciitis and oddly enough, my feet have improved with this bed.
 So this company said to give the bed a week. I gave it a little bit more than that, as I want to give a true review. The first week was great! I loved it, I had the best sleep. My back pain went away, and I stayed nice and cool. But now, I can already see where I usually sleep, and my husband sleeps. Its not a dramatic cave in, but if its doing it this early, I don't see this mattress lasting us 10 years, like this company said it would. I really wanted this to work, one because I believe in supporting small businesses, and two because we have been searching for years for a mattress to actually last us longer than a year. I don't see this lasting even close to a year. Oh and I also started to notice that the mattress is starting to make a plastic sound. Not all the time, like when I just move a leg, but like when I kneel on the bed or if I put my elbow into the bed. I wish it could stay how it was the first week we had it because I really did have the best sleep ever. I have read some reviews that said the bed was too stiff when they bought the bed, that is not the case for me. It was the best bed I have found, well until now. We might have to return this and pay for a more expensive bed. Like a tempur pedic.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Wow, I am so impressed with this company! They are quick at helping you, and do EVERYTHING they say they will. No extra hoops to jump through, and no small writing you didn't see. They are sending us a new mattress, AND they are taking care of the old one!! That is a huge plus for me. That would cost us time and money to get rid of it. We will be getting our new one soon. I will for sure keep updating, as I hope my next update will be 5 stars! I can't say enough about this company, customer service is fast, and they are very nice and helpful. Just all around an awesome company. I'm very glad we decided to push the buy button. Thank you very much Tuft &amp; Needle
 True to the reviews I read. I’m very happy with the comfort of this product and ease of unpacking and airing out.<br/>The firmness is perfect and consistent.
 This works great!  My toddlers diaper leaked and it didn’t go through to the mattress.
 At first -- over the first month and a half -- this mattress seemed to be doing the trick. It has been getting progressively worse since then. I sleep on the left side of the bed, I weigh 215 pounds and am around 5'9" with most of my weight from stomach to upper torso. Looks like I've had this mattress about a week too long to get the money back guarantee though I haven't asked yet maybe they will still honor it. Support seems to break down mid-mattress (header to footer) getting softer or squishier with repeated use. Now I'm waking up every couple hours with severe back pain and there's no comfortable sleep position, back side or stomach. If I move to the middle of the mattress the support gets better but eventually that would probably soften up too, besides my wife and I sleep in the same bed so I can't really hog the whole thing. Very disappointed. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Tuft-Needle-Mattress-Queen/dp/B00QBZ265U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress, Queen</a>
 So nice. If you have any doubts, you should try it out. The best mattress I've ever slept on in my life.
 good mattress and a whole lot cheaper than name brand mattresses
 so far it's been GREAT
 This mattress is awesome! It is very comfortable. It is firm yet still very soft.
 I wanted to roll the dice on a cheap mattress and it turned out great. I figured if it didnt hold up to the hype i could go back to purchasing expensive mattresses. Its very comfortable and i've been sleeping great. Im 6'2" and weigh around 200 lbs.  i havent noticed any deformation, but ive only had it a month so time will tell.
 Great customer service.<br/><br/>The mattress was not comfortable for my wife and I but the return policy was great.
 Are you tired of sucking at life? Are you tired of being a loser? Are your inadequate issues keeping you from moving up in the world? THEN STOP WAISTING TIME AND BUY THIS BED!!! NOW!!! CLICK THE BUTTON!!! DO IT!!!!!
 I really like it. It's comfortable and I am able to get much deeper sleep that I have been getting for years. The mattress stays cool and doesn't get that "sunk in" feeling that memory gel gives. The only thing is that if you sit on the edge, it will give. There is no sturdy wire to support the corner. That's not a problem though. I would buy it again.
 I am a stomach sleeper who prefers sleeping close to the floor, or sleeping on foam mattress' on the floor. After months of sleeping this way, i finally got me a mattress. I liked that it's really firm and OKEO TEX certified. ....so upon unboxing, I get cute stickers and it's wrapped really nice, better than all the others I have tried since. I got a FULL, so it was folded 1/3 in half. The plastic is sturdy and doesn't rip unexpectedly on you which is also nice. (i had that happen to me once and it pissed me off)<br/><br/>I let it air out for about 3-4 hours. I also worried about off gassing as I am EXTREMELY sensitive. I will sneeze, itch, and wheeze if there is dust, drugs, mold or smoke around me. All the other mattresses I have tried thus far have had medium off gassing to minimal, and this mattress, (T&amp;N) also had a little bit of off gassing smell. They say it's due to the vacuum process, however it still makes me sick. I was able to sit on top after 10 minutes of letting it inflate.<br/><br/>I noticed it was firm and super supportive from the beginging. Most foam mattresses claim to be firm and supportive, but your knees always sink to your thighs as you "kneel-walk" accross the bed.  This one however kept you at the top, ON-TOP, the mattress. You don't sink. I was expecting a slight hug even after sitting there for a while, and I never did. IT REALLY IS SUPPORTIVE! So i LOVE it for that. However, I noticed that my spine still wasn't in alignment, and though I love the firm, it still causes me pain. MAYBE it's because I have scoliosis and my curvature of the spine is so wacko, I have to sleep in my wacko positions for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>Despite all that. I think this is one of the best mattresses. It just didn't work for me. So in summary= This is a hardish, firm and very supportive bed. I found it best for sleeping on my back, despite me being a stomach sleeper. The side sleeping also works pretty well, (I sometimes add sore shoulders in the morning). Very little off gassing, as in you have to get your face to the foam literally and sniff to smell it. Cover is a bit loose underneath but attractive. A very decent mattress. Still a little bit too much for me pay for aches...maybe scoliosis ? who knows.
 So glad that my sister told me about this bed! It's fantastic.
 Love this bed!!
 My husband and I decided we needed a King mattress after my son decided he preferred sleeping with us in our queen-sized bed.  After a few nights where I was (literally) kicked out of bed by my son, we looked for a new mattress.  I was nervous about trying a boxed mattress, but I have to say that I have been very, very happy with our mattress!  It was a snap to unbox and unroll, and was ready to lay on in about ten minutes or less.  It's a just-right Goldilocks dream- not too firm, not too soft.  I have had the best night's sleep on this mattress- kid in the bed or no!  Now there is room for everyone, AND it is far more supportive and comfortable than our old traditional spring mattress.  Two thumbs up!  One note:  It *does* seem to sleep hot for me, but YMMV.
 I wouldn't say it's a "prefect" bed. Its a little on the stiff side for me but maybe I'm not heavy enough at 170lbs. This is probably the best value for foam mattress. It ships very neatly and very managable for 2 people or 1 strong person to move around. Overall I like it and it's a good value.
 If there's any doubt whether you can handle a firm non memory foam mattress,  save yourself the trouble and time and skip this mattress.<br/> I purchased a king size mattress directly from t&amp;n. I'm writing this review as I go to sleep... but mostly toss and turn.  I've been sleeping on it for a good few months now.  It's been some of the most difficult nights sleeping I've had.  I really wanted to like this mattress,  but it has all the problems associated with too much firmness.<br/><br/>This mattress is way to firm for me.  I'm sure it would be better with a topper, but given the price,  it's no bargain in its class.  Set aside a bit more money and get a real memory foam mattress.<br/><br/>I read other reviews stating the same that were adjusted higher based on customer service.  I mistakenly assumed they fixed the issue with the mattress,  but now realize there was no fix. It's too late,  I own it! Hopefully this review saves others the trouble.
 Not a good user experience, did not fit well for CalKig.<br/><br/>Bad product design, dimensions are smaller than CalKing, causing backpain.  will be returing.
 Very comfortable and great support.
 Awesome mattress. Very comfortable.
 My body feels like it can finally rest on this mattress! All the tension from my body is released and I wake up feeling energized and refreshed.
 It has been a month now and it is working out perfectly.  My son sleeps well and says it is very comfortable.
 I'm not as happy as I thought I would be .. this is my 1st new mattress in 20 yrs.. I'm a single parent and have always had to prioritize..<br/>I was sooo happy when my Tuft &amp; Needle bed came I almost cried out of pure happiness! It's been almost a week and I feel like I'm only comfortable on the edge of the mattress because the middle seems too soft, almost like it sags in the middle.. has anyone else had this problem? I have it on a frame and a queen size  bunky board? Should I buy a box spring? I did at it of online searching and homework for a new mattress and I thought this would be perfect for me and my wallet.. I'm disappointed but going to give it a few more days before I call company.
 I am so pleased with this mattress in every way, and with the company that creates it. When I think of what I went through (and the ridiculous expense) getting my older memory foam mattress three years ago, I wish I'd known of Tuft &amp; Needle then. This new mattress arrived quickly, packed tightly in wrap. Once I opened the wrapping, it unfolded and expanded more quickly than I expected. By nighttime it was perfectly in place on top of the Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase I also ordered. This mattress is extremely well made, and oh so comfortable. My college son likes it so much he wants to figure out how to take it back to school with himI To find a mattress of this quality and comfort made in the USA was a bonus; I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good night's sleep.
 I've had Mattress right at two months now it is very comfortable and is an awesome value. I am very pleased.
 Love it!  Comfy and cozy!  Easy to carry and unroll.
 This is a quality mattress. It arrived well packaged and was easy to open up and place on bed. It had absolutely no smell as in some memory foams. We have a 1 story house so could drag to bedroom...but probably a bit heavy to haul up stairs without 2 people. We had high hopes for this mattress. We had a spring mattress that was a good brand but seemed too soft and saggy with arthritis in back and hip. This mattress is pretty firm and again for people with arthritis, it may be a little too hard. It also has the issue of sleeping a bit warm. We had a mattress cover made of cotton on it and it was way too hot. Then we tried a lambswool cover that someone told us about and still pretty warm. I called the company and they were very nice and advised that we use just sheets and no mattress cover. We tried that for a week, and although we could tell a difference...(must be the construction of material requires almost full body contact to dissipate heat) it was still too warm for us.<br/>Reluctantly we called Amazon, and as always gave they us great service in arranging the return.<br/>I would have rated this mattress high but for my arthritis issues, but there are also as minor points; I think to be able to use a mattress pad is essential...I don't like sleeping on old ick and body oils etc that go through sheets. It did not look easy to wash the mattress covering it came with although there is a zipper.  So if sleeping hot is not an issue then use a pad, and also profile of mattress is a bit thin...I guess not used to the look of a 10-11 inch mattress anymore. This mattress has more give than a rock hard mattress, but still not conforming enough for some.
 This mattress really absorbs movement so there is no bouncing or shifting when the other person gets out of bed or changes positions.
 Easy set up took me all of 15<br/>Minutes to set up.
 its  very  comfortable  ... I  sleep better  than I have in  years......buy  the  pillows  too
 Great bed!!! Was very skeptical to purchase a mattress online but glad I did. It is more on the firm side of things but not uncomfortable at all.
 Only been several weeks, but since purchasing I have slept full nights. No complaints
 I love this mattress. It arrived faster than expected, was easy to set up, and, with my previously-owned topper, is extremely comfortable. That being said, I haven't slept on it without the topper so I can't attest to the firmess.
 Oh my goodness, I love LOVE this bed! It did take some getting used to, but it is the BEST bed I have ever had!
 After three months of use. Still has firmness and a pleasure to sleep on.
 I ordered a Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress along with another brand at the same time for my new condo.  The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress that arrived was for the guest room. My son was visiting and he couldn't believe how easy it was to "unwrap", as it unfolds itself!  He slept for 12 hours the first night it was so comfortable!  I waited 2 weeks to find out the 'other' mattress I ordered wandered around the country a couple of times and never found me. So I ordered another Tuft &amp; Needle!  It came swiftly, and I opened it and cut it open myself, and I'm 76 years old!  Love, love it.  I bought it because I loved the company story, and read and saw the videos of all the wonderful reviews. Do yourself a favor, look no further….buy a Tuft and Needle.  Be sure to get a good matters cover……Thanks!<br/>Judy<br/>Singer Island, FL
 My back did not creek and pop when I got out of bed this morning!I'll see how it goes but love it so far
 wonderful
 I got this mattress after struggling with morning back pain for 6 months. I'd tried everything (stretches, chiro, strengthening, PT, foam rollin, you name it) except replacing my 2-year old middle of the road ikea mattress. After reading about the great reviews and how it's extra-firmness would be good for my back I figured it would be worth a try.<br/><br/>So I gave it a month but didn't notice any improvement over my cheap ikea mattress. Yes, the mattress feels nice, but I can't maintain a comfortable position for more than a few minutes with strategic positioning of pillows.<br/><br/>Which brings up the other problem. It's hot. Now it's not crazy-sweaty hot like some foam mattress, and yes, I'm not a little guy and I generate a lot of body heat. But even in the bay area's mild summer I had to sleep with no pillows around me and no sheets on the bed. My partner who's of the always-cold variety confirms that the mattress gets pretty hot.<br/><br/>So after a disappointing month trial I found out my biggest problem- I bought it on amazon. I'd read about the great 100-day return policy, but, my bad, didn't notice it's only 30 days on amazon. So now I'm stuck with it.<br/><br/>I'm a stubborn fellow so I've continued using the mattress with a combination of fans when it's hot and lots of pillows to make things comfortable. But I'm still tossing and turning every night from one almost-comfortable position to another. Now I'm on amazon again trying to either find a replacement mattress or some kind of topper that might fix the heat and stiff back I have every morning.
 An excellent buy, comfortable, getting good nights of sleep and waking up rested.
 Bought one for each of my college boys.  They absolutely love the mattresses.  Super comfortable.
 So far so good!! Easy set up and a restful first month! I have back problems and I've been sleeping well. It's pretty firm which I like but my husband says its a bit too firm for him.
 I think most mattresses are overpriced.  Read about this one.  I like their sales plan!
 seems to be great :0
 I did my research, read reviews, and decided to try Tuft &amp; Needle based on what I read about them.  My dad used my mattress first and loved it so much I bought him one for his room so he had a comfy place to sleep on his summer visits. When I finally got my mattress in my room, I had it on the floor due to the frame I'm building not being ready. No worried, so happy without, sleeping better than I have in a long time.  Changing the sheets one day I noticed something odd, and upon further investigation I notice the entire bottom of the mattress covered in mold! And the area under the mattress soaked. What? What is happening? I'm panicked and not sure what to do. I call Tuft &amp; Needle and speak with an amazing representative who listens, and explains what has happened prior to transferring me to another amazing representative who tells me not to worry.  She explains that she's going to need some things from me and emails me the breakdown.  I got this mattress I June and I am just so upset that I didn't think about propping it up to air it out.  I get an email telling me my new mattress is on the way.  So excited! And, they arrange for a company to come and remove the old one. None of this cost me anything.  It took just a few days and it was done.  I haven't stopped talking about how thrilled I am with this company. Not because they replaced the mattress. They didn't have to. But they did,  I'm thrilled with how professional and understanding they were. That they didn't treat me like an idiot for what happened.  And the mattress itself is so comfortable. Really just the best mattress I have had ever. And I am recommending them to everybody I know. Huge fan of their product and their people.
 Wow, great mattress.  For the price, for the workmanship, and particularly for the delivery (free in less than 24 hours!)  I don't care for the advertisement, citing "greed" as the reason other companies charge more, although this may be a factor, but it is always a subjective one.  "Greed" is a catchword used as a negative judgement which implies that there are/may be others in commerce who are not interested in making money.  I am sure this is not the case, and it is a little like saying that people who are "breathers" use more air than people who d ....oh, yeah.  Thank goodness for "greed" which has allowed us to develop our intricate interdependent trading system which benefits all!  Ahem.  That said, mattress had very little (noticeable) out-gassing, was a blast to unpack, (same rules as for an auto-inflatable air mattress, move the furniture first!) and we are enjoying it already.  Not too firm, not too soft, and we have over 100 pounds variability  among our different family members who all find it quite comfortable.  Would recommend.
 Wish there were two ratings, one for the product and one for the company.<br/>My wife is pregnant, we needed to step it up to a bigger mattress and T&amp;N was coming up huge in our research.  We received our King mattress almost ten days ago, its still off-gassing and putting out bad smells.<br/>We couldn't keep it, and this is where I would like to give 5 plus stars to the company.  They were outstanding with us, told us to donate the mattress and apologized.  Even congratulated us on our pregnancy followed up with a mention of their toddler.<br/>I really wish it would have worked out, but no more "petro/polly" made mattresses for us anymore, took a huge leap into all organic bedding, pricey, but worth it!
 great buy
 GREAT PRODUCT!  I bought three of them and my kids love them.
 This review is based on 8 months after buying this Cal King for my parents and a queen for myself.  l had hight hopes for these T&amp;N's. Not to be confused with hight expectations. After realizing that l can't say that I've had a good night sleep since getting these, l spoke to my parents to see if it was just me. Long story short, they told me the same thing plus it just so happened that within the last couple of weeks all three of us woke up one morning with a horrible stiffness to our necks, not to mention the amount of heat that these mattresses retain.  As l mentioned, l had high hopes because l read really good things about T&amp;N, specially when it came to lower back pain. The reason l say high hopes and not high expectations is because l don't like to set myself up for disappointment, even though it happens sometimes.
 Love it! A little firm at first. But, by the end of the week I wouldn't want to give it up.
 I love this mattress!! Best sleep I've had in years. My kids won't sleep in their own beds now. Ordering them each a twin soon!!
 Great product. Firm mattress. Met all my expectations.
 This 10in King mattress is lovely and well-priced. When we unpacked it we didn't really notice a harsh chemical smell. After two nights of letting it inflate and air out, we had the best night's sleep. I like beds firm while my husband likes them on the softer side. Oddly enough, I find it to be quite firm and he thinks it's nice and soft! They seem to have figured out the right sweet spot. Very happy with our purchase and have recommended widely.
 I love this bed. Best for the price.
 Excellent product,  great service, fast shopping, great packaging.  The mattress is unbelievably comfortable. Will repeat the purchase next time I need a new mattress.
 After my bed floated away, thank you hurrican harvey, i was forced to sleep on an air mattress that eventually started deflating by morning. Now I sleep like a baby...on a cloud.
 Still adjusting to one another but I think it's going to be great
 Perfectly firm bed.
 Totally worth.
 I love the comfort of this mattress.  I have encouraged my friends to purchase one!
 This is a great mattress for the money!!
 Awesome sleeping experience
 I've had such a great sleep on this mattress since I've started using it. I'm never too hot, and never feel the need to reposition myself during the night. Very pleased with the product after about a week of use and I'm hopeful that the quality will last through years of use.
 Really nice mattress. It was a little soft, but overall a very comfortable mattress.
 So far so good - just received this mattress a few days ago. Looks great and I hope it holds its shape. Minor petro smell the first day, but very mild.
 Easy to get bed into house and upstairs!  Even easier to set up.  Totally comfortable!  Rave reviews from my first guest!
 Unbelievable bed, and very easy set up. Got delivered in a timely manner. Would recommend to bed to anyone.
 most comfortable mattress i have ever slept on
 LOVE this mattress.
 I had no chemical smell when I first got it so I did not need to wait 24 hrs after opening it. It is the best bed I have owned.
 Very comfortable! Like better than memory foam.
 Love, love, love!!!
 So far I love this mattress
 Mattress is terrific, comfortable and affordable!
 You can not and will not find a better mattress for this price. Tuft &amp; Needle has impressed me with quality and customer service!
 Love the mattresses. Very comfortable. Wish it had hand grips.
 Packaged well, quality material, shaped well, very comfortable right off the bat.
 Weird getting a mattress shrink wrapped in a box...I expected it to be a bit more firm .especially since I'm a 6'1" 230 lb man. I will say though that my back feels much better so it must be working !
 We love our mattress! Was so skeptical but now I’m all in!
 Ahhhhhh!  Have had hip and back problems for years and woke up stiff and sore.  Not any more!!!
 For all the "look how modern and cool this mattress is" you see in the ads, I've actually found myself lying on it thinking, "hey this mattress is pretty great. And fairly priced. How modern. And cool."
 Wow! did I say Wow! What a great mattress. I was a little leery about spending this much on a mattress I could not touch and feel first, but Wow. I opened it up in another room and let open up for about two days, whether it needed it or not I just decided to do that. First night I slept on this mattress I was in love. I have had 3 spinal surgeries and it has taken me years to find a mattress like this. I tried them all, sleep numbers bed, Sealy Posturepedic, and some of the NASA foam beds. But this bed by far has been the best. I'm not saying the others are bad products, I'm just saying it just did not do the job for me. When I wake up in the morning its easy to get out of bed and no pain. I can't believe that this bed can even exist. Thank you so much....
 We weren't sure if it would be firm enough, but we have it on a slatted platform bed and it's perfect.
 A bit hard, but a mattress topper solved this well.
 If you don’t like an extra firm mattress don’t buy this. I thought it was medium I was wrong. ☹️
 Love this mattress. Sleep like a baby. Stays cool, supportive with enough give.
 Showed up packaged correctly and super easy to set up. In love
 NO complaints.  best priced cali king that me and my significant other can sleep comfortably on
 Its very comfy I got it for my child and he loves it.He thinks its kind of hard though.
 Awesome mattress. Both my wife and I absolutely love this mattress. The only issue I have is that this mattress is so comfortable its difficult to stay awake lol.
 Best mattress I ever owned.  I am so happy that I found it on Amazon.  I read reviews on so many mattresses before selecting this one.  I purchased a platform to place the mattress on.  I am amazed at how firm and yet comfortable this mattress is!  I sleep so well on this mattress.  I am thankful that it is a high quality mattress at an affordable price.  I did not detect any odor on it and I am highly sensitive  to smells.  One of the best choices I have ever made.<br/><br/>5/9/17<br/>The previous review was for the first Tuft and Needle mattress I purchased in 2014.<br/>My second Tuft and Needle mattress arrived today.  This time I ordered a queen size mattress.  I saved for what seemed like an eternity to buy it .  I feel sick about this one.  It has a horrible strong odor.  I called Tuft and Needle and asked if they changed the manufacturing  process since I bought the twin Tuft and Needle in 2014.  She told me they had not.  She suggested that I let it sit out overnight.  The odor can be smelled throughout my entire apartment.  I doubt if this strong odor is ever going to go away.<br/>I cannot return it because it took every bit of my strength to get it out of the box and placed on the box Spring.  The UPS man carried it into my bedroom for me .<br/>I am more disappointed than I have ever been about any purchase I have ever made.<br/><br/>5/27/17<br/>The company has excellent customer service.  I was able to get my mattress replaced last week.  It had a slight chemical smell which has mostly dissipated by now.<br/>I found out that they did change their manufacturing of their mattress foams since I purchased my first mattress in 2014.<br/>The first mattress had absolutely no odor and was the best mattress on which I had ever slept.  After a week of sleeping on this mattress, I have lower abdominal and hip pain. It just does not provide the support that their original mattress provided.<br/>9/12/17<br/>I have constant abdominal and hip pain after sleeping on this mattress for 4 months.  The foam is very hot to sleep on and when it is hot it has a strong odor.<br/>Horrible.  I am now saving for another mattress and also saving to have this one hauled away!
 Amazing! True to size, came in T&amp;N shipping box, and super comfortable
 Firm yet soft
 Have owned this mattress for 10 months. The first few months I loved it but after that I started waking up with sore shoulders. I thought it was just my shoulders but after going on vacation two weeks ago I now know it is the mattress. My shoulders were never sore on vacation and as soon as I got home and slept in my own bed they hurt again. I have bought 8 different pillows in the last few months and none make a difference. I took my own pillow on vacation and had no issues.<br/>Now I am considering buying a mattress topper but hate that I have to spend that money when this mattress is brand new. Uggghhh.<br/>When I first bought this I told everyone how great the buying experience and mattress was. My nephew even then purchased one. Now I would have to tell others to reconsider buying this mattress. Makes me sad because I feel like I wasted money and I love it when I can brag about a purchase.
 Coming from a futon, it is too soft for me, but not too bad. It does not seem to affect back pain either way (exercise does! :) )<br/>- Don't kid yourself, no matter what they say about layers, it gets hot just because you sink into it.<br/>- It is rather soft, I'd say, but it offers decent isolation, i.e. when you bounce, your partner does not (an opposite of a waterbed :) )<br/>- It is very easy to get off from, as the edge has no rim, and you sort of roll off it easily as it compresses. Careful, if you are still sleeping :)<br/>- It is interesting that you can lie on it like half-turn, and that that position is stable. Kinda fun. Probably how the support and softness work out.<br/>- Opening it up is a fun experience! It bulks up in seconds - cut the plastic wrap and watch it grow!<br/>- It does have some smell, even though maybe not as much as your run-of-the-mill foam mattress. We've let it vent for several days, and it is fine after.<br/>Overall, not too bad. I would personally stick with a futon, though.
 Lightweight, easy to handle, comfortable at first. Not for 300 pounds.
 Best mattress ever! Would highly recommend to anyone!
 Great mattress. Great price. Made in the USA. enough said...
 I love it
 Love this mattress! I slept like a log last night. It's really easy to unpack, and it's just the right balance of firmness and squishy cloud-ness. Seems like a great value for the price.
 This is absolutely the most comfortable mattress I've ever had in my life! Worth every penny.
 The Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on.  Highly Recommend.
 A friend told me that I was going to get to sleep on her Tuft &amp; Needle mattress when visiting her guest room. She said that she and her husband loved theirs. After returning 2 others to a big box company, I'm happy to say, we love our new mattress! Just love it!
 Love the bed.
 Love it!! It took a few days to really take form but it was worth the wait. My back has never felt better!
 My wife loves it. good product
 I love my Tuft &amp; Needle!! I was without my memory foam mattress for 2 years. It is good to have a restful sleep again!!!
 Too soft for us. Back was starting to hurt.
 After fifteen months of owning the mattress, the one side I’ve been sleeping on started to sink dramatically in comparison to the other side.  That caused me a tremendous lower back pain every night.  I tried to return it but Tuft &amp; Needle sent me a one time replacement.  I just hoped this would last for ten years as they said.  I’ll never buy this brand again.
 So far, so good. This is an incredibly comfortable mattress, I recommended it to my friend who was looking for a firm mattress. I've found myself anticipating getting home from vacation because my bed is better than most others that I've slept on. I wouldn't say this is too firm or too soft. It provides great support for my back (I get reoccurring back pain from work) and it's a dream to flop onto. I'm 120lbs soaking wet but the mattress hugs my body well, I haven't found that I'm too light for the mattress to support me.<br/><br/> I'd probably buy a mattress protector; this one comes with a cover on it but I'd recommend getting another. It fits well on our bed frame and doesn't sag anywhere. It fits the sheets well and has ample room for us to sprawl out. It's also not too heavy. It arrived at about 90lbs in a box and took less than ten minutes to fully inflate. It was easy for me to move, weight wise. It's more bulky than anything when it comes to moving.<br/><br/>For those wondering about "bounce", it's got very little bounce. =)
 Best sleep I've had in years! Be warned, you won't need blankets as heavy as with a normal mattress, or you'll wake up in sweat. Other than that...  magnificent!
 Absolutely perfect
 I don't know about the many positive reviews but I had a hard time to adjust to this bed. It is unbelievably firm almost like sleeping on the floor. I wanted to like this product but unfortunately it didn't work out at the end.
 A very comfortable mattress. Expensive, but well worth the money.
 Awesome bed, awesome price.
 DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER MATRESS! We are upgrading all of our mattresses to Tuft and Needle, product is awesome. Delivery is flawless. Price is unbeatable. Any other questions?
 We have had the mattress for going on 2 months and have never slept better!
 Buy this mattress. We have a queen and a twin for our 16 year old. I have had traditional, pillow top and a far inferior "memory foam" mattress. I am quite satisfied with my Tuft&amp;Needle.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it's that I am occasionally unable to find a constantly comfortable spot to sleep. If I'm honest I would tend to lean towards blaming most of it on my failing body and over-active midnight mind.<br/><br/>We also recently advised my Mum to get one for her husband,  who's been having difficulty staying asleep. Though it had been only a week or so I've heard no complaints and reports of restful nights.<br/><br/>All in all this is a solidly constructed mattress that I,  without reservation,  recommend you purchase. I am no expert, by any means, I can only provide feedback on my experiences.<br/><br/>Bottom line,  I looked at and read/viewed multiple reviews for Serta,  Temperpedic, Casper and liked what I saw regarding Tuft &amp; Needle. I have yet to be disappointed in my purchase.<br/><br/>If nothing else,  opening the vacuumed sealed package and watching the mattress "inflate" is happy magic...simple pleasures.
 It is a good quality mattress at a fair price.  For those people looking for a bed on the firmer size, please consider something else.  This bed is definitely more of a "medium" firmness.
 Super comfortable! I love that as a single woman I was able to easily get this in my bedroom and set it up with no assistance. I highly recommend it.
 I've had it for two days; it is a little firmer than a Casper mattress, but definitely very comfortable, and lives up to its hype.
 Buy this mattress!  We purchased a twin T&amp;N Mattress for our daughter and she is sleeping soundly and comfortably on it - she absolutely loves it.  I should mention she has sensory issues - so pressure is important - we needed a mattress that would not be too firm or too soft, but would feel like a supportive hug - if that makes sense.  That's exactly how this mattress is.  You lay on it and you sink - just a little.  Then, you feel supported.  I love laying on it myself.  My husband and I have a very expensive mattress and adjustable frame - we literally spent thousands on it.  Yet, my husband keeps teasing he's going to take over the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress for himself.  Everyone is different, so you might not love it as much as we do, but since they stand behind their product, I'd say it's worth the chance!  By the way, it plumped up very quickly and we did not notice any off-gassing.  To be on the safe side we let it air for about a day - but probably didn't really need to.  Good purchase, very satisfied.
 Sleeps very good. Would definitely purchase again in the future.
 The mattresses are exactly what the manufacturer said they would be. Very very comfortable. I love them!
 We have two of these mattresses and love them!
 I love this mattress! I'm sleeping better than I have in years!
 Teenage boys are on cloud 9!  T &amp; N offers a great quality mattress for the price!  Amazon Prime got it here on time and we didn't have to set foot in a store.
 Great mattress
 Really happy with mine.
 So cozy. I ended up adding a 1.5" topper to make it softer -- sleeping on a cloud.
 So easy
 Sleeping on a cloud from heaven. I've had back and neck pains from my old bed (futon), this bed had given me the best sleep!!! My son loves it as well!
 Bought this mattress a month ago because I was crawling out of bed due to back pain. The pain has subsided and I am getting great sleep!  Would recommend this mattress to anyone and everyone.  It is a firm mattress but soft.
 so far so good, comfortable not to warm sleeping on it. hoping none of the negative reviews come true over next few months regarding it losing its resilience.
 Loved my new mattress, very comfortable!!!
 So far so good. It does have an odor that seems to be going away after about 4 days. Soft yet firm and supportive.
 I have now purchased a total of 3 Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses and can truly attest to how wonderful they are.  We first bought one for our guest bedroom in our primary home and have had it for about a year and a half.  We ask all of our guests about it and the feedback has been consistently that they find it to be very comfortable - not too firm and not too soft.  We recently purchased 2 more queen mattresses for our vacation home, one in our bedroom and the other in the guest bedroom.  Now that we're sleeping on one ourselves, we would agree with the guest feedback.  I personally find the firmness to be just perfect.  My husband and I also like different firmness levels (he usually like more firm than I) and yet we both find it equally comfortable.  The order process was easy, delivery was quick and it's kind of fun to watch a queen size mattress come out of the box and plump up once the plastic covering is removed.  I would order another one in a heart beat and recommend this brand to others.
 i like it i sleep all night
 I do find it a bit too soft, but overall it's ok.
 Comfortable and home delivery; what's not to like.
 Love love love this bed.
 I was sent by Tuft &amp; Needle the matteress topper and know we love our Tuft &amp; Needle matteress and topper.
 Got this to replace a two year old Spa Sensations 12" memory foam mattress from Wal-Mart. The memory foam mattress held in too much heat and got too soft over the past two years. At 27 years old, it was causing my wife and I neck, shoulder, and back pain. The reviews looked amazing on this mattress, plus the 30 day no hassle return policy made it worthwhile to order.<br/><br/>The mattress came in 3 days. It was packaged in a 60"x20"x20" box. Opened it up and it was very well packaged. Cut off all of the plastic and it expanded nearly instantly with no noticeable scent unless I was to bury my face in it. I let it sit for 12 hours before taking it for a test ride.<br/><br/>Initial impressions: very firm, but in a very comfortable way. It doesn't feel like memory foam, there's no sinking over time. But it does not feel like a board either. Support is just right for us. There was no residual scent.<br/><br/>The morning after: Felt great. It's going to take some time to get used to not sinking in to the mattress, but even so, we both love the level of support this mattress gives.
 Great mattress!!
 Very comfortable bed that holds its shape tremendously. Would most definitely buy this product again.
 I bought a different mattress from Amazon that other sites said was good for fat guys.  I weigh 375 and am a side sleeper.  The first mattress was causing me terrible hip pain after about a week.  "Give it time" they kept telling me but the pain got worse.  I finally got up one day and said enough was enough.  Even with a topper I still had horrible hip pain every morning.  I then bought this mattress because it said it was good for 500lbs per person.  The first night I still had the pain BUT it was just a little less.  Now it's been a week and the hip pain is pretty much gone.  It feels soft but it supports me very well.<br/><br/>I know it's only been a week but I feel so much better.  I just hope it lasts.  I guess time will tell.  Thanks Tuft and Needle!<br/><br/>UPDATE!!!  I'm sorry but I have to lower my rating to 3 stars.  The hip pain is back and even with a topper I'm still not comfortable.  Oh well.  back to the drawing board.  Why is mattress shopping such a PITA?
 This mattress was recommended to me as a quality inexpensive intro into memory foam mattresses. I liked the easy order and delivery process as well as the idea of coupling it with the Sleep Master SmartBase foundation. However, after sleeping on it for over 2 months I cannot say that I am happy with my purchase. I am a 20 something year old side sleeper that has never had back issues in my life, but now I am waking up in the morning with a terrible crick in my neck and back pains throughout most of the day. The mattress itself just seems to firm for someone who sleeps on their side and my weight does not seem to make an indentation in it at all. I was aware of a period needed to "break the mattress in" and so I kept expecting it to get better, however after spending a couple nights on another memory foam mattress recently, I believe that I either received a defective mattress or chose wrong in my mattress shopping decision. I am disappointed to have to write this review about a mattress that I was really hoping to like, but it has become apparent that I will likely have to switch to another mattress soon in order to avoid future back problems. For this reason, I cannot recommend someone buying this mattress without trying it out first.
 Best sleep I've had in a very long time, took about 3 days to get used to the medium firmness but still slept very well, my girlfriend noticed a huge difference with stiffness pain as it was no longer there, I would gladly do a commercial for these guys!  (-:
 Bought this for my husband and I for our bedroom. We have had it for a year now and if I could go back in time I would not have bought this. Sheets are a pain to put on because the mattress is so heavy and floppy. Also, now that we’ve had it for some time, the sides have started to squish out. I’ve also been unable to find a way to remove any stains because this mattress is literally just a gigantic sponge and you can’t flip it either because it’s one sided. Also, it absorbs heat and holds onto it which is terrible for California but maybe good for a colder climate?<br/>But, my husband thinks it’s somewhat comfortable and I think it’s better than sleeping on the floor. So 2/5 stars..
 I have two of these; one I've been sleeping on every night for two years and one in my guest room that has had occasional use off and on for 18 months.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic mattress; by far the best I've ever owned and I've had a a few fancy mattresses that cost a heck of a lot more.  It ships rolled up and is easy to move up narrow staircases.<br/><br/>I'm not a small guy (apparently; 6'3" and over 200 lbs) and I haven't noticed any sagging or other issues.  To me it doesn't sleep hot, and I tend to be temperature sensitive.  I put a Nordstrom-branded mattresses cover on both of my beds, which adds a bit of softness and protects the bed.<br/><br/>I love this mattress!
 A perfect bed for those on a Budget
 like price USA made.<br/>nothing is perfect but close
 Anything is better than what I had, but after only 3 days of sleeping on this bed my crippling morning back pain has disappeared. It is a dream. It is like sleeping on air. I can't feel when my boyfriend gets in and out of bed. I woke up 2 hours earlier than usual this morning with energy and an improved mood! And this is from someone who hates mornings, waking up, and life in general. Just buy the dang bed! The shipping was fast, the bed expanded within a minute of unwrapping (so cool to watch), and most importantly––it's a great bed! It may have even improved my sex drive...<br/>so fellas out there with girlfriends or wives or husbands or boyfriends or many friends who are "too tired," think about it.
 We've been using the mattress for a couple weeks.  Both my husband and I are waking up in less pain than we were with our old mattress.  It is very comfortable.
 A little firmer than expected, but good
 I must admit it was tough to buy a mattress online. I must have read reviews for hours, bouncing back and forth between latex and memory foam. I finally stumbled upon Tuft &amp; Needle and liked everything I read, not just the customer reviews but about the company itself. They are an American company whose products are actually made in America. They stand behind their mattresses with impressive guarantees. But at the end of the day none of that really matters if the product isn't any good. I'm happy to say the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is excellent! Just the right amount of support for me. I'm fairly light at 145lbs and the first few nights I was worried it was too firm for me but by the end of the first week I knew it was a keeper. It's only been a month so I can't comment on longevity but I'm very pleased with my decision to purchase this mattress.
 Easy to get up a difficult flight of stairs very comfortable.
 This mattress is amazing! Provides firmness with a soft top layer that hugs the body. Great support if you suffer from chronic pain.
 broke in nicely at first and less than 60 days in already have one side that seems a loft softer than the other so seems to slant down from my wife's side to my side when we are both on the mattress. I am not that large of a guy(180lbs) so figured it would not have any issues but guess I was wrong.
 AWESOME, awesome,awesome😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
 Love it.  No more waking up to reposition, just sleep thru the night :)
 Too firm for me as I’m a side sleeper. Had neck pain when I woke up which I have never had before this mattress.
 Bought the product originally for my wife didn’t like for first couple weeks but now sleeps well actually helped her back issues.
 This is a lot better than the generic memery  foam  I had, which was old and needing  replaced, but even when new was too soft. I tried Getting by with a 3 inch topper, but it felt like I was sinking,  and I'm a small person, 150 lbs. , I purchased this  for a review  said it was as good as a casper  or leeza, but cheaper  and had the same return  policy.  I liked it at the very first.  I have back issues,  it seemed not to soft, not to firm. This is my second  month,  occasionally I still have nights when  my back bothers me,  but probably will  have that no matter what  I get. I think I'll keep it, but may try to get something  a bit more  firm in the future.
 Very comfortable after we got used to a firmer mattress vs. our older one. Prompt delivery, easy setup. Very pleased
 In love with this mattress ! It is so comfortable and my back no longer is hurting!
 Love this mattress! no back pain, wasn’t heavy at all. It’s everything I wanted
 This mattress was way too soft for me. Called Amazon within 30 days and they refunded the purchase as a large item. Asked that I donate to charity. Will do so.
 As advertised. Soft/responsive almost like a Tempurpedic, but sleeps cool, which is what we were looking for.
 This mattress is so comfy. I really don't have anything bad to say about it. We have it on the floor and we sleep so soundly. Glad we got this and not the Casper. Also it is affordable!
 Don’t get on this bed unless you’re planning to go to sleep immediately.  It’s firm, yet soft.  My mom is a mattress snob, but loves this mattress  - she’s staying with us while her femur break heals.  She’s complimented this bed frequently which is a HUGE deal.  Tuft &amp; Needle is a rockstar organization in this household for sure!!  ***i wasgoing to add a pic of my mom completely cracked out in the bed, but she had different thoughts on that and, so, no pics of my mom in mimis....
 The bed is good. I'm getting sleepy; this bed makes it better. I'm getting horny; this bed makes it better.
 The mattress comes compressed in a box.  In 10 minutes I had it unwrapped and laid out on my box spring.  In about an hour, it had expanded and flattened out to it's full shape.  Frankly, I had modest expectations.  Who would buy a mattress without being able to try it out?  However, 6,000 Amazon reviews averaging 4 1/2 stars couldn't be wrong.  They weren't.  I weight 240, and am 6'3" and sleep on my back.  For three nights, I have not turned over once.  It's amazing how supportive the mattress is.  I expected it to be hot and to feel like I was laying on a large marshmellow, but this company has figured it out.  My wife, who is a side sleeper, didn't like it as well.  However, this was perfect for me and the price point was an added bonus.  I'm glad I took the chance, and my thanks to all other reviewers for helping me make the choice.  One of the reviewers advised against using a quilted cover, so I only used sheets, and it has not been hot at all.  Would buy this again and highly recommend.
 Dislike not what I was expecting
 Mattress is outstanding!
 This was recommended to me by a friend, I received in  July, and I must say this is a wonderful bed.
 Nice but a little firm I think I am going to put a topper on it.
 After a year we still love it.
 Very nice mattress. Would buy again!
 The best bed I ever owned!  Sooo comfortable that I look forward to laying down and going to sleep every night!
 Very comfortable...much better than my worn spring mattress. Sleeps firm and cool.
 After sleeping on the same Serta mattress for the past 8 years, I knew it was time to get a new mattress after having back pain on most mornings. I didn't really want to go to a mattress store because I definitely believe the markup is substantial. I wanted something that was comfortable but also a mattress that most consider to be a good product. After reading the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere across the web, I felt like Tuft &amp; Needle might be the way to go. I checked out their website and I was amazed at what went into constructing their mattresses. I also checked out their closest competitor, Casper. Both seemed to be pretty good but I also liked the fact that Tuft &amp; Needle was closer to my price point. After reading about their return policy, in case I didn't like it, I decided to give Tuft &amp; Needle a shot.<br/><br/>"Wow" is pretty much all I can say. The mattress came only a few days later in a box on my doorstep. Unpacking was a breeze and after you cut away the plastic, it only takes about a minute or so for the mattress to come to life. After sleeping on it for the past week, I can definitely say I've noticed a considerable difference in how I feel in the mornings. I also noticed that it takes much less time to actually fall asleep. So far I'm very happy with this mattress and I highly recommend it to others in search of a new bed.
 Just okay. Not great but not bad.  Have only slept on it 4 night but so far can’t stay comfortable for long without having to move. Will update again as used more.
 Never as good as you hope. But this is a good mattress and I will keep it.
 A great mattress. I am enjoying sleeping on it.
 this is the second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress we have purchased and are extremely pleased with both.  Great product and company to deal with.
 We LOVE this mattress! We replaced a $2500 traditional pillow top mattress with this one and have not regretted it for a minute.
 We love this mattress
 I LOVE it!!  After researching mattresses for a year or so I  finally decided on Tuft and Needle's full size 10". Slept on this last night and had,the best sleep I've had in years. Not as hard as I thought it would be due to the reviews.  I'd give it a 7/10; just enough softness with the support your body needs. Because I was nervous it might be too hard I bought a mattress topper/pad from Eluxury which added another layer of heaven. Thank you Tuft and Needle!  Wonderful product I'm happy to put my stamp of approval on!  Cheers!!
 the bed had some smells but not too bad; and I am very sensitive to smell so probably most people will not notice.<br/>I tried sleeping on it for 2 nights and the I didn't sleep too well, my back hurt a little and it took 2 nights for me to recover.  it said 95% of people kept the bed so that I means I fit into that 5% category.  I was worried about the return policy but it wasn't too difficult, I had to get on the phone but it was resolved with one phone call.  They must stand their product for them to do this, even though it wasn't for me, I would recommend this product and try, you may fit into that 95%
 Best sleep ever!!!!!
 The edge of the mattress seems unstable
 Still amazing that this mattress came in a box!  This mattress is the most comfortable That my husband and I have ever bought.  The price is incredible!!!! There is a odor I hope it goes away.
 Great mattress! I have had it for ~6 months and I can honestly say it is one of the most comfortable mattresses I have slept on. It is moderately firm. We are not using a frame or a box spring mattress.
 GREAT mattress at affordable price!  Came right into shape after following the unwrapping instructions and no strange smell.
 Best mattress... highly recommend.. I have a difficult time sleeping and this mattress has change my life!!
 I love you bed
 A little on the firm side but comfortable and supportive
 Really good for 3 months. After 8 months, it’s literally good for garbage. Very annoyed and disappointed by this purchase.
 so far so good.  seems quite comfortable and a great price comparatively.  arrived on time and as described!
 Fast delivery, very comfortable, once you open the box it inflated itself very quick, even the corners. No problem. Well spend money. We are very happy with this mattress.
 At first it needed breaking in, but it turned out to be the best mattress EVER!
 Very comfortable
 Very good mattres, love it
 I got a king size and it was easy to take out of box by myself. Not too heavy yet super comfy and firm.<br/>I recommend.
 I have so far had this mattress for 2 weeks, about halfway through my 30 day trial period. I read up a lot on the mattress before hand and decided this was the one I want based on other customers experiences. Tuft &amp; Needle is a great company and I have had great luck with them from the start. Why is this review only at 3 stars you may ask? Well, before using this mattress I had an old mattress that would give me terrible back pains when I wake up. I decided I couldn't take it anymore and needed to find a new mattress. I found this company, and ended up ordering one. While I waited the couple days for delivery I was sleeping on a blow up mattress. I would wake up with absolutely no back pains after sleeping on the blow up mattress which was very surprising as I thought they would be worse than an old mattress. Now that I am sleeping on this mattress, the back pains are back. I'm not sure if it's because the mattress is too firm or what, but it is quite firm. Maybe this is the issue.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Overall great company, great customer service, mattress doesn't help back pains. Might be too firm.
 First few nights with this bed has been great so far. I don't sleep hot but my last memory foam made me feel like i was in a volcano at night. This one is great. It retains some body heat but doesn't trap it. Great bed.
 We bought this because there were so many positive reviews. Well, this is one more. THE best mattress I have ever slept on. If someone stole the mattress tonight, I wouldn't go to bed until I had reordered it.
 This is the most comfortable mattress I have ever had.
 Firm mattress, sleeps a little warm. Can lay it out pretty much anywhere on the floor without even a frame and just roll it up whenever you don't need it.
 offers the back support I needed... no longer have back issues because of this mattress...
 I think is is fine. I have only had it a little while. So far it is good.
 This is a good mattress for what I paid last month $399.
 Awesome, beats the hell out of he 4800$ Sealy foam bun warmer we bought 10 years ago.
 Nice mattress. Pretty cozy. Does get a little warm, but overall I'm impressed.
 Very satisfied
 love our bed - but now don't want to get up.  The best ever
 These are awesome!!!!!  I'm completely satisfied withTuft and Needle mattresses!!
 LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! We ordered it for my mom ordered one and after just one night her back did not hurt.
 I call it my love bed because "I love it".It is just what I needed  .Love it a lot.  Thank you
 Great mattress, very easy set up. Gave us great night sleep...
 I really love this mattress, I can't tell you what a difference it has made it my sleep and it has drastically helped my chronic back pain. Somehow it is soft and firm at the same time. It offers great support.
 Awesome bed !!! Awesome price!!! Bought the bed a month ago and I am very happy I purchased the mattress.
 Very comfortable
 This bed is amazing, I definitely recommend it as it amazingly comfortable and also a great deal cheaper than most memory foam or latex mattresses.
 It was easy to set up and I felt that it was a great value.  My husband and I both agree it was the right mattress for us.
 feels great!!! great price!!!
 Loved the mattress but didn't work on my platform bed that has slats- kept sinking.
 Best mattress of my life! Recommend to all yearning a comfortable and affordable mattress.
 We absolutely adore these mattresses!  We got one for our 3-year-old as his first "big boy" bed and we all laid down on it and tried it out and loved it, so we bought a second for my 8-year-old!  Easy to set up, easy to unpack, inflates quickly.  It is a wonderful mix of the give of memory foam but the firmness of a solid mattress to get a mixed-feel mattress that doesn't appear to be severe in either area.  Very happy with the price vs. what you get and will happily purchase again -- and will likely be replacing our king master bed with a Tuft soon!
 I love this mattress more than I love my family
 It was soft in the middle and firmer on the edge it seemed. I didn't care for it.
 This mattress is so comfortable!  Great mattress!!
 This bed is awesome. Firm memory foam that you get a great nights sleep. Comes rolled up in a box delivered to your door. Never makes noise while taking care of business. Highly recommended. Super comfortable.
 Love LOVE love love LOVE!!! We've had our Tuft and Needle bed for almost a year now and my husband and I sleep like babies every night. My back pain has been all but eliminated thanks to this mattress. My husband is over 200 pounds and has no problem with the mattress sinking/being too thin. I have hip problems and this mattress cradles me just right to alleviate pressure on them. It was easy to unpack (I know it says you need two people, but I got it off my porch, up a flight of stairs, and onto my bed frame with no issues, alone). No weird smell that I noticed, and we slept on it just fine 4 hours after unwrapping it. I will only buy these mattresses from here on out for any room that needs them!
 fixed wife's back issue
 This is my second purchase  of a Tuft &amp; Needle bed love them
 Excellent, firm mattress that results in dreams every night. Easily manageable weight and size. I've slept on it now for three weeks.
 So far I like it , Not as sore anymore.
 Provides really good support. Heavier people might find themselves sinking but overall great mattress.
 Slept on this at my daughter's house and loved it. When we first got it I didn't know what to think.. It felt too firm. I added a 1" gel topper and now it's perfect for my bad back and arthritis. Better than the $1500 mattress we bought from Mattress Firm, save your money, buy this mattress instead. Wonderful customer service.
 Absolutely love this mattress.  I bought a queen for our camper and after spending several days camping i am going to replace our king sized sleep number we have in our home.
 Was dreading the hassle of buying a new mattress, I wanted comfortable sleep (I'm easy to please) &amp; wanted my ol' lady to be comfy too.  My old mattress had worn out (5 yrs), so I was kinda pissed because I had shelled out good money for it and it was murdering my lower back.  I heard about T&amp;N and thought the price on the acceptable side for a King size and I wanted to try a memory foam.  Someone told me that memory foam was too hot to sleep in and almost dissuaded me since I live in the hot desert. Good thing I didn't listen, I love my mattress now ~2yrs.  No too hot to sleep in (even in the hot desert). Sturdy yet comfy foam for sleep, nice bounce for hanky-panky.  Best mattress I've owned this far in my life (36 yrs old). Only drawbacks was the foam stink for a few days (but it wasn't that bad), and maybe a night or two of "break-in" to get your back used to it.
 Not happy. Hate everything About this experience.
 So far this mattress is not as comfortable as I thought it would be.  Have slept on it about a month and having pressure point pain. I didn't think I would with this type of mattress. Over all it is about a three out of five.
 2-months in and not disappointed. I sleep like a baby every time Iay on this bed.
 It's a little too soft on the sides, but after about 4 months, still love it!
 I've owned and slept on this mattress for about a year and it's by far the best mattress I've ever owned.  The mattress if firmer than most beds I've slept on, and it's very buoyant, meaning there's very little 'sinking into' the bed.  This is perfect for me as a back sleeper.  Bed has held up well and I haven't noticed it losing firmness or it developing any soft spots.  Bed sleeps cool as well, as I've been comfortable in hot LA summer heat without much air conditioning.  I'm about to put in an order for a second mattress, for a different room, to replace an aging spring bed.
 good price
 Added a padded mattress cover.<br/>Needed to air out as it had a slight chemical smell first couple days.<br/>Conveniently packaged.
 Arrived perfectly, it was a cinch to unpack, and I have never slept better. Would give it ten stars if I could. Initially felt some lower back pain but that was just from my spine aligning properly for the first time; it went away after 10 minutes, and I felt outstanding the next day.
 We had been needing a new mattress for months and finally decided to take the leap and try the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. It was well worth it! We are only a day in and plan to order the twin size for our kids. It would be amazing if Tuft &amp; Needle made a crib mattress as well.
 No pressure or sales of the big box stores. I didn't have to struggle with ten million choices. This is a great mattress at a reasonable price. Setup was easy and quick. I was a bit skeptical, but consider me a customer as long as they make these.
 I am not happy with the support. The first three nights were good but I have no idea how I would return these once opened
 Tuft &amp; Needle has the best customer support we have ever experienced. Their mattress is great. If you are unsure, just give it a try. They offer a 100 night trial, and make return super easy.
 I purchased this bed roughly two weeks ago after spending a few days reading about this mattress and others like it. First thing I will say is that the delivery and packaging of the mattress was great. The problem for this mattress really comes down to the firmness. After reading all the reviews and seeing comparisons between other direct from manufacturer mattress I decided that Tuft and Needle would be the best. I like firm mattresses and this was rated at a 7 out of 10. Well I would rate the firmness much higher than that. My back has been killing me after a couple days of sleeping on this mattress. I'm only 27 and weight 180lbs and so I wouldn't have thought that this would be an issue. However, given that I haven't changed anything else other than my mattress in the last two weeks, I have to assume that this mattress is not right for me due to it being much much firmer than expected. I was reluctant to write this review as I've also read that you should sleep on a mattress of up to 30days to give you body time to adjust. However, with how bad my back has been the last couple days I don't really see thing changing. The one thing I'm trying to decide now is whether to buy a mattress topper for this mattress to help soften it up or if I should return it. I really wish the company had an option to add more of the top layer of the mattress to help soften this mattress up as I really like everything else about it.
 First time I laid down on it, I felt amazing. Thought I finally found a good mattress. Fast forward a few nights, and I've been consistently been waking up with lower back and shoulder pain. I am 6' 1", 175 lbs, mostly stomach and side sleeper.<br/><br/>EDIT: Upped rating to 4 stars because of Amazon's great customer service. Not the mattress for me, but it was worth a shot.
 NICE!  Feels even better that a higher priced, highly advertised product I bought a month earlier.
 The guys at Tuft &amp; Needle are turning out great products at great prices, and their customer service says a lot about how much they value the customer.<br/><br/>I will say that the twin mattress will not stay folded without some help, but it can easily be propped up against a wall in a closet.  Weight of the twin size is very manageable, especially considering how firm and supportive it is.  Comfort is excellent.  This is easily one of the best beds available for the money.
 The comfort is just great. Couldn’t be happier !
 Absolutely LOVE our new mattress. It was so easy to unpack and inflated with in a minute or two. Very very comfortable and who could beat that price!
 has been very comfortable so far
 Can’t belive this came in a small box! It’s so comfortable!
 the only problem with this mattress is that i don't want to get out of it!
 Best mattress ever! If we ever need another bed we would buy one of these without hesitation.
 Amazing comfort.Arrived on time.
 Super easy shipping/delivery that made buying a mattress almost enjoyable. Comfortable and perfect for my space!
 Surprisingly light weight.  Comfortable, thoughI would personally prefer a bit firmer.
 I'm only 29 but after years in the Army, my back was pretty stiff in the mornings. After my last change of station I decided to roll with a Queen bed from T&amp;N and lemme say, best choice I've made in a good long time. The bed is easy to move, easier to set up, and provided a fantastic night's sleep -- even on the floor while I was building my platform bed. The bed helps keep you cool by not having a ton of cotton-based fabric to top the mattress, and it cleans easier than you'd think.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, the mattress is surprisingly good for sitting. I know that sounds a bit odd, but if you've ever had a bed that sags at the corners when you sit on it... you understand the benefit. Putting on shoes, playing video games, even just getting out of bed in the morning: the bed has just enough give to be comfortable but not enough to break down.<br/><br/>I almost never write reviews because I'm far to cool for all that, but I had to share my great experience with T&amp;N. OH, and the customer service was outstanding (I called to ask about the mattress and delivery details before I made the purchase, they were great). As long as it doesn't spontaneously combust or suck me into an alternative reality where there's no dessert foods, I'll be a loyal customer from here on out.
 Best bed I've ever owned. Least expensive one too!
 had some chemical smells for a week. i thought had to return but try a couple of days more.  its good now.<br/>thanks
 Great value, no issues over the first 45 days. Firm enough but if you have low back issues it is not THAT firm, just FYI.
 Maybe not the best for sleeping on your back, but otherwise the bed is comfortable and my wife and I sleep well.
 So far so good. Woke up super late for work already from being so comfy ! Little firm but not bad.
 Changed my life. Seriously. Sleep apnea among others.
 Was exactly as advertised. Mattress is soft, but still firm enough for a good sleep.
 A bit too soft, not firm enough for us.
 Was a little skeptical at first, but after a couple weeks this is the best mattress I have ever had!  Great purchase!
 I have a bad back and the mattress is good but still hurts my back to sleep on it. I have had it for 2 months now
 What can I say? Mattresses are obviously very personal so one person may find a mattress to be perfect while someone else hates it. In this case I didn't love the T&amp;N mattress. The fit and finish of it is nice, and I like that it's basically the cheapest mattress of its kind made in the U.S. (at least that I'm aware of it), but in the end I just found it to be too stiff. It does have good support, however, but I just felt like the pressure points were too much for me. I ended up replacing it with a Layla mattress and I much prefer the softness of it over the T&amp;N. But if the T&amp;N mattress sounds good to you then you at least have nothing to lose in trying it since you have a 100-day trial of it even if you buy it on Amazon. And if you do return it you just have to call Amazon's customer service and they'll handle it for you (check out the FAQ on T&amp;N's website).
 I am updating my review because I am now able to give my honest opinion  after trying it for almost the full 100 day trial period, and where I was once unsure about the bed, all doubts have now been erased and the unknowns have been revealed!<br/>First off, I feel this company is wonderful and they have or will go above and beyond to make sure that their customers needs are met.<br/>Reviewing the queen mattress is difficult because, just like different people have more refined palates or an exceptional sense of smell, we also have different sensitivities to touch, pressure points or higher and lower pain thresholds compared to others around us. The point I am trying to make is that my rating is not based on the quality of materials, or durability of the mattress itself, because if it was, I would have given 5 stars!  I am giving it a 3 star rating due to the firmness of the bed and my poor quality of sleep due to it. I am a side sleeper, and I don't really believe that this bed is a good choice for someone like me with hip and lumbar issues and who sleeps usually in a side position for the whole night. I kept wanting to believe that this firm mattress(around a 7.5 out of 10) would get softer over time, but unfortunately it did not. I do have some pretty serious spinal issues, such as a failed lumbar back surgery and some autoimmune diseases, including Ankylosing Spondylitis which affects my spine and hips, and polymyositis which affects my muscles. I need a lot of good uninterrupted sleep to help keep flareups at bay, and of course for healing and recharging my energy levels for physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing! Unfortunately, pain is a daily occurrence in my life, and this trial period saw an increase with it instead of the decrease that I so desperately was praying for. I know that this mattress is great for so many others out there, and has changed their lives for the better, and that is awesome! That's why I recommend that you should try it out for yourself and not base your judgements on my or any other person's review. You have nothing to lose, since they have such a great trial period and return policy in place, except the potential of having YOUR dream bed! I just have to do a little more searching until I find the bed that is everything I need and dream for....Fingers crossed!!
 Best mattress I've ever owned.  Shipping on time and easy to unpack. No more sore back in the morning.
 Great mattress! It feels like a cloud. Takes some getting used to if coming from a coil mattress.
 So far we like it, for the price I feel like it was a good purchase.
 We've had it two months and so far we love it!
 Everything as described
 Too early to say if it is durable.  It is comfortable though.
 SO comfy! And the payment plan made everything even better
 This is a great bed
 Just wish it had an inch of cool foam on top as I am in florida. I did put a bed board under it as I could feel some wires from  bed frame as not using box spring. With that its fine. Great cover hope it doesn't shrink on wash/drying. Felt like buying from company that cared. I loved THAT.
 Was skeptical about this product but after reading reviews decided to purchase! This product is amazing! Absolutely love it and is extremely comfortable. All the claims made by the company are true.
 First night sleeping on this mattress was amazing. Just right comfort level. Not too soft and not too hard. Highly recommended.
 This bed is amazing. It's very comfortable to sleep on. Firm despite being foam.
 Overall it is a great mattress for the money. I will probably buy more for the guest bedrooms.
 dang, too comfortable. All my friends love it
 We are firm mattress people, and the big challenge has been to find a mattress that retains its firmness after a few months. THIS particular mattress did not have a problem losing firmness - it felt like I was sleeping on the ground from Day 1. That achy feeling you get while camping? Like knowing you must have slept, but the hazy memories of waking up numerous times in the night due to discomfort seem more real than dreamlike? That was our Tuft &amp; Needle experience. The packaging was efficient, though, and the free return was awesome. I gave it a good 2 weeks, but it was clear from the first night's sleep that this was a back-killer.
 Finally, we are getting a good night's rest!  My hips no longer hurt and my husband's back and leg don't hurt nearly as bad. We love this bed!
 Easy.  Looks great.  Gray.
 Only been a few nights but I love this mattress. Other competitors offer a king at over twice the price. The quality is there, it was ready to sleep on in hours. I'm going to give it there full 100 night test, but so far so good. I couldn't be happier.
 This mattress is so convenient. One person can carry inside and unwrap in place. It is very comfortable, it is on the soft side but does not lack support.
 Just what I needed to get a goodnights sleep.
 Good job!
 Ordered for my kids. Works great and she sleeps much better now.
 I rarely review things...and in fact this may be my first review ever. It's hard for me to overstate: this is the best mattress I've ever laid on, and one of the best products overall I've ever used. And I'm a product designer that's obsessed with these things.<br/><br/>Every element of the experience is well crafted, from the customer support to the fact that it's delivered in a small box (!!!) keeping you from lugging a mattress around corners or through doors...is incredible. And that's before we get to the mattress itself. I'm a pretty cranky sleeper and this feels like I'm supported by a cloud. It feels like what a mattress advertisement looks like. Can't recommend this highly enough.
 Perfect mattress for me
 I love this bed. Just the right amount of support and softness. I have not had a better nights sleep. The bed stays somewhat cool and is worth the price! I will always be a tuft and needle bed owner.
 LOVE THIS BED!!  Money well spent!
 Very comfortable and well made.  Set up was simple.
 This mattress is great. Researched for months and ended up choosing this. No complaints!
 I just order my second mattress from this company It’s  comfy and fresh not hot best part .immmmm
 Firm and cool. No need for a box spring. Why has a bed like this never been invented.
 Amazing matress! Been getting way better sleep and waking up feeling refreshed.
 Absolutely incredible bed.  Just the right mix of comfort and support.  Sleeps nice and cool, which is critical for me as I run pretty hot.  Delivered to my door in two days.  Setup was very simple - just follow the instructions in the package.  You won't regret it!
 Wow, what a great night sleep for BOTH of us!  I toss and flop alot and she rarely feels it.  Great product, great price, easy to receive shipment and setup!
 The best mattress I've slept on.
 We bought this mattress for my daughter.  She loves it!!
 Though rated highly by CR, it hurt my lower back.
 Love this mattress! Arrived at our door. It took 10 mins to inflat.
 I've had this mattress for 4 months now and my wife and I are more than satisfied. I was hit by a car years ago that resulted in some residual back pain which causes me to not fall asleep quickly. But after getting this mattress I'm sound asleep in minutes. Very much worth every penny.
 Excellent mattress. Have had it for several weeks and have been very pleased.
 Introduction: Just a few random thoughts I feel are relevant in this review. 1. I am 27, 5'10" ~165lbs. 2. I am not a wealthy person, and price was definitely a factor in my purchase. 3. I threw my back out about a year ago - and my mattress  before T&amp;N] was incrementally, day by day, exacerbating my bulging disk. Also, waking up with extremely tight shoulders. 4. This was a difficult decision for me to purchase this mattress. While the reviews were excellent, I couldn't help but feel many were fake, and there were two factors that led me to finally pull the trigger. I managed to get $140 in Amazon gift cards, and I read you could donate the mattress for a refund. Buying from Amazon may negate this - but the fact that this company allows for this is really incredible and thoughtful. I like to support ethical businesses, and I've deemed Tuft &amp; Needle is one of them. 5. This will be a living review. It's only been 1 night thus far, but I'll be sure to keep this updated  2 weeks, 2 months, 9 months, etc.] because I know how difficult this decision was for me, and could be for many others without disposable income. 6. The foundation is an old box spring, it seems a little low to the ground - if anyone has any suggestions on whether I should look into a platform for this, let me know!<br/><br/>Day 1: I received my T&amp;N mattress yesterday, the box was a bit heavy and awkward, but once I got it in my room, and began cutting it open, it inflated within a minute. Set up was a breeze. I laid down for a minute, just for a tease. A smile graced my face, "This is what a comfortable bed feels like," I thought to myself. The mattress I had prior was an old hand-me-down spring pillow top mattress, and has been destroying my back and shoulders for the past couple of years. There was a noticeable chemical smell, but not too offensive sleeping on my back or side. I flipped over to my stomach and YEP.. it's quite potent.<br/><br/>Falling asleep. It took me a little longer than usual to fall asleep. It may have been more of me  the over thinker I am] just analyzing how my body was molding to the foam. Reading other reviews, and experiencing this mattress myself, re-enforces that much more just how SUBJECTIVE most opinions are. It bothers me when people say things like, "THIS IS TOO FIRM! &gt;:  " or "This is like sleeping in a fluffy magical cloud in heaven next to Jesus! :D"<br/><br/>Honestly, for me, this was right down the middle. Balanced. Not too firm, not too soft. Laying on my stomach, back, and side were very comfortable. I typically sleep on my back, and with this mattress I didn't even need a pillow. I felt the foam contort to the natural curvature of my spine. It was awesome, especially because I'm only 27 and have a stupid lower back.<br/><br/>I woke up, and my shoulders didn't hurt, I didn't have to bellow a discomfort grunt when getting up. It genuinely made me happy. My first night review is 5 stars - and this may be due to the fact that I've been sleeping on a terrible mattress for so many years and there was a significant contrast. We'll see if this rating changes throughout the weeks, months, years.<br/><br/>I can only be so descriptive with one night - So I'll leave it as is for now. Again I'll be sure to make updates. And also, please ask me questions if you have any. I'm no expert, but I'm candid with my opinions and open about my biases. Some may scoff at a $600 mattress, but I know for a lot of us this is a big purchase and an important decision and I would be more than happy if I can help anyone one way or another.<br/><br/>Update: 2 weeks in.<br/><br/>I think above I made it seem almost like a miracle in healing my back and my shoulders. My back is still jacked up.. but much better. My shoulders are only a little jacked up anymore, way better. I think I may need a lumbar pillow.<br/><br/>So after two weeks of using this mattress. I still love it. There's no visible indentations, and it feels about the same it did the first time I laid down on it.<br/><br/>Something I did notice is the heat. When I sleep on my back, I notice being MUCH warmer than I have been with other mattresses. This should help in the winter, but right now it's kinda beat. Fortunately, I found it to be an easy transition sleeping on my side and the heat issue isn't really a problem.<br/><br/>The smell mentioned above is all but gone. If I bury my nose in it and inhale, I still smell it a little bit.. but it's really not a big deal. I question your ability to be reasonable if the smell still perturbs you after a couple weeks.<br/><br/>That's all I have for now. I'll make an update maybe mid-September which is right before the 100-day return policy.<br/><br/>Update 3! ~100 return policy mark.<br/><br/>I down voted to a 3 from a 5. Over this past month or so since my last review, I've slept in some other beds. And while the Tuft &amp; Needle has still relieved some of my aches and pains due to my old mattress, I still awake generally sore. In contrast, the other beds I've slept in I have woken up MUCH more limber.<br/><br/>Tuft &amp; Needle may just be too firm for me. :( I cannot return it because I purchased through Amazon and the 30 day trial has passed. I want to love this mattress, I think the company has the right idea and is reasonably priced. So at this point, for me, it is an acceptable mattress at a reasonable price.<br/><br/>ALSO. To be fair, the mattresses I slept on were +$1000, so keep that mind.
 Super comfortable. Delivered on time. Edge of bed does not “give” very supportive
 So far into the hundred days only about 30 I have say the mattress is everything they claim it to be.  It supports my 250+ lbs with no problems so far and I sleep as well as I have on any other mattress.  I will comment fully after their return period is over.
 Awesome bed but...<br/><br/>My brain says the mattress needs more foam / support. I really sink into the mattress when I lay on it and I can feel the bars from my metal bed frame.<br/><br/>My body says the mattress is a successful purchase. I have never had so many dreams in a single night than I have with this mattress.<br/><br/>The proof that the mattress is working is I have yet to wake up with a sore back or in pain. I am very happy with my purchase. I look forward to sleeping now. I'll update in a few months (if I remember to) with how it's working out.
 It's fined not the best one but good quality!!
 I really want to like this mattress, the quality is good, the concept is great unfortunately is is too soft.  I toss and turn all night.  Unfortunately I made the decision that the mattress was not for me a little toate, I am out of the return period.  If you need a firm mattress this may not be your best bet.
 It's so amazing.
 GREAT MATTRESS !
 For the price, you cant find a better memory foam mattress. Would buy again.
 Mattress is excellent. 90 days into it and just like new. Watching it expand was fun. Very comfy.
 My daughter stated that she wished it was just a little softer.  Planning on ordering another in April sometime for my daughters guest room.
 great mattress. Soft yet firm. My wife and I both love it. Hope it lasts.
 For the $ you can't beat this deal ...
 WE WILL BUY ANOTHER FOR OUR RV &amp; 2ND BEDROOM
 Love. Bought for my daughter.
 FANTASTIC mattress.  Only issue is it can side on the box spring so I bought no slip pads and no issues.
 This was my first memory foam mattress.  I really have loved sleeping on it.
 like it
 I love this mattress so much. It’s pretty firm but that’s what I wanted!
 I am far from picky when it comes to mattresses, once I'm tired I can fall asleep just about anywhere, but how anyone could enjoy sleeping on this mattress just blows my mind. I've had it for 9 nights now, and never have I ever woke up with such horrible back &amp; neck pain! And not even after a full nights sleep - I haven't slept longer than 3-4 hours a night since getting it, which especially pisses me off because this is the first week I've had off work in years. Was hoping to get rested up, but nope! Still deciding if I'm going to return it or buy a pillow top mattress to put over it. So incredibly disappointed.
 This bed is amazing. We are on night number 2 and sleeping very well!
 1/3 the cost of my former bed. Just as comfortable, but not as soft because it lacks the pillow top.
 So comfy!
 Best sleep I have had in 20 years! Awesome mattress.
 My husband put this in his semi truck. He loves it!
 Purchased two of these for the household and they are wonderful so far. Solid and comfortable for a great price.
 Great purchase! Never gets old
 excellent
 not sure yet
 Great mattress!
 I have had this mattress for 6months with zero issues or complaints. Sure has been a life and health changer and can truly appreciate rem level sleep again.
 Sleeping great now, no hot spots or sink holes
 Was expecting it to be very firm as I saw ratings and thought I would try. I'm going to have to look at another mattress as my back has not hurt this bad in a long time. I wake up so sore.
 Came in two days and been sleeping like a baby since. It is a firmer memory foam mattress which my husband and I love. Keeps up cool overnight. Best purchase!
 This bed is amazing! We have had it for 2 months now, it is incredibly comfortable and I've never slept so well. Highly recommended!
 We ended up returning this because it was just TOO firm for us. We were having sore backs and legs. It was unbearable. HOWEVER, customer service is AMAZING. We got a quick refund and we were able to donate it to our local veteran's center and touched the lives of a family in need, so AMAZING company. We ended up buying an extremely soft bed elsewhere, but would have easily bought another bed from T&amp;N if they sold soft beds. Great company. Wish more companies were like this.
 love it. was worried it would be too soft as i am stomach sleeper but it is amazing
 We bought these for our daughters new room and ended up sleeping on them ourselves the first week. We will be purchasing a king for ourselves in the very near future.
 Great mattress.  Very affordable price. Gives a great night sleep.  Allows us to turn on our sides without a fight like with our last memory form mattress.
 Great bed, so far so good. Firm but soft, really hard to explain.
 It's been a few weeks, the wife and I, even the dog, can't get enough time on this mattress.
 A great night's sleep that is a great buy as well. You just cannot beat a Tuft &amp; Needle.
 Very happy with this purchase. Exactly as advertised. Will be getting another one.
 Perfect!<br/>Update like a year later after using it for various things on a standard metal frame<br/>still perfect :)
 Purchased 5" twin for use as daybed/sofa.  Based on all the Amazon reviews, plus information on the company's web site, I anticipated that the mattress would be firm - and it is.  Using a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being firmest, the mattress is more like a 9 to my bones.  However, for use as a daybed, intended to be both a sofa by day and a guest bed for the grandchildren, I believe it will serve the purpose well.  Only negative was the shipping experience.  FedEx could not locate me because someone at the shipping end of things ran my entire address into 1 word.  Because tracking was available, I contacted FedEx and got it straightened out.  By the way, it arrived MUCH sooner than what was suggested by Amazon as the delivery date - even with the address error.  Overall, I think it is a very good value for my intended use.
 Comfortable. I can sleep forever.
 Been sleeping on the mattress for about 4 months and is great, best sleep I gotten totally would recommend
 A wonderful comfortable mattress. Very Pleased!!!!
 It’s comfortable and reasonably priced... as advertised.
 I am very happy with my Tuft &amp; Needle 10-inch mattress.  It is comfortable and I've slept well on it every night.  It is good value for the money.
 Such a great purchase. We absolutely love the comfort and support this mattress offers.
 This is the best bed i could have ever purchased. Ive had it for 4 months now, its like its brand new still. Absolutely nothing negative to say. Love everything about it. At first my lower back sorta hurt because it wasnt used to the support as I lay in bed. Give it a few days and you will see the difference. My back doesnt permanently hurt like it used to. I had no idea how much a good bed can affect your life and your body. Thank you T&amp;N for making an affordable, wonderful bed!!!!! Customer FOR LIFE. Will tell everyone to get this bed, even if theyre not in the market for one hahhaa. BUY IT. BUY IT. You'll love ittttt.
 Very firm! It took some getting used to, but I like it now. It had a strong chemical smell initially. That has worn off.
 Well made, no smell, nice and firm, attained full size amazing fast.
 Great mattress. Really firm and excellent edge sure.
 Only two days but I love it!
 Very comfortable!
 Fantastic mattress— sleeping much better— would highly recommend!!
 Wish I would have bought a kingsize mattress. Also don't buy from Amazon. Return policy is better if you buy from Tuff &amp; Needle. !00 nights from Tuff and Needle and only 30 days from Amazon.
 I really like the feel of this mattress. It unwrapped easily and expanded almost instantly. It's not too firm or too soft and I absolutely love how it feels so far.<br/><br/>I will say, the smell is something else. I figured with any memory or latex foam, there will be some "gassing", but this has been going on for several days. It simply smells....chemically. I've washed my sheets three times to help compensate, but doesn't seem to be doing much. I let it "expand" and release gasses for about 9 hours before I slept on it.<br/><br/>Would I buy this mattress again? Yes, but I would leave my apartment for a week after set up :)
 The T&amp;N queen mattress exceeded my expectation!
 I personally love it. Only complaint is they say it's a "perfect mix between soft and hard", its definitely more on the hard side.
 I absolutely love this mattress.  My sleep is solid &amp; I hardly toss and turn anymore!  I like a firm mattress, and this delivers.  For the price and free shipping you can't ask for anything more.
 I'm a back sleeper. I would like a firmer mattress.
 This is a good mattress. We have had it for few months now and still holding up well.
 Looking for a mattress? This is the one! Extremely comfortable at such reasonable price.
 Very comfortable for those that like a slightly firm mattress
 It's so comfortable!!!!!! I love that getting the mattress was so easy; it just appeared at my front door. It was fun watching it expand too. I am all for supporting American made products!
 Super comfortable. Delivered on time and as advertised. Easy set up. I would definitely buy from them again.
 Been sleeping on this for 10 months and its been dope AF for the price.
 Arrived early, unboxed quickly, and I slept better than ever. Why would you not buy this?
 Very comfortable and gives great support.  Helped solve my back problems which aided sleep.
 Yes, it is a matress that doesnt suck.  Yay.
 Was comfortable for a few days before I experienced neck pain nearly every day after waking up in the morning. The mattress just sags in way too much for it to be comfortable for me. Quality is definitely there and I'm sure it works well for others but this mattress was simply too uncomfortable for me to keep. However, support was superb so it gets 3 stars.
 Very comfortable, would buy again.
 My wife and I love it.  Been sleeping on it for three weeks now.  It was a bit firm to begin with, but it has softened up a bit and we are more used to it.
 Fantastic mattress- very comfortable, timely delivery, easy to move into the bedroom. The only con was the "new mattress" smell that took longer than I'd expected to go away. It is fantastic that you don't feel the other person moving around!
 3 months in. Was duly impressed with the reviews. It was 1/2 the cost of the high rated $1,500 spring mattress I was slated to buy, so I took the plunge. Mail order mattress kinda cool. Pop open the package, self inflate, and wahlaa.<br/><br/>Softer than I would have I liked. But livable. What is annoying is all that foam doesn't disperse heat. My body's getting used to it, but if you sleep in one spot long enough the indentation heats to the point where it wakes you up. Like sleeping on an electric heating pad that's on high. Super uncomfortable that makes you wake up and seek a cooler part of the mattress.
 So comfortable and supporting.  Makes you want to get into bed at night
 This is the nicest bed you will ever sleep in. Buy this now and be happy like me
 Absolutely LOVE this mattress. My boyfriend and I have been sleeping better than ever on this.
 UPDATE12/20/17 - I'm not going to return the mattress and start this process all over with something new (as T&amp;N suggest). In reality, I should have just kept my old mattress (only 2 years old) and figured out how to make that more comfortable. That said, I did finally figure out how to sleep on this mattress!!! After 3 weeks I finally got a decent night sleep last night (using a IKEA pillow)!!!!!<br/><br/>A few things I've learned:<br/><br/>1. Don't sleep on the bed for the first 3-4 days. The sinking is really annoying and using the bed too soon may do something to the foam, etc. For me this was a hassle and I ended up sleeping on the couch for two weeks of owning this product.<br/><br/>2. Even through T&amp;N replied to my first posting, I still don't sit comfortably on the edge. There's isn't an "even distribution" of body weight and it feels like I'm going to fall off. I purchased a bench for the bottom of my bed. I don't really like that I had to make an additional purchase just to keep the bed. Also, watch little kids around the bed as well. My friends daughter climbed onto the bed only to fall off because she hadn't moved fast enough to the center.<br/><br/>3. If you sleep on your side, use a flatter pillow to support your head. I started with a traditional pillow first, that caused MAJOR neck and back pain. Then I tried a skinny pillow and that helped a bit with the neck pain but increased pain in my shoulders, hips and knees. Then, I tried using the IKEA pillow from my couch, and BINGO!! For the first time in weeks I finally reached 70%+ sleep quality for the night (according to my sleep app)!!! The best part, I actually had 3+ hours between deep sleep and sleep!!!!  I woke up WITHOUT any back, shoulder, hip, knee, or back pain!!!! As soon as I put the IKEA pillow under my head, I felt the pressure release in my neck and shoulder. So, I'd say, if you sleep on your side, try that adjustment.<br/><br/>4.  As others have said, this is NOT the bed for you if you like to sit in bed and read or watch TV.  I purchased one of those bed pillows and that doesn't make sitting on the bed to read any easier. Maybe I'll have to add a chair to my room to accommodate this.<br/><br/>5. All in all, I wouldn't purchase this type of mattress again. After reading the CR recommendations, each brand has their own pros and cons. The problem I have with this one, I probably wouldn't have purchased it if I had tried it in the store. Even the S&amp;F I tried at Macy's seemed to offer more support than this one. I would be willing to pay double for a good night's sleep. I just hope it lasts for 5 years so I don't have to go through this again for awhile.<br/><br/>NOVEMBER, 2017 RESPONSE<br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, I really want to like this mattress but I'm not sure I can. As another reviewer noted, if you sleep on your side this may not be the mattress for you. Consumer reports indicates this mattress is good for people that sleep on their side. I guess I have to wait for that part to kick in.<br/><br/>The first few nights I was sinking into the mattress and it was difficult turning over. I experienced lots of back pain and pain where there shouldn't have been, like in the thigh area (not sure which "pressure points" are there).  I turned the mattress over for one night and back, now I don't sink anymore, but the right side of the mattress seems harder. On the website there is a picture of the mattress being pushed in and I don't get a similar "indentation" when I push mine.<br/><br/>Since I got the mattress, my sleep cycle app indicates I haven't gotten a good night sleep. This is a shame because my old mattress seems to have been better than I thought. Not yet sure why I needed a new one. I'll have to give it more time if I can survive the pain and sleeplessness.<br/><br/>Also, if you're used to sitting on the edge of the bed to put your socks, shoes, etc. on, you can't really do that comfortably. I had to purchase a seat for the bottom of my bed. You'd think that if they have 'designers' to create new foam, they could create something that has a more supportive edge around the mattress.<br/><br/>Final point, I have two dogs that usually get in bed with me at some point during the night. Since I've had the mattress, they actually sleep in their own bed through the night now so I guess that's one positive point of the mattress.<br/><br/>So if you purchased this mattress because of the CR best buy, the other foam mattress actually have a 'very good' rating for comfort around this price. CR says the Casper has a firmness rating of 4 (compared to TN 5). But the others that are in this price range (Serta, Sleep Innovations, etc) have higher overall ratings with a firmness rating of 7. Not sure when the testing was conducted or if TN specs changed since. But I think it's pretty hard and can't imagine sleeping on a 7.
 Great for back sleeper, little rough for side sleeper as it's very firm.
 Best Bed Ever - my family loves staying over now!!!
 DEF THE 21 CENTURY WAY TO BUY A MATTRESS... OPEN AND SNOOZE.<br/>REALLY ODORLESS AND COMFORTFUL
 We were nervous about purchasing a mattress on line but are super happy with the mattress.
 Nice mattress so far
 Great mattress at a great price.  Nice and firm yet does not cause any soreness.
 After using for 3 months, I don't feel its worth the amount I paid. I have started having back pain due to the mattress.
 It is hard to get out of bed because you sleep so well you don't want to get out of bed. We love it. Can't watch TV in bed though because you fall asleep.
 I was super hesitant when picking this mattress up. I read a bunch of hype about it but it was the return policy that really sold me on it. Fast forward a couple days and I have this heavy rectangular box at my door. Opening the box I kept thinking no way is this a queen. Lo and behold I stood corrected. As soon as you puncture the packaging, watch out. This thing pulls in air like a dyson vacuum. Under a minute later and my mattress was all full of air. No chemical smell at all, just a good looking mattress.<br/>I used to wake up with a sore back constantly but thats no longer an issue with this mattress. I've had it for 2 months and can easily say its the best sleep I've had. Personally I like a firmer mattress and this is the perfect mixture of firm but supportive.<br/>Will review again once I've got a little more time on this but I don't expect to have any future issues.
 Still trying to get use to the hard memory foam but so far, I’ve been sleeping well.
 A little firmer than expected.  Solved that by adding a 3 inch gel mattress topper. Other than that all good.
 great mattress, comfortable sleep!
 I enjoy this mattress. Coming from a pillow top I was nervous to try a mattress of this type. However, after sleeping on it for a month and a half now, I can say that I am completely satisfied with this mattress. The price was right, the shipping right to your door is great. It's not too unwieldy to move around and there was no odor at all to it.<br/><br/>My only complaint that is keeping it from 5 stars is that I get really hot at night. I know there are ways to mitigate this, but I'm in a house that's kept around 68 degrees and night and get way too hot on this mattress. It never happened with my pillow top mattress. Full disclosure: my wife has not had this issue.<br/><br/>Great mattress. Great price.
 THE VERY BEST!!  Shopped for several weeks - definitely made the RIGHT CHOICE with Tuft and Needle. Extremely happy!!!!
 Great mattresses! We have enjoyed these mattresses and have no complaints. They very comfortable.
 In love with this mattress!
 Ive has this mattress for about 8 months. Couldn’t be happier.
 Great mattress. Can't believe it's actually in the box. Easy to move and open. Live it
 Much better than the LUCID mattress I bought a couple years ago on amazon. I like this mattress because it supports my entire body and I don't sink into it like a hammock (this happens with soft memory foam). I would recommend this mattress!
 Great!
 Day 1: disappointed.  I was looking to be amazed with sunshine and puppies and all manners of wonder.  It's a decent mattress but my first night was at best marginally better.  The rest of the reviews here make it seem like imbues immortality, And I'm left with "meh"<br/><br/>Week 2: slightly less disappointed.  I'm getting the feeling with a few months age it will soften up to be more to my liking.  It would get 5 stars for non-sleep activities.  Maybe a mattress topper might make me satisfied.  It's a great value and I don't hate it, but I'm still considering the return policy (which I love).  If I had tried it in a store I probably wouldn't have bought it.
 Super comfortable
 Great mattress. No off gassing and very comfortable thus far.
 This my second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress and pairs nicely with an adjustable bed frame.Very comfortable for a very reasonable price
 No smell at all.<br/>Bed was ready to sleep on within 4 hours<br/>Getting a rested sleep<br/>The bed does not feel too hard or too soft.<br/>Very good quality.
 Love this so far. Just a little upset about how long it took to get here
 It is not firm enough. Does Tuft and Needle have a mattress that this much firmer
 This mattress would be fine for anyone who prefers a soft mattress. I did not feel that it gave me the back/spine support that I need.
 Def like the T&amp;N mattress so far,  T&amp;N pillows even better.  Seller AAA!
 These Beautiful Mattresses are too wide for my Ergomatic Dual King Bed. We are falling off the bed! HELP
 I’ve slept on my mattress for about 2 months now and I’m happy with it.
 Price is good. Shipped in good time. Box intact. Mattress is a good mix of soft but supportive.
 Truly is a good product but just didn't fit personal needs, much to soft causing back issue's.
 This was the best mattress purchase I have made in my life. Comfortable from the first night and I have been sleeping on the mattress for almost a year now. I would purchase it again.
 Love my new mattress! I've had it for about one month and my arms are no longer numb in the morning. Great on my joints and back.
 Best mattress I ever bought
 Awesomeness
 I am very pleased with my purchase of a Tuft and Needle Mattress, Twin X-Large.<br/>Douglas Richards
 We love this mattress! it took a couple of nights for the mattress to fully fluff up. By the 3rd night we both slept all night without waking up once! That's amazing. It's firm so we bought a thick quilted mattress topper and now it's like sleeping at an expensive resort! Just can't say enough good things about this mattress!
 I bought this for my son and wanted to sleep in it. My other son and I set it up, it was pretty easy. The hardest part was getting it up the steps in the box but much easier than a regular mattress. It was pretty neat seeing it "inflate" on its own and amazed at how comfortable it felt...I hope to check back when it has had some sleeping time on it. My son did say it has been comfortable and he is sleeping well. So we are very please so far!
 Very cheap, got here in 2 days, extremely simple and comfortable as hell
 A mattress that’s just right!
 This thing has been nothing short of amazing... I was really surprised at how well I sleep on this mattress.
 I ordered 2 couldn’t be happier. Comfortable easy to open. Good balance of firm and plush
 Very comfortable. Just firm enough
 Excellent fit; easy to handle;very comfortable. Exceeded expectations.
 Do not, I repeat, do not buy any other mattress. This is the best choice ever. Do no hesitation. 120% recommended.
 Recommended by a friend and I bought it for my daughter who absolutely loves it. With this new mattress, she stopped begging to sleep in my bed.
 Best sleep i've had in a long time!!!
 Love it soft but not too sof,  Just what I wanted, perfect for me.
 this is the best mattress ever.  had a sleep comfort, it sagged after a while.  highly recommend tuft and needle!!
 Very happy with the mattress so far.  Still not sure how well it absorbs heat as it feels somewhat warm but overall seems well made.
 Finally!!! I have some back issues and having undergone recent back surgery, my husband and I wanted to try a memory foam mattress. The first one we ordered was comfortable but it turns out I'm HIGHLY sensitive to VOCs and it made me severely ill. So we had to get rid of that one and, after doing some research, opted for Tuft and Needle which is reported to have almost no smell, minimal "chemically" content, and least amount of time you need to air it out. It arrived two days ago and we are SO pleased. I'm sleeping pretty well on it, it's comfortable, and I've had no reaction. Recommend!
 super
 great mattress
 Update:  Trust Amazon and Tuft &amp; Needle to put the "action" in "customer satisfaction"!<br/><br/>Although this wasn't the right solution for us, they stepped in to make sure that we were fully satisfied with regard to the transaction and refund.  Honestly, they could not have done it better.<br/><br/>Full disclosure:  Both my wife and I do suffer from "back anomalies", in my case a congenital defect -- or as my family doctor described it to me many years ago "you were born with an extra vertebrae".  When I asked him what that meant, he said "If you are ever eaten by cannibals, they'll get an extra T-bone"... and ... "Your back will probably be weaker than normal."<br/><br/>Well, he was right on with his latter statement, as to the first, it has never (fortunately) been tested.<br/><br/>Point being:  Most people would probably love this mattress.  I'll bet you will too, and if on the odd chance not, you won't be dissatisfied with your dealings with Amazon &amp; the Tuft &amp; Needle folks.  They are great.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>I was so sure this was the right choice for us.  How could so many positive reviews be wrong?  I read. I investigated.  I compared the competition.  I called Tuft &amp; Needle and asked them if they had feedback on the satisfaction of former waterbed users.  They tried to be helpful.  They are obviously a great company, with great people, and a great satisfaction policy.  How could we go wrong?<br/><br/>The simple answer is that it was just too firm for us.  We knew that after the first few nights and the morning back pain that followed.  Desperate, we bought a foam topper from Costco for $200 -- that will fix it -- right?  Nope.  We're used to the natural way our waterbed would shape itself to us.  It felt like no matter what we covered this with, there was still this board underneath.<br/><br/>Then one morning, I awoke to find my wife sleeping on an air mattress beside the bed.  She'd given up.<br/><br/>This surely is the perfect solution for many, maybe for most, but it just wasn't right for us.  We bought it from Amazon instead of directly from T&amp;N, even though T&amp;N probably has the easier "return" policy.  The thought we might actually not be able to use it just seemed so remote.<br/><br/>The promise that "one mattress fits all" is perhaps true most of the time.  Unfortunately, it's just our bad luck to be the exception to that rule.
 Oh, I love this mattress. It's like my bed hugs me all night long.
 A little thinner than I’d prefer, but a great bed!!
 Wonderful support, so even, and warm. They take the work and mystery out of shopping for a mattress.
 Hurts my shoulder and hips. Customer servicecwant me to spend $180 for topper...
 Very comfy and good quality
 Was skeptical about buying a bed online but Tuft and needle made me a believer. I have slept so soundly for the past month. Perfect amount of softness and firmness. I had very slight smell for the first couple days. I love this bed though and could not be happier.
 Loving the mattress in our first week of using it. Super comfortable. Has a weird smell that I am hoping will go away.
 Extremely comfortable!
 This T &amp; A mattress was everything I was hoping for. The firmness was good and the price was right.
 So comfortable!! I am really bad about snoring, but the husband reports I haven't hardly snored. It arrived on time and was easy to move. Love this mattress!
 The bed isn't anything special. It's just a normal memory foam type bed. I did notice that it retains heat like crazy. If you're a hot sleeper, this isn't the bed for you.
 I want to love this mattress. Delivery and set up were easy. Their customer service should be the model for all customer service. However, I am still not sleeping. I have a chronic illness and I really need to sleep.<br/><br/>First the bed is hard. There was a remedy in a mattress topper but as silly as this sounds, now it is too soft. Bit like goldilocks now. I had back issues with just the bed, now the topper helps my back but my joints are killing me.<br/><br/>Second issue is how freaking hot it is. I am waking up in the middle of the night and morning absolutely drenched. I did try and troubleshoot this but even with many different kinds of sheets, air conditioner turned down to 62 and a fan blowing right on me, I am still hot. Heat was the main issue with my temperpedic and I really thought this company had it down. But I am even hotter in this bed. As I read through the reviews, I have to wonder if something changed.<br/>Third smaller issue is when I came here to right the review, I see that the price is significantly cheaper. This upsets me as it has not been 100 days since I bought it, and it dropped that much?<br/><br/>I wanted to love this bed. I was even smug with a mattress company (where I bought my adjustable base) who told me I would return it, after he found out I bought from T and N. I am nearing the end of my trial period and I really hate mattress shopping. But I need to sleep. If there was any solution that would work, I would keep the mattress just for their customer service.
 I had hoped it would be a bit firmer but should be good for a child. Fast, easy and works great!!
 Honestly, I was a little skeptical of buying a mattress online but I truly did not want to go to a store and try out a bunch of mattresses and then worry about delivery costs and getting the mattress in my room. Being a single lady moving things usually requires begging someone to come help. So I took a chance because if I didn't like it there was a 30 day return policy. This bed was so easy to set up. I carried it up the stairs in my house by myself and set it up in about 10 minutes. It was just like the videos I saw on YouTube and it was ready to sleep on that night. I wasn't sure how much I liked it the first two nights because I had never had a memory foam bed and it was different but after the second night I was sold. I love it!!! It is firm yet soft and it is not hot at all. This mattress has changed the way I sleep so much that when I have to stay somewhere else for the night I find myself wanting to be home just for my mattress. I even told my mattress I would miss it before I left for my last trip, lol.
 Couldn't be happier, the other reviews are right. This is one of the best mattresses I've ever owned.
 The mattress is good quality and has good support but it is too firm.  I am a side sleeper and I have tossed and turned all night because my sides would fall asleep.  I ended up purchasing a topper for the mattress and have been sleeping well ever since.  Not thrilled I had to spend an additional $150 on a topper.
 It's pretty firm
 Not as soft as it felt at first
 Now i sleep like a baby again
 love it- super comfy!
 Best purchase I have made in years.  I am so happy I bought this mattress.
 Great mattress for the price! Very satisfied!
 It's a great mattress. A little too firm for me however since it's so inexpensive I was able to buy a three inch tempurpedic topper and it was still under $1000.
 I love it, very affordable for the quality you are getting.
 *** UPDATED*** after one month<br/><br/>After a couple of days of sleeping on this mattress, we started to get a bit of a back ache and not able to sleep. I didn't want to go through the trouble of getting a whole new mattress so we tried to get a memory foam insert for the top of the bed to make it softer. The manufacturer said that it would get softer as we used it more so I was willing to give it a try.<br/><br/>Finally, we are sleeping much better and the bed is pretty comfortable. We had to spend another $100 bucks on it, but i think it was worth it to not have to return it and find another mattress.  The Casper mattress is supposed to be softer so that might be an easier fix if you haven't order it yet.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>We let the mattress off gas for a couple days before we slept on it. There is still a bit of a Smell but not too noticeable.<br/><br/>The real problem is how firm the mattress is. My wife is pregnant and has to sleep on her side and wakes up in the morning with pains in her back.  I'm also a side sleeper and I keep waking up with my arms tingling and falling asleep. We are both on the smaller side.<br/><br/>We are going to go to Costco and get a mattress topper to see if that helps before we return this. I know the Casper mattress is supposed to be a little softer so I wish we had tried that first even for a little more money.<br/><br/>It would be great if T &amp; N would give us some sort of refund for having to purchase a mattress topper, though I'm not even sure that will fix it.  It's got to be cheaper than us returning a 600$ mattress which they send to charity.
 Very comfortable. Never slept better
 This is the most comfortable mattress. And the price is awesome. I will tell all my friends. You rock Amazon.
 This has worked out to be a fabulous purchase.
 This bed is amazing no complaints I think I really found the right one.
 Great product and great customer service.  I would highly recommend it.
 Totally satisfied from the first night I slept on it. My wife loves it we had a Select Comfort before and she never had a good nights sleep on it. From day one she is sleeping in great comfort on the Tuft and Needle.
 Love this bed!
 most comfortable mattress, ever!
 Tuft &amp; Needle is the most comfortable mattress and goes perfect with Classic brand ber frame .
 Very happy with purchase. So convenient. Simply unfold wait alittle and better sleeping. Price was right. Newer technology.
 Convenient and comfy
 Not as good as its hyped up to be
 This bed is amazing.<br/><br/>My husband and I have been debating for quite some time about upgrading to a king size bed. After months of awful sleep in our spring-coil mattress we decided to bite the bullet. I was worried that the only nice quality memory foam mattress I would be able to find would end up being $2000+ and that was something we really didn't want to spend. I began researching different companies through Consumer's Report and found the Tuft and Needle Brand. It was ranked as one of the top memory foam mattresses and it was only $750 for a king! I couldn't believe it. I began researching it on Amazon and after finding countless good reviews, we decided to purchase the mattress. The mattress came in one large box with the basic instructions of simply unwrapping the mattress and watching it expand. I'll admit we were a little nervous initially because we thought we accidently bought a twin size mattress because the company was able to compact the mattress into such a small bundle!<br/><br/>We've had the mattress about a month now and it's without a doubt the best mattress we've ever had. It's extremely comfortable and supportive of the neck and spine. In fact, we still have our old spring-coil mattress in our guest room and I ended up sleeping on it one night after being used to the new mattress and I could tell an immediate difference when I woke up the next morning. I had horrible back pain throughout the entire day. The Tuft and Needle mattress has changed everything about the way my husband and I sleep. I'm very happy with our purchase and would recommend this mattress to everyone. ​
 Awesome ... everything it was advertised to be.
 Very comfortable and love the fact it is not toxic like most mattresses on the market regardless of price.
 Great if you're interested in the Japanese sleep system, or just firm mattresses in general. Took a while to get adjusted to.
 my mother in law loves her new bed
 Amazing! I've had a King for over a year now. Still holds up perfectly fine. Amazingly comfortable and cool. Great purchase and fast delivery.
 Pretty good matress. Not so high on it like a lot of other people, but it's good. Worth the money.
 I had just returned my Casper mattress because it got so hot at night. I tried this one and not only was it much cheaper, I am having a much better night's sleep.
 Amazing bed. Very comfortable. Fast shipping.
 Hands down an excellent value mattress,  extremely comfortable and a nice balance between firm and soft.  The memory foam really supports your body well.  Easy to carry up stairs to an apartment or bedroom and expands amazingly quickly.  Extremely satisfied with this product so far.
 This mattress is so comfortable
 Got this mattress because my old spring one killed my back after my lower back surgery/recovery process. this mattress dis not have any strange odor ot anything like i see some complaining about.<br/><br/>This mattress like any thing else that is new to you takes time to get used to. Once you are used to this and sleep on it for about 2 weeks you crybabies will be ok. Those of you that have had to have decompression/lumbar/disc operations this will be your best tool for recovering beaides walking around.<br/><br/>If you want to sleep and then wake up and wonder what day it is when you wake everyday, then buy this. With the simple design of this mattress im surprised the mattress store clowns arent out of business. Plus i dont buy ANY product that isnt from the USA.
 I trusted all of the amazing positive reviews and I'm glad I did. Definitely took a couple nights to get used to, but we love this bed.
 Awesome mattress. Very comfy. Easy to carry in box of course.
 I LOVE THIS BED! It's not too particularly heavy, and the main thing for me is that if I move, I know I can vacuum seal it in another bag. I've bought a Beautyrest Plush Kate hybrid mattress for $3.5K and I got this for $650.00 and I like this more than the Beautyrest. It is pretty firm, but I am a fan of firm mattresses. I bought the 14" metal bed frame that folds up and it's a pretty solid fit. Be sure to get some kind of protection for it, unless you absolutely don't care about where you sleep. Bed bugs and other mites are a big menace when it comes to furniture, so a $20.00 investment when buying this is a huge recommendation. I sleep very well at night thanks to this mattress.
 I love it
 As described.  Nice So far so good.
 Bought in summer of 2015. Had never gotten a foam mattress before but I am now never going back!
 Happy so far with the mattress.  Shipped fast, medium firmness which is what I was looking for.  You may be able to avoid sales tax by buying directly from T&amp;N.
 It has been about six weeks and it has never really softened up.
 By far one of the best mattresses I have ever owned. I have been having problems sleeping for years... now I just have problems getting up because I sleep so well on this mattress.
 The best mattress yet soft and very comfortable when tired of a long day at work.
 This is a really nice bed.  My wife and I enjoyed this mattress.  So soft and comfy.
 Very comfortable
 I wanted to love this mattress so bad! I was excited to be supporting a seemingly great company. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of sleeping on this, I hate it. My back has been killing me and I frequently  wake up with neck and arm pain throughout the night. My day to day tasks have become nearly unbearable to complete with all this back pain I have been having. I am a stay at home mom of 4, so you can imagine how important a good night of sleep is for me. I'll be returning as soon as I can figure out how.
 wow, I knew it would be firm but its really firm.  I figured I would need to add a plush topper, but ended up adding a 2 inch gel foam as well.  My wife and I are both side sleepers and needed to upgrade from our seriously sinking wannabe "serta" mattress we got 5 years ago.  Overall it is a well made product, the sides don't really sink much (the reviewer who said the sides sunk and she fell out of bed needs to wash her mouth out with soap).  We probably should have gotten a softer bed but even with the extra money spent on the topper and foam we have a very very comfortable bed at under 1K.
 I really wanted to love this mattress because it is nontoxic. However it is not the case, I purchased a full size for my daughter and a king size for our room and no one can sleep well on them. My back shoulders and neck have been sore since sleeping in this mattress. If you sleep on your side your arms go numb. It's hot and I wake up a lot during the night from being uncomfortable or hot. Unfortunately we will not be recommending this product to anyone and now I have to go buy another mattress.
 We love this bed and it is still comfortable 6 months in!
 I also own a Casper mattress and I will write my review in comparison to that experience.<br/><br/>The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress comes in a smaller box than the Casper and does not come with the fancy tool Casper includes to cut away the plastic wrapping. Without the safety cutter it took some patience to cut away the tightly wrapped plastic wrapper and avoid damage to the mattress. When I first cut away the outer layer of plastic I thought they had sent me a Twin mattress and not a Queen. After a short moment of worry I removed the inner layer of plastic wrapping and the mattress quickly expanded to full width and length. The entire expansion process only took about 20 minutes to an hour (I stepped away for a bit so I can't be sure exactly how long).<br/><br/>Once everything was unwrapped and expanded I returned to the room to find that the off-gassing smell of the mattress was slightly better than the Casper. Both mattresses smelled at first, but neither was overwhelming. The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress lost 90% of it's gassy smell in 24 hours. Within 2 days it had no off-putting smell at all.<br/><br/>Comfort: This is where the Tuft &amp; Needle shines. This mattress is most definitely not as firm as the Casper. I found it to be much more suitable for a side sleeper as it gives about .75 - 1 inches of extra sinking-in with my 195 pound 6'1" frame. The edge support on the mattress is equally bad as the Casper and makes it a little tough to sit on the side of the bed while putting on my shoes or socks. Other than that, I found that I can sleep within 8 inches of the side and not worry at all about it rolling me towards the edge. I found this to be a very comfortable mattress.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a great value. It doesn't hold up to some of the $1,200 memory foam mattresses, but for the money it's exactly what I wanted.
 might well work for some but just a little on the too-soft side for me, I need something firmer
 So far this mattress has been a good fit, as I have back and neck issues, and find myself able to get a good nights rest on this mattress.
 Quick Shipping! Love this mattress! bought 2 for guest bedroom.... well made and super comfy.
 The best ♥️
 It is everything I expected, love it so much I bought another for the other bed room
 This should have been Oprah's favorite things. This mattress has literally changed my life. I sleep soundly every single night, no longer have back pains, and my dog loves it more than I do!
 Perfect bed for me. Firm but not a rock. No dimples or caves on the surface, just a soft smooth top which is nice. Great price, easy to have shipped to you. A+!
 Excellent! My back felt better within 2 days. Fast shipping.  .
 This is not a paid review or one offering a free coupon like so many other reviews I have found. I have been looking for a new mattress to replace my 3 year old 2000 dollar Macy bed. Decided to try a few of these boxed mattresses and compare as the process seemed way more simple then going to a mattress store. The first mattress I ordered was a king size ghost bed and I must say that this was a very well made and comfortable bed for back sleeping but not so much for side sleeping, it sleeps cool and has multiple layers...fyi  am 215lbs. I can definitely recommend the ghost mattress so far compared to the Tuft and Needle....now for the tuft and needle.....it feels so cheap compared to the ghost bed, almost like it's a single piece of egg crate foam that you sink into. Tuft and needle is not a supportive mattress and honestly now that I have tested it ....seems like a hyped up scam with a pretty nasty amount of off gassing. I am currently waiting for a Voila mattress and a Purple mattress and will update when I try those. USEFUL  info ahead!  If you need a king size mattress do not order a king  ..order two twin xl mattresses instead as the king will be impossible to return to amazon...trust me I tried to vacuum reseal the mattress to fit the ghostbed back into the box and it's almost impossible. The two twin xl is the exact same size as the king with less headaches when it comes time to move or return your mattress. Hope this helps.
 Super comfortable, no complaints, and it keeps me cool!
 Great mattress
 Such a soft and amazing bed.
 I am very pleased with this mattress.  Haven't slept better in years!
 Very awesome mattress a bit on the firm side. Just like I like it.
 I ordered this mattress for a guest bedroom and have been sleeping on it for the last 5 nights just to try it out to see if I wanted the king-sized version for the master. I can't even tell you how comfortable it is. It keeps me cool (definitely had fewer nighttime hot flashes) and I didn't wake up with achy hips like with my Sealy Posturepedic mattress.  I just ordered another one for my master bedroom. Great price, great night's sleep, and it doesn't break the bank.  I am using it with a really great platform (lots of support slats) and no box spring.  It does collapse a bit on the edges when putting all my weight on it (like when I sit on the edge of the bed) but that's not an issue for me because I don't sleep on the edge.
 Best mattress ever. Perfect combination of buoyancy and support.
 My back says "Thanks"
 My wife &amp; I, after many months or researching and contemplation, replaced a 12 year old pillow-top spring mattress that had bottomed out &amp; was being supported with numerous couch pillows. So far (Only 4 days in), the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress has proven a happy purchase. Though on the firm side still, both my wife &amp; I have woken pain-free and energetic; something that has not happened in a long while with our old pillow-top. I do feel there is a breaking in period, as the first couple nights had me rolling to readjust to the new firmness though this had no effect as to how I felt in the morning. Last night, I only remember rolling over twice...so, it looks like my body is adjusting nicely.<br/>  I knew from most of the reviews that the Tuft &amp; Needle was a 7 out of 10 on the firmness meter and specifically chose this mattress because I am large man whose weight ranges from 250-275 &amp; wanted a product that would support my weight without sagging for as many years as I can manage. My wife, on the other hand, is active with curves &amp; is adjusting to the firmness but it remains too firm for her, I'll get a twin XL mattress topper for her side.
 After several months of waking up feeling very sore and not well rested, I figured it was time to replace my 7 year old king serta mattress.  I was also getting ready to have surgery which would require me to be planted in bed for about 6 weeks.  I couldn't believe how expensive furniture and mattress stores were and I really was not prepared to fork out that kind of money when I stumbled onto an ad by Tuft &amp; Needle and decided to give it shot.  I figured I couldn't go wrong with their return policy and while they didn't haul away the old, I could work around that for the price point.  Thanks to the awesomeness of Amazon Prime, the totally manageable box arrived the day before my surgery.  We rolled it out and I was ready to go.  I am close to my 5 month mark of owning this mattress and I have to say that this is the very best mattress I've ever paid for.  There is no rolling side to side to find a comfy spot - it's just all evenly dispersed goodness.  There didn't seem to be heat radiating from it in the summer months but now in the cooler months, it is cozy to slide into.  I will say that very edge of the sides tend to be a bit mushy (like 2") but who sleeps dangling from the edge anyway?  I'm very pleased and happy with this purchase so much so, that I'm getting ready to order a queen size for one of the kids!
 5 stars for the price to quality ratio<br/>Personally I would like it to be a tad softer/a little more of the comfort foam, but overall it was a great purchase and I am very happy with it.
 Honestly, this is the best mattress we've ever had. I recommend this to every one I know in search of a new mattress. I haven't heard my Boyfriend complain about his neck and back since we've gotten it which used to be an every day occurrence. We've had it for almost a year and it's still wonderful. My mother purchased one, as well, and also loves it. Her SO has major back problems and would leave their old bed to sleep on the recliner and since they've purchased a Tuft and Needle she now stays in bed at night.
 Very comfortable. Perfect level of firmness for me. I'm 5'9", 140lbs, and prefer my mattresses slightly on the firmer side.
 Comfy large easy to set up
 Best mattress ever!
 Cheaper and just as sturdy as our old Tempurpedic.
 Made a big difference in my sleep, able to sleep all night for once
 Very good quality. A good nights sleep
 Best mattress! Everyone should have it!
 Excellent buy!
 Very happy about this purchase
 BEST SLEEP EVER!  We LOVE our mattress!!!
 I've never felt so horrible after a night sleep then after sleeping on this mattress. It doesn't support my body correctly and I wake up in extreme pain and soreness nearly every morning after owning this mattress for a while now.  The soreness started mild and I thought it was the adjustment period but it only got worse. Something is really off. I'm currently in that state of pain while writing this review and just switched to the couch to salvage my last hour of sleep. I don't want others to make this same mistake.
 Best bed ever!
 Great product as advertised
 Very happy
 I purchased my mattress (cal king) Feb 26, 2016 and it arrived very quickly, the package was a bit beat up but its a foam mattress I wasn't very worried about it. After the first week of semi restless sleep i attributed it to a new mattress and i needed to get used to it. That continued for a bit longer but i eventually was able to sleep somewhat throughout the night.<br/><br/>Coming up on a year later and i will be shopping for a new mattress, i wake up most mornings with a good amount of back pain that goes away after i get up and stretch. Im 33 years old and really shouldn't be waking up with lower back pain after an average of 6 hours of sleep. I may just not get along with this mattress as well as i had hoped. Perhaps i need something just a bit softer than this.
 This mattress is so freakin comfortable!!!
 Purchased this for my ten year old son.  Needed a mattress but did not have time for traditional store delivery.  Read about this product and decided to check it out.  Very nervous about purchasing such an important item without being able to see and feel in person, but am very glad that I did.  Full size mattress arrived in box that I was able to manage and bring to second floor bedroom.  My son had such fun unpacking it and seeing it "blow up" to full size.  He loves it.  Very soft and cushiony, which is what he wanted in a mattress.  There was no "new mattress" odor.  We were able to recycle all the shipping materials.  Win-win situation.  I would definitely purchase again.  Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle for making a great product.
 Update!!! I turned the mattress and it fits perfectly!!! I have updated my rating to 5 stars.<br/><br/>This bed is perfect for me as far as being comfortable goes. I have had it for 2 months, and so far so good. My problem with this bed is that it's too short.<br/><br/>If I want the mattress to come down to the foot of the bed, it leaves a gap at the top of the bed. My 2 year old nephew came to stay a couple of days with me and I had to put pillows in between the mattress and the headboard to keep him from falling through.<br/><br/>If I push the bed closer towards the headboard, it leaves at gap in between the mattress and the foot of the bed. Eventually I will get another mattress, because this one is not a keeper.
 Sleeps a bit warm, but otherwise very comfortable.
 I really want to like this bed, given the reviews and ease of purchase (first time mattress buyer). Unfortunately it is too firm - not good (maybe even painful?) for side sleepers. Been trying to like it for about 3 weeks to little avail.<br/>Edit1: mattress might be less firm for heavier people. I weigh less than 110lbs.<br/><br/>Also, the bed is very thick, making me weirdly self conscious about adding a topper to it. The idea (and practice, trying a topper now) immediately reminds me of Princess and the Pea.<br/><br/>...It's probably time for me to return it.<br/><br/>Edit2: After reading some comments here, I called Amazon customer service and asked to speak to the large item return department. They were incredibly helpful! I'm keeping the review at 2 stars for the mattress, because I don't want to dilute my opinion on the product, but Amazon returns deserves 5 stars.
 softer than i expected, but the kids love it. my 3 yr old only fell off of it 3x his first night on it, but now sleeps like a champ!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>My 4 yr old has now been sleeping on this for about a year. He loves his bed and it has been good to him. His little brother liked it so much he started taking his naps on it, so we decided it was time to promote him to his own twin bed. The mattresses have held up great so far. There have been a few times where my husband or I have actually fallen asleep on the mattresses while putting the kids down for naps. I actually find the mattress quite comfortable.<br/><br/>I like that I know the mattresses are safe, no off-gassing, and they have held up wonderfully to our rough boys.
 Best sleep I have EVER had. Buying one for my mom.
 It's pretty much perfection.
 Wow these are awesome mattresses!  Really comfortable and they don't off-gas terrible fumes like the average mattress.
 Really comfortable.
 Super comfy and easy to set up! I love how comfortable it is!
 Great buy. No initial problems (odor). Mattress is firm but not hard (just enough sink for comfort) and after 2-3months of use- have had no pains and many restful nights.
 Firmer than I expected, but still very comfortable.  It took very little time to expand, I did not notice any odor at all.  I would highly recommend this product.
 So hard to tell, at first on this mattress I slept like a baby but after sometime I found it harder to get a full night's rest. My job is pretty demanding physically and now with this mattress my shoulders are sore every morning and again I can no longer ger get a full night's rest. My significant other co.ains about her back a lot as well. Mattress is still in really good condition over a year of sleeping on it. The sheets do come off a lot like other reviewers have stated.
 My husband and I were researching mattresses and this seemed to be a really good mattress from all the reviews we read on Amazon so we ordered a king size...it came in three days and we set it up with no problems or smell...its reached its full size in mere minutes so everything was looking good....NOW THE BAD PART!...it hurts to wake up in the morning !....my hips and back hurt ever since we first tried it!....had to go back to our old bed !.....This is going to be returned but not sure how now that it's expanded
 Wow is all I will say. First morning waking up with no neck &amp; back pain in years. Great product!!
 Crazy awesome bed. My small boy is growing like a weed...and he has outgrown his twin. I got him this, and we were all mesmerized when I opened the tubular box and this thing started making noises like...stand back, I'm about to expand. (note: I've bought all my beds in stores, mostly innerspring...this was fun to un-box).<br/><br/>Bed is soft to lay on, you sink in a touch. But it doesn't give much for flex beyond the initial give. I know I'm not being descriptive enough, but I'm 200lb back sleeper and this thing is firm enough for me. My boy is 80 lbs side sleeper, and he says he wants a marshmallow -- and he says he likes this. What can I tell you?<br/><br/>I think it's got some foam-like properties...a little give and then no more. It keeps cool, which is important to me.
 Have had multiple one-night stands attempt to turn themselves into relationships because of this mattress.<br/><br/>My cat ALSO cannot get enough.<br/><br/>Keeping one star because I've only had it six months and have yet to see how it holds up over the years.
 Too firm. Did not like at all! Requested a refund.
 Nice comfortable.
 Wasn't sure about ordering a mattress on line but I love it.  Fast service, good price and great bed.
 So far, I'm a fan! It's a happy middle group of firm and soft. Arrived quickly and as expected!
 I bought this mattress on Amazon last February. The reason I took the chance on buying a mattress over Amazon was the Tuft and Needle 100 night warranty. ***Note that the company doesn't expect you to reroll and ship the mattress back to the company! Instead, they have you donated to a local charity, and then they will refund the money.***<br/><br/>I decided they must be really sure of their product to offer such a warranty, so we took the chance. We figured if we didn't like it, it would still be a win-win for a local charity. I set my calendar alarm for 90 days, from the day we received it, as a reminder to really consider what we thought of the bed.<br/><br/>The very first night we realize that this bed was completely different from anything we had ever slept on. Granted, we had never owned a super high-end multi thousand-dollar mattress before, (but we have slept in some GREAT $$$$ ones) but we had enjoyed our old traditional mattress until it was just too old to be comfortable.<br/><br/>The first morning my husband woke up saying that his hips and back hurt much less than they ever had (he is a disabled Vet). All I knew was that I wasn't tossing and turning all night; instead<br/>I closed my eyes.<br/>I open my eyes.<br/> It was morning.<br/>And I was rested. That works for me!<br/><br/>Today a friend ask if anyone would recommend a mattress, and I immediately spoke up! One year later this mattress is still holding up just like the first day we received it. I have spilled liquid on the mattress and it cleaned up with no problems. I can truly say it's the best mattress we have ever owned. We would definitely recommend this mattress highly and we'll definitely purchase another when needed.
 I really wanted to like this mattress - I did a good amount of research and I was really excited for my first Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress. To my disappointment, this mattress is extremely firm and has given me back pain. A previous customer expressed similar experiences with her mattress and was given a reimbursement for the mattress topper they eventually bought, but I was not afforded this option by T&amp;N.  They did suggest a mattress topper via their customer service line.<br/><br/>Overall - great quality mattress from a slick company, but too firm!
 Best Mattress I've had so far but I've only had it for about a week! But so far I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!
 Great bed and at a great price 5 stars
 Only have had the matress for about a month, but so far, it is extremely comfortable.
 Love love this bed. Incredibly comfortable.  Next matters will also be a Tuft.
 Wonderful. I never slept better
 Love love love my bed and loved the price even more.  It was so easy no hard sell no stress. Thank you guys so much
 I love my new mattress!. Quick easy set up and ready to sleep on.
 Perfect comfort and support!
 Really like this matress.  Medium firmness.  Very comfortable.
 Love this! Bed easily expanded and didn't have strong chemical odor.  High quality for affordable price.
 great bed, I was very happy I mean very happy!!!!!! et
 Very comfortable
 When we buy another mattress it will be a Tuft &amp; Needle. Love it.
 comfortable and cool. recommended
 I love it, very comfortable and sleeps cool which is a huge plus.
 After sleeping on this mattress for a month, it's hard to find words to describe how dangerously comfortable it is. This mattress was worth every penny. I highly recommend it to improve your quality of sleep!
 Most comfortable mattress I’ve ever owned and their support team is awesome.
 So far so good .....
 Wife wanted a matress.  Looked and chose this.  Exceeded my expectations.
 A great bed, bought it for a guest room but we decided to use it fior our own bed
 Our mattress was delivered two days earlier than expected.  WE opened it according to the simple directions which were provided with it and put it on our old foundation.  There was no chemical odor and were enjoying a very comfortable, good night's sleep  that same evening.  We were reluctant to get a foam mattress, especially at this low price, since we were used to the kind with springs.  This is  so much better.  Would recommend Tuft and Needle to anyone. They also provide excellent service.  When I asked if there was a charity in our neighborhood that would accept a used mattress donation, they came back to me in a couple of hours with 2 names. Great company.
 My husband and I bought this mattress right at the end of November. We decided to give it a few solid months of use before reviewing. The product itself came in a very beat-up box but it was intact and enclosed within plastic. The smell that I have seen others comment on is strong, but will fade after a week or so.<br/><br/>Initially, it was quite comfortable. The mattress almost molded to each of our body shape. However, after a few months of solid use, both my husband and I are waking up with back and cervical pain on an almost daily basis. I feel like my body is sinking in the middle and isn't as supported at the ends (my head and feet). I am currently 5 months pregnant and have had to resort to sleeping on the couch (which is NOT comfortable) to have more consistency.  It's a good mattress but something is missing from it -- we considered buying a  mattress topper but wanted to give it a little time to see if it was just an adjustment period.
 So far, so good. We've been sleeping on this mattress for a month, and are very happy with it. If I had any comment, it would be that the edges are soft, so it's not good to sit on the side of the bed. But it is extremely comfortable to sleep on. Both my husband and I are back and side sleepers, and are sleeping well. It is not too firm or too soft--a real Goldilocks mattress! The mattress was easy to set up. I am hoping that this comfort lasts for more than a short while.
 This mattress is too firm.
 BUY IT NOW. ITS MAD GOOD. I GOT 1 FOR MY MOM AND IT WAS SO GOOD I GOT 1 MORE FOR ME.
 Sleeps wonderfully.  Best thing I ever bought from Amazon.com.  Oh, and I had fun unpacking it!  LOL
 Arrived earlier than expected. Have had it over a month now. Very comfortable -- not too soft, not too firm.
 Great mattress at a great price!
 Wow, no more hip pain at night. This mattress is wonderful, great price, delivered fast and perfect firmness.
 Overall I'm really happy with this purchase. The mattress, while being thick and firm is also soft. Since I've gotten it my back has bothered me much less and my sleep has been more restful.<br/>I'm a big dude, 300lbs, and while I'm working on weight loss, it will take time. This mattress doesn't seem to have lost any of it's firmness or size in the month I've owned it.
 All these reviews are accurate. Not only is this a wonderful mattress, the customer service is unmatched. I'll never buy a mattress in a store again!
 I HATE mattress shopping, especially in person with pushy sales people. I don't know what kind of mattress I need -- soft, firm, plush -- I just know I would love to sleep well. So after reading the reviews, I purchased the King version on Amazon even though it was the most I have ever spent on a mattress, knowing I could return it if needed. What company does that? This one!<br/><br/>Ordering and Delivery<br/>I ordered the mattress on Feb 24 at 11am PT. The listing said "Usually ships within 2 to 3 days" and gave an estimated delivery date of "March 3-6". So I had plenty of time to look for "accessories". I found a recommendation on your site for a good mattress encasement, did some research, and purchased one a few minutes later. I got an email the next morning, on Feb 25 at 9:20am PT, that said my mattress had shipped, with the same estimated delivery date. I had a tracking number so I went to Fedex to look it up. Turns out it was already on a truck for delivery... the same day! Come 3pm, the box was delivered at my house. (They didn't even ring the bell or knock on the door... just left the huge box leaning on my porch and we happened to look out and see it.) So let's recap. I ordered at 11am Feb 24. It arrived 3pm Feb 25. Guess it pays to be close to the warehouse! In fact, the mattress arrived well before the mattress cover.<br/><br/>Unboxing<br/>The box wasn't terribly damaged, though it did have a large piece missing from one edge where something was pushed into it. Once we got it upstairs to our bedroom, we immediately saw how dirty the box was -- totally covered in something like a heavy dust. Very odd. Once I cut open the box and pulled out the rolled up mattress, we had to wash out hands very well so we don't get our new baby all dirty. No big deal. On to the unpacking! Now, I don't consider myself an incompetent person, but I didn't quite figure out how to cut the outer most plastic wrapping without cutting the inner plastic. I got it half off when I heard the sound of the mattress expanding. I evidently cut too deep and cut into the second layer of plastic before I had it all rolled out. So I hurried and cut through the rest of it, trying not to cut the mattress itself, just in time for it to expand completely. That was the only real negative part of the unboxing. It was pretty cool how something so large can fit in such a small box.<br/><br/>After my 30 night trial<br/>I know some reviews on Amazon talk about having the best night's sleep ever and other wild claims but remember these are all hyperbole at best. Bottom line is that after sleeping on the mattress for 30 nights, I didn't have a great reason to return it. I slept about the same as I did on my previous mattress. I wasn't suddenly swept off to dreamland immediately upon resting my head down. I tossed and turned about as much as I did before. I probably should see a doctor about that. And since I ignored the wild claims made by other reviews, I wasn't disappointed in the outcome. It is a nice mattress, comfortable, soft to touch, looks great, but that's it. I do notice my pillows may need to be replaced soon since I now need 2 pillows to prop up my head on this mattress than my previous one. No big deal, though. It will work fine.
 We love our Tuft &amp; Needle mattress! Such a great purchase.
 Great mattress for half the price of big names.
 so comfortable !
 Very comfortable. Would buy again.
 I truly, truly wanted to like this mattress, but I think I was seduced by all of those 5-star reviews. The two big lies for me are that this mattress is medium-to-firm and that the mattress sleeps cool. I feel like I am sleeping on a hot marshmallow. I finally grabbed a board and placed it under the mattress, but it is still way too squishy. Two of the eight nights I woke up crying  because my legs cramped up so much when they sunk into the mattress abyss. I HAVE to return this.
 Delivery and packaging was great. It does weigh nearly 100 pounds, so some helping moving it may be needed. Had it for over a month, it is a great night's sleep.
 Got mine a week ago and both mine and my boyfriend's backs feel amazing!! It is the best mattress I've slept on ever! I can't believe the difference!
 comfortable, economical, well packaged
 Love my new mattress! Highly recommended!
 Great sleeping good now
 My husband and I both love this mattr ess!!
 It says you need two people to lift this. Take it from someone who went and picked it up in one state, drove it to another, then took it into her apartment and set it up, again, by herself. You really do need two people. The only reason I didn't flag down a neighbor was pride, and the fact that it was late and I had already committed myself to cartwheeling the box into place in my bedroom. That worked and all, but seriously, just get another person to help. Especially if you ordered anything larger than a full.<br/><br/>Anyway, cutting the plastic off and watching it expand was one of those really satisfying, calming aesthetics. I let it have 24 hours to inflate fully and settle before I tried to sleep on it, and then, since it was a weekend and I actually didn't have anything planned the next morning, I disabled my alarm, went to sleep and didn't wake up for about fourteen hours.<br/><br/>If you like sleeping firm, and cool (I do) then this is a great mattress. It's probably too hard for some tastes, but I was specifically looking for a firmer mattress that wouldn't get too warm, and for me, this is perfect. Decent price for the quality you're getting. Shipping was a bit of a disaster, but that was for mostly unrelated reasons. Let's just say it's too bad there's no Amazon locker option for bigger items. I think generally these guys seem to have shipping convenience well in their favor, and I'm going to say my experience with that was atypical.
 Pretty much as advertised.  A cheap yet good mattress delivered quickly and easy to set up.  A bit on the firm side, good for me as I'm a stomach sleeper.
 Most comfortable bed
 We love this mattress!
 The mattress is a bit too firm for my taste, but, my husband really likes it. However, my suggestion is that you buy the mattress through Tuft and Needle. We thought we would be able to have a 30 day trial and return the mattress through Amazon. Unfortunately, through many phone calls to customer service and many misunderstandings, we were not able to return the mattress because you have to return items to Amazon unopened and in its original packaging. However, I don't understand how their 30 day trial and their return policy coexist. It was a very frustrating process. Overall, if you like a firm, foam mattress, there is a good chance you will like this mattress, just purchase it through Tuft and Needle because they will give you a full refund if you don't like it.
 We are both happy with Mattress so far.
 I have been using this mattress for a year. It has given me many amazing nights of sleep. Happy to recommend to anyone searching for a great mattress.
 Best night of sleep I've had in a year.
 I was skeptical, but after 3 months of use I can honestly say that this is the most comfortable mattress I have owned
 I love this bed. Super comfy, incredible price for a king size. What more do you need?
 ...but I will try.<br/><br/>Its absolutely amazing. All the glowing reviews are right; its like a sleep revolution. Not too hard and not too soft; suitable for back/slide/front sleepers, easy to unroll and best of all: Made in the USA at an affordable price.<br/><br/>I wanted to wait a while before I posted the review, I thought maybe it was too good to be true... its not. A+ Tuft and Needle; thank you!
 Always slept on spring mattresses and this is way better. May be a little on the firm side, but this is perfect for me. The price couldn't be better.
 The bed felt so wonderful when we first got it. I just hope that it will retain its shape a lot longer than anticipated. However, this bed is not meant to be lounging in while on your back for a long time because the back was stiff and a bit sore when I was laying on my back while lounging for an hour.<br/>Folowup: April 2018. The bed did not last, comfort-wise, as anticipated because our lower backs have been hurting for the past month. It is as if the structure of the mattress isn’t meant to last longer than two (2) years. Also, it is impossible to take off the mattress covers comfortably to have it washed because it is so heavy and would be very difficult to try to stuff the mattress in the cover.
 Returning "The Internet's Most Comfortable Mattress" (TM) as it's way, way too firm for either my wife or my liking.  Shouldn't trust a company that has to trademark any qualitative element of their product.  Let's see how Amazon's Special Handling department works now as that's the only way to return thru Amazon.  This is night # 34 of our 100 days and we cannot take it anymore.  Going to try Westin's Heavenly mattress and sheet set as we've always slept great at Westin's with this.
 Great mattress for the price. Quality workmanship and with the right sheets the bed made me feel excited to go back to sleep again. The mattress is on the firm side but i feel it holds the support you body needs very well.
 Not only is this mattress extremely nice, ordering, receiving, and setting up is very easy. (The box is heavy though;).) No hassle, free shipping, speedy delivery, great mattress. Watch YouTube reviews first. Well worth the money.
 After several nights of giving it a chance I am disappointed in the comfort. We are both side sleepers and the first couple of nights both of us woke several times. My wife said her hips hurt and I am having the same issue with the outside of my hips being sore in the morning. I am 6'1", 190-200 lbs and my wife is 5'8" and about 120 lbs. This may be great for some but I am returning the mattress and I cannot see spending 100 nights on it, let alone the duration of the 10 year warranty.
 Great relief of my back and hamstring. The product itself just two layers of foam, but it worked!
 My husband loves it. I wake up sweating.
 Strongly dislike this mattress. I am a healthy person &amp; ended up developing back problems after purchase. Ended up doing physical therapy &amp; I just kept thinking maybe it was the mattress after my therapist encouraged me to ditch it... I did after sleeping in the guest room for about 6 months. Back is back to normal. My husband had no preference so we put it in the guest room for now. Crazy.
 Thinner than expected - but comfy
 Best mattress I’ve ever owned
 Great mattress!
 all i can say is thank you
 This is the second mattress we have ordered. Great mattress..great valu for the dollar
 Comfortable, resilient, firm
 Very comfortable , so far no issues
 It took a while to get used to since my last bed was soft and sunk in.  This Ben is more firm but  I love it.  It sleeps cool and reforms back to shape very fast.  I would recommend this bed to anyone.  We got the king size.
 It's a pretty good mattress for those on a budget. We had a Tempurpedic previously so it's hard to compete with that. 3.5 stars
 too hard. Manufacturer sent a topper but it didn't help. I need to return.
 Cannot rave enough.  After sleeping on expensive junk for the last ten years, my husband and I read the reviews and took a chance on this (queen size) mattress.  After nearly 2 months, I still get giddy when I slip into bed and remember "I have a new mattress!".  So ridiculously comfortable.  I have had back pain forever and in my early 40's wasn't sure where that was coming from….from my old cruddy mattress.  No more back pain - seriously, within a week or two I felt GOOD again when I got up in the morning.  Sorry if I'm gushing or sound like a bad ad, but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mattress and even more so for it's reasonable price.  Thank you hugely, Tuft &amp; Needle (&amp; Amazon!).
 Very comfy. Met expectations. Doesn't make sense to buy any other matress. This out performs any $1000+ matters for just $700
 comfort mattress and fast shipping.  thanks.
 I have fibromyalgia, I can finally get a good night sleep.
 Comfy
 We LOVE this mattress!
 This mattress is so soft and comfortable. I don't have any back problems anymore.
 1) We strongly dislike the softness of the mattress and found it uncomfortable and hurtful to sleep on. We had significant back pain in the morning which I have NEVER had previously.<br/><br/>2) We could not sit on the side of the mattress without it collapsing and our sliding off the mattress and sometimes on to the floor. It was impossible to sit on the bed with this mattress and get dressed (e.g., tie shoe laces)<br/><br/>3) finally the mattress was so soft within 6 inches of the edges that we woke repeatedly so we could slide ourselves towards the middle. Since this is a full size mattress, 9 inches on each side is significant about 30% of the mattress width is unusable.<br/><br/>Any ONE of these problems would have led to our returning this<br/>unsatisfactory product
 Perfect
 I wake up every single night from being too hot. Sometimes my leg goes numb and tingly when I sleep on my side. Also, I don't know how I could ever return this, it doubles in size when it is removed from the box.<br/><br/>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I don't hear or feel when my wife gets up in the night, and it seems to offer good support throughout my body.
 Super comfortable!
 Great mattress, starts off firm but after a few weeks it softens up a bit. It also does a good job of keeping you cool.
 very comfortable.
 Too soft could not sit on edge  too hot. Moved off base too easily
 This is a great mattress.  Overall, just slightly softer than the 5 inch.
 Very comfortable.  Finally a bed that we both agree on.
 Best mattress ever!
 great bed came fast just what i needed
 It's my first time to buy a mattress online, all I can say, it is worth to buy it, I love it~
 Great sleep for the first time in years!  We love this matress!
 Has been the best bed we've owned and at a fraction of the cost we've spent on "amazing" mattresses over the years.  No Chemical Smell (ever). We are a combined weight of 380lbs. The mattress continues to provide a comfortably sleep and we wake rested with no aches or pains. "Ahhh...I love this bed!"
 Best mattress ever!  And it comes in a very compact box.  Great story accompanies the founders and product also.  Made in USA
 This is a great mattress. I highly recommend it.
 Comfort and easy to made.  Fun to unpack!
 Well pleased!
 For the price, excellent bed!
 Sleep better but still seems to sag in center
 Meets our expectations...I agree with the other favorable reviews.
 Good mattress,on Time  delivery, easy to put on bed, fun to watch expand!
 Love it!!!!
 Wonderful nights of sleep. And it was a blast watching it puff up!
 Best sleep ever
 We are about to purchase our third mattress (for third bedroom) from  this company! Delivery in 5 days, easy to open (and fun to watch) and as comfortable as our Temperpedic.
 Comfortable, well priced and terrific customer service.  Could not be happier.  Delivery was on time and simple (unlike my experience with large national mattress companies).  Good value for the quality and comfort.  Definitely recommend.
 Shipped astr. Just as described. Very pleased
 Perfect.
 Best. Mattress. Ever. Superb customer service!  I have 4 comprrmised lumbar discs; spinal arthritis, and stenosis--tons of fun. But this mattress beats all.  (And my Newfy likes it too.)
 this is probably the best bed I have ever had its about a medium to firm
 Purchased the 10" twin mattress for my daughter's new day bed (despite being chastised by the bed salesman for not purchasing a mattress I could "try out on the floor" - big regret). The mattress arrived on-time. Packaging was easy to remove. Bed expanded just like the videos. Problem? Zero (and I mean ZERO) support along the edges. When I sat on the bed last night to say goodnight to my daughter, my rear end literally sunk down to the bed frame. Tonight my daughter tried to sit back on the bed to read (keep in mind that this is a day bed - to be used like a couch) and she sank down between the mattress and the bed frame. I deeply regret this purchase.
 So it took me a while to even write this as I hate to write a bad review about what seems like a great company but after having this mattress for almost 4 months the bed is now uneven. The bed was always a little firm for my liking but my husband loved it and I did grow to like it after a couple weeks. Unfortunately after a couple months the bed seems to be losing its support. My husband and I even tried switching sides but it's no use. The spots where he sleeps are almost dented in and the corners even seem to have become more rounded as my sheets keep slipping off which is driving me crazy!! Really wanted to like this bed but it seems as though the quality is just not there, a bed should not be uneven a few months in. Next I guess we will try flipping the mattress even though tuft &amp; needle says this should not be necessary. Wish I had purchased it through their site so maybe tuft &amp; needle could rectify this 😔
 Returned it. Finding a foam mattress as a side sleeper is a pretty difficult task. This mattress is one of the firmer you can find. It rates as a 6 but I would say it's closer to a 7. I'm 6-2, 225 lbs and I get the hip pressure as well as some shoulder pressure. I wake up stiff and subtle movements in the morning after getting out of bed would give me knots in my neck and upper back throughout the rest of the day.<br/><br/>The next mattress I'm going to try is the Brooklyn Bedding Soft version. Research that if you're a side sleeper. Amazon carries it too.
 Im a 6'5", 300lb, side sleeping, hot sleeper, with a history of chronic back pain and multiple back surgeries. I honestly don't know the last time I slept on a good mattress let alone a great mattress.<br/><br/>This mattress is a great mattress. It's supportive and comfortable. I'm very impressed with the quality and value. I'm honestly just really happy with it. I think this mattress would be great for anyone.
 Before we started sleeping on the Tuft and Needle, my wife and I always got up with a back ache.<br/>Now after a couple of weeks with the new mattress we wake up with no aches and refreshed , should of<br/>purchased it a long time ago.<br/>James Day
 it is a little too firm for me. but overall, i like it. i had purchased a plush mattress cover and hopefully it will help me out. =)
 Great Buy and saved a lot money
 Sleep great on this!
 This mattress is medium-firm and it comes stuffed inside of a vacuum-packed bag (weird, but in a good way).  It took a couple of weeks to get used to this non-traditional type of bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night a few times or I had a little insomnia a couple of nights before I got used to it.  It took me about a couple of weeks to be able to fully adopt it.  My original spring mattress used to create numb fingers and arms and hip pain if I didn't rotate my body, it caused me pain and a lot of sleepless nights.  This bed corrected those issues and I noticed that I fall asleep faster and I wake up without any pain and I'm not groggy.  I would recommend this bed but if you prefer a lot of smooshy, get a mattress topper.<br/><br/>I got this bed because I HATE to shop for this kind of stuff in a store...The last time that I tried to shop in a mattress store, the prices started at $700.00 and that did not include taxes and delivery charges.  It was a normal spring mattress w/ a box spring.  Then I would have had to be there for the delivery and setup.  This mattress was left on the doorstep and I dealt with it in my own time!  BTW:  I purchased a full and it was 60 lbs, but the box had handles so I was able to maneuver it easily into place.<br/><br/>I would recommend it giving the above caveats.
 very comfortable, easy to setup
 i like it , the man thinks its just ok
 Very comfy
 This bed is amazing. As someone who had her pelvis shattered over 4 years ago and chronic back pain since, I can say I've never had a better, consistently good nights' sleep than on this bed. I worried it would be too firm and right after we first unrolled it and sat down, I immediately had twinges of regret, but after that first night, it all went away. It's essentially a memory-foam, perfectly molding to your body so you feel like you're floating. I also must say, in addition to the comfort, this company is really great. Do a little research and you'll see why.<br/><br/>Mattresses are crazy expensive for reasons beyond my comprehension, but I was sick of sleeping on something cheap and we really wanted to upgrade to a king. Tuft and Needle made that possible within our price range, but trust me - you are not cheaping out on this bed! We decided to forego a boxspring (it's genuinely not necessary, no idea who has been keeping this myth alive - mattress companies probably!), and just got a simple kingsize platform. You can't feel anything below the mattress, you could probably put it directly on concrete and be fine.<br/><br/>Minor cons: there is no edge support, so when you slide/roll to the edge to get off, you can easily slide right off. It's really not a big deal, but it might shock you the first time it happens! I'm very used to it now, and I never ended up slipping off. Another con (and maybe this isn't a con for everyone) but it absorbs movement. This is actually a GREAT Thing, especially when your significant other is a flopper, but when you want to be able to...bounce or whatever on the bed, well, let's just say it takes quite a bit more effort!<br/><br/>Overall, we have had out mattress for 4 months now, and I love it just as much as that first night. I can't imagine sleeping on anything else.
 Best mattress ever!
 Very soft, yet firm. very comfortable
 I love this mattress, I don’t sink into it but it’s still beautifully soft 😍
 Had the mattress six month and love it!
 Took a day or two to adjust but the support is great.  If you like to sleep on the edge of your bed this is not going to work for you.
 Would never go back to a standard mattress!
 We have had this mattress for a month and a half now and we love it! no more aches and pains!
 I've put off writing a review until my wife and I have had several months sleeping on this mattress, but after 4 months we both can say that we love it. Like many who have reviewed this mattress it's the first foam mattress we've owned. We have been fooled in the past with soft "sink in" spring support bed that left us with aches and pains. It feels wonderful in the store but it's not what's needed for us for a comfortable good nights sleep. Obviously everyone has their preferences when it comes to mattresses and this review only reflects our tastes for comfort but we really are sold on this type of mattress. Cool to sleep on and firmly contours to our bodies whether we sleep on ours back or sides, and it's nice not to have a 24" thick bed to climb in and out of. Please, if you're looking for a new mattress give this one a try!
 Very comfortable mattress.  Tuft &amp; Needle is a great company to work with.
 Seriously the best bed Ive ever owned and the price is right too!  Opened it up last night and slept like I havent slept in a long time.  Will definitely be telling everyone about this bed!
 It's takes a couple days to get used to this mattress, but three months in I'm very happy with the purchase.
 Most comfortable bed ever.<br/>Love ittt!!!!!
 Soo comfortable
 We are some of the few people that can't stand this mattress.  We really wanted to love it, but unfortunately it didn't work for us.  We both have neck and back issues, and we are both side sleepers.  After reading the reviews, we thought it would be a great fit, but it has caused more damage.  Bummer! :(
 Worth the money. Very comfy.
 It stinks and is too soft. Not supportive.
 I do LOVE this bed!
 Great bed. Perfect mix of soft and firm.
 Enjoying the wonderful  sleep received from mattress. Quick shipping...
 There is not one thing I can say that isn't good about the mattress and my dealings with the company.  Mattress actually arrived sooner than projected delivery date.  Quality is as good as the many other reviews that highly recommend it and I have already recommended it to other people I know personally who suffer from back pain.
 Love this mattress!! have had it for a few months and has been amazing to sleep on!!
 I love this mattress. I prefer a firm mattress. It is firm and supportive. Great price. Great service. Love it.
 Easy to set up and comfortable as well. No complaints from my guests unlike the old mattress.
 Fabulous!!! Increadble how comfy it is...took a long time to ship
 Really liked the whole product and using it on regular basis. Till now very relaxing and comfortable product. we bought two same items
 Good product
 Product is as advertised.
 Great mattress for the price. Wasn't too warm during the summer months, even on nights when the A/C wasn't on.
 So comfortable. I love it. I had a $2000 mattress before this. I'll stick with Tuft and Needle from here on out.
 Fantastic mattress at any price.
 One of the best thing i've ever purchased! Not too soft, not to firm. Breathable and very cool with the right mattress sheet.
 Comfy
 Sleep has improved drastically, nice amount of firmness, and a fair price.
 This is a pretty bad product. As someone with backpain can say that the firmness stated this mattress has is false. It is not firm at all. In fact it is so soft that when its hot it softens up more and my back is almost sunk in to the mattress. Like a big pillow. While its not uncomfortable at first, you wake up feeling like your back broke in half. I don't recommend if you are looking for firm to medium mattress only if you are looking for an extra soft mattress. PS it also seems to retain heat.
 My husband is 6'6" tall. This bed is comfortable and he actually fits on it!
 Very pleased with our mattress. Just the right amount of softness to it, no odor, and isolates movement so that my husband and I don't disrupt each other's sleep. I happily recommend this mattress.
 great mattress.
 I have slept like a rock the past few nights. Such a great mattress and great price.
 My second purchase for my guest room. a really comfortable matteress
 this mattress is so comfortable and is amazing quality. i always get a good night sleep on this mattress
 The jury is still out, but it feels hotter than I hoped it would be.
 Loved it.
 This is the best new mattress I've ever experienced. It's super comfortable and more affordable than similar mattresses.
 I'd heard about Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses from what I thought was a trusted source. My past two mattresses were Stearns and Foster and were very good mattresses, however they are getting very expensive so I decided to try T&amp;N. I need a firm mattress and reviewers said T&amp;N was firm, and a lot of folks were happy with it. The package arrived on time and was easy to open, and set up was simple. Once the plastic was opened, the mattress came to life. I like that it isn't very heavy so one person can move it and there wasn't an odor. My sheets fit, but once the bed was put together it didn't look very plush, primarily because the thickness of the mattress is only 10". I've been trying to adjust to the mattress for the last two weeks, but my back hurts every morning upon arising, and I wake multiple times in the night trying to get comfortable. While I need firm, this mattress is almost too firm. I have ordered a memory foam topper to see if it will make a difference. I hope this isn't going to be of those times where "you get what you pay for". It seems T&amp;N has awesome customer service, but I've not contacted them yet, waiting to see if the memory foam topper helps. I will provide updated information before my one month trial period is up.<br/><br/>It's June 3 and I've been using the memory foam topper on top of the Tuft and Needle mattress. While it is more comfortable with the topper, it still doesn't provide the comfort I'd like. Not sure what I need, but this isn't it.  Be very sure you can handle a "firm" mattress because the Tuft and Needle is that.
 So far so good. Seems to be holding up!
 Love, love, love this bed!!!
 The mattress is too firm
 Best mattress we've ever had!
 Excellent product , 2 months after getting it and I love every single night on it. Not too hard, not too soft. Odor last only a few days
 We've only had are mattress for a week. And so far we love it.
 What an awesome bed. Not to mention the price. Great bed, great price, overall extremely pleased.
 Love it but a bit on the stiff side but no more back ache
 I bought this mattress for my guest room.  It is so great that I'm switching my $3000+ mattress from my master bedroom and keeping the Tuft &amp; Needle to myself.
 Amazing!!!
 The most comfortable bed I've ever owned.  I would live on it if I could.  Also the easiest way to get a mattress ever!!!!!
 Better than any mattress I slept on while at college
 The comfort of this mattress is wonderful.  If that was the only criteria for review I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately I ordered 2 twin XL mattresses for my cal king adjustable bed and the mattress is not an XL.  Item description says it is 80inches in length.  I measured it and it measures 75 inches.  It is several inches short on my bed frame leaving a gap from the wall to the top of matress.  I'm a tall person and this just doesn't work.  Amazon customer service was helpful and after ensuring I did not get twins on accident refunded my money.  I'm very disappointed though because I really liked the mattress.  I hope tuft and needle fixes this sizing issue with the bed.
 I've been sleeping on this mattress for 1 month now and I have noticed that a lot of my back pain has gone away.  I still wake up with some back pain in the morning though.  This is a good mattress, but as a side and stomach sleeper, I feel it is a little stiff to give me the right support.  I will be purchasing a memory gel topper and fiber fill mattress topper combo set to give me a little more support and cushion.  I got the same thing for my last mattress before it completely fell in and became useless and it was phenomenal.  I'll update in a another month to let everyone know how it is after.
 Unbelievable! I have recommended this mattress to friends and family. Best mattress I have slept on!!
 I'm debating returning this bed.  It's pretty firm, and seems comfy when I'm sleeping on my stomach but i sleep on my side too.  Its way to firm for when i switch to sleeping on my side.  The shoulder i sleep on gets very sore, to the point it hurts to raise my arm.  Not what i expected when i spent this much on a bed that claims to stand up to the larger names in their industry.
 If 5 is medium then this mattress is a 4.5.  The Tuft and Needle mattress is quite a bit softer than my previous mattress from Sleep Innovations which I also bought on Amazon.<br/><br/>This mattress eliminated the soreness in my back and hips that I had with my SleepNumber bed and previous memory foam and inner spring mattresses.  After owning the mattress for a year, I found that when I added a 2 inch latex topper I slept even more comfortably.<br/><br/>I watched a couple of reviews of the Tuft and Needle mattress on youtube and both reviews ranked the Tuft and Needle at 6.5 out of 10.  I would say it is a 4.5.
 It is ALL they advertised it to be!
 I've had this mattress for a few months now and I couldn't be happier! At first, I was hoping it would be a little softer and have more noticeable "sink" to it, but after a week or so my back just felt so much better! The firmness of the mattress is juuuuuust right, and I always feel relaxed on it. It doesn't get hot, but I live in a pretty mild climate where heat isn't a huge issue, even during summer. I think it's great, and the fact it's a more affordable than some of its competitors it sooooo gooooood!
 Iliked it
 We both love the bed.  Best mattress we ever bought.
 We have been using these mattresses for a few months now. The bed is comfortable. It is not the greatest quality mattress int he world and it isn't as soft as I would have liked, but it is still a good mattress. We had a really terrible 10 year old lumpy pillow top mattress before we got the Tuft &amp; Needle, so basically anything was an upgrade for us. I would think people who started with a pretty good mattress before would maybe be less likely to enjoy this mattress. It is a great product for the price though and for people like us who simply can't afford a fancy tempur-pedic $5k mattress, Tuft &amp; Needle is a great way to go!
 Best mattress I have ever owned!  Excellent price.  I find it so comfortable.  I just had surgery and I have to spend about 85 percent of the 24 hours in bed with my leg elevated.  I have not once had a backache.  Before with my old mattress, I was so uncomfortable I often slept in a different room.  I am so glad we found this mattress.  I would buy it again.
 Absolutely, the best mattress I've ever owned! Hope they bury me resting on it.
 Nice mattress. Had lower back pain after sleeping on it for a few I days but then again I had been sleeping on an air mattress for 2 yrs before. Just my back readjusting I guess.
 Softy :/
 I purchased this mattress because of the great reviews on Amazon and the 100 night trial period. Unfortunately, neither of these things held true.<br/><br/>The mattress seemed to be well crafted and made out of quality materials. This did not lead to the mattress being comfortable. It was extremely firm and did not soften at all through a month of nightly<br/>usage. I also found the mattress to retain a great deal of body heat, adding to my nightly discomfort.<br/><br/>After 30 nights, my wife and I could no longer tolerate sleeping on this mattress. I attempted to return to Tuft &amp; Needle directly, but learned that since I purchased through Amazon, I had to return to Amazon. I went to the Amazon site and then learned that their return policy was only good for 30 days. I was one day beyond their return deadline. Despite this fact, Amazon was very helpful and allowed me to return the product. Finding a way to ship back was quite difficult since the mattress expands upon opening the original packaging and there was no way to get it back in the box. I returned the item 2 weeks ago, but am still awaiting refund.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want a very firm mattress, give this one a try. Just don't purchase through Amazon in order to get the 100 night trial and avoid the return shipping problem that I encountered.
 It’s awesome. Super comfy!
 A bit firm,  but really nice. I am happy with my purchase.
 It was more than expected for a mattress in a box.  It is firm and comfortable.
 Great product just as advertised
 Really comfortable and supportive!
 Great mattress and awesome value.
 Great mattress, sleeping like a baby!
 Nice and comfortable! Only negative thing would be delayed in delivery.
 Good price, arrived fast, and easy to set up.
 I received the mattress on two days earlier than promised. That was a nice surprise. We unpacked the mattress which came in a white plastic bag vs. a box as described by others. Upon unpacking, there were two black marks on the mattress, where one was very long. I don't think the mattress was used, but I was disappaointed with the mattress not being mark/scuff free. Was not sure if the mattress had been repackaged. I was looking for a firmer mattress as my Tempur Pedic with elevated base had become to soft over the years. This was even after flipping it over. I love the memory foam type of mattress, so based on the great reviews and fantastic price point, I took a chance and ordered this one. After setting it up and sleeping on it for three nights, it was just too firm. I had to spend another $140 on a a good mattress topper because the bed was hurting my back and left hip. The mattress topper is 3" thick and makes a huge difference. I am hoping over time, the mattress will soften up a little and I can do away with the mattress topper.
 By far the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!  Well worth the price, Tuft &amp; Needle is a very good, trustworthy, and reliable company!  It comes in a box you lay the rolled up bed on your frame and cut the plastic, then it expands into a pure comfort cloud.  It's simply AMAZING!!!!  This bed was referred to me by a friend, I felt skeptical about buying a bed online before testing it out...well I'm glad I made the purchase because it is PERFECT for me, not to soft not to firm, just right!  I love this bed and its the best 8 hours of sleep I have ever got.  It is so good I'm starting to refer this bed to friends and co workers!
 My family lives this mattress. Ordered 3 so far!
 No more back and hip pains from both myself and my wife!! Money well spent!!
 Comfortable mattress
 We love this mattress!! We've had "nice" inner spring mattresses for 25 years, but this is my favorite mattress of all time. I love the fact that I sink into it. It conforms to me, then gives support. My back is grateful in the morning.  :)
 Love it! It's comfortable. Not too hard. Not too soft.
 Much firmer than expected. Return policy was a pain since you have to repackage a bed which was vacuumed sealed(will not fit in the original box again). Purchase the bed through the tuft &amp; needle website and they will pick it up "as is" making it a world easier to return. Great bed for someone looking for a firm bed.
 Love the mattress! I never want to leave my bed!
 This mattress is amazing. Definitely firm, which is what I wanted. Had it for over a month now and no sagging. High quality work, and 5 stars to Tuft and Needle for their dedication to customer satisfaction.
 very good
 i look forward to going to sleep every single night because of this bed
 sleeping like a baby!
 Great bed. Comfortable. Perfect for the size of the room. Easy to manage on my own. Thanks.
 We spent way too long trying to decide whether to buy this mattress and should've bought it sooner.  We've now had this mattress for almost a year and love it.  While it definitely took a couple months to adjust to because it is firmer than what we had we love it now and it has done my back a world of good.  It is firm but a little giving as well and does break in a little over time.  Our previous mattress was the kind which had two different sides which were supposedly customized for us.  The reality was even though the old mattress was more than twice the price of the Tuft and Needle my side was too soft  for comfort within months of our purchase and so I don't feel getting to try a mattress out in a store really helps since it steered us wrong last time.  We endured the old mattress for two and a half years and while the old one had a 10 year warranty it was useless because the dip/softness in the bed wasn't visible.  I had a lot of lower back pain previously due to athletic pursuits and it was exacerbated while I was pregnant and sleeping on the old mattress.  This mattress has helped tremendously and I rarely have pain anymore.  It is a low profile mattress which suits us and we have it on a contemporary metal frame from Room and Board.  When it arrived it did have a plastic sort of smell for a few weeks but that went away.  Very comfortable, highly recommend.
 Love the King Size bed, just wish they came with the pillows, thanks again
 So comfy and you don't sink in like you do in most memory foam-type beds.
 love, love my mattress. Bought 2. Very comfortable<br/>Thanks!
 Awesome product! Delivered as promised!
 I was really looking forward to being happy with this mattress.  I just never "warmed" to it; although I did overheat nightly using it. If you make the same mattress for all your customers, SOME of those customers are going to love it.  I  wasn't one of them....  The company did make a full refund (thanks, Amazon) so they get points for that.  The "Love it or return it" policy is a great one.  I have to say that without that policy, I would not have tried one.
 On time. A little soft.
 Amazingly comfortable! Love T&amp;N!
 Scale 1 to 10<br/><br/>$600 Queen Bed<br/><br/>Cool Temperature: 7.5 - The foam is not hot as with some other beds, ands its actually a cool mattress. BIG Deal for me.<br/>Firmness: 7 - body weight 165 lbs<br/><br/>My GF who weighs about 108 was very very pleased and she uses a high end coil mattress. She also sleeps hot so coolness of the bed was important.
 Soft yet firm!! Easy deliver! So cheap!!!!
 I've slept on this mattress for 3 nights, this is an  extremely firm mattress, like a board!  I weigh 270 lbs and I do not sink in at all! I even bought a Pinzon mattress topper but it is still uncomfortable.  I am a side sleeper and my hip joints ache on this mattress. I will give it a week and see if it "breaks in", otherwise will l have to send it back.<br/>UPDATE!  It's, May 30th and my mattress has broken in.  I LOVE IT NOW!  Very comfortable and my shoulders and hips no longer hurt when I wake up.  I can sleep 8 or more hours without waking up from pain. I definitely recommend this mattress.
 On time delivery, this is the second one I have ordered great deal for the price.<br/>If you are a small and light person you may find the support somewhat firm.
 After reading all of the reviews for the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress, I broke down and ordered 2 ( one queen size for my guest bedroom &amp; one king size for a new bed in my master bedroom).  The company has a nice, trendy logo; the matresses come in cool packaging thats easy to set up (there were even stickers with there logo in the box {think Apple}), but the bed...sleeping on the bed...nothing really cool about.  It is extremely firm.  I waited several weeks before writing this review, and during that time have had to order 2 mattress toppers and a memory foam body pillow in search for more comfort.  Spending almost an additional $300.  It is still not perfect with the topper but I just dont want to go through the hassle of returning it and purchasing another mattress.  I am hoping over time it will loose some firmness.  Before you purchase this matress on-line , I recommend that you test FIRM foam matresses at your local matress store.
 Great bed, I have been getting full REM sleep for the past week.  More review to come
 A bit firmer than expected but nice bed.
 Great mattress!  Best investment I've made in a long time!! Sleep is now perfect.
 The most comfortable mattress I've ever had. And love supporting a fellow AZ company.
 I haven't slept this good in years!!
 Love it, Fast delivery
 I wanted to wait until I slept on the mattress for a bit before writing the review. Generally, I think it's pretty good and most likely cooler than other foam mattresses, but using my duvet with it proved to be far too warm. I routinely woke up sweating so I had to change out the duvet to a thinner quilt set up which seems to be working better. Initially I attributed to sleeping with it on the floor, which I had to do for a couple weeks while the new frame came in, but even after being on the new frame it was still pretty warm.<br/><br/>During the first few days it does off-gas a little bit, but it's only a few days and after some use it dissipated. Compared to my new upholstered bed frame it's nothing....the off-gassing with that lasted for almost 2 weeks even with routinely airing the room out.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a good quality bed, maybe not the best nights sleep I've ever had but for the price the quality seems appropriate.
 Could possibly be the best purchase I've ever made. I've had it for a year now and it's just as comfortable as it was when I first got it. It's very firm which I had to get accustomed to at first. It took no time at all to set up. I also bought this with it: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-14-Inch-SmartBase-Mattress-Foundation-Platform-Bed-Frame-Box-Spring-Replacement-Quiet-Noise-Free-Maximum-Under-bed-Storage-Queen/dp/B006MIUM20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation / Platform Bed Frame / Box Spring Replacement / Quiet Noise-Free / Maximum Under-bed Storage, Queen</a><br/><br/>2-year update: still great, no complaints.
 Great mattress! So compact.
 have slept on it for 8 nights. it is so comfortable. great on by back and joints. I don't wake up as much during the night. This is a very<br/>supportive mattress, but not hard. It is soft, but you don't sink down into it. I am 69 years old and it is the best mattress I have ever had. I very highly<br/>recommend this mattress.
 Best $700 ever spent
 Very happy<br/>great service<br/>Great product
 This is the best mattress I've ever owned. It can be a bit firm if you're used to a pillow-top mattress or something along those lines. It does expand out a little bit over the first few days (even though it's advertised as one day). I purchased a Overfilled Microplush mattress pad and it's the best sleep I've ever had. Absolutely incredible. For those that are not wanting to get the softer mattress pad, the foam material doesn't run very hot, and this is coming from an Arizonan. Get ready to catch those sweet z's
 Love this mattress. Good value. I like the company too.
 I tried to like this mattress. I came really close. But I'm tiny and slim with wide hips, so I need a fairly soft bed if I want to sleep on my side. I've given it the required 2-week break-in period to soften up, and it's gotten a lot better, but it still has a decidedly firm feel to it - about like 3 inches of memory foam on nice plush carpet (instead of the "2 inches of foam on a hardwood floor" feel it had on the first night). I'll be trading it out for something a bit softer - provided I can get Amazon to do a more sane return process than UPS drop-off...
 I was very excited to sleep on my new mattress especially since it had so many excellent reviews. When it arrived it didn’t have an odor to it or have any issues with expanding to full size. There were a couple negative reviews regarding those two things. My problem with this matress is that is not as firm as described. It’s quite the opposite. So much so that after a few nights of sleeping on it I have been waking up with upper back pain while my girlfriend has been waking up to lower back pain. We just need a matress with a lot more support. If you are looking for a softer matress that you sink into then this would probably be a good fit for you. The motion isolation is not very good either. I was struggling to get comfortable throughout the night. Every time I moved my girlfriend complained that I kept waking her up. Once we find a new matress we will be returning this one.
 I bought a King size several months ago for my bedroom and really like it.  very comfortable, firmness is just right, very easy to set up, I just put it on my old box springs. Just bought this Queen size for a guest bedroom.

 best mattress I ever owned
 This mattress is super comfy and was really easy to get set up. No smell whatsoever. We had returned a previous mattress for being too soft, this one is firm but not too hard. Definitely recommend it for anyone!
 As advertised, soft, yet firm if that makes sense .Movement does not disturb partner. Less tossing and turning and no hot or cold spots.best night sleep in years.
 I love it. It's the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on
 excellent mattress!
 It's a bit hard, and I had to try several new pillows with the way my body was now aligned. The packaging was a little scuffed up, but the mattress was in great shape. Been very pleased with it so far (sleeping on it for 6 weeks now), but after reading the stellar reviews my expectations were a little higher. For the price I can't complain. I might be in the market for a mattress topper soon though.
 We bought this for our daughter and I want one for myself!
 My son loves his bed and it's VERY comfortable. Packaging is great and easy to set up.
 This is the best mattress.  It arrived in a box, tightly wound.  Once opened, the mattress grows to full size...So comfortable and a nice savings.
 OMG, what a brilliant invention!! It is almost unbelievable how comfortable and life changing this mattress is!  Set up was a breeze, and no need to wait longer than an afternoon to sleep on it.  My chronic back pain is nearly eliminated and my partner barely feels anything if I toss and turn.  Are you kidding me?  An affordable 700 bucks for a perfect king size mattress with a ten year warranty!  It also doesn't hurt that I admire the company that makes it, just google them and you'll see why!  I brag about my mattress to anyone that will listen and recommend it to others.
 This is the perfect mattress!  Arrived quickly and performed exactly as described. No odor! Does not make me sweat! Firm and resilient.
 Writing after the first night so I will update if anything changes:<br/><br/>The packaging on this mattress is fantastic.  Our king mattress fit into a fairly compact box.  I'd suggest having somebody help carry it to your room, but it is manageable with one person if you have the muscles (I ripped my pants carrying it myself).  You just lay it on your bed, (CAREFULLY) cut the plastic and the bed rolls out and grows into it's shape pretty quickly.  I rolled it out at 7PM and by 10PM it was definitely ready for us to sleep on.  One good thing to note is that there was not much "Foam odor" at all as compared to other foam mattress'.<br/><br/>On one hand, I was weary of buying a mattress that I couldn't lay on first, but then again, spending two minutes on one at a store doesn't really give you much to go on, either.  The trial from Tuft &amp; Needle made it a no brainer for us to try.  100 nights on the mattress and if you don't like it, they will work with you to donate it to a local charity and refund you the entire purchase amount (Returning through Amazon is a bit different but the trial is the same).  That type of confidence in their product and the amount of good reviews on Amazon made it a pretty easy and safe decision.  Also, the fact that they have a set price year round and don't drop the price for opportune shopping days made me believe that they are selling the mattress at a fair price year round and are more focused on the product than price point.  Plus, the mattress is developed and manufactured in the USA.<br/><br/>The mattress feels fantastic.  When I first laid down I thought it was going to be too soft but you sink down just enough and just stop.  It's hard to explain but the mattress just seems to know where you need support.  Just the right amount of softness but firm where it needs to be.  I'm not too picky about mattresses, firm or soft, but my wife does have back issues and we have been on the hunt for a mattress to alleviate her morning sore back.  We felt like we were striking out (even returned a sleep number after two months) but she said she felt great after the first night on this mattress.  Her description was the same; Right amount of softness and firmness.<br/><br/>It's only been one night but our experience with the mattress so far has been nothing short of perfect.
 Love it! firm enough
 Best bed we've had. Great for both my wife and I. Just soft enough for her and supportive for me
 I love my mattress! Sleep has never been better
 First impression, it's just a $700 mattress. Don't expect it to be great. Or at least, I'm not blown away, yet. I own Costco mattresses at this price range, and they are absolute heaven. I'll give it the week, they ask before drawing final conclusions, but, overall, it's just flimsy on the edges (just compresses and very soggy), and bouncy and unrelaxing in the middle. You don't really sink into this. It doesn't take your shape at all. You don't feel the stress instantly leaving your body, like you want from a bed. I'm already thinking about buying a proper pillow top for it so I don't feel like I'm sleeping on a bosu ball, but why bother with that when competitors have the right feel, out of the box (literally). Like I said, I'll give it a week, like they ask, but why should I have to? It should be cut and dry that it's amazing like my Costco mattresses. Ohh well. We'll see.
 to hard
 Best mattress I have ever bought
 Love this mattress! I was skeptical to order a mattress online but it is very comfortable!
 At first, I thought it was exactly what I was looking for. It felt great to lay on it and it felt quite firm. After a couple weeks sleep on it though I felt it lost its firmness over time and did not provide the support I needed. After a few weeks unfortunately I decided to return it as it was causing me to toss and turn way more than I did before, not getting a very good nights sleep and having neck and back stiffness/pain in the mornings.
 My wife and I really love this mattress. It provides great support and I think my sleep has greatly improved. I get up less times during the night than I did with my old mattress. The only negative my wife has is that if you sit on the very edge, there is very little support so you sink down. I didn't find it an issue....  It was very easy to set up if you open the plastic while the mattress is on the platform you are going to use.
 This mattress is a great sleep!
 Amazing
 Very comfortable
 Great mattress at an extremely competitive price point.
 I'm excited to see how well it holds up, but this bed is the perfect firmness for us. Thank you to Tuft N Needle for making a high quality and affordable mattress. I will never pay excess for gimmicks any more.
 Wonderfully comfortable!
 It would be a great mattress and a good value at twice the price!
 Comfy af
 Magnificent mattress.  How do they fit it in the shipping container is amazing.
 Sleep like a baby. It is a wonderful mattress. Thank you for the speedy delivery.
 Very happy with the mattress.comfortable foam,kind of firm
 Finally sleep all night
 Love this mattress.  It unrolled and turned into a queen sized mattress magically.  No off-gassing that I could detect.  After the first nights sleep, I was so pleased to wake with no back pain.  I'm sleeping through the night without waking up to aching hips or back.  Mornings are wonderful again.  The only downside is I paid sales tax,having dropped shipped to Tacoma before transport to Alaska,
 I hope the product would be more firm
 Amazing truly comfortable and not hot
 Perfect! I love it!
 Great mattress!
 Arrived perfectly packaged.  Set-up a breeze.  No noticeable smell from unpacking. Fits beautifully on our Ikea slatted platform bed frame.  Incredibly comfortable. No complaints!
 Bought another one - both for family members who love them. In time will get one for myself.
 Terrific mattress for an individual or couple that doesn't necessarily sleep in close proximity.  Unfortunately sleeping up against my partner on this mattress seemed to want to support us as a single person and that didn't really leave either of us in a good spinal position.  As a single person though my spouse with long term back problems noticed an immediate improvement in back pain levels moments after lying on the mattress.
 Superb mattress. Shipped in 1 day.
 Very satisfied with this mattress. I am a Physical Therapist Assistant and I recommend it to my patients, family and friends.  I cannot recall when I have slept so good and awaken feeling rested and virtually pain free.  I am in my late 50s and have experienced bilateral shoulder pain on and off.  I am predominately a side sleeper and with my prior mattress (which was only 1 1/2 years old, more than twice the price of this one and by a popular mattress company) I would wake during the night with aching and pain.  I am a fairly new owner (approx 3months) but it is already worth the price to me for the awesome sleep!
 I no longer suffer any back pain.
 Better than my old mattress
 easy setup..very comfortable
 Love it
 Am very pleased with the mattress even though it was firmer than expected.  I do wake up with no backache.  The big problem was in the mattress delivery--UPS lost it at my local distribution center.  I had to wait the full 8 days before I was able to call Amazon then the first person I talked to blew me off.  Called back 2 hours later and was connected with a different person who after much whinning and complaining promised to have a new mattress "over nighted" to me via Fedex.  That did arrive promptly and I have been able to enjoy sleeping ever since.
 Super comfortable.  Great deal.
 Love this mattress! I sleep warm, so I was happy to find that I haven't overheated in the bed, and it's also super comfy! I haven't been able to buy any furniture for it yet, so it's just laying on the floor, but I've really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The box it came in was absolutely destroyed though. Thankfully that didn't harm the product in any way though. I was horribly disappointed in the condition the box came in though. So, good on Tuft and Needle, but Amazon or the UPS people dropped the ball.
 This mattress was a bit too firm. I contacted Tuft &amp; Needle and asked to purchase a plush mattress topper from them. They offered to give me the mattress topper for free! I was amazed by this! The T&amp;N people kept in contact with me, and were totally committed to ensure that I would be happy with my mattress. Personal service of such high standard is virtually unheard of nowadays.<br/>My plush mattress topper arrived in almost no time, and now my mattress is perfect for me!<br/>Rest Assured - Literally!<br/>Thank you Tuft &amp; Needle. Excellent product and excellent service!<br/><br/>Update on March 28, 2019<br/>Well, it's 2 years and 5 months later and this mattress is still great!<br/>A while back spilled some coffee on the mattress and just couldn't get the stain out. This morning I used undiluted 3% Hydrogen Peroxide on it and removed the coffee stain. It took some work, but now there's no sign of there ever having been a stain. The mattress looks brand new! No matter what they are, it's seldom that products can look brand new after almost 2 1/2 years.<br/>T&amp;N thanks for a great product. You rock!
 I have not ever been truly comfortable in any of the beds I have had in the past.  It was always a compromise. This was the best bedding decision I have ever made. Love, love, LOVE!!!  I HIGHLY recommend!!!<br/>I purchased the Classic Brands Adjustable Comfort Base with the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress and it is the best bed/ sleep my husband and I have ever experience!!!!  Perfect for TV, reading, or special cuddle. :-D<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>It has been about six months since our purchase and I must say this is the best purchase I have ever made!
 Amazing mattress. Soft and comfortable. Worth the money.
 So it has been as advertised.
 First review here from hundreds of Prime purchases and let me tell you, its the best damn purchase yet. I travel quite a bit and I catch myself craving my bed at home. I have never had such an awesome mattress before. I was hesitant at first because you don't get to try it, and was considering the cheaper alternatives on Amazon, but I am extremely happy i went with this one. My buddy opted for the cheaper brentwood home foam mattress, but when he laid down on ours, within a few minutes he wanted ours over his. It took wifey some getting used to, but now shes all about it as well. Awesome freaking buy.
 As far as mattresses go it was ok.  I'm sure if I didn't mind the feeling of having someone pushing up on my hips all night I would have loved it.  But as it is I felt as though I was in traction all night.  And my significant other didn't sleep at all.  I like the direct from the factory idea, just make a better product.
 so far so good only had it less than a month
 would by another one.
 Pretty comfy, pretty firm, gonna be a huge bitch to move by myself.
 great inexpensive choice for a guest/spare bedroom.  very comfy.
 Very comfortable. Exactly as firm as I hoped. Delivered quickly.
 Bought them for the kids. They love them!!
 It's true...best sleep I have ever had. Took a few days for the odor to disappear.
 Great product, fair price, fast shipping, and no hassles with a mattress salesman!
 Ease, firm comfort, fair price = I'm a new fan!
 Best mattress ever
 I've had this mattress now for about 3 months. I love it! I am a side sleeper, and my back feels completely aligned when sleeping.<br/>My last mattress was turning 10 this year and I would commonly feel lower back pain when I sleep on my side.<br/>Like over reviewers, it did take me some time to get used to the firmness, however that only took a couple weeks. It's super convenient to have a mattress delivered straight to your door!
 My experience with this product and company has been first rate.  I have already mentioned Tuft &amp; Needle to friends as a result and will also include my comments here.  You can really tell the character of a company by their service and this typically is also an indicator of overall quality, including the product.  Mattresses are largely personal preference, but based on my limited experience thus far, I am very pleased and will buy additional mattresses by T&amp;N in the future. They offer a 30 day return, which speaks volumes about their confidence in their product.  At this price point, T &amp; N knocked the ball out of the park!
 Too soft, I did not expect this.
 If I could give this bed a 6/5 stars, I would.  Absolutely the best 600 bucks I could've spent.  The first night on this mattress, I was actually cold in comparison to my old one.  It breathes VERY WELL. I decided against a mattress cover because the reviews I've found are either 'Not waterproof', 'Not breatheable', 'Not quiet'; so this is a review based on just the mattress with no other variables. It's been a couple months and I can honestly say I still sigh in relaxation when a crawl into bed at night.  My mom spent the night on it once and is looking at ordering one for herself.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
 DOES NOT WORK WITH ADJUSTABLE FRAME (twin xl) Pics to prove it. Amazon needs to have a product feature of mattresses be: ADJUSTABLE COMPATIBLE, followed by a Yes or a No. Well, anyways, I’m apparently going to do the job for them and inform, you, the customer. Thanks amazon for the refund (this time.)
 Cost Effective, Easy, and Very Comfortable
 Packaging and design make moving easy. It's very comfortable.
 First three nights on the mattress I slept so well.
 This mattress is exactly what I was looking for after an old beat up spring mattress/box-spring. Foam is very dense and I've had it for over its 30-day warranty...still great.
 Great support, and a wonderful night's sleep
 i love it! Great mattress!
 Love their mattresses.  It comes in a box all vacuumed sealed.  The first 3 inches of foam is soft, like a pillow top.  the remaining 7 inches are firm.  It works great on my bad back!  It doesn't have any weird funky smells.  The mattress exterior covering seems really high quality and luxurious!  Unfortunately Amazon only offers 30 day return, but if you get it from their website directly they offer 90 day trial.
 Perfect balance of soft and firm. Never again will I buy a mattress from a bedding store when this can be had for such an amazing price. Me and the lady have been using this since August of 2016. Has not changed in firmness or quality. Edge support is not the best, but that is to be expected from a foam mattress. If you're suffering from stiffness or back pain, this may be your cure. It helped me when my previous mattress (standard pillow top) died essentially overnight. Cannot beat free Prime Shipping. We have the queen mattress. Size is exactly what you'd expect.
 Purchased for teenage daughter's new bed.  Arrived in a large box which is somewhat awkward and definitely heavy.  But beside that was easy to open and instructions were super easy (recommend as they say putting rolled mattress on bed and removing plastic wrapping).  Bed expanded immediately and was ready to be made.  Although not as firm as I prefer (I like a very firm mattress) it is extremely comfortable and our daughter is very pleased with it.  This mattress was rated highly in Consumer Reports and as a good buy.  I would definitely purchase it again considering all things were the same...such as person sleeping on it, size, rating, and type.
 Simply saying, you'll get the sleep that you dream for.
 Very comfortable - very pleased with purchase!
 I patiently waited for the mattress to arrive, only to discover rips, large dirt marks, and patches covering the mattress. As advertised, I expected a branded Tuft &amp; Needle box to arrive rather than a large dirty plastic bag. Disappointed in the shape the mattress arrived in, especially since there was not a notice of the damage from the carrier.
 Exceeds my expectations in every way.
 Great mattress, fair price, and wonderful company to work with.  Keep at it guys!
 5 star in every way. Will never go back to a standard mattress
 Great mattress and very comfortable!
 Best mattress I've ever slept on.  My wife and I wake up rested, instead of moaning and groaning about our backs.  Probably the best investment I've ever made.
 Most comfortable bed ever.
 Very confortable, soft and stable and easy to unpack. It's amazing! It makes me not to get up!
 Best night sleep I've had in years. Very impressed.<br/>Only modified by placing a 2" latex mattress pad on top
 This mattress is high quality at a reasonable price, all while being made in America. Can't ask for much more.<br/><br/>It's firm, perfect for sleeping on your back. I'm still adjusting to side sleeping, but it has gotten better after the 7 day break in period. I have broad shoulders, so they tend to get in the way when on my side.<br/><br/>Previously I got rid of a 12 year old spring mattress, was sleeping on a futon for a while, &amp; occasionally the floor... so this is a huge improvement. It's worth it. Don't skimp on a real mattress.
 I started using this bed in the last few days of November and it is now beginning of May and I am disappointed. The side of the bed I sleep on (I don't move much when I sleep) is already noticeably indented. There is a clear difference between the side I sleep on and the side I don't sleep on. I'm going to have to turn my mattress and eventually flip it to last me the year. I thought this bed was going to be different from my other but it's the same. I will not be purchasing this bed or brand again. The customer service number on a card they send you is not in the United States so I can't even call them. I get a message that says the number is restricted.<br/><br/>Edit: it moved down to 1 star. Awful. Do not buy this bed! It is truly awful.
 Problem-free ordering and delivery! Mattress dimensions are an inch or two smaller than our Twin XL foundation, but not enough to worry about.
 Feels great!  No more lower back pain.  It comes with the same warranty as mattresses that cost so much more.
 Great mattress I love it
 We love this mattress. This is our first foam mattress after sleeping on a traditional pillow top mattress for years. This mattress is firmer than we are used to with the pillow top mattress, but that turned out to be a benefit since it has decreased some back pain that my spouse had sleeping on our old mattress.<br/><br/>One thing we did notice was a very slight smell for the first day or so, but once it airs out it doesn't smell any longer.<br/><br/>We compared this mattress to several of the other foam mattresses available now and this one seemed to be the best price for what you got and we don't regret buying it at all. We now plan to replace our other mattresses in the house with this mattress.
 Nice even, firm, replacment mattress.  I would classify as firm.  Great support.  Edges are questionable.  But sleeping great after a week.  Noticeable evenness compared to a spring mattresss.  Don’t expect a happy reception in a nice white box like the website pictures. It came in a thick plastic clear shipping bag with contents visible.  Dirty on the outside.  Fine on the inside but you are unsure on how deep to cut to open.  Really our only complaint.  No smell.  Was looking at the Nectar but found out it was made in China. This is US made.
 Amazing bed.  Even easy to set up in a matter of seconds.  Have had the best sleep in a while and this mattress has helped with back and shoulder pain as well.
 Simple. BEST MATTRESS EVER.<br/><br/>No off-gassing, super comfortable, and easy to install.
 Best I've ever owned.  Give it a week or two and you'll be amazed.  So happy I took the risk of buying a product I was not quite sure about since it was online only.  Awesome!
 This is a very comfortable mattress. It provides just the right amount of support while being soft at the same time. No need for a memory foam pad with this mattress. Very satisfied customer!<br/>Update: I have now had the mattress for a year and three months. It is still perfect. No loss of support and the cover is very durable. Absolutely the best sleep as the mattress supports your body throughout the night. It is not so soft that you sink down into the mattress, but provides the perfect amount of support. Highly recommended!
 I recently had to sell everything I own to move across the country.  We were previously sleeping on a mattress that cost around $1,800 on a Memorial Day sale.  It was great!  We like a firm support mattress, and I have issues with my back and neck.  Now that I am on a budget, I did my research and found Tuft &amp; Needle with all of the positive reviews.  I decided to give this a try.  The mattress arrived on-time and undamaged.  I knew it would arrive in a box.  We carefully opened the box and rolled out the mattress.  At first, the mattress looked like a twin size (ordered a full-size).  I was worried.  There were no markings on the box or inside that indicate the size.  I decided to just take the mattress out of the plastic.  As soon as I cut the plastic, the mattress became wider.  I knew it would get taller once we opened it, but I didn't know it would get wider.<br/>After 3 nights, I can honestly say that this mattress is amazing!!!!  I don't think I have ever slept so well (and I thought I got great rest with my old mattress)!!  We sleep like the dead, we wake up without any pain.  LOVE THIS MATTRESS so far!!  Will try to post a follow-up in another month or two.
 This is the best mattress I've ever owned. It replaced my ten year old mattress and I wish I had done it sooner. It had the slightest odor the first night but nothing after that. I noticed it was a little warmer than the old mattress but not enough to make me uncomfortable.
 A supportive mattress that is well made and meant to last.
 Fantastic!
 Very comfortable bed. Easy set up and perfect amount of firmness.
 My husband is so particular about mattresses that I all but gave up on my own comfort as long as he is comfortable.  But the industry doesn't make it any easier by acting like new car dealers.  Tuft and Needle  created a product that is so unbelievably comfortable that Disney should somehow create a feature film about the Tuft and Needle California King mattress!  Tuft and Needle Levels the playing field by keeping the cost low so that working people who don't make a lot of money can still sleep like a king!  Congratulations &amp; God bless Tuft &amp; Needle! Husband still sleeping!  Thank you for waking me from the nightmare of mattress shopping.  Going back to bed.<br/><br/> cuts the
 This product is AS ADVERTISED.....and we BOTH LOVE IT!.......it ALLOWS TO YOU TO SLEEP COOL THRU THE NIGHT......but I would get a SLATTED BED FRAME TO COMPLEMENT IT.........we also tried the $100 TUFT &amp; NEEDLE PILLOWS and to our surprise they were worth the price heavy and soft and supportive.........hopefully one day AMAZON WILL CARRY THE T&amp;N PILLOWS............It is also soft on the top (I rate it a 6.5 or 7  with 1 being firm and 10 being comfort.........which was a pleasant surprise..........for $600 bucks YOU CANT GO WRONG..............I ordered a Tempur Pedic and then read all the details on Tuft &amp; Needle website and we SAVED ABOUT $3500.........you will like it!
 Best value I have found sleep very well so far I have in a semi truck .
 This is a great mattress at a great price. Really satisfied with it. Highly recommend.
 Very good
 Comfort
 Regardless of the price this is a great mattress. Lower back pain is erased every morning. Very elastic and supportive while remaining soft and comfortable. Will purchase again when time comes to replace other mattresses throughout the house.
 Very comfy!!
 Comfortable so far
 Great
 The price is right, it was delivered quickly, right to my door, it was fun to unpack, and I love having a foam mattress instead of my old, springy one.<br/><br/>I went with Tuft &amp; Needle strictly because most of the reviews and comparisons I found said that it was a little less firm than the competitors. I have nothing to compare it to myself, but I wish mine were softer. It feels nice when I lay down, but I wake up stiff.
 I love this mattress! Its super firm, so you don't just get swallowed by your mattress. I can sleep well again, finally!
 Easy to unpack and seems to be a great mattress so far only had it a week.
 This mattress is extremely comfortable. It's much better than the more expensive mattresses that I have previously tried.
 I did my research before purchasing this mattress and so far am not disappointed. I need a supportive mattress due to a spinal injury and RA; this is firm but not hard. I am so pleased! My back feels well supported. I usually sleep with multiple pillows under my neck, arms and under my knees; I was able to sleep without so many pillows for the first time in years!<br/>I also like the corporate culture of Tuft and Needle, how often do you receive a personal email after you've made a purchase? The guarantee is impressive. I doubt I'll need to use it though.
 This is an amazing mattress and I am sleeping better than I have in a loooong time.
 great alternative to the expensive--even when "on sale"--store mattresses. Odor (off-gassing) was a concern given it is foam, but this has not been the case. No odor at all. You may want to get a mattress topper if you like it soft, but even then you'll be dollars ahead over the mattress stores. The only thing is that you'll need to dispose of your old mattress, as there is no haul-away service. Not a big problem if it's in good clean condition; Salvation Army accepted mine.
 I was sceptical on buying a mattress on amazon without getting to try it first. I read probably 200 reviews, just about all were 5 star reviews. I decided to take a big chance.<br/>After having it for 2 weeks I'm happy to report I'm getting the best, most restful sleep I've ever had. It's a firm mattress but not like sleeping on a board. I didn't want a mattress that I'd sink 4 inches into. I weigh approximately 175 lbs and sink about a half inch. It's like sleeping on a cloud. Awesome purchase!!
 Best purchase! Great value for a king size mattress and fantastic quality. Perfect amount of softness &amp; firmness.
 Relieves pressure points that keep me up half the night. Sleeping so much better. Wish edges were a little stiffer when you sit on bed.
 i set it on bed.  Actually waited three days to sleep on it.  on side is very soft on edge to sit on and has a permanent indent from where i usually lay.  turned it 180.  this other side, the edge is more firm and have not had and indent.  I read a couple of other reviews saying same thing happened to them.  Which I had bought another mattress
 Awesome bed
 This is my second T&amp;F mattress and combined I have about 3 years experience with them.  By "second" I mean that I sleep on one, and have another on the guest bed.  When it was time to replace the guest mattress I decided to move the first T&amp;F mattress into that room and experiment with some of the other bed-in-a-box mattresses out there.  In short order I tried a couple of other well-advertised/popular brands and ended up returning them.  Then I ordered the 2nd T&amp;F mattress and went back to sleeping much better.  Certainly an example of, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
 BUY. THIS. MATTRESS!
 Very easy to setup and very comfortable
 This is my second tuft and needle mattress and we are still very thrilled with the overall fit, finish and comfort.<br/><br/>We bought the first mattress from tuft and needle directly and got the second from amazon to take advantage of my credit card rewards and 2 day shipping.<br/><br/>Mattress arrived very quickly. Opened it up and let it expand which it did in just a few minutes. There was no smell at all which is always a plus.
 We love our new mattress! Comfortable and supportive.
 Can't say enough how much I love this bed!
 Best sleep ever! Thanks!
 Much harder then I expected, but after sleeping on it I'm sold! I don't wake up with a sore back if I sleep in all day and I'm quick to pass out once I lay down. The bed can be a bit stiff if you keep your place very cold though but it isn't an issue!
 Excellent work guys! My biggest fear of these types of mattresses is the fact that they make you feel like you are suffocating and hot with no air circulation around your body. This one is perfect ! I live in a small apartment in an attic space and couldn't get a regular bed up here! This was perfect to install and perfect to sleep on . I'm 52 old and have a bulging disk, in the past few years have found it hard to find something i can sleep on without pain. Thanks again guys and thank you to your wife for having a problem only you could solve :-)<br/>I had a small adjustment period for a couple of nights as predictided but WELL WORT IT !
 Words cannot describe and explain how amazing this mattress is! Ordered a king size mattress directly from Tuft &amp; Needle after having spent a lot of time reading reviews here.<br/><br/>This mattress changed my life from the very first night. I fell asleep instantly (which I never do) and slept for 10 hours (which I never do) and woke WITH NO PAIN (which I NEVER do)! It took my husband a few days to adjust, but he can now sleep on his back (which he couldn't do before on our old mattress) and he also wakes up with NO pain now. It has changed our lives.<br/><br/>I would suggest going to mattress stores and trying foam mattresses vs spring. If you like foam better then go to Tuft &amp; Needle and give them a try. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain.<br/><br/>I received an email from one of the cofounders after I ordered the mattress, thanking me for my trust and assuring me that if there were any issues they will promptly return my money. There has since been several long, kind, personal, friendly, open and genuine emails from them. They truly care about your quality of sleep... I immediately emailed them after my first night on the mattress, letting them know I'm in love and that I can't feel my husband moving on the bed AT ALL and how that alone is "Hogwarts-like magic". I received a thank you email from them AND a thank you card, a copy of which I will try to attach here. Let me stress that the company's customer service is unlike anything I have ever experienced. You won't regret dealing with them and giving them a try! They answer all your questions quickly and happily. Every aspect of everything I've experienced with this company has been simply amazing.
 This is a great mattress. Because I was able to, I did go to LA and try a Casper in the Hollywood showroom. Here is my comparison.<br/><br/>Casper-<br/>I thought the mattress cover seemed cheap. I don't like the seam along the top edge.<br/>While the Casper is cushy, it does not support well. Two adults will sink in the middle, it is soft all the way through.<br/><br/>Tuft and Needle-<br/>I like the Tuft because it is soft on the top and firm support. I don't like the feeling of being buoyant on top of it so I got a mattress cover, I would use one anyway as a protector. The Tuft is nice because it is solid, it feels like a nice high end mattress, but I suggest to buyers to treat it as a foundation and then customize the topper to your taste. You will be very happy with it. I really like the cover that it comes with, it is very elegant and soft to the touch. I also love the square corners, so my bed actually looks bigger, it actually adds a little real estate to your bed.
 I can't say enough good things about this mattress! I have been searching and searching for new mattress. The first one I bought was very comfy, but it slept too hot for me. After reading the reviews and researching every possible brand out there, I decided to give Tuft &amp; Needle a shot. It has been a dream (no pun intended) come true. While some say it's too firm, I think it's perfect, but I prefer a firmer mattress. Best of all, it keeps you at the perfect temperature all night. Well made with great customer service, Tuft &amp; Needle is fantastic company. I couldn't be happier!<br/><br/>I have to give Amazon props, too. Even though I placed my original order for a Queen, I got a King. Amazon fixed the issue immediately and my Queen sized mattress was here two days later. Thanks Amazon!
 great bed!
 We are really enjoying this mattress. It has changed the way we sleep.
 Feels like a hotel bed. Felt great sleeping on it for the first night! You can't beat the cost.
 I'd recommend this mattress to anyone.
 I worry that if I don't like it Amazon will send me an address label and say to repackage it, ~think I'm stuck with it.<br/><br/>My queen was heavy!, un bagged on the box spring. I have noticed lying on my front to read it's much better on my back. I may be defective cause I think it is to good for me, I think I am sleeping better just not sure. It's like all the things that foam beds have. I just feel stuck on the Matto that I can't ever have any thing nice, so not sure.
 The mattress was very firm. Not much give to it at all. I give the mattress comfort a 1 star, but since my wife liked the mattress I boosted it to a 3 star. When I laid on it, the firmness of the mattress created pain in my shoulder, neck, hips and back. We tried it for close to the 30 day trial period and after waking up every morning in pain, we had to return it. We had gift cards to use up so we purchased through Amazon. I would recommend buying direct from Tuft and Needle, because you can just donate the mattress and not worry about returning it and you get 100 day sleep trial. The return with the mattress through Amazon was a little more complicated. I called Amazon and was told all I had to do was have the mattress ready for UPS to pick up and that I didn't need to box it or wrap it or anything. When UPS arrived, they told me that it would have to be boxed. I called the UPS dispatch office and they agreed that if I could wrap it in plastic than they could take it. They said that this happens all the time, as Amazon seems to tell people they don't need to box or wrap the product. After running to home depot and then fighting with the King Size mattress to get it wrapped up, UPS returned and picked it up. We searched for another mattress and tried out the Leesa mattress. It's slightly softer, which works great for me and just firm enough for my wife. She actually likes the Leesa mattress a lot better. If you're looking for a new mattress, I would highly suggest the Leesa foam mattress. My pain is gone and I sleep great.
 Ultimately too hot and too firm. Looks like the return process is going to be a bigger hassle, and I’m going to wish I’d bought from the manufacturer instead of from Amazon. The CS rep I talked to wanted me to try to mail it back to Amazon, and it took quite a while for me to get her to understand why that wouldn’t work.
 Can't say about length of service after only two months use. Great for comfort and great for price.
 Fabulous mattress
 Awesome!
 Bought for our son - he loves it and sleeps much better
 I've officially given this mattress 6 months to win me over, and I have to say that I feel duped by all of the glowing reviews I've read.<br/>I first entertained the idea of ordering this mattress because after buying the highest rated mattress from a leading consumer-driven magazine, and hating it because it was too firm, I was left with mere days to find a replacement, or face sleeping on the sofa indefinitely. So, because I'm pretty Amazon loyal, and after reading many reviews, and seeing that I could have the mattress delivered within 48 hours, I pulled the trigger and bought it. The first few night were unbearable -- firm, strong chemical odor, and overall much worse than the previous mattress I had just sent back. So, I invested a few hundred more dollars on a mattress topper, which had made absolutely no difference. After a few months, it started to sink in the places where we sleep, leaving sad people-shaped spots, so we flipped it over. I resent that I had to flip over a mattress that I've only owned a few months. (I should also note that flipping the mattress over has not made it any more comfortable.)<br/>Overall, I'm underwhelmed by the quality of this mattress.
 We love it! It's cost effective and super comfy!
 Researched a lot as not easy to choose online.  I guessed Right.  Consumer Magazine rated high. Got a new  slat board base as many Mfgs suggest it.  Slats 3" apart.  Setup was easy and fast.  Mattress firm, but feels like top inch or two is soft for comfort.  In any case, PERFECT, for my taste.  Long problem with leg cramps gone in 1st night.  My frequent stiff neck gone by 2nd night.  Could not be happier with this mattress.... hope it remains exactly as it is.
 The wifey and I love it. We've had a few memory foam mattresses (few moves), but this one is top notch. You will not regret this purchase.
 love the mattress
 This is one of the best mattresses I've ever slept on. It's just the right level of softness and has nice firm support. It's also sleeps very cool to, and I'm the type of person who gets hot easily. Also I'm a bigger guy and I don't sink very far into the mattress, which is nice. The only cons about this mattress are edge support(if you lay or sit to close to the edge you may fall on the floor). The other con is off gassing, prepare for a chemical smell for the first four to six hours after you open it. It's not that bad just be aware that these type of mattresses offgass, don't worry the fumes aren't harmful because the bed is made with non harmful materials.<br/><br/>Price is also right on this one. 500 for a full size mattress is nice! Most of the other online companies wanted 800, or didn't even make a full size. (Purple).<br/><br/>So if you want an inexpensive, cool sleeping mattress with firm support buy this tuft and needle!
 *Update 6 months in**I am STILL so impressed with this mattress! I was worried about the quality because the price was amazing compared to other mattresses on the market but my husband and I both love this mattress. We have had the mattress for about 2 weeks and both of us have gotten the best nights sleep.<br/>This mattress is so soft and firm at the same time. It supports my back and I no longer wake up with neck aches. I could not recommend this mattress more.
 Incredibly comfortable
 This is a comfortable bed at a hell of a price.
 he would have never left Spain in search of the fabled 'Fountain of Youth'.<br/>This mattress is wonderful. Immediate results the first night.<br/>All the early morning shoulder, hip, and back aches that plagued me have now vanished.<br/>Just like that. No more morning pain to start the day due to an uncomfortable mattress.<br/>The secret formula: This mattress is comprised of the restorative waters found only in the 'Fountain of Youth'.<br/>Believe it!
 Mattress is cost effective and very comfortable
 Sleeping better then ever!
 EXCELLENT mattress . . . . . hubby and i love them (as do our dog and cat).
 I have now been with this mattress for a year.  I initially had to get used to the feel, but that didn't take long.  It has been one of the smartest amazon purchases I have made and I always tell my friends about it  very comfortable and the packaging was easy to navigate and set up was kinda fun!
 Sleeping so well now amazing, never going back!
 I was torn between giving this mattress a 2 star and a 3. I settled on a 2 star because my back has simply hurt every morning since we put this mattress on our bed. I was really hoping for a mattress that was so comfortable you felt instantly relaxed, can’t say that is the case. The mattress is comfortable enough to do the job but I already notice that my wife and I seem to be sinking into the middle and the mattress is only 60 days old (we are pretty light people too 165 and 95 Lbs). I will give the company a 5 star though, had a problem with the wrong size getting ordered and TN corrected and got me a new mattress ASAP with virtually no hassle. Highly unlikely we will buy another TN when we upgrade to a King bed.
 Great mattress!!!! Have been sleeping so great......
 Couldn't believe when it showed up in the box. We opened and put on our existing box springs. Love it!
 I'm still on the fence.<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying that my wife absolutely loves this mattress to the point where she jokes about not wanting to get up for work or up from a nap. We previously had a pillow top mattress which was much softer on top, however after a few weeks my wife had gotten used to the new mattress and now loves it. A+ there! That pillow top mattress had given me back pain from sagging.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I still think it may be too firm. Based on other reviews, I initially thought that it would take some breaking-in, which I've given some time now (about 60 days). I'm guessing from the research that I've done is that I simply don't weigh enough (5'9'', ~130lbs) to put enough pressure on the foam, but I'll admit, I'm not a mattress scientist. For what it's worth, my wife is 5'2'', ~140lbs. I don't know whether I just need to give it more time or whether I need to seek out a softer mattress. I don't have any concerns with the durability of the foam, so I'm guessing it will stay this firmness for quite some time.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>Everything you've probably seen already - the packaging, shipping time, lack of a weird smell, bounciness, decently firm edges, durability, and price.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>May be too firm for light weight/skinny individuals. I still have some back pain from sleeping on this mattress, albeit much less than when I had a pillow top mattress that sagged.
 Good quality...no complaints from the wife.
 Deeply, passionately in love with this bed.
 I will definitely buy again.
 Amazing bed!!  I have lumbar issues and have yet to find something I can sleep on all through the night. This bed supports my back fully. I have had it for about 10 days now. I do settle into the bed, but I would not call it sinking into it like a generic memory foam bed. My wife and I have our twin beds side by side as we could never find mattresses we both liked. She slept on my T&amp;N bed for 2 nights and liked it so much, our second one is being delivered today.<br/><br/>I hope it continues to deliver the same level of comfort for years to come.
 Love It!!
 I really wanted to love this mattress, &amp; I do love the company. Customer service through both Tuft and Needle and Amazon has been excellent. But, we ended up donating this mattress and going with another one. This mattress felt too firm, &amp; we just couldn't get used to it. It was uncomfortable to sleep on (we were waking up feeling like we hadn't slept well, &amp; with aches and pains). It is also hot to sleep on, which is also very uncomfortable.  Mattresses are a very personal item, &amp; I know this works great for a lot of people. It just didn't work well for us.
 Very pleased with this mattress. It was comfortable the first night. I woke up for the first time in years without feeling like I had been in a boxing match with my mattress. The chemical smell is still slightly present after 4 days but it is not so powerful that it is bothersome. Online reviews pick a more expensive box mattress because the cover is more appealing. I don't happen to care that the cover is plain. I have a mattress cover on it. I recommend trying this mattress first.
 I sleep very well on this mattress,great value!
 Very comfortable to sleep on. Slept like a baby.
 Very comfortable. I would say it is softer than I expected but still, good purchase.
 I bought this last July because I was having hip pain (come to find out it is bursitis).  I find it way too firm.  I tried 3 mattress pads stacked on top of each other, no change.  I bought a high loft mattress pad...still too firm.  Unfortunately Amazon only gives 30 days to return whereas Tuft and Needle gives 100 days.  Had I had 100 days, I probably would have returned it.
 I was very nervous to buy a mattress for the first time. Great price for a great product. Firm-ish and very, very comfortable.
 I do like this mattress. Like the idea of being delivered in a box (other co.'s copying that) though it's slightly approx. 1 1/2" wider &amp; longer than my box spring. Also, like other mattresses there is no way to lift it to move if you are 5'2". Sewn in handles will help. Too many mattress companies to confuse the buyer. Seeing good reviews, also by word of mouth, make it easier to choose. Quit paying so much - it's not like the Princess and the Pea.
 okay, this has got to be the BEST mattress I've ever slept on.
 Great mattress
 Love it
 My husband and I find the mattress most comfortable website sleeping better now...
 We have had our new queen size mattress now for about 3 weeks. I think it's the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. However. Do be prepared for the first one or two nights after you open the box and set it up. There is a somewhat chemical odor as it offgasses. And the company does not warn you enough in the product description or the paperwork that comes with it. But once that passes, it is great to sleep on. Oh so comfortable!
 After purchasing from Amazon all was good for just over a year, recently I've started waking up in the middle of the night with back pain.  Just completely out of the blue.  While I'm a large guy at 6'9", 310lbs I just read at one of the big mattress comparison sites t&amp;n want made for heavy people.  Just took a year to figure this out.<br/><br/>I've since ordered a ghostbed, same 100 night sleep, so that may prove to be the same after a year, but if not, a 20 year warranty behind it.
 It's awesome and I sleep well.
 Great Mattress.  Unfortunately Amazon sent me the wrong size the first time but finally got the right one and love it
 Great in-expensive mattress
 This is a great mattress. But it is too firm for my husband and I. But I didn't want to give up on it because I like everything else about the mattress and the company and their values, so we got a memory foam mattress topper and the combination is to die for. So our bed is perfect now.
 This bed fits mine and my wife needs perfectly even though we have different comfort levels.
 We really hated the feel of this mattress. First of all, it is NOT firm. If you look at the scale it's a 6.5 out of 10, and it definitely feels quite soft. It's VERY bouncy when you sit on it and when someone else sits or moves on the bed when you're laying on it, you will definitely feel it and move yourself. My husband moves all night long, and I was looking for a firm mattress that wouldn't transfer his movement to my side. This is definitely not that mattress. After sleeping on it for 2 weeks I'm going to have to return it. I would suggest NOT ordering a mattress from Amazon b/c they make you return the item by putting it back in the box, an almost impossible task once it's been opened and expanded to full size.
 First 3 nights and it feels like heaven.
 Great mattress if you don't mind having the side collapse when you sit on the edge of the bed. Overall, quite comfortable.
 We recently bought this mattress for use in the bottom bunk of our kids bunk bed... its quickly become the preferred hangout spot in our house to lounge.  VERY comfortable!  The mattress comes tightly compressed in a small box and you wonder "how does this become a mattress?" - but once you unpack it and remove the plastic (be careful not to cut the mattress!) - POOF - it magically expands and fits perfectly.  This will be my next mattress for sure!
 Awesome  mattress just three perfect amount  of support and firmness.<br/>Wake up every morning feeling great!<br/>Love it
 As far as packaging, shipping and overall appearance of the product, it has been great. My issue comes with comfort. After reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I had little to no expectation of a problem with the mattress. We have owned the mattress for 6 weeks now. The issue I am having is now waking up with mid-upper back pain every morning. This is a new problem that I never had in the past with other mattresses. I'm not sure the specific reason for the pain (sinking in, soft spots) as the mattress seems fine when I lay in it. It's only when I wake up that I have this awful back pain that goes away once I get up and move around for an hour. Now I am a big guy at 6', 220 lbs but not that much above average that I feel it should affect my sleeping (I had no problem on our prior mattress or our guest mattress). My fiancé is much smaller and sleeps without issue. I am writing this to hopefully find a solution to this problem without sending the mattress back. I will be trying a mattress topper to see if that helps. I am hoping that helps and prevents having to return the mattress. Any tips would be appreciated.<br/><br/>Update: Changing rating to 3 stars. I was contacted by Tuft and Needle and the customer service is amazing. They are working with me every way possible to make sure the mattress meets my needs or else they are working to help me return. Great customer service.
 I feel this is a great quality memory foam mattress. I have two home. My main home I have a $7,000 tempurpedic king size bed. I wanted something much less expensive for my 2nd home. Upon unpacking the mattress did have a smell to it but being a nice day I left my window open and the smell was gone within 8 hours. The mattress cover looks good comparable to my expensive mattress. Compared to a tempurpedic it is a bit more firm. For me that is not a good thing as I prefer a softer bed. However my husband had no problem with it at all. What is nice about it is it holds it edges like a tempurpedic. Having bought cheaper memory foam mattresses for my kids from Amazon in the past I was very aware of how some less expensive brands simply cave in on the edges or middle making you sleep at an angle. This mattress does not do that so that is a very good thing. In the end I bought a 4 inch memory foam pad to put on top just to make it softer. But if you like a mattress a tad more firm than most memory foam mattress this is the one for you.
 It took about three minutes to unwrap the rolled up mattress-- it was very compressed and filled seconds after unrolling.It is way more comfortable than my King Koil ( a manufacturer that makes beds for a number of bed brands) and almost half of the cost.Ten seconds after lying on the bed I realized how great it felt.I was sceptical about the quality/ price but it has received #1 in reviews.Got it in two days through A Prime.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this mattress/ company !
 Mattress was comfortably firm.  Topped it with a memory foam topper and it was perfect.  Can't be the direct to home shipping and value!
 Had this mattress for 6 months now love it love it I can't say anything bad about it! Perfect in between soft and firm!
 Love this mattress, the best I've ever slept on! I recommend it to everyone!!
 Fantastic love it comfortable worth the money
 Awesomeness!!!!
 Its very firm
 most comfortablte yet.  firm. love it
 My husband and I purchased this mattress approx. 2 months ago to replace our previous mattress. I didn't realize how poorly I'd been sleeping until we got this. I used to wake up several times a night, now I'm sleeping through and waking up feeling rested. We're beyond pleased with the mattress quality, we are recommending Tuft &amp; Needle to everyone we know.
 slept on for 3weeks now and never slept better in my life.
 When this mattress arrived I was impressed with the packaging and simplicity of unrolling it.  It had a slight chemical smell which dissipated after a couple of days, but never completely went away.  It was a bit firm for side sleeping.  After sleeping on it for about a week, I began not feeling well.  There were eventually allergy symptoms that finally woke me up in the middle of the night wondering if I might be allergic to this mattress.  I Googled for a while and found others who had had some or all of the same symptoms:  lips swelling, mouth sores, joint stiffness and aching, fatigue, depression......Luckily it was still within the 30 day trial period so I sent it back.  Boxing it up was difficult, I ended up buying 2 flat panel TV boxes and a BIG roll of tape. ($50.) UPS came and picked it up and I have already received my  refund. I will now stick to Latex.  This is the first experience I've had with an allergy this severe.  I really thought something was terribly wrong with my health!<br/>Luckily the symptoms are disappearing and I am feeling much more like myself again. I am a "Senior Citizen" and all of a sudden was feeling awful ! I had 3 difficult and uncomfortable weeks due to this mattress.
 This is a great product!!!!  I could not be more happy with this mattress.  Amazon was dope and like always my shipment shows up on time w/no issues.
 Love our new mattress. It's our first time with a king and we both have back (but different) problems. Very comfortable and cozy.
 I read so many reviews complaining about the stiffness. Not sure what people are thinking of. This mattress is extremely soft ! I sunk in it (180lbs guy) an developped a terrible back pain after the first night of sleep.<br/>Very disappointed, returning the mattress immediately, hopefully it's hassle free. Will get my next mattress at a regular mattress store.
 I head about Tuft &amp; Needle from a report Dad printed off from C Reports.  they where #3 on foam mattresses and less than 1/2 the price of others.  Also when I google them and others reviews bear out but not for the others. its been since the 1st week in April &amp; its great.  For me?  next day was only $65 if I wanted it
 I prefer firm mattresses, but this mattress is incredibly firm. As other reviewers have noted, I had to immediately purchase a mattress topper to make this bed remotely comfortable. (Edit) Now, almost two months in, I toss and turn all night with back pain and stiffness. I would not recommend this nor would I purchase it again. My old mattress wasn't uncomfortable, it was just old so I bought this as an "upgrade" and now I wish I would have just kept my old mattress.<br/><br/>I really, really want to love this mattress, but I don't see how this has so many positive reviews. I will be attempting to return it. DO NOT BUY unless you need an extremely firm mattress, and even then you'll need a mattress topper, which will then make it sleep very hot.
 This bed is simply amazing. It has helped with my aching back more than I thought it would. Best price I found for the most part. The Casper mattress was the other I was looking at but decided to go with the Tuft and Needle mattress instead. I'm happy with the decision and felt like I made the right one. 5 out of 5 as far as comfortably and value goes.
 Very good.
 Amazing, better then a 2.5k Tempur-pedic cloud I was sleeping on. Well worth trying the 30 days if not keeping like I am, but then again it's only been 4 days.
 Not the miracle bed I had hoped for in assisting with my back issues and personally I would like it to be a little softer while adding some support around the edges, but for the price, good luck finding anything near as good. We'll see how it holds up after a few years. It's definitely the best bed you can probably get for this price range and I appreciate the company not trying gouge customers like most mattress companies do.
 Very happy with the matress.
 Received 3 days ago and set up today.  There is a very strong chemical odor, so much so that we won't be using the mattress for at least one night.  Not too happy about that.  I wonder if this night counts for the return period?  Just kidding, I know it will.  Still, my eyes are burning a bit.  My wife's too.  The real rating is a 2.5, between I don't like it and it's ok.<br/>I'll update this when I can.
 So I’ve had this mattress for just under a year and I’ve had to turn it once, and now im going to have to flip it. It seems about every 6 months, it wears down, and there is NOTHING i can do to make it stop hurting! I think it may be because im narrow. Im 5’7, 135lbs. My husbands side doesnt have this problem, hes a big guy. I thought it might have been my pillow, but i have tried every type of pillow i could think if and none have helped. I switched what side of the bed i sleep on and instant relief. That tells me the mattress wears down VERY quickly. It might not be normal, i may have gotten a dud, who knows.
 On the fence on this one.<br/><br/>I've had this for about 2 weeks now and I gotta say, Hip pain disappeared within a few days. However, neck, shoulder and upper back pain developed.<br/><br/>Comfort and usability of the mattress greatly depends what you are going to be using it for. If you are ONLY sleeping, it should be ok.<br/>If you plan on doing ANYTHING else, eg. Eating, sitting, watching tv, reading a book, meditating, I would not recommend it. You end up sinking in and lower back pain begins quite quickly to compensate. If you are sitting on the edge (including back near headboard) you will sink below the headboard. As far as sex ... probably better to get a spring mattress, this one has waaay too much give. Remember that you'll have two people (or more) with hands, knees etc in single points sinking in to the marshmallow like mattress. If sitting crosslegged in the middle is a core workout, sex is out of the question.<br/>Sleeping, yeah, it's fine. Anything else, look for a spring mattress.<br/>I'm 5'9" 210-220
 Love it!
 We have only had the mattress for a few days and so far we are satisfied customers. By the reviews I was worried it was going to be to firm so I ordered a 2 inch topper and I haven't had any problems.
 OMG I love this mattress! I like my mattress Hard and my husband likes the pillow tops but those hurt my body versus a foam mattress, well when this arrived I thought oh oh it's spongy so it's like the pillow top, well I was wrong, my first night I wasn't in the bed 5 minutes and I was asleep. My best sleep I've had in years and my husband loves it too because you see it's designed for all types of people. Glad I made the purchase.
 I've needed to replace my Tempur-Pedic mattress for the last year or so as it had a horrendous sag and no amount of flipping or turning enabled me to sleep without the sag. I should mention that the old mattress was under warranty but because it was so hot I opted not to use the warranty.  I'm somewhat hesitant to spent upwards of a thousand dollars on a new mattress sight unseen and wasn't willing to buy the same brand again... cue many hot nights on a sagging mattress,<br/><br/>Just before Christmas I got fed up and started seriously hunting for a new mattress, This had good reviews and was affordable, so I took a deep breath and clicked purchase.<br/><br/>This was delivered a week or so ago and I love this mattress!<br/><br/>This mattress is softer (and yet has a firmer core somehow) "top" feel and is so much cooler!  It was considerably lighter than my previous mattress too!<br/><br/>I am sorry I waited so long to buy this.
 I love this mattress.
 I tried this mattress out for 10 nights before moving it to my guest room. The mattress is just too firm. Maybe a pillow top would help. I let several guests try it out. Their feedback was more positive. The biggest benefit over a traditional mattress is that motion doesn't transfer. This is a plus for not disturbing a sleeping partner. I ultimately returned mine.
 Best mattress I have every owned! I will never buy another coil spring mattress in my life.
 This bed is awesome!!!! I don't want to leave it ever
 Quick shipping, excellent product!  Very comfortable and will buy again!
 So this thing is really amazing, actually.  I finally bit the bullet and spent the dough after obsessing over the reviews and reading everything I could - I mean, who buys a mattress site unseen without trying it out first?  Yet, all the reviews were RIGHT.  I can scarcely believe the value I get from this mattress - I've felt better and more rejuvenated than with any other mattress I've bought before - and it did not have ANY chemical smell, or any problem 'inflating' after it arrived.  I mean, what more do you want?  This is a SUPERB value for the money, and it feels great to sleep on.  My partner doesn't even know when I've left the bed to go the bathroom, it's so solid.<br/><br/>Just remember - follow the dang instructions!  Let it air out for 24-48 hours (I let it sit over a weekend trip, came back and it was PERFECT).  Also, get a mattress cover for the thing...it will save you the hassle of spills and cleanup if you have pets, kids, or have sex a lot.  This mattress is GREAT!  If you are sitting there thinking 'well, maybe the negative reviewers are the real deal, and this is just a scam...' DON'T.  I debated for months with a sore back and cranky morning attitude, and within a week this mattress made me a believer.  IT'S WORTH IT!!!<br/><br/>I've had it for a few months now, I'll update this post with a photograph when I hit the 6 month mark to show you how this mattress has not lost it's shape AT ALL.
 Is the most comfortable mattress I ever slept in
 This mattress is the most comfortable ever.  Wish I had known about Tuft and Needle sooner. Highly recommended.
 Very comfortable
 Very hard mattress. Can not sleep comfortable. Not what we expected. Hopefully it will soften.
 This is the 2nd mattress I have purchased from Tuft and Needle.  18 months ago I purchased a King mattress and have Loved it!  I just bought this one for my 6'02 205lb 20 year old and he is very happy with it.  I highly recommend  this company to anyone looking for a well-made, very comfortable mattress.  Delivery was very fast and set up ridiculously easy.
 Mattress was hard as a rock.  My wife and I gave it two full weeks to try to get acclimated to it and for it to 'break in'.  After 2 weeks, we were tired of losing sleep and ultimately went back to the mattress we were trying to replace.  Also beware of return policy - You don't get the 100 day return time frame when purchased through Amazon.  Now we are stuck with this mattress we can't use or we have to figure out how to ship it back to Amazon.. :(
 very good mattress seemed firm at first but now it sleeps very good we are satisfied and would recommend it to anyone.
 Very comfortable, we bought 2 twins for our sons and ended up buying a queen for our guest room as well because they are a comfortable at a good price point. This was a good medium for us—between poison-mattress and billion-dollar-organic/green mattress.<br/>Lost a star simply because it’s on the heavy side for changing sheets. Also, tip: definitely let air out for at least 24 hours before sleeping.
 Super firm - might be better with a mattress topper or feather bed.
 Sooooo comfortable! My back pain is all but gone!
 First, I went for this mattress based off it's price-point when compared to its mix of reviews.  This seemed to be a good Goldilocks area for me however, if you're wanting to spend more the vast majority of reviews I've seen have Purple mattresses finishing first in overall comfort.  I didn't feel the need to spend 400 dollars more for a mattress but I'm usually pretty easy to please.<br/><br/> I've slept on the mattress for two nights now and have slept all the way through without waking up at all.  I didn't smell anything during the set up process but that could have been due to me not setting up the mattress until 6 days after I got it.  If there's a downside for me it's that the sides compress quite a bit when you're sitting on them.  If I don't update this post it's because I have nothing to complain about.
 perfect, getting better all the time
 Great! Not too firm, not too soft. Very happy!
 Very comfortable mattress. I sleep so well and I would definately recommend.
 This is my 4th or 5th "memory foam" mattress and the 3rd I have ordered by delivery. It came on time, was easy to unpack, had virtually no out gassing and is very very comfortable. It is a great product at a price that is hard to argue with. Time will tell if it stands up.
 Unless you enjoy sleeping on a stack of bricks or plywood, because that's about as soft as this mattress is, then you'll hate this mattress as much as we did. I got better sleep on the mattress in our camper than I did on this thing. We bought this because it had thousands of reviews and nearly a 5 star rating. However, it is the firmest mattress ever.  The off-gassing from the foam was horrific.  I had to lay a blanket down on top of the sheets to add another barrier so I couldn't smell the chemicals from the foam. Even spraying with Febreze and letting it air out did not help. It took about a week for the smell to dissipate.<br/>Thankfully there is a 30 day sleep trial with this mattress and a full money back guarantee. We called Amazon to return this mistake and was issued our full refund within a few hours.  You can't return the mattress but you will get your refund.  We were told by Amazon (via telephone and email) that you can keep the mattress, donate, or sell it. At least Amazon was very helpful and had great customer service with this purchase.
 We purchased this item over a year ago to replace an aging traditional spring mattress that was scarred by some rather unsavory stain patterns We had looked at several of the name brand "Sleep-Number" and Sweedish-galactic double-secret foam "sleep systems", but I refused to put myself in a position to decide between a Hyundai and a mattress so we went with this item. It is comfortable, supportive, and we have not found it to be hot as some foam mattresses tend to be. We installed it atop the same box springs that we have had for years. After 16 months of nightly use we have not experienced any breaking down of the material or structural integrity. Excellent item for the price.
 Super comfortable!
 I have had this mattress for approx. 6 months now.  I notice now that the mattress is uncomfortable.  My weight has not changed.  I'm looking for a new mattress.  Wish I would have noticed in the time frame allowed.  I do not recommend.
 I had no idea what T&amp;N was until we stayed at an Inn and had the BEST NIGHT SLEEP EVER! My husband and I both had to forced ourselves to get up and get moving, we were that comfy! I looked at the brand and as soon as we got home from our trip I ordered ours.  We have not been disappointed.  I have always had a hard time sleeping, my back always hurt during the night and in the morning.  Not with T&amp;N.  I sleep great and wake up pain free. I convinced my daughter and son in law to buy one for their spare bedroom, that way I know we'll sleep good when we stay with them, oh, and their other gusts like it too.
 Amazing!!! Best investment ever
 Better than expected fast delivery very happy
 Easy order/ easy set up / great night sleeps!
 This is my first Amazon review and the reason I am taking the time to do so is because this mattress is pretty phenomenal.  I was at first skeptical about purchasing a mattress sight unseen online.  Adding to my skepticism was the low price.  I decided to take a chance, thinking to myself, "its only $600, if I get a year out of it then that will be money well spent."  Well I am impressed beyond my initial low ball expectations.  This mattress is extremely comfortable, does not retain heat, and provides both support and "give" simultaneously.  In the roughly 6 weeks that I have slept on this mattress I have experienced higher quality REM sleep than I can recall in the past 15 years and I wake up feeling significantly more refreshed than with my last mattress. I am more than pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this to my friends and family.
 The mattress did not even come in a box like a lot of the less expensive units do. It was just rolled up in plastic. The Mattress is only about 8 inches thick. For this amount of money you can buy a thicker mattress. I would suggest at least 12-14 inches. This mattress sits too low in the bed frame I bought.
 The whole process was great. Fast easy delivery and set up. I've had shoulder problems for years now and have problems sleeping thru the night. Not with this mattress! I love it! If I could change 1 thing, I'd try for a bit softer, but hey, it works and I'm happy!! I did leave it uncovered for a good 24 hours to get rid of the smell, after that, I don't notice a smell at all.
 I purchased the mattress through Amazon, but apparently do not get to take advantage of the 100 free nite trial period that I would have received buying direct from Tuft and Needle. You only get 30 days through Amazon. The mattress is too firm for me and know I am stuck with a quality built mattress that could have been easily exchanged by not going through Amazon. Lesson learned, buy direct from Tuft and Needle if you would like to try this one out. I was impressed with quality of the mattress, it was just to firm for me. Every review out there I read gave Tuft and Needle top notches for their customer service. I would recommend they go back to a direct sale model instead of Amazon to avoid confusion on the consumers part in the future.
 This is exactly the mattress I wanted.  I didn't want a memory foam mattress.  The firmness is perfect.  I like that it's not horribly heavy to lift when I get ready to rotate the mattress.  I also like that the product is made in USA. I would certainly buy again.
 Comfortable, affordable and durable.  Nice find.
 Its firm but I like that.  I woke with no pain after the first night.
 We love it, we were very satisfied!
 Awesome mattress for the price , fast delivery and comfortable
 Seem to be sleeping well, just wish it was better for side sleeping. My arms will still fall asleep, and/or be sore from my shoulder, when I sleep on my side.
 Love this mattress so far.  We have been sleeping on it for a week.  Did not notice an odor.  The only thing that I was not happy with is the width of the mattress.  It expanded to about 57-58 inches instead of 60.  It did not cover the bed frame we bought completely but it is very comfortable so far.
 I've had this mattress for over a year and I absolutely LOVE this mattress. I've always preferred a very firm mattress, and although this is medium firmness, the support this mattress provides is unbelievable. I've had no issues with it sinking down in any spots, or the corners sagging. I've loved this mattress since day 1, and you can't beat the price for the quality you get.
 Wonderful!
 Great comfortable bed.
 After about using a month I can say that it is comfortable as ever.
 Absolutely fantastic.
 This is the worst mattress I have ever slept on. It is extremely soft and gives no support to your back. The first week it felt ok. But then, the foam started to depress, causing intense lower back pain.<br/>I watched the video and bought into the gimmick, cool San Francisco vibe. DO NOT BUY THIS MATTRESS.<br/><br/>-Disabled U.S. Army Veteran
 the mattress is too firm like it doesn't hug the body and it isn't cooking just feels like sleeping on a sneaker.  I had to get a cooling foam gel topper to put on top of it.  For all the money I spent and all the good reviews I thought I would really like this bed. I threw away the box and it would be a pain to return so don't buy into the return policy it'll be too much trouble and you'll keep it.
 This is an excellent mattress, it is 20 times better than any spring mattress that I’ve slept on. It kept my back aligned and improved my sleep greatly. The mattress did feel a little strange to sleep on. It almost felt like I wasn’t sleeping on anything so my brain did freak out a little when we first got it. When we unpacked the mattress the was no smell, that was wonderful. Overall I would say that is a little bit of a firmer mattress. We did choose to return the mattress but only because I’m a back sleeper and couldn’t get comfortable on my back. I would defiantly recommend this mattress to a friend.
 At first feel, this mattress seemed like it would live up to the reviews. The mattress returned quickly to its original form when pressed upon--it had that bounce-back quality I was looking for. I wanted a firm mattress with some top-layer softness, and I was excited to replace my old futon with this high-end T&amp;N mattress. A couple months passed and I began to notice sharp pains in my side and back as soon as I awoke. At first, I credited this discomfort to my sleeping positions, and tried to lay on my back, very still, so as not to wake up sore. And for a month or so, this strategy reduced my aching. But as time went by, the pains escalated--it seems as if this mattress is slumping into itself, and it feels as if my back is sinking into a ditch. I never had this problem with my futon. The material of this mattress is too soft, and its firmness is deteriorating after sleeping on it for less then a year!
 Fantastic mattress, easy delivery- what more could you ask for.
 Fabulous mattress!!!
 I purchased this mattress to use in our guest bedroom after over a year of reading reviews and checking consumer report reviews. The mattress in our master bedroom is a dream to sleep on - but at the time of purchase 8 years ago it cost $2k. It is a hybrid innerspring with memory foam top. I could not find a well-rated mattress in the size range and depth that would fit our guest bed AND that was a hybrid AND cost less than $1k. Then I came across this Tuft &amp; Needle memory foam and for the great price took a chance.<br/><br/>Pros:  delivered to your door; easy set up; right price; feels comfortable.<br/>Cons:  It does have a charcoal-like smell that took a week of airing to get rid of.<br/><br/>We slept on this mattress so I could give you an honest opinion on comfort. It is more firm than my regular bed, but still very comfortable. I put a mattress pad over it, then a cotton sheet. It did not feel hot, and after a bit it conformed to my body. This is what I look for...enough firmness to support my spine and hips, yet enough "give" to cushion my joints. This mattress fit all of those requirements for me.
 Love it!
 absolutely incredible.  So super comfortable, I love it.
 Very comfortable mattress.
 It rocks
 Absolutely love it.
 Love it. Super comfortable
 Please heed the reviews that say this mattress feels like a rock! I purchased this mattress after seeing the fair price and reading all the positive reviews for it, choosing to overlook all the comments people made regarding how firm it was. 3 months in (wanting to give time for adjustment and trial) and now unable to qualify for a return, I am so sorry that I did.<br/><br/>My fiancé and I sleep on a full - I'm about 160 lbs and he's more like 200, but we've always slept fine, even on hotel beds, until this. We've both been tossing and turning and I often wake up to find him sleeping on the floor rather than this mattress. When we first got it I had so many neck and shoulder stiffness issues (I am a stomach and side sleeper) that I ran out and re-bought the 4 inch mattress topper we'd been using to make our previous mattress go the distance (we'd gotten rid of it when we got the new mattress thinking we wouldn't need it any more...). The mattress topper helped me be a bit more comfortable, but even so if I slept more than 6 hours on this I had back pain the next morning. My fiancé hasn't been so lucky - with or without the mattress topper, he has major back issues after sleeping more than 5 hours or so, which is why he's preferring the ground lately.<br/><br/>So unfortunate, because the mattress did unpack very easy and quickly, no real odor or temperature issues with it, and the company and their customer service seems to be spot on, it's just the product itself for comfort is not ideal - at least it wasn't for us.
 This is the second Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress I have owned. The first one is still going strong and I liked it enough that I bought another for myself. While I think it is a quality item and that you can't beat the price, I find it a bit too firm and wish it was a little more cozy. I ended up buying a soft mattress topper to give me that. Even with the added cost to make it comfier (which is just personal preference) I think it is a good deal and I recommend it to friends and family whenever they are in the market for a new bed.
 Great product!
 I had my doubts about products like this, such as the product not expanding properly, having collapsed corners or sagging edges, or having a soggy feeling since it's an all foam mattress.  Neither of these turned out the be the case.  Tuft &amp; Needle had the best reviews and better pricing than more expensive all-foam mattresses you can get online. The mattress expanded almost immediately to be a properly shaped mattress and has been far more comfortable than traditional spring mattresses.  The support feels appropriate, not too soft or saggy but still has a cushy feeling to it.  Glad I bought it!
 Holy crap, I don't know what you're doing with your life if you don't stop right now and buy this mattress.  I was apprehensive but glad I pulled the trigger.  It really is cool and awesome and everything Consumer Reports said it was.  No regrets.  Buy this and put it on a platform frame.  Boom.  Easy peasy.
 So this mattress is pretty good, but it has some considerable flaws. On the plus side:<br/>+ Packaging was fine, comes all rolled up and vacuum sealed. Expands quickly without issue when you cut open the packaging.<br/>+ The mattress is more on the firm side, but still somewhat soft. When you lie down, it really does feel like the right amount of firmness.<br/><br/>On the downside though...<br/>The edges of this mattress are not firm at all. They have no strength. And when I say edge, I mean the ~6 inches of the mattress on all sides. If you tried that bowling ball test with this mattress, it would do pretty well in the center. And anywhere close to the edge the bowling ball would quickly roll off and smash into the floor. The edges on this bed are worse than almost any mattress I've ever seen. Take a look at some pictures of the just this mattress without any bedding on top. Notice how it has no seams at all? It's not that the mattress is a little soft closer to the edge, the issue is that it becomes so much softer that you start to sink in and almost fall off.<br/><br/>Honestly the lack of edge strength is becoming pretty close to a dealbreaker for me. If you get a queen size bed (first mistake) which is already pretty small for two people, then imagine the bed is another foot shorter in width because you cannot comfortably sleep close to the sides. The mattress is also too soft if you decide to sit on it cross legged at the head or foot of the mattress. Lying down the foot and head of the mattress are not an issue because your weight is evenly distributed. But if you roll over close to the side, be careful you don't just fall off. Honestly if this mattress cost ~$100 more but had firm sides it would be totally worth it. Definitely 4-5 stars.<br/><br/>But the way it stands, this mattress is not worth ~$600. Unless you're really strapped for cash, don't buy this mattress.
 so far so gooooooood!  Wonderful quality and so easy to set up! I've slept on it now for 4 nights and have no back ache whatoever.. ahhh so nice:) I don't think anyone will be unhappy with this purchase. I hope this quality lasts *fingers crossed*
 Best mattress ever!! Replaced a $2500 big name! Customer for life!
 It's better that I thought for the money.  I hope it lasts several years.
 These mattresses are softer than what I am used to, however I haven't had any back problems and have been able to sleep very well. So I think that it does give enough support to your back where needed. Since it is a little bit softer it works better than my Tempur-pedic mattress when sleeping on my side. Also it does not get as warm as my Tempur-pedic.
 experienced a Tuft and Needle mattress  while visiting an Airbnb in Brooklyn. It was  the first time ever in my life that I had a great night of sleep  away from my home.Before I left Brooklyn  I made a point of taking off the fitted sheet and checking out on what type of mattress I had been sleeping. Since I was remodeling our guest room it seemed to make sense to invest in these mattress for the 2 new  twin beds. I ordered online  on a Monday night and they were at my doorstep 10 AM on Wednesday. The mattresses were fun to watch inflate and feel so good. I shared the whole mattress story with my visiting mother in law who tried out the new mattress and she decided to order one for herself. She had a great experience with the ordering process and the free  "helpers' who took away her old mattress and set up the new ones for her. She loves her new mattress as well.
 I’m very sad about this. I’ve had the mattress for almost 3 weeks and my sleep has not improved at all. I wake up with unbearable pain in my hips and low back. I had really high hopes for this mattress but I think it’s just too firm for me. Back to the drawing board, plus returning a mattress certainly will not be much fun at all. 😢
 Great price, which included delivery and a 10-year warranty. The mattress is firm but gently cradles the bodies curves. Took some getting used to as it's 3 inches less in height/thickness than my last mattress. We'll have to wait and see how long it will last.
 Outstanding mattress at an excellent price. I love it.
 Our twin mattress came all rolled up in a cardboard box.  We let it out and it filled up with air.  It's light and very nice to have as an extra guest bedroom mattress.  Occasionally on those hot summer nights, we'll carry our twin mattress downstairs to sleep there where it's cooler.  Very comfortable.
 Amazing to sleep on the right mattress. My family has been in the custom foam mattresses, bed, waterbed and custom cushions for window seats, V berths for sailing vessels for years. So I think of myself as a bit of an expert. To buy from my family's currant store would be far more expensive even with my discount. The price is right even the cost of a simple frame. I bought it from Amazon but there is a store in San Francisco.
 Good
 Excellent, the best mattress so far.
 "We believe in offering the same fair price to all customers, all year long." says Tuft &amp; Needle's website.<br/>However, after I purchased this mattress for 900 dollars, they changed the price to 700 within a month. This is not even a discount but a base price change. That's what you call "same fair price to all customers, all year long"? Funny!
 We bought a King and have been delighted with it. We have a Tempur mattress we bought 10 years ago for $3,500 and this virtually matches it in every way, except the cost!!! It is very comfortable to sleep on as it feels soft where it touches but has the firmness to support your body and there is no disturbance for the other person when one moves. I would recommend these mattresses and we intend to get another for the guest bedroom.
 Good mattress.. 16 yr old hasn't complained.
 THANK YOU!
 Simply the best, an equal if not slightly better competitor to Casper at a lower price point. Couldn't be happier with the delivery and quality. Love supporting a startup and not an overpriced manufacturer. If you're considering a discounted mattress on Groupon Goods or another site, try this instead. Note: it is definitely too heavy for a petite woman to bring up a NYC walk up by herself so enlist help!
 Very comfortable mattress.
 I was so excited to get this mattress because my old one was killing my back. I like this one, especially for the price, but it's not amazing. A lot of people made it sound like it was incredible but I found it to be middle of the road. It doesn't kill my back but it isn't the best sleep ever. It's good for the price for sure though.
 I purchased our Tuft and Needle mattress about a month ago after finally getting fed up with poor sleep on my coil spring mattress. I've comfortably slept on latex mattresses in the past, but they are extremely expensive and all indications are that a non-latex mattress can offer the comfort of latex for significantly less. So I researched the various direct-to-consumer foam mattresses. I really like Tuft &amp; Needle's business model, and they seem to have the best combination of affordability and quality of the available options.<br/><br/>The package arrived within a week and was smaller and lighter than I was expecting. The mattress is compressed surprisingly thin and rolled, but quickly expands once you remove the plastic packaging. I resisted the urge to sleep on it the first night since it does take time to completely expand and there was the slightest hint of off-gassing. The mattress consists of a firmer base/support layer and a softer top/comfort layer. To the touch it feels quite comfortable - soft but still supportive. And the mattress appears to be high quality. The cover is smooth and well-pit together without any poor seems and is cut cleanly without any loose pieces or ragged edges.<br/><br/>After letting expand for 24 hours, I eagerly slept on my new mattress. And I awoke rather stiff and sore. The included literature rightly suggests that you give yourself some time to adjust to a new mattress, and that it can take a week to reach full softness, so I reserved judgement.<br/><br/>After sleeping on the mattress for about a month, I've decided it's just too firm for me. I'm ~200 lbs, and it feels like the comfort layer is a little too thin, particularly if sleeping on my side. I toss and turn and night trying to get comfortable and typically wake up with stiffness/soreness in my back.<br/><br/>As the thousands of positive reviews indicate, the Tuft &amp; Needle works for a lot of people. Unfortunately it's not working for me. It would be nice if they offered firmness options, but I suppose that would complicate their business model and increase prices. Oh well.
 This mattress is very firm. Night three. My back is killing me. I dont know whether to return it or spend more money and get a topper. Not for side/stomach sleepers, especially if you have bigger hips.
 Great mattress, great support, cut my chiaorpactor bill in half
 Perfection. I wondered whether the 5" might be too thin, but this thing is comfy as can be.
 My wife who is a side sleeper loves this mattress and actually got better full night sleep time. I’m a back sleeper and the first couple of nights couldn’t sleep. We are coming from a spring style mattress and was new to this memory foam style. After about a week I started getting better sleep times. I’m not sure since this is our first memory foam mattress in the levels of firm and softness but reading other reviews before we bought this had it higher towards the firm comfort. The next mattress I might be buying a little more towards the softer side. But overall for the price and comfort I can’t complain. Great product.
 Great product, very comfortable.
 I wish I had purchased this mattress years ago. I've always been able to get to sleep, but I wake up significantly more refreshed than when I used a box spring.  Every pressure point disappears. Recently, I attended a conference in a nearby town and opted for an early checkout to sleep in my room instead of a very fine Westin.<br/><br/>It's easy to unpack and open. The inevitable foam "smell" dissipates quickly and isn't overwhelming to begin with.
 The bed came quickly and was packaged nicely! We set it up in a spare room and let it air out and inflate for a day or two before putting it onto our frame. I wouldn't say this is necessary, as it didn't have a "smell" like some other beds do/reviews have said and it inflated very very quickly. It's a good weight for a king - it's not hard to move and the flexibility is great for moving into smaller bedrooms/homes. We've been using the mattress for about a month now and it's awesome! It's some of the best sleep I've had in a long time.
 Unfortunately, we decided to go with another mattress. This mattress was simply too firm and did not let up. My wife and I are generally smaller and combo sleepers and the firmness of this mattress just does not "give" enough for any of the positions we sleep in. We were both waking up with worse back pain than we did with our previous 10 year old sagging mattress. Real bummer since the reviews are so great. Back to the drawing board for us...
 Received it, promptly opened it as instructed, impressed with it so far, BUT haven't slept on it yet because it came on a Monday, it is now Saturday and the petroleum odor has not entirely gone.  It has been near the open window so hoping it will dissipate soon. It is the Full size.  Perhaps some have stronger odor &amp; perhaps some people notice it more..........just something to consider. I did lay on it &amp; it seems nice &amp; firm.
 Love this mattress
 Bought this mattress almost a year ago. Straight out it looked and felt just perfect. Don't even feel like putting a bed sheet on this thing. A little later we started noticing that when both me and my wife were sleeping on it it felt much less firm and we woke up with back and neck pains sometimes. When only one of us was sleeping it felt perfect. I think it's not able to completely take the weight of two people (we weight about 165 and 110 lbs respectively)<br/><br/>We had mostly gotten used to the feeling over the months but Recently we returned from a trip to India where we had a very firm mattress for a month and immediately felt the lack of support with mattress again and started having an uncomfortable sleep and started waking up with slight back pains.<br/><br/>It pains me to say this because it's such a beautiful mattress and when I'm the only one on it, it feels just heavenly.
 Very comfortable..! Its firm and soft.
 Cool mattress in a cool box.<br/>Definitely worth the money.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>too firm for me.<br/><br/>Because of my age and weight (45-200lb) my skin hurt, like pressing against my bones.<br/><br/>For a younger person, a lighter person, or one who prefers a firm bed this is it. Maybe perfect.<br/><br/>Soft for about an inch or two then firm like an overinflated air mattress.<br/><br/>I like the politics of the company as well, and the startup, entrepreneur aspect.<br/><br/>I had to return the mattress and use the 6 year old Sealy pillowtop I was replacing.<br/>I thought of getting a topper. Then this looked great.<br/>I guess it's back to topper and a foot tall bed.
 Love it!
 It's been about a year and a half since I purchase this mattress and I've finally come to the conclusion I need to get rid of it. This mattress is not for side sleepers. While firm, it does not have enough top layer softness to allow my to find a stable side position. Instead, it almost forces you into a fetal position (or even stomach) with a concave lower back and twisted hips. I'm 5'10", 195 lbs, so I thought the firmness wouldn't be a problem. I've definitely noticed more morning stiffness and soreness in multiple places. Also, I have been traveling more for work and sleeping in hotel beds. In most hotel beds, I sleep much better with minimal or no morning soreness. While I do think it's a well-built mattress, this is in no way the right mattress for me.
 Great mattress for a great price. We moved here from Europe and think its ridiculous what mattresses cost here. We've had ours for 2 months now. We sleep well on it. I like that it's not made in China. Firmness was perfect for us. Not at all too firm contrary to other remarks. Can't say much about durability as yet.
 Like. We rate it a 5
 Awesome. So comfy
 Great mattress, delivered when said.Overall experience was great.
 I found this mattress to be hard and hot.  I spoke to T&amp;N customer service and they 1) sent me a foam topper and 2) advised me not to use a mattress pad.  Now I'm comfortable.  If the topper was built into the mattress I would give it 5 stars.
 Very comfortable and got here really fast!
 I've been sleeping on this bed for several months, and it is extremely comfortable.
 Fantastic quality with a great price!
 The delivery was as promised. Replaced a ten year old mattress.  Watch a video to see it unfold.  It is amazing.  Beautiful cover and construction.<br/>Sleeping well.  After a month we have added our foam topper for extra firmness.  We expected that could be the case. It does not change our opinion of the mattress.
 Never thought I'd buy a mattress online, but after doing some research, and lots of comparison shopping, I decided to give Tuft and Needle a try. I figured that with the100 night guarantee, I didn't really have much to lose. After three of the most comfortable nights of sleep I've ever had in my life, allow me to whole-heartedly recommend this mattress to you! I'm a big guy - 6'1" and 225, and this supports me and my weight spectacularly, while providing enough give to keep pressure off of my joints. My wife is 5'7" and 125, and she can't stop raving about how comfortable she finds it too, so feel confidant knowing that this likely suits you as well.
 Great Mattress. Really fast delivery. Very easy to unpack and set up
 This product is amazing.  Tuft and needle somehow developed a technology where they turn expanding foam into a bed shaped rock.  Three different family members tried this bed out and reported uncomfortable sleep and back pain.  It is unbelievable that this bed got so many good reviews.
 It was OK. I left it will enough, my wife didn't comfortable and that was hurting when using it. The return process was pretty weasely. Paid $636 with tax but for some reason only got back $508 in refund . What's that about??  Oh and that doesn't include the $36 I had to pay for a box into which we could get the mattress because forget about getting it back into the original packaging.
 Me and wife are both pretty picky about our mattress. We got T&amp;N mattress after a lot of research and based on our friend's recommendation. We find it comfortable to sleep on and no more back pain when waking up. Couple of drawbacks we observe are:<br/>1. Sleeping on the edges is not very comfortable on this mattress. It makes you feel that you are about to fall down. Basically a 'no grip' feeling on the edges<br/>2. 'Twisting and turning' is not very easy. Looks like I am leaving an impression (I weigh 240 lbs) and the mattress is not back in shape fast enough to support any twists and turns. Basically I feel that I am in a ditch during the twists and turns.<br/><br/>Sleeping on your back is a perfect experience. My back does feel supported and I feel comfortable. We will use the full 90 days before we decide whether to keep or return. Chances are that we will keep it mostly.
 I wanted to like this mattress, because I love the story about the two guys that started this company.  I had also heard good things about the mattress.  But, after sleeping on it for two weeks, we got a refund.  The issue is the cushioned top is way too soft and simply collapses when you lie on it leaving you sleeping directly on the foam mattress which is too hard.  I have owned memory foam mattresses in the past and love them.  But, this one is not for us.  Even my partner started complaining about back pain.  A good memory foam mattress is firm enough to give all over support where you need it while being soft enough to mold to your body.  This mattress does not do that.  We felt like we were lying on a board.  We replaced this mattress with the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Zinus-Memory-Foam-12-Inch-Premium-Ultra-Plush-Cloud-like-Mattress-Queen/dp/B012H0K93I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zinus Memory Foam 12 Inch / Premium / Ultra Plush / Cloud-like Mattress, Queen</a> and are very happy.
 This is such an awesome mattress! I was one of those people who was certain that I would need to go in to a store and lay on about 20 beds before picking the one I wanted. Well, I read a lot of these reviews and decided to roll with the T&amp;N King size. The mattress is more on the firm side, which is what we were looking for and we didn't have any issues with the mattress laying flat or having any type of smell (some others had mentioned some sort of smell). Shipping was very quick! All is well and we would definitely recommend this mattress to anyone thinking of buying a mattress directly off Amazon!
 I'll probably update this in a couple months, but I've been sleeping on a queen-size Tuft &amp; Needle for about 20 days now, and it's fantastic. It has completely blown away my preconceptions about memory foam mattresses. I'm a very hot sleeper, so I was nervous I would hate it, but it's actually been just as cool as a traditional mattress, if not better.
 Outstanding mattress.
 I would have returned this awhile ago, however I only slept on it one week out of the month. I was hoping it would improve in comfort. Now, I'm scrambling to return it in time!
 I have bought both this bed and the Leesa bed. This one is a bit softer so if that's what you like, you'll like this. For me it was a bit too soft. The edges are also very soft, if you get to the edge you will feel like you are going to roll off. UPDATE: after about a year of using a T&amp;N and Leesa bed, I'm giving up on both of them and going back to a "real" mattress. I don't think either have been good for my back.
 love it
 Overall, the mattress is very comfortable. My wife slept like a rock on it, I unfortunately did not sleep as well. We purchased the T&amp;N to replace an old foam mattress that developed hot spots.<br/>After the second night, I encountered the same problem. The big problem came when we returned it. If you purchase directly from T&amp;N, you get to try the mattress for 90 days verse 30 days if you go through Amazon. Here's the BIG problem- Amazon requires you to box up the mattress before UPS picks it up ( no cost to you). This is easier said than done. The mattress is vacuum packed at the factory. Once you cut open the bag, it naturally inflates to full size.<br/>Getting it back in the box is impossible.<br/>Finding a king size mattress box was harder than expected. Our local Uhaul store had nothing and mattress stores typically don't keep old boxes on sight. I ended up purchasing  a poly bag for the mattress at the Uhaul and, using a shop vac, sucked out enough air to roll the mattress small enough to fit in two large boxes. It took my whole family of 5 to accomplish this feat. What a pain. If we had purchased directly off the T&amp;N website, they would have had  someone pick it up and we would have avoided the whole repackaging nightmare.
 I love our new mattress. I have not woke up with hip pain as I usually did since sleeping on this and we've only had it a week. Its soft but supportive/ firm at the same time. My husband likes it too. He is always hot and does not get hot at all sleeping on it. Very happy with this mattress.
 Fantastic bed - awesome for anyone who has pressure issues or sleep problems.  Excellent for anyone, any age.  I used Zinus 14 Inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation / Platform Bed Frame / Box Spring Replacement / Quiet Noise-Free / Maximum Under-bed Storage, King - and also a Pinzon cover.
 I don’t normally write reviews but this-time I am because I don’t want someone else to have the same experience as I did. This looks like a very quality mattress and looks very comfy. However when you order a queen and take it out of the box thinking it’s a queen and go to put it on your bed frame and low and behold it’s falling off the edge. Umm. You go back and look at the box and sure enough it’s marked king on the box. And yes there happy to refund or exchange your product but have you ever tried sending back a mattress that has been vacuumed sealed and now is not. It’s like putting a round peg in a square hole. I DOESNT WORK! So now I have a 600 dollar king size mattress I won’t use. So just remember if your buying a mattress online check the outside of the box and make sure it’s the right size. And if it’s not trust me you will never get it back in the box.
 It's only been two nights on the new mattress, but I'm now two nights without Tylenol for knee/neck pain! My husband said the only problem with the bed is that we need a louder alarm clock to help us get up and going- It is so comfortable. We are not small people and my husband is 6'6"" has had 2 knee surgeries in the past years and we both suffer from neck/shoulder tightness from tension etc. and that is being alleviated at night as well. So far no complaints at all...great product and we have 98 more nights to continue to try it out.<br/>*Also, set up was super simple, slept in it right away, no weird chemical smells like other mattresses. Very, very satisfied. Go get you one! :)
 love the bed!
 Soft.  Amerisleep and others have better fit and finish.  While any mattress will work - these tip you off the ends and I did see this in other reviews.  As well, I see the 5 stars and the 1 stars and believe this is a true 2 star product just because you can sleep on it.  We have now purchased 4 new amerisleep for Scottsdale and Chicago homes and this unit was donated to local thrift shop after 20 uses.
 Very comfortable and getting better ever night.
 so comfy and a great price too
 Fantastic mattress for a great price
 Good
 Mattress is way too firm for me. I have had it for a year hoping it would soften up over time. It hasn’t. I find it hard to get to sleep and once I do, I wake up hurting. Very disappointed. I bought it because of the high ratings and reputation of Tuft and Needles.  😓
 We have had our queen sized mattress for about two weeks now and we absolutely love it.  It is so comfortable and it doesn't get too hot at night, despite the fact that our little guy (who occasionally sleeps with us) is a tiny heater.  It arrived in a small box, considering its size and I was amazed that it only took about 60 seconds to fully inflate!  There was no chemical smell at all and we were able to sleep on it that night.  We will buy Tuft &amp; Needle mattresses from now on in my family!
 Amazing bed. Sleeping through the night! I used to always wake up but this solved all my back ailments. Make sure to get a mattress cover (to protect from sweat, skin cells, etc)
 After waking up with joint and muscle soreness for the last couple of years, my husband and I decided it was time to replace our 8-year old "Plush" mattress.  The Tuft and Needle reviews were amazing, so we decided to give it a go.<br/>First night in, we didn't sleep well from adjusting to the new mattress. Second night and on, we were impressed how much better we slept - we could not feel each other switching positions, we weren't waking up every few hours, and finally we didn't have our aches and soreness.<br/>Unfortunately, for me, that feeling only lasted a few days. I think it is because I went from one extreme to the other. Three weeks in and  I think the mattress is too firm for me as a side sleeper.  I need a little more give for my shoulders and hips to sink into but still have support.<br/>With that being said, we may purchase a mattress topper before deciding if we will return to Tuft and Needle. I am grateful for the 100 day trial and will give it more time + possibly the mattress topper.<br/>The hubby loves it, but we need to find a combination that works for both side and stomach/back sleeper.
 Wanted to post an update, my son has been sleeping on this bed for 5 weeks now and the pain he's suffered with for almost a year has almost been completely gone away, he loves this bed and we both wish we had purchased it sooner.  Highly recommend this if you are suffering
 I really wanted to love this mattress. I ordered the queen size. I’ve “slept” on it for a week now, if you can call it that. I'm 25 years old and weigh 100 pounds, so I hardly sink into the mattress and it’s insanely firm. I’ve tossed, turned, and barely slept a wink in the past 7 days, and my zombiage is beginning to affect my work. When I do manage to fall and stay asleep, I wake up sore with back pain. I can’t mentally afford to test it out for another week. I would buy a mattress topper, but this mattress was already at the top of my budget. I’m going to start the return process through Amazon, and sleep in the guest room until I find a suitable replacement.<br/><br/>I like that it was made in the USA and the company seems ethical, but it just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/>UPDATE: I worked with CEVA to return the mattress to Amazon. Amazon deducted $31.92 from my refund to pay for return shipping, so be aware that return shipping is NOT free! I should have bought it from Tuft &amp; Needle itself, but I wanted the 2-day Prime shipping.
 I LOVE, LOVE this mattress !!!  Soooo comfortable, best night sleep in a long time.<br/>Previously I was totally into Beauty Rest or Simmon's, NEVER again.  I have been telling all my friends about Tuft and Needle mattress, hopefully they will shop &amp; buy soon !!!
 UPDATE - the return was arranged - Amazon said next business day someone would arrive - 2 business days later UPS arrived and refused to take the mattress - stated that I had to compress the mattress back in to its original box - for those of you familiar with foam mattresses they are shipped mechanically compressed out of air to 1/4 or less of their size to fit into a convenient shape and size for shipping. Tuft &amp; Needle said that we should not need to package the mattress and that Amazon would take the mattress as is and donate it since you cannot sell an opened mattress. T&amp;N were clearly wrong. They gave me an Amazon number to call that did not work and I am trying to contact Amazon know. Horrible experience. Never buy T&amp;N through Amazon. Never buy a foam mattress through Amazon. I don't have packaging for a mattress - what do I do, go to a store and get a mattress box and bring it back and stuff the mattress in - well if I had the vehicle to get a box, would I not just take the whole heavy mattress to UPS? But wait, that's not convenient.  Amazon and UPS are not communicating with each other. Whenever that happens, mistakes happen in a company that large and customer satisfaction drops - pretty soon the stock will plunge. If you do not take care of your customer, you are no longer a valuable commodity. That goes for T&amp;N as well - they should have had a system in place for this.<br/><br/>This mattress was not supportive at all and was too soft. I do not understand how the reviews are so good. There is no edge support so you squish right down and getting up and out of the mattress is difficult. It is terrible for those with back problems and is not at all as described. In addition, when you buy it through Amazon, make sure you understand that the 100-night guarantee does not apply. The company does not honour the 100-night guarantee if purchased through Amazon. This mattress felt more like a giant soft pillow, than a mattress. There was no comfortable lying or sitting position. Had to return it and buy a firm foam proper mattress. I gave it two stars instead of one because the quality of the material was decent and the packaging and marketing was good. Unfortunately, as is all too common these days, marketing and looks are more valuable than actual functionality. Do not buy this mattress if you care about your back and posture.
 Product is great but beware, when ordered through Amazon the trial is only 30 days.....through Tuft and Needle directly is the only way to get 100 days!
 VERY COMFORTABLE, but really can impede sex.
 Love it!
 Sooooocomfy
 This bed is somewhat like a temperpedic mattress but half the cost. My daughter bought one &amp; recommended it to me. I had a good mattress before moving to the west coast &amp; this one is far better then that one. You don't sweat or get cold &amp; its very very comfortable.
 Love it!
 Too soft. Edges collapse when you sit on them. Gave us a bunch of hip pain. Bought $200 memory foam and decided to get rid of our tuft &amp; needle. W
 Been sleeping on the mattress for 3 weeks now and I still hate it as much as I hated it the first night I slept on it. It is extremely hard and uncomfortable. I have not had one good nights sleep since sleeping on it and I am so fudging tired. I thought I would love this mattress given the reviews but it is not my jam and I am sad. I am 145lbs if that helps anyone get an idea of why it isn't working for me. I may just try purchasing a topper to help make it more comfortable for me.
 The seaside resort had T&amp;N mattress which we found to be very comfortable. So we bought one for the house and are happy with it. All I can say is try it.
 I was very nervous about buying a mattress online. I looked at many reviews and even after reading all the good ones I was skeptical because I had never done it before. The mattress comes packaged in a way that makes it easy to get through the door, and setting it up was a breeze. My husband and I have slept on it for a couple of months now and I have to say it is very comfortable and it stays pretty cool through the night. Would definitely buy another one when in need of a mattress!
 This mattress is great for stomach and side sleepers. My husband loves it, he's a stomach sleeper. I love the mattress when I sleep on my side, but when I sleep on my back all bets are off and the mattress is really uncomfortable. I wake up in pain when I sleep on my back. However, a nice thing about the mattress is it's ability not to disturb the other person if they get up in the middle of the night. Temperature stays decent too. I would highly recommend for side and stomach sleepers, but not for back sleepers.
 It didn't work out for for us. We took advantage of the 100 night free sleep trial, but ended up not keeping it and getting our money refunded.
 Great
 Love our new mattress!
 12.01.17<br/>Ordered the bed on Sunday, received it by Wednesday !<br/>Great service as expected on Amazon.<br/>It was easy to open, carry and place on our new bed!<br/>Size is perfect.<br/>I can say it’s the best bed I’ve ever slept in.<br/><br/>I will return with an updated review as we use the mattress more. So far it’s perfect !
 Fantastic mattresses!  We love them.  We enjoyed the unpacking process too.  It was fun to watch them come to life.  We're using two XL twins on adjustable frames made up as a king in our Florida home.  We loved them so much we ordered a King size for our Virginia home to replace our aging innerspring.  Can't beat the comfort or the cost.  They're supportive, stay cool and are much easier to handle than what we replaced.
 Too soft, and around the edges it's so soft I fall into the wall or off the side. Gives me a back ache too from being too soft yet description says it's firm. How are you supposed to return a mattress any way. Big mistake buying a bed without seeing it first
 Wow, I generally like firm mattresses, but this thing is FIRM. It's been 3 months and there is no breaking it in. Multiple people have agreed. Please read the most recent reviews before ordering and you will see. $750 down the drain. I tested it out in a T&amp;N store and it was nowhere near this firm. I strongly suggest returning before the 3rd day if it is firm on arrival. That said it is nearly impossible to return through Amazon, because they make you box it so I strongly suggest not buying at all. I repeat, it will not "break in".
 First impression was good, first night was so bad. It was way to stiff! The thought was to go a bit stiffer, this being our first memory foam mattress, I was afraid of too much sinking and feeling stuck. But this was unbearable. So in the meantime we gave another mattress a try while this one sat. BEWARE: the company has changed its formula so reviews on popular mattress websites might be outdated. Sites that haves tested before and after product changes are much more positive. After a week this mattress had a completely different feel. Much softer but still has bounce! To be honest I would prefer a bit softer mattress as a side sleeper, but the mattress gets more comfortable each night, so here is hoping it breaks in nice and stays that way for a while. At this price I haven't found one that could beat it. It doesn't hurt that the company is awesome!
 This mattress is very firm, I am very disappointed, especially since I planned to purchased this mattress back in may but due to the bed frame being delayed I wasn't able to order until June and they hiked the price substantially. It seems to be well made but I'm waking up every morning to a stiff back due to how firm this mattress is.
 Just way, way, way, way too firm.  I was never as sore after a night of sleep as I was after three nights on this mattress. I didn't believe the reviews that said this because I assume all people on the internet are crazy.  In this case, they are right.
 WATCH OUT !!!!!!!! BEWARE !!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Writing this review after owning this mattress for 1 1/2 year now. It was fine for first 6 months.<br/> Mattress soon became soft and the center of the mattress is still firm and the corners got soggy .<br/><br/>Both my husband and I developed back pain . Too late to return too .... and disposal charge on this mattress is around $100<br/>Trusting amazon reviews ordered this mattress without even trying .
 Terrific mattress, very soft and comfortable. Amazing how it's rolled up for shipping yet flattens out in a very short time with no signs of it being rolled up. Slides a bit on top of existing box spring, but that's not a big issue.
 I have owned foam mattresses for over 10 years.  My last one finally formed a depression and I purchased this mattress based on all the high reviews.  At first, I slept great,but within 3 months (funnily just days after the 100 day trial period), I was having horrible lower back pain.  It has been 4 months now, and I am already thinking about having to buy another mattress as the lower back pain continues and is becoming chronic.  I did not have this problem on my prior mattress, so I have to attribute it to this mattress.  I am disappointed and wish I had identified the mattress as the cause of the issue prior to the end of 100 day trial period.  Money down the drain.
 Loved it the first few months. After that it wasn’t so great. Still feel like it was a good price, but will be in a landfill within a year.
 I sleep like a baby on this mattress! Whatever aches and pains I have disappear, because this mattress works for me.
 I sleep like a dead hooker on this thing. My only regret is that I didn't save up slightly more money and get a king-sized one so I could still sleep on it diagonally when my girlfriend sleeps over and radiates more heat than a dying blue dwarf star.<br/><br/>It's ready to use right out of the box, and doesn't smell like anything, so you don't have to lay awake for the first week on it wondering how much formaldehyde you're inhaling, or whether you're sleeping well because it's a great mattress or because you're in the process of succumbing to death's sweet embrace.<br/><br/>Whatever the casing is on this thing, it feels amazing. The texture is great, and if I wasn't worried about staining it with jeans or dirt, I'd love to lie on it while the sheets are in the laundry, because the texture is even better than the 400-thread-count sheets I use on it. If it was socially-acceptable, I would drape myself in the stuff and walk around like a king.
 Excellent mattress in most regards, can't feel my husband roll over in bed, supports evenly from head to toe, no offgassing when it arrived, but I still sleep a bit painfully, I think it could be a bit more maleable. Would definitely recommend it though.
 Overall not a bad mattress for the price but too soft for me, will be returning it. Gotta say amazon is pretty great with returns, they paying for shipping back
 It took about a month to get a good night's sleep....a bit too firm for me compared to my old select a number mattress. ...but now my back has actually been feeling less achy and stiff than when I slept on sleep number mattress. Very good workmanship.
 Great mattress so far no shoulder or hip pain yet.does seem to run a little warm though have noticed my lower back gets a little sweaty but nothing to severe,might be the mattress cover we have on it. At 6' tall 370# this mattress is working great 4 me!
 Too soft. Sunk and the sides are actually hanging out over the bed frame from settling
 I love that the mattress was low cost, but this mattress was too hard and I ended up adding our old Queen foam topper onto it before I could get comfortable enough to fall asleep. I did wait 2 weeks just in case the mattress softened a bit more, but it stayed the same and I was constantly waking up with pain on my spine due to how firm it was. It's too bad that I can't replace it as I already tore the box apart and have no way of putting it back into its original plastic casing so I can try to ship it back and see if it was a faulty product.
 too soft. does it suppose to look like this?
 I really wanted to like this mattress since it has an attractive look, and Tuft &amp; Needle has an appealing business model/company philosophy. However, my back has been killing me ever since I bought it. I play various sports, so I thought it was coincidence maybe attributed to subtle injury, but no, months later, and I'm pretty much in constant pain. I culled out other factors and slept on other mattresses as a control, so it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>My credit is through Amazon, so that's the only way I could afford a new mattress when I moved, but then you're stuck with only a 30-day return policy. That's not enough time to suss out if the mattress works for you, which is why T&amp;N's 100-day policy was so appealing. Disappointing and problematic.
 I had high hopes to write a review that raved about this mattress after reading what so many people had said, and researching the awesome company that the product comes from. I could relate the mission of the company and the ethics that they stand behind, and after a few months of searching, I decided that this would be the bed for me. Let me validate the company and their product: I think that it would be FANTASTIC for 'thinny' people... but if you need jeans in the double digits, look elsewhere.I had high hopes to write a review that raved about this mattress after reading what so many people had said, and researching the awesome company that the product comes from.

I try to go to sleep on my back, but I end up on my sides many nights as so many do. My previous mattress was a pillow top and I was looking for something soft, but firmer to contour my curves and give me an awesome nights rest. I had bought into they mythos of the Tuft &amp; Needle branding and this mattress so completely that the first night waking up with the first sore back that I'd had in ages, I attributed it to shoveling a little too much snow the night before (Wisconsin, ugh). The second and third mornings were groggy because I'd been up not once, but twice in the night -- an anomaly for me. Again, I rationalized this away. Perhaps the aforementioned snowstorm had my fat cells complaining from the work out. As the days went on, and the waking up became more frequent in the night, I found reason after reason to tell myself that it was me, and not the beloved bed that I'd bought and went loyally to sleep on and invariably found myself on the couch by morning and my backache was becoming quickly disabling; to the point where I felt like I'd need help to stand up!!! Still, I found reasons to blame circumstance. . .until last night.<br/><br/>Yet another snow storm (I have GOT to move somewhere warmer..) caught me out of the city overnight at ye olde random middle of the line hotel room, where the room' promised to be inexpensive but the coffee was promised to be free-flowing in the morning. As I eyed up the bed in the hotel room suspiciously, I groused to myself because I *knew* that if I couldn't get a decent night sleep at home in my new awesome bed, a snowball had a better chance of surviving being deep-fried than I had at getting a decent night sleep. What happened next? Seven hours and eighteen minutes of bliss.<br/><br/>Now safely back at home, I've realized that the only entity in the house that really gets a good night sleep on the mattress is my chubby feline who has nothing better to do than lounge around the house all day and props to her...but for the money I spent, I need more than a new bed for my cat. I need to sleep soundly, and this is not the mattress for me.
 These mattresses are a great value and offer much more support than a Temperpedic,  No sinking in to this mattress.
 This mattress felt more like an air mattress to me than a type of memory foam.  If you are used to memory foam and prefer memory foam, you will likely be disappointed.  Regardless of sleep comfort, if you get one thing from this review it is the following:  You will find it impossible to repack the mattress and ship it back if you decide this is not the mattress for you.  The 100 day trial and free return is completely meaningless given that it is impossible to stuff this mattress back into the tiny box it comes in (before it expands) and/or find a shipping box big enough to get it returned easily.
 We really like this mattress.  We couldn't believe that an organic mattress could arrive in such a small box and still be so soft and firm at the same time.  It's got a super slim profile, which is nice too.
 This is my second Tuft &amp; Needle mattress. I ordered a Queen size mattress for my son's room couple months ago and I started liking it, so I ordered a king size for my own room. So far so good! It is definitely firmer than Casper.
 I did a lot of research and chose this bed. I have back problems and was hopeful this bed would solve them. It didn't take 3 days for my back to feel almost completely better. Just laying on it calmed my back spasms. Worth every penny.
 The mattress is quite comfortable, but due to offgassing, it is making me deathly ill.  I am a day away from the week the instructions say to let it off-gas, and I am as sick as ever.  I was not entirely comfortable ordering a synthetic foam mattress, and I should have trusted my instincts.  If you suspect a synthetic foam mattress might make you sick, it probably will.  Aside from sleeping with windows open, there is little respite from nausea and headaches.
 After 5 months of sleeping on this bed, I have back pain consistently. I have never experienced back pain before, and I have not changed anything about my lifestyle. I can only imagine it's the bed.
 Waited a while before leaving a review to make sure I had adequate time to try it out.<br/><br/>Results: This mattress is the best mattress ever.
 Took a few nights for my body to adjust to new style of mattress.<br/>Woke up sore a few mornings as my bones moved back into alignment.<br/>For years I have had trouble staying asleep, but now I am sleeping longer and waking more rested.<br/>I will NEVER go back to a traditional mattress!
 Very comfortable &amp; cool sleeping on this mattress.  We used it for 2 weeks right on the floor before our bed frame got here. Minimal movement noted when partner moves or enters / departs the bed.
 Sorry it wasn't as comfortable as I thought.. my body, especially my back was achy... I purchased a one in half inch thick foam matter for better comfort.
 We now own two of these mattresses and have had one for over two years. Previously we had spent thousands of dollars on mattresses that we were only happy with for a few months. I can honestly say this mattress has not only pleasantly surprised us, the quality continues to hold and the price is unbelievable. I highly recommend this to those that have already tried the top expensive brands only to be dissatisfied and unable to return them.
 Good mattress for the price, although it is definitely on the firmer side, so be aware of that before you purchase. It took me some time to get used to, but I am back to having a restful night sleep.
 Comes so compressed in the box, we were thinking it was the wrong size.  But fills up quickly and expands to its normal size and shape once out of vacuum.  It is very comfortable.  A lot better for the back.
 My wife and I have been married for 16 years and have purchased over 10 mattresses. It was like Goldilocks who never found thr just right mattress until now.  I have 6 ruptured discs and hip replacement. I sleep well on this mattress on side,stomach, or back. Wife used to have to migrate from room to room each night trying to sleep on different beds in house. No more! Highly recommend this mattress. Have slent $4,000 on mattresses that weren't half as good as this $750 King Size!
 The mattress did not meet our need for firmness and we could not repack to return. Found out if we had bought direct and not via Amazon we could have returned and Tuft and Needle would help arrange alternative to shipping back. Alas! Amazon was not the way to go. May never buy mattress online ever again!
 It was too thin for my body, I have had back surgery and it was not think enough and I can feel the frame it was laying on.
 Awesome mattress for a bigger guy
 A little harder than I thought it would be but I sleep on a hard mattress any way. I didn't think much of it but after about 4 days I feel better and sleep 7 to 9 hrs when I let myself. I never sleep over 5 to 6 hours no matter how hard I try. It forms to me and I don't ack in the morning any more. I like the mattress a lot  but wonder if a little softer would be better. Don't know but I do like the mattress.
 Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.  I had reservations about the delivery before ordering.  But, it is packaged in such a way that it was the easiest mattress I ever brought into the house.  Great product!
 Bought this mattress because reviews claim it is good for heavier people. Was great for the first couple of weeks. Now I'm sleeping in a hole again. I think this product is extremely comfortable for average size people.
 We love it. Great price. Easy to assemble or air out. No real chemical smell. Unlike our previous organic mattress which was more of a futon this is like a regular king mattress. So far so good.
 I purchased this mattress and received it on June 13th, 2015. One needs to follow the excellent instructions included for unpacking and what to expect with the mattress.  This is what we found:  It took about 12 days for the odor to fully dissipate.  But, the odor was not strong and did not bother my wife or myself.  The mattress reached its firmness in about 7 days.  Tuft &amp; Needle indicates at least 5 days.  But again, this did not bother us.  It did take us almost 3 weeks for our bodies to adjust which the instructions indicate as well.  So, we have been sleeping on it for over a month now.  I have no more pressure point pain.  At first I thought the mattress needed to be firmer but not now.  It is truly comfortable. I weigh 220 lbs. and do not find any sagging yet.  My wife wanted it a little softer, so we got a padded top for her side.  It works great.  The mattress does not get hot which is one thing we feared might happen. Even through the humid and hot weather we are now experiencing, the mattress remains cool.  Our former innerspring mattresses were terrible for this.  Having owned innerspring and air mattresses ranging from $800  -  $2000 dollars this mattress is exceeding our expectations not only in price, but comfort and performance.  We strongly recommend this mattress and if you don't like it, Tuft &amp; Needle have great customer service and an industry leading refund policy.  Sincerely, Peter
 I am not sure we are going to keep this mattress. It is not as firm as I had hoped.<br/>I am also using a firmer mattress under it to give more support.
 Mattress delivery was fairly see less considering I live on a 3rd floor walk up apartment. The mattress was left at the bottom of the stairs, and I got a friend to help me carry it up the stairs.<br/><br/>After cutting out of the package, the mattress unrolled nicely and was soon ready for a full nights sleep. I found the expansive sea of foam quite exciting to dive into. The give of the mattress is definitely noticeable but I thought nothing of it since the manufacturers are professionals and seem to be very well regarded in the market place.<br/><br/>After two weeks however, the mattress has just not lived up to expectations. It is too soft, too saggy and offers no lower back support at all. I'm a 26 years old fit make and after sleeping on this mattress for two weeks, I've begun to develop pulsating lower back pain. At this point, I would rather sleep on the floor.
 For one person this is a very comfortable mattress. Weight gets distributed reducing stress points. Provided he/she sleeps towards the center. Towards the edge it feels like a slide. On a queen mattress even the slightest movement by one person feels like an earthquake to the other.
 I wish everything I purchased lived up to the advertisement like this mattress does. I only wish I needed two so I could buy another one! Anything else I say would be redundent.
 Bought a twin sized mattress when I moved across the country ~10 months ago. It came in a box that was easy for moving. I've never had foam mattress before, and this surpassed all my expectations. Whether I put it on the floor or on a platform, I always slept comfortably. I had read some reviews that said, due to the size, it might trap heat- but that has not been my experience at all. The mattress gives plenty of support while still feeling soft and pillowy.
 I did a lot of looking for a new mattress and came accost Tuft and Needle. They have great reviews, so I gave them a try, And so far I'm happy with the mattress, Shipped fast and I had it setup in less than 10 minutes
 Quick and easy to order and receive.  I bought the twin and put it directly on the slatted bed as it didn't sit squarely on the box springs.  It will need to be flipped about once a month to keep it from sagging.<br/>I bought this for my Moms room and she loves it.  It's soft and cosy.  Not a firm mattress if you are looking for that.
 Firm yet conformable with no pressure points. Great mattress for those with back pain. Love this product. Soft feel yet provided solid support. Great value as well.
 Very good company to deal with. Saved me a bunch of money over local stores. Mattress is fine. Highly recommended.
 Was super excited after reading all the great reviews on this mattress.  Night one was not great but we just figured it was just because it was new, night 2 was awful.  It is way too soft and we are sinking so far into it.  Both of us are in pain, worse than with our 12 year old spring mattress(that we thought was bad).
 I was super excited to get this mattress, actually I bought two. After a few nights sleeping on it we have decided we hate it. I feel like the stock of the Amazon ones are the older version that had crappy reviews. I sleep in my primary house with a Tempur Pedic and love it, put these in a second home, so even though it has only been 2 months we are out of the return window. Anyway, terrible if you sleep on your side, hurt shoulders....my back is killing me after 2 nights and longing for my tempurpedic. not sure what i am going to do with this mattress, at least i can roll it up and try and slip it in the trash can easily like when it shipped. real bummer, if you are a tempur pedic lover, this will not work, or maybe it will and mine was the old stock or defective, either way because i ordered through amazon i am out of luck.<br/><br/>Update, I purchased a new Tempurpedic and it is sooooooo much better
 Was disappointed in the quality of this mattress.  It was far too soft and gave me no support.
 I love this mattress! I have never slept on a mattress that gave this much support! My body aches, headaches are gone and my sleep is 100% better!
 I bought this mattress a little over a month ago from Amazon based on its Consumer Reports rating and best buy recommendation, and the glowing Amazon reviews, which are all FAR off the mark! The mattress has two layers of foam consisting of an approximate 8" base layer and 2" top layer. The top layer of foam is too soft, which allows you to sink against the base layer of foam, which might as well be a brick. I am a side sleeper, and this is, hands down, the most uncomfortable mattress I have ever owned... or slept on! My bed time has turned into a horror story, where I toss and turn until my clavicles feel as though they have been pounded, my shoulders are aching, and my spine is screaming in pain... and this is pain I never before had. I can't believe this mattress attained any kind of positive, objective review, especially from side sleepers!!! IT IS TERRIBLE! Oh, and I must not forget to mention, the sides have no added support, so don't even think about sitting on the side of the bed... and be careful getting out of bed, or sleeping too close to the edge, lest you may hit the floor. I WILL BE RETURNING IT... OR TRASHING IT. One Last Note: The ratings this Tuft &amp; Needle mattress received from CR and Amazon are so far off kilter, it leads me to question the veracity of any and all reviews. My trust factor in consumer reviews is now all but gone!
 TOO FIRM<br/>The mattress quality is there, the product is well made. Shipping was excellent- arrived within just a few days. Product arrived tightly coiled and after removing the protective plastic it unrolled and expanded into a bed- pretty cool. Problem is the mattress itself is too firm for myself and my pregnant wife. We have given it about 3 weeks to settle in hoping to get adjusted but I find myself waking up multiple times at night to readjust. My wife is finding herself waking up and sleeping on the coach instead of our new mattress. Understand that I like the company, product, and Amazon service overall- I just can't sleep on this thing.<br/>For those that like a firm mattress or are used to memory foam pillows or beds this is a great product for you- just not for us. Hopefully Amazon will honor the 100 trial period that Tuft &amp; Needle offers from their website otherwise this may be a much bigger issue than I thought.
 After about a month of sleeping on this mattress, I'm experiencing severe lower back pain. The pain started as a dull ache in my thigh around week 3. Towards the end of week 4, the pain spread into my hip and lower back until one Saturday morning when I attempted to get out of bed, I experienced a sensation that felt like getting stabbed in the back. X-rays show no spinal issues (no sciatica) and before the pains started, I was practicing moderate yoga fairly regularly. The money I thought I was saving on this product is now going to visits to an orthopaedic physician, physical therapy and pain killers.
 I think it is a good mattress. Some nights I sleep wonderfully. Other nights my back is killing me. Wonder if it needs a topper. Wish they sold a foundation for this like Casper does for their mattresses. I used the "Purple" foundation and need to retrofit it with more slats.
 Worst mattress ever feels like your laying on the floor. Kept telling myself it would brake in now the return window is done and I want to return it me and wife both can't stand. buying new mattress regardless
 Nicely packaged. Comfortable and easy.<br/>Great way to receive a mattress.
 Very hard dense does not return to original shape very fast ...In fact hip indentation seems permanent...L do not recomend this product
 I am planning to return the product pretty soon. Some review of this mattress portrayed this as a decently firm mattress. Well to my disappointment, this mattress was too soft and no way would fit a back sleeper like me. I have used this mattress only for 2 days now and already feeling the pain.
 I feel like I go into the afterlife every time I go to sleep. I wake up feeling very well-deserved.
 I bought this mattress because of the high reviews.  It arrived in a really nice box and had a high quality look.  For the first month, it was pretty firm, but quickly began to have sections that were sunken.  I turned it, and again, sunken spots formed and remained.  I am 5'6", 130# so my size wasn't a factor.  I replaced my 10 year old tempurpedic with this mattress, which I regret.  I wake up with back pain every morning.
 My back aches but I can't afford anything better. Its comfortable enough. If I had the funds I would just purchase another casper.
 The best mattress we've ever had. That simple. After 50 years of marriage this is it.
 Extremely hot. Would never recommend this mattress.
 We would not recommend this mattress. We have had it six months now and it is sagging terribly.
 This bed is really comfortable so far will be updating in a few weeks. Some reviews talk about a smell with the bed I expirenced the same but it's not as bad as some poeple make it seem and with in less than a week it should be gone or close to gone.
 Shockingly comfortable bed for a really great price.
 This is like the uber of mattresses.  Paying less for a vastly superior product.  We ordered online based on the amazing reviews and were not disappointed.  It was a breeze to set up and is an amazingly comfortable mattress.  Last night was one of the best nights of sleep I had in a long time and my back felt great.  And we didn't have to deal with any pushy mattress salesman.  Highly recommended
 We love the mattress -- not too soft and not too hard.  The only complaint we have is the packaging.  It was in a nice, compact package but unfortunately the wrapping plastic was fused to the mattress cover which tore the mattress cover.
 I got this mattress after reading all the positive reviews..plus I was tired of going to different mattress stores and not finding anything I like. I thought this would help me with my back pain since the company claims that this mattress evenly distributes body weight. While my back pain did not get worse, I developed shoulder aches from sleeping on this mattress. This mattress is too firm and my back and butt seems to sink in while my shoulder, head, and legs are floating on top so I usually wake up with shoulder aches. I got this mattress in full size and sometimes when I sleep on one side of the bed, I noticed that one side of my body seems to be lower than the other so this bed has bad edge support (and it wasn't even that close to the edge). I got this through Amazon and now I'm worried that it will be a hassle returning this 70lb bed...
 Mattress is comfortable and soft. I'm disappointed that I bought 12" mattress but within 3 days became 9.5".
 BEWARE!!! YOU WILL BE LATE TO WORK BECAUSE OF THIS MATTRESS!! This mattress is very comfortable and firm, the good firm. Why spend more $$$ for a Ghost or Casper bed when this mattress is $100-200 less.
 We've had this a week or two and it seems decent. I was hesitant but saw tons of great reviews. It is a little firm, but my wife likes it a lot. There is very little support on the edges.
 These work great for our grandkids.  I wouldnt want to sleep on it though.  The kids do find them comfortable.
 I am amazed by this mattress! I desperately needed a solution to my very restless nights and chronic back pain/spasms. Every morning I wake alert and rejuvenated and am enjoying bedrest I haven't known before! Thank you for a magnificent product! This mattress is awesome!!
 The mattress is okay. I bought one for my guest bedroom and compared to the traditional mattress that I spent $$$ for at a mattress store it doesn't even begin to compare. VERY FIRM! There just is no such thing as a cheap luxury mattress. I honestly expected better for all the hype.
 It is a comfy matress. But arrived with a holes and burn marks in it. Not what we were expecting with something brand new especially when we spent so much on it.
 This mattress is perfect! I was already used to a firm mattress. I had no transition. Slept great from the first night onward.
 Recommended for everybody. From first night, good nite's sleep every night.
 Love the price, unfolds just like the demonstration video and is comfortable.
 Receiving this mattress was a good part of experience. Vacuum package, easy to open, not much smell...<br/>But back pain was not relieved by slipping on this mattress. This mattress is simply too soft. After about a month of sleeping on this mattress I went to nearest mattress store and bought a different, more expensive but firm mattress (I am avoiding to tell brand name - this is not advertising).<br/>Pain gone in two days!<br/>Next, I requested return thorough amazon website and chose UPS drop off - because I have an SUV that big enough and cannot wait whole day at home for freight pick-up. That was a huge mistake! UPS stores rejecting package because of size, no matter how big facility I went to. It was embarrassing to go location by location just to be bounced out to the next one. Finally, ordered home pick-up and i hope this time there will be no problems. Question to Tuft &amp; Needle and Amazon representatives - why this option  - UPS drop off - proposed for mattresses at all? How can you get your customers into such misadventure?
 This was recommended by a friend.  I'm so glad I bought it.  My back and hips are feeling better already.  Great support but has 'give' where I need it.
 My first Amazon review - thought it would be important for some people who may have certain sensitivities to read.  A few years ago I had purchased a memory foam mattress topper from Sam's Wholesale Club.  I have no known allergies, and have always been pretty healthy.  I soon developed a sinus infection followed by migraine headaches and eventually a siren noise in my head.  I did not connect the dots, but eventually realized it was the mattress pad.  It had had a chemical smell when I got it, but I read it needed to be aired out, and that it would be fine.  Sorry this seems long, but it is an important backstory!<br/><br/>Fast forward to last week when I was shopping for a chemically safe mattress.  The organic ones were too expensive for me.  I came across Tuft and Needle's site and chatted with the customer support person about my concerns.  They said something like the mattresses were safe and that I wouldn't have to be concerned - they met some federal safety standard.  The site goes into detail about how their foam is superior . . .<br/>I ordered off of Amazon to make sure it would be here before our weekend company.  Well, when I opened it I quickly noticed a very familiar odor.  I tried to convince myself it was just a new fabric smell or something.  I aired it out for several hours before making it and going to bed.  First I could not believe how hot I was - had to keep flipping to a new location to cool down.  Then I developed painful sinuses, and that siren sound in my head!  Needless to say, it is wrapped in plastic and closed off in a closet waiting for the UPS man on Tuesday.  It has taken the whole day to air the house out.  I am just thankful I knew what was happening right away before getting sicker.<br/><br/>For those who are not sensitive to mattress chemicals . . . it IS a very comfortable bed!  I would have preferred being told to not buy if I had those sensitivities rather than making me feel it was safe.
 Amazing mattress. So comfortable. Unpacking was also a very unique and cool experience.
 I've only used spring mattresses and I had my doubts about foam. The first time laid down on this mattress my back cracked. It supports you but somehow it holds you as well.  The first night was an amazing night rest and after 1 week of use I'm still sleeping better then ever.<br/><br/>Update:  still love this bed!
 Not comfortable. Too hard. Thankfully we were reimbursed fully under the 30 day satisfaction warranty.
 Very good product
 Remember this is firm.
 We’ve been sleeping on this mattress for almost a month now and it’s amazing! Once i fall asleep i stay asleep. Usually i am up half the night tossing and turning. But according to my Fitbit i am out for at least 7 hours straight. That’s a lot for me. Highly recommend this mattress!!!
 Mattress is comfortable as long as you stay in the center.  Sides are weak and lack firmness.  Don't roll to the edge or you may end up on the floor.
 It just feels terrific all over.
 I love this bed! I havent slept so well in so long. And the price is about half of the other beds in a box. I highly recommend.
 I purchased this mattress based on the rave reviews from a coworker.  The reviews on Amazon seemed to support what I'd heard from others. This mattress is just ok, much firmer than what I anticipated, I"m still getting used to it.  I'm currently looking for a good mattress topper hoping​ that will help ease the firmness of the mattress.
 My back problems disappeared, honestly, it's so so inexpensive and sooo comfortable and easy installation. I prefer it over my boyfriend's $3,000 bed! It's firm, yet soft. It doesn't move. It provides my spine and neck support yet, not contours with the curve. Ugh! Love it! The best part is the price, it's a steal.
 Ordering this mattress from Amazon has been a nightmare.  Amazon sent the wrong size mattress; I ordered a twin and received a queen-size mattress.  There were no markings at all on the outside of the box or on the outside of the mattress wrapping, so I couldn't tell until it was opened.  The mattress is compressed, and as soon as the packaging is removed, it starts to expand to its full size.  I stood there, completely baffled, thinking "Wait, this is too big" while literally hearing the air rush in and watching the mattress get bigger.<br/><br/>To get a replacement, I would have to stuff an 80-lb 60"x80"x10" queen-size mattress into a 44" tall, 20" square box, haul it out of the house, get it into the car, bring it to have it shipped, and pay for the shipping.  I have tried folding the mattress, compressing it, rolling it...none of it works. I have no idea how other people have ever managed to return one.<br/><br/>At this point, it looks like I am going to be out the entire cost of the mattress and have one I can't use sitting in the middle of my living room. I just want the thing to be gone. The inconvenience and cost of going to a brick and mortar store looks completely insignificant at this point.  I have never regretted a purchase as much as this.<br/><br/>I debated ordering one for over a year, and out of all the possible things that could go wrong, this wasn't one I imagined!
 suppose to be good for side sleepers, very hard, not comfortable
 I have had this mattress for 60 days now and am still trying to decide how I feel about it. I received it about 4 days before I had back surgery at the end of August,  and I'm still trying to adjust to it. I do like this mattress, but it's a little firmer than I was expecting and still find myself tossing and turning all night long and not getting the sleep I need. Not sure what to do...
 Uncomfortable to sleep on after a few months.
 Super Comfortable, breathes well, and very supportive.
 This mattress is FIRM. According to my husband, it's like sleeping on a pile of bricks. We've had the bed for two days now, and we're both a little sleep deprived from tossing and turning to find a soft spot. We'll wait the recommended 15 days to see if it we can "break in" our respective sides. So far, we're not impressed.
 Easily packaged and shipping was great. Bed isn't as firm as I'd like, but it's a good mattress.
 The mattress is high quality but ended up being a bit too firm for me. The customer service is top of the line and I was able to donate the slightly used mattress. Thank you Tuft and Needle for caring about people and practicing kindness.
 I've never had back issues and since I got this mattress, my back is often stiff when I wake up.
 Exactly as described. Simple to prepare, only took a few minutes to expand but gave it a couple hours. Great sleep since purchasing.
 Amazing bed with superior comfort. If you are looking for a stiff bed to help ease back pain: buy this bed! It has done wonders for the quality of my sleeps. I actually sleep through the whole night now.
 Awesome mattress but had to return cause it didn't work for what I needed. Needed something different for my back issues.
 Like it been about a month seems to be working well. Definitely need to get used to it
 Purchased for our son's guest bedroom ;) - we are thrilled to be sleeping on this wonderful mattress when we visit!
 Love this mattress!  so comfortable
 comfortable bed albeit a bit pricey and nothing said about 100 day trial.
 The mattress is very, very firm.  This was the firm foam mattress I had purchased.  I wish it would have worked out.
 Caused every muscle in my back to tighten up.  It does not really feel too soft or too firm, but it put my back in a position that became painful after a few hours.  I was not able to sleep on this bed for more than a couple of hours.  For reference: I am 5'9", 140lbs.
 One of the main selling points of this mattress is that it keeps you cool. Well, in the summer that is fine. But now that the weather has cooled down this mattress is uncomfortably cold. This mattress draws the heat away from my body and I never feel warm on it.
 LOVE THIS BED really soft but not to soft cool my boyfriend can't feel when I get in or out of bed it's amazing I sleep so well 😄
 I was skeptical about buying a mattress that I couldn't try out before purchasing, but after reading a ton of reviews we decided to give Tuft &amp; Needle a try. With the 100 night sleep trial, we had nothing to lose.<br/><br/>We ordered our mattress on 2/1. It shipped the next day &amp; was delivered on 2/4. We also ordered a new platform bed from Amazon so we wouldn't need box springs. We assembled the new bed &amp; then it was time to open the mattress. We took off all the outside plastic and unrolled on the bed before we cut open the vacuum sealed plastic &amp; the mattress immediately expanded. The process was super easy. Less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Then it was time to finally try out the mattress!! If you push on the surface it feels really soft. My husband was immediately concerned because he as had back surgery and a soft mattress just won't work for us. But when you lay down, it's magically the right mixture of soft &amp; firm! I'm a stomach sleeper and in the past I can always feel extra pressure where my knees, hips and chest meet the mattress, but my weight is so evenly distributed on this mattress that I can't feel any extra pressure on those places. My husband jokes that it feels like the mattress is giving him a hug. He wakes up with no back pain! I haven't slept more than a 3-4 hour stretch in it yet due to my 3 month old, but it feels heavenly when I'm in it!<br/><br/>I know it seems crazy to order a mattress online, but I'm so happy we did!
 I like the fact that once I set up my zines upholstered button tufted premium platform bed then placed my tuft and needle mattress  on top..I never got  up! It's wonderful.
 Plainly put, this is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. I've only ever owned spring mattresses, but this time around I decided I didn't want springs poking my back. I was also on a budget, so when someone sent me a link for a similar mattress, I dug deeper and came across Tuft &amp; Needle. I was immediately sold on the ethos of the company -- the good quality affordable mattress, the cutting out of the unnecessary middle man (who really wants to deal with salespeople anyway?), the fact that T&amp;N donates any mattresses that get returned, etc. Upon receiving my mattress, I was then sold on the full package. I love my T&amp;N. It is the perfect mixture of firm (the bottom layer) and soft (the top layer). I found my mattress comfortable from night one, but after breaking it in for four or five nights, it was even better. I can't imagine wanting it any softer and I'm not even big on firm mattresses. It supports and envelopes at the same time, conforming to your body for the ultimate support. For anyone who receives their T&amp;N and feels it is too firm -- give it a few days. You might love it after it breaks in. If not, know that it will go to someone in need. How awesome is that?!
 started sagging after five months
 Went on sale after buying wouldn't honor new price.
 EXCELLENT MATTRESS, I highly recommend this item. We love it.
 I have had the mattress about a month now. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriends summer place in Vt. I seems to be a quality mattress and very comfortable. My partner really likes it. Still have a few months left on 100 night trial but it appears to be a keeper
 I was skeptical about ordering a mattress online. But after unwrapping it and sleeping on it, it is probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned.
 Excellent purchase. Very comfortable to sleep on. My 5 year old loves sleeping on it and sleeps like a baby!
 Fast delivery, very simple set up. Comfort is great. Excellent value.
 Comfortable, and a very nice night's sleep. Great value.
 I bought a queen a few days ago and I can't tell you how happy I am with it. The first night sleeping on the matress I slept 7 hours straight and the second night 8 hours. I have not slept that long with out waking in years. I am so glad I got this matress. I am here to order 2 more for my kids.
 My wife says she sleeps better on it than the old regular mattress.
 Have had this mattress for about a month now and absolutely love it! It was a little firmer than my liking during the first week but over the past few weeks it softened up. Definitely need two people to open/set up the mattess (we got a king, it was pretty heavy) even though the box looked small and light. I highly suggest this mattress.
 Love this mattress! So comfortable and the perfect firmness! Will be getting another soon. Love the ability to order online and have delivered to my door.
 After extensive reading online we decided to go with Tuft &amp; Needle because it seemed to be the firmest of the online mattresses. I think they must have changed the density of the mattress because it is NOT at all firm. We are very disappointed.<br/><br/>Most importantly though: returning through Amazon is a horrible, horrible experience. We read about Tuft &amp; Needle's amazing return policy where you can get a full refund and donate it, which sounded great. When we went to return through Amazon we realized that they only do UPS pickups. UPS will not give us a window (except 9am to 7pm) as to when they will pick it up. My husband and I both work and I am very confused as to how this is going to work considering we cannot stay at home all day waiting for UPS to come. It is not at all clear how I should have the mattress ready for pickup. I just spoke to Amazon and they said I should have it by the front door. Considering it is on our 4th floor now (possible to carry up with two people when in box, impossible to carry down as one person without box) I don't know what the UPS man is going to do. They said if we miss three days of pickups then we will have to drop off at UPS location.<br/><br/>Buy through Tuft &amp; Needle and not Amazon because of the Return policy.
 Super comfortable.  They are not squishy like memory foam, just soft, but still firm.
 Not fully king size. Hot.  Mushy
 Most comfortable mattress I've ever owned.
 No firm enough for us:( We returned it.
 Very happy with this mattress. It replaced my old (27 years) regular mattress.  Big difference.
 I thought I am buying a good product for the price they were asking but it's a terrible product.<br/>I hate the back pain because of this mattress!!!
 This mattress is unfortunately much too firm.  I am 24yrs and of an average size but it's extremely hard on my joints :( I've been waking up sore each day and toss and turn through the night.  Perhaps with a topper it would improve but I'm hoping to find a mattress that doesn't require one. Great service and delivery nonetheless. Off to try the Leesa...
 I love this mattress. When I visit relatives and sleep on their beds I literally can't wait to come back home and sleep on this.
 We have been sleeping on our new Tuft and Needle Bed for about 2 months now.  First off I was unhappy to learn shortly after I ordered that since I ordered through Amazon I was not able to return after a 100 day trial like advertised..<br/><br/>The mattress showed up and was easy to open and set up.  The first month was great but shortly into the second month my back and shoulders started to slowly feel pain... as of now I wake up with shooting pains in my back and neck and as of last night probably got zero sleep..<br/><br/>I like to do lots of research before I make big purchases and I thought this was a safe bet.  Now it seems we cannot return the bed (even though we are within theasy companies 100 day policy) and as everyone else before me has said I'll probably have to go spend another couple hundred on a mattress topper so I get some sleep.<br/><br/>My husband has been fine with it but he could sleep on the floor and have no problems.  I am a side a stomach sleeper and this bed is about killing me.  Wish Tuft and Needle would listen to what we as consumers are saying.  I had such high hopes for this bed, and I'm so let down by the outcome...  I am 28 years old and a ex college athlete in fantastic shape, I should not feel 70 when I wake up...
 Soft but very supportive. Superior to a spring mattress.
 I never write reviews on Amazon but I felt compelled too for this product. This matress has exceeded my expectations, I am a side/stomach sleeper and I'm surprised by how comfortable it is. Not too firm at all. If you are on the fence about ordering a matress online, get over it. This matress rocks.
 3.7/5 it is too soft when sitting on it but is good to lie on.  I'm 5'6" 125lbs. I'm concerned it may not hold up well over time.  I have a Costco brand foam mattress for 9 years that has held up well. Prior to that I had 3 mattresses in 5 years.
 Still not sure anout this bed. Its a little to soft. Ive had it 2 months now. I'll give it 3 more weeks before I decide to keep it or send it back. Still better than my old conventional mattress.
 This mattress is fine, but not great. Unfortunately, it took me too long to realize this; now I’m waking up sore and stiff on a regular basis.
 Not comfortable.  Too rigid.  Did I get a return or factory second?  Nothing like I expected.
 Wow, who knew great things could come in small boxes!
 Great mattress. For the price, probably the best foam mattress you can buy. The feel is Med Firm. If you know how to cook a steak then i would say it is (medium rare) but no blood. We have it on top of a box frame and bed frame with slats. I prefer it on a flat surface so my side has 1/4 inch cardboard under it. made it little firm like (medium done steak). The bed feels very cool which is awesome. Construction is on par with any high quality foam mattress.<br/>We would buy it again.
 Very good mattress, fits our lifestyle nicely.
 Excellent mattress.  Bought a second one after trying the first one and loving it.
 For all the issues I have: Lupus, Fibromyalgia, PsA etc., this mattress has been the best yet.  I had to return another (Saatva) because it is absolutely not for edge sleepers.  I do need to rotate this about every two weeks due to my edge sleeping.  It caves a little on the side over a two week period but not too bad.  Occasionally, my arms and hands will still fall to sleep and that’s annoying.  But at least I don’t dread going to bed at night.<br/><br/>I started out with a Latex topper (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UYGA49M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) that was expensive and so awful to sleep on.  I’d researched and that was the recommendation for people with my health issues.  But, I was simply swallowed and unable to turn with the ease that you should during the night.  I’m going to try it on my RV queen size bed and see how it works there.  And btw, “Sleep On Latex” doesn’t allow you to write a review after your return window closes and I find that a bit deceptive.  At any rate, I’ve slept much better without it on the Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress.  However, because I’m in a pretty bad flare right now, I’m going to try another (Lucid 3”) to see if this might help with some of the more severe joint pain.<br/><br/>One last thing about Tuft &amp; Needle?  They have FANTASTIC customer service!
 I bought this for myself. Then bought one for my wife. Good sleep starts with separate bedrooms! Neighbors on both sides of us have recently purchased them as well. I would never own another conventional coil mattress!
 This was best money spent. Plus local company with good return policy.
 So comfortable! It is not soft, nor firm. Just right for my wife and I!
 Ok so I have had this mattress since December and I LOVE it!!!<br/>I have it in a slate bed frame and it is amazing!<br/>Love that I can unzip the white cover and wash it.<br/>Super soft enough for me. My sister is actually jealous.
 After getting used to the firmness of it, compared to our previous mattress, we love it! I'm not sure I notice a whole lot cooler feeling, but it is comfortable and after also getting new pillows my neck and back feels so much better. Plus you can't beat a mattress delivered to your door in a box!
 super comfortable and great craftsmanship, super easy assembly, thoroughly packaged.
 Enjoying these mattresses... thanks
 An amazingly simple, elegant, and supportive mattress. Definitely the Just Right blend of firmness and huginess. Quality fit and finish. No smell! Carefully packaged. It's going to make your old mattress seem, well, old....
 Great mattress for my guest bed.
 Great mattress. Very comfortable!
 EXTREMELY FIRM. Very little cushion. Comfortable to sit on, but sleeping on it is extremely uncomfortable. I weigh 140 lbs so I should feel some cushion. I wake up constantly throughout the night, in the morning my back is sore and stiff. Not worth the trouble to return, purchasing a mattress topper and hoping that helps. I'm used to sleeping on a pillowtop mattress and thought I'd be okay with foam, but clearly this is not the mattress for me.
 I have purchased alot mattresses in my life. From cheap to very expensive gel/foam type mattresses. This mattress was perfect!! Not too firm not too soft. For the price I paid I was very sceptical, but I was wrong. You can't beat the price. We love it!!
 Love it! Not too hard or too soft works great.
 Best mattress purchase I have ever made. My fiancee and I have both bought mattresses over $1200 and will never do that again! This mattress meets all of our needs with an unbelievable price and is delivered right to your door!!
 Great bed for the money!
 great sleep
 Best mattress ever!
 Greatest purchase ever!
 just wish it was thicker
 This is one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. If you're looking for a new bed, get this one!
 This bed was too firm for me.
 Had this bed for 6 months and absolutely love it.  I will never buy a bed from a retail store ever again.
 I love the matress, the wife doesn’t. She thinks it’s too firm. Not sure if keeping it.
 Lived up to all of our expectations.
 The mattress was first delivered the day after getting a rib contusion playing basketball. I had a sore back and the bed was just too stiff for me. The injury was bad enough that I couldn't sleep due to the discomfort and had to switch to my older queen bed spring mattress with medium firmness. After a week I was able to sleep comfortably in the older queen but couldn't seem to comfortably transition to the T&amp;N mattress.<br/><br/>I no longer have any lingering symptoms from my basketball injury but have noticed my sleep seems to be more restless on the T&amp;N mattress due to it's firmness. I have a FitBit Charge HR that tracks my sleeping patterns and I sleep on average 15% less on the T&amp;N mattress with 2-3 more restless periods per night.<br/><br/>Contemplating returning the mattress at this point as it's too stiff for me.
 Best Night Sleep.
 Just as expected. It's like jiffy pop, as much to make as it is to sleep on.  Did I just date myself?
 hard, I will return it today!
 I believe you still need a box spring for this mattress. It's not a super comfortable as advertised, the mattress can stand to add a few more inches.
 Awesome!
 Great mattress. My 2 year old sleeps well on it.
 Too firm for me, have to roll over all night long.
 good
 I'm in love with my new bed. I've slept on memory foam mattresses before and they've always been too hot, but even in July I never have that problem with this mattress.
 Verry stiff had to put on a two inch foam hurt my back.
 My husband likes it but I hate it. Ordered a medium firmness and I feel like I slept on the hardwood floor, had to go to another bedroom in the middle of the night to get some rest. Wonder if putting on a mattress topper would help???
 Great mattress and firm enough to make the back feel so good.
 This was painful and I just about sleep on anything. Being a mini nomad, I've slept on many things. Firm beds, squishy beds, floor, couch, a sweater on the floor, a pillow on the floor, and an airmatress for half a month. No problems ever. I'm athletic, young, and have no back problems even when I sleep in unoptimal places. I went to a showroom to test out T&amp;N and it felt soft and no issues, and because my sleep needs are pretty much none, I thought this was a great idea and a bargain.<br/><br/> But one night on T&amp;N and I woke up in pain. Read reviews that people even needed pain killers and I thought, ok no that's not that bad. By night 3, I'm tempted to go the pain killer route. I'll sleep in any position and I still couldn't find one that didn't hurt.<br/><br/>To describe the feeling would be best using the commercials for these recent mattresses.. But then you flip it reverse. It has the WORST of soft and firm mattress. It is soft and sinks in where you're heaviest where I woke up feeling stuck (110lbs) yet super firm on my shoulders and joints. Isn't it supposed to be the opposite? I'm not using a mattress pad because I read that it'll ironically make it worst and more firm.<br/><br/>When I unrolled the package, it also inflated instantly on one side... Seemed like it was pierced already. I really really really wanted to like this mattress, but for someone who lined sleeping on anything, any bed, any car, any floor, this is the first thing EVER that I couldn't sleep on.
 A BIT TO FIRM. WE WENT WITH CASPER BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE SOFTER BUT STILL ON THE FIRM SIDE. WATCH THE COMPARISON VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.
 Incredible mattress.  Can’t beat the price
 So I've had this bed now for 6 months. It started out nice but has since turned out to be a very hard and uncomfortable mattress. I constantly wake up with shoulder pain or a numb arm. It's definitely not for a side sleeper. I don't know what has happened because it started out nice. I guess I'm SOL until I get a new bed.
 didnt work for us but great return policy
 I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a month. It is much firmer than I like. The mattress does nothing for heat. I would almost say it is warmer. However, if you like a firm mattress and heat is not a problem for you this would be a great mattress.
 DO NOT BUY THIS ON AMAZON!!  SUPER HOT MATTRESS WITH HORRIBLE WARRANTY!  I will never buy a mattress online again.  If you like being very hot at night, this mattress will be great for you.  I normally am a person who sleeps with 3 blankets.  I was always cold at night.  NOT anymore though....  This mattress is too HOT.  My husband is burning up at night too.  I have not had a good nights sleep since it arrived.  If you are going to buy this mattress, do NOT'BUY IT ON AMAZON!!  You only get a 30 day warranty and have to somehow re-box it up and send it back for a refund!!  If you buy through T&amp;N you get a 100 day warranty and you do not have to re-box it!  I feel cheated $600.
 I wanted to love this mattress. Unfortunately, it ended up not being supportive enough for my body. I've had consistent back pain on this mattress. For some, it might be a great fit, but my body doesn't agree with it.
 In summary, this mattress had too much give/not enough support, and we ended up returning it toward the end of the 30-day trial period.  We ordered the California King, and I was surprised at the lack of proper support given the other reviews stating how firm the mattress was, but perhaps the 2015 version has changed somewhat.  The mattress isn't soft in any way (there's a difference between hardness and support), and there's never a "wow" moment of comfort when laying down on it.  I was ok with this assuming it was going to provide proper support, but I immediately noticed a "hammock" type effect where after lying down for any amount of time (back sleeper), the lighter parts of your body (arms, legs, shoulders, head) are being pushed up in an unnatural manner relative to your heavier parts (torso).  This causes pain in those areas and after a few weeks hoping it would get better, we decided to continue our mattress search elsewhere.  If you are particularly small/light, this issue may not manifest as much; however my wife is fairly small and she echoed my sentiments.  In the end it was worth trying out but just not comfortable enough for a long-term solution.<br/><br/>A note on returns:  I bought this through Amazon and not T&amp;N.  Obviously you can't return this to Amazon in it's original packaging because of the expanded size after opening.  The returns department didn't grasp that fact initially but eventually sent me to the large items department and they sent a 3rd party shipping company to take it away, presumably to a charity.  This was still a bit of a hassle because the rep kept insisting I needed to wrap it in some way in preparation for shipping, not understanding this mattress was as large as my hallway.  Eventually he got the picture and stated he would have the shipping company bring plastic to wrap it for shipping.  When the return shipper arrived this morning, he was alone in a small van, dropped the mattress in the mud, and eventually had to enlist my wife's help to get it squeezed into his vehicle.  All in all not a good return experience.  Your mileage may vary, but perhaps you would have better luck with the trial return if purchased through the manufacturer directly.
 Love this!
 When I die bury me in a tuft and needle coffin so I can truly rest in peace.
 Mattress and pillow reviews are so subjective given everyone's personal preferences, medical needs, etc, so please take this with a grain of salt. For me, I have many back problems and am a side-sleeper. This bed was incredibly hard and caused my chronic pain, which had me rolling around all night. I slept with this for almost four months to really try it out, but I'm completely exhausted and in pain. I'm giving up.
 I wanted to give this mattress one star, but this isn't entirely the products fault and honestly besides the way it feels to sleep on everything else in the purchasing experience was five stars.<br/><br/>Price is great, delivery is amazing, customer service was awesome but in the end its still a really stiff mattress and I dread sleeping on it.<br/><br/>This thing is so firm, if you are a side sleeper you'll likely hate it. I'm 6' / 170lbs / broad shoulders and I wake up with them aching. Its been a week and I had to return it, I don't even enjoy sleeping right now.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why there is such fanfare for this mattress, maybe I need an ultra plush mattress... I'm a backpacker and have slept on just about the worst beds in the world at cheap hostels etc and I'd put this bed up there in that category its like sleeping on a yoga mat.
 I sleep like a baby and anyone who sleeps over has agreed
 Took me about 14 days to get used to its firmness but now I love, love, love it.<br/>Best sleep I've had in a long time.
 I don't like the softness.  It looks and feels saggy.  I bought it in April and within 6 months it was to soft.
 Had my doubts about a bed in a box. Sounded weird. But as an old lady needing a new bed, thought its guarenteed why not? It arrived faster than I thought it would. This is day two. Its everything that was advertised. Hadn't really bought a bed in years so didn't know about foam etc. Very comfortable. I like a soft mattress but this isn't mushy. I'm throwing the box away tomorrow. This is not going back!
 I have terrible dust allergies and this mattress has neutralized them thus far. The mattress retains shape quickly and is incredibly comfortable. Invest in yourself! Be comfortable! Buy this mattress!
 A++
 Wonderful!!
 Best mattress I've ever owned. Great company. They are understated on quality.
 It surprises my husband and I; the number of 5 star reviews.  The first night the mattress was so hard that I had to go into another room to sleep.  By 3:00 am my shoulders and ribcage ached.  As sleepopolis said, you do sleep on the top of the mattress and that does keep you cooler.  However, you could sleep on the floor with the same result.  Admittedly, I exaggerate, slghtly.  It is not as hard as the floor.  We are using our Jamison box spring so I know it has proper support.  My  husband made it the whole night but woke up to back pain and shoulder pain.  Last night we put a 2" latex topper on it that we had purchased for our aging Jamison.  That made a huge difference.  But here is the thing....should you buy a new mattress that you then have to add a topper to make it comfortable?  I really don't think so at any price point.  We will be calling to return it.  If you like a really hard bed, with very little top cushioning, this bed is for you.
 Absolutely love our new bed so comfortable
 SUPERRRRRR firm, I Loved it , but my husband could not handle it . it def holds your weight, but if you like a soft squeeshy bed, this is NOT FOR YOU. But this is a great bed for the price !!
 The bed is too firm. My buddy has the same but his is not nearly as hard. I've had the bed for roughly three weeks. I called T&amp;N and they said they could not help me because I bought it from Amazon.
 Great mattress! I didn't realize how much I needed a new mattress for better sleep. I now sleep like a baby. I live in a tiny loft so the box delivery was awesome.
 Tuft and Needle mattresses was everything advertised and more. The ease of ordering, delivery and the setup could not have been easier. I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the best of the best in a mattress.
 I thought it was too soft. Get the bed in a box that Costco sells
 Sleeps so hot. Had to return
 Love this company and their mattress! Great customer service. I'm very very happy with my purchase.
 This mattress held up for only about 6 months before we had to replace it with a Stearns and Foster.  This may be fine for skinny people or kids, but the entire edge collapsed and I had to tuck a pillow under me along the outside to prevent myself falling out of bed.  A total waste of time and money.
 Love it, gets better with time. One star missing bc I wish it was just a little softer and the sheets don't fit on it well
 Great mattress, great service
 I just this month purchased a Queen sized T&amp;N mattress. I am in heaven!<br/><br/>I was sleeping on an old spring mattress and box spring bed, I knew it was time to get a new one...but you know, one procrastinates... I was at Costco and they were selling Temperpedic mattresses. They were less expensive then some, but still about $1500. I considered...but  needed to research. My research showed that memory foam mattresses sleep hot. I live in the California desert. In the summer,  hot does not begin to explain. So that was nixed instantly. My research then lead me to Tuft &amp; Needle.  Oddly enough, my friend was telling me about the new mattress  she and her husband were getting for their move to Maui ( I know, I hate her!) They live in San Francisco at present, and T&amp;N have a brick and mortar store there.  They were sold on how comfortable it was.  Now my wheels were really spinning.  I trust her. Also, this mattress was less than half the price of the Temperpedic and did not sleep hot! I then was able to justify buying a new platform bed, because I was saving so much, and wanted a whole new look too! When it came, everything was so easy. I had a small issue getting the bed out of the box, but that was because the bonehead furniture delivery guy had broken the seal on the shrink wrapped mattress (it comes looking much smaller, but then, like sea monkeys, gets big!) he said it was not a queen, but a twin and put it back in the box. Once you break the seal it begins to open, so that was happening in the box, therefore making it hard to get out. This allowed me to deal with T&amp;N's famous customer service!  They are easy to get hold of on the phone or even through their website on a live chat (which is what happened) They were so nice and patient.  This issue wasn't even their fault or problem, but they still followed up with me by calling me on the phone, making sure that my experience was positive and even taking the initiative to send me a small refund for my problems. That was ABOVE AND BEYOND. I was duly impressed.<br/>For the first week, it was a bit of an adjustment, as I was used to my old bed with a memory foam topper on it. This wasn't mushy like that was. I would say that it is firm, but in the best way.  After a week, I was waking up so comfortable it was truly tough to get out of bed! Every night I get excited to go to sleep. I am so grateful that I have this.  I have rheumatoid arthritis pretty bad, and this has been really helpful for aches and pains. For the last couple years on my old mattress, I was unable to side sleep, as I would wake up sore and immobilized somewhat in my neck.  Now with the T&amp;N every position is comfortable. No joke!  It's like every pressure point is met. I am worried about travelling now, cause how will I sleep on any other mattress like...EVER????!<br/>I did not purchase through Amazon, but through their website. Still, I had to leave a review to let you know that if you are thinking about buying a new mattress, you must consider Tuft &amp; Needle. MUST.<br/>BEST IN SHOW.<br/><br/>Update: I purchased a second queen for my guest bedroom, and have been sleeping on that one too, cause the guest bedroom is cooler in the summertime. Only thing better than having a T&amp;N mattress is having TWO!
 Very comfortable.
 I bought the mattress b/c of the nice review on Amazon.<br/>The first 3 months are ok, starting in Jan both my wife and I had back pain issues.  We initially thought it was the long drive or long sit from office work, but couldn't  figure out why it started almost same time.<br/>Until few weeks before I woke up in the morning realizing i am trying hard to hang on the edge of the mattress unconsciously.  If you sleep alone or tend to sleep towards the center of bed, this doesn't affect you much.  The material used for memory foam make it easier to slip off the edge if you get really close. After realizing that I tried to stay away from the edge and my back starts to feel better.
 WAY TOO HEAVY !!!! Dont order if you don't have help or mind a hernia or disc herniation. If you are single forget it. It moves too much so even if you got help to get it on the box springs (did it myself but still have back pain) you have to constantly move it back into place. Really comfortable when you are recovering from your injuries but WAY WAY too heavy
 Best night sleep i've have had in a long time! Thanks T&amp;N!
 I ended up developing rashes in multiple locations on my body which continued to get worse until I stopped sleeping on the bed. I've never reacted to any type of foam in the past (memory foam bed toppers, couches, etc)--so this was very unusual.
 Nice, I wonder if IKEA beats these guys
 The company claims that their mattress is not too soft and not too hard. Well, I tend to disagree. I can't imagine how it can get much harder than sleeping on the floor. In fact, I've probably slept just as better on the floor. I really wanted to love this mattress but now I'm unfortunately subjected, for now, to my 10 year old inner-spring bed which I despise because it's uneven, but I still sleep better on it.<br/><br/>They recommend a topper you can buy through Amazon for $60, but I'm just willing to do that given that this is a $600 mattress. The thing is, $600 may or may not be a fair price, who are we as a consumer to know? Their material is proprietary from what I understand, so there's no legitimate way to compare it to another mattress. You can buy cheaper mattresses that are more comfortable.<br/><br/>I gave it a fair chance, I just don't think most people will be comfortable with a mattress this firm.
 Awesome
 way to firm, gives me a backache. also their claim of cool sleeping is bogus, unless I keep the room freezing I wake up in a puddle
 Bought this for our 25 year old son. He says it is the most comfortable bed he has ever had...
 I did a TON of research before buying this mattress.  Until I purchased this mattress, I thought I like a firm one.  This one, though is FIRM.  We gave it 5 days and then ordered the 2.5" Lucid® by LinenSpa Gel Infused Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper.  This was an extra $180 that I hadn't anticipated spending, but it made all the difference in making the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress comfortable.  Here's the full review I did on my blog:<br/>http://www.bluejeansandturquoise.com/2015/05/there-are-times-tuft-and-needle-review.html
 Literally the best mattress I've ever had. No other way to put it.
 I purchased this mattress a year ago, and if you would have asked me a week ago if I liked this mattress I would have said yes. However, after spending the first 7 minutes of my day (yesterday) on the floor trying to get up... I have changed my opinion. This bed looses its firmness after a while and eventually becomes useless to point to where it can injure you. I had to see chiropractor to get my mobility back. I also tested out sleeping on different surfaces through out my home, and none of them twisted up my back like this bed. So, long story short if you have back problems or value your hard earn money, avoid this bed.
 Love it!!
 Was terrible with shipping. Took two weeks and needed to get a replacement and was charged twice. But it is very comfy and was worth the wait.
 comfy
 Does have an odor, retains heat,and already appears to have some body indentation after a month.  Cannot say I would purchase from this manufacture again.
 It is a bit softer than I had hoped, and less supportive than I'd like. This is understandable for a mattress that is designed for "everyone."
 Absolutely the best sleep you can buy at a price that simply can't be beat. Will eventually have the Tuft &amp; Needle on all of our beds.
 So far we like it still breaking it in.
 Best matress we've ever laid on. Easy to fall asleep on but hard to wake up because it's so comfy!
 This mattress is very soft, good for anyone that likes a soft mattress. My back hurts more since I started sleeping on it.
 I love this bed. It sleeps fantastic.
 Not sure why people like this mattress. Probably the worst quality sleep even compared to nova mattress from over 10 years ago. Way too soft top layer that immediately feels like hitting a brick once bottomed out. Feels like my hips are sinking while the rest of my body is being lifted off
 This is the worst mattress I have ever slept on.  I weigh 202 pounds and the right side of the mattress collapses under my weight and feels like a marshmallow.  The left side is a little firmer but also collapses some what and then there is a large firm hump in the middle.  It feels like a hill in the middle of the mattress which would be the correct firmness if it were throughout the mattress.  I would like to return the mattress for either a refund or another mattress as I assume this one is defective.  I can't imagine anyone receiving a mattress like this and keeping and/or liking it!  Now I have to figure out how to return the mattress now that it has expanded to it's full king size mattress size!?
 Awesome mattress. Very comfortable and I bought this mattress because I was having lower back issues and it helped tremendously.
 Kills mine and my wife's lower back and mid spine area every night because of its ultra firmness.  Unless you weight 500 pounds there's really not much contour.
 Great mattress
 Great bed!!
 A few concerns first:<br/>1) According to everything I'd read, this mattress wasn't supposed to off gas or have a smell. I was sooooo excited to find a mattress in my price range, with great reviews, that wouldn't offgas. I'd put off buying a new mattress for YEARS because I'm very sensitive to chemicals and offgassing makes me sick. For instance, I didn't go in the room with my couch for 6 months because it was offgassing. The mattress isn't bad but it is for sure offgassing, for anyone who's worried about that. A bit disappointing.<br/>2) My bed and box spring are California King. I ordered a California King. It's too narrow on the sides and too long on the foot. My expensive California King sheets don't fit. Yes, we tried turning it, just in case it was user error. It wasn't.<br/><br/>But...<br/>This is BY FAR the most comfortable mattress I've ever bought. Both my husband and I laid on it and said, "Oh, WOW!" I love it! I just wish it wasn't doing its slight offgassing and was the correct size.
 Product came in great shape. No damage. Turned out that it was just too firm for what I was looking for.
 Way way wayyy too firm!!! My carpet floor is more comfortable than this. I can't believe there are so many 5 star reviews. I've tried and tried to convince myself that this thing is soft and comfortable but it's unbelievably firm!! If you like your mattress this firm just go ahead and save your money and sleep on the floor
 Best investment ever.  All the perks of Tempur-Pedic without the crazy price!<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this mattress!
 After long search and based on the CR review, I decided to buy the T&amp;N mattress twin.  It was a big mistake.  I should have tried a less expensive one from other stores.  It is firm NOT medium firm.  I weight around 192lbs.  I usually sleep either on side or on the back.  I feel pressure points which wake me several times during night to change position.  The only positive thing which was was highlighted in CR review, it is not as hot as other mattresses.  Now that I opened and used it for 3 days, I am wondering how I can pack it back in its original box and return it.  I am not impressed.  Unfortunately Costco has not twin memory foam mattresses (Novaform 14").
 Love this mattress
 Love this mattress
 Best mattress ever!!!, I been had my lower back pain for 15 years, and sleep on this mattress for 2 days, it's gone!!!
 Buy it if you like sleeping on a rock. Also they want you to pay for return
 We couldn't be happier 👍🤗
 This is the 2nd T&amp;N bed we have ordered!  Love them
 It has just the right amount of bounce if you know I mean (wink wink).<br/>Anyways, on a serious note, this is a great mattress. It expands to the full size pretty quickly in about a few hours. I find it very comfortable as I am prone to having back pains. In the summer, the top of the mattress remains relatively cool.
 So far, so good. Will update in a few weeks!
 The mattress was softer than I expected.  Quality is good, but not giving me the support I had hoped it would.
 Loveeeeeee it
 Very comfy and high quality.  U won't regret it
 Extremely happy with this purchase.
 This mattress gets better the longer you sleep on it. Everything that was said about this mattress is true.
 I purchased a Tuft and neddle mattress 2 years ago and I swore by their quality and their comfort. This past week I decided to purchase one for the guest bedroom and I was highly disappointed. It was good at first but got very uncomfortable during the night and felt like I was sleeping on a highly plush mattress. I woke up in pain the next day. As much as i was excited about the new mattress,I had to return it. I couldn't put my guests thru the pain.
 Ouch... I wanted to love this mattress but it's just not for me. My body is so sore when I make up in the mornings. I'm a side sleeper and I have been waking up with numb arms and hands. I feel like I was hit by a truck.  Honestly, it's far too firm. I almost think something is wrong with it. So bummed.
 Comfy
 After reading all the positive reviews and answered questions, we ordered this mattress but, unfortunately, after sleeping on it for a week I cannot recommend it.  I am a fit, 57 year old that hasn't had a good night's sleep in over a week.  The mattress has no give in the hip area where I need it most and I've awakened with soreness every day since we started sleeping on it.  Yes, we've made sure the zipper side is on the bottom and, yes, we've tried to soften that particular area of the mattress by working it with our hands.  Now I'm faced with having to send it back and have received no instructions as to how I'm supposed to box it up for UPS pickup.  Can the the seller please provide us with the information we need?
 Amazing company, amazing standards, amazing product.  You won't be disappointed.
 Great bed so far just got it but its everything I wanted in a bed.
 So comfy.  I absolutely love it!  The perfect mattress.
 Exceptional Quality, Unbeatable price
 Extremely comfortable. Better than I had hoped.
 Seriously, stop obsessing over reading reviews and buy this mattress. It is a great decision. I promise.
 Update: Still very unhappy with this purchase, I ended up ordering a "Loom and Leaf" in medium firmness which is professionally set up (not delivered in a box) and the quality is much better. The "Loom amd Leaf" is comparable with my Tempurpedic Contour Elite. Still stuck with this rock for guests... maybe it will keep them from staying long.<br/><br/>Does not compare to my tempurpedic (which is medium-firm). This was purchased for my son but I slept on it several times hoping to love it. It is very firm with almost no give. I prefer a firmer mattress but this is like a piece of concrete. It appears to be good quality but very thin and hard.
 I switched from a pillow-top mattress that was old and needed replaced. Sleeping on this new one seems very hard to me almost like sleeping on the floor. I guess I'm just used to the pillow top and now I'm forced to order a down-filled mattress topper. Hopefully that works out.
 Love it!
 Easy, comfy, affordable
 Heaven. The package came directly to my apartment lobby. Just had to drag it to the elevator, then down the hall. It's one of the most comfortable mattresses I've slept on. I use it on a wire/mesh bed frame, and it doesn't feel safe to step on. If it was on the floor or on a board it would probably be more ideal.<br/><br/>PS I like firm beds, so if you love really soft stuff, this might not be for you. It's also not springy as it is memory foam.<br/><br/>Also, I put a bed bug/dust mite/waterproof sheet over the mattress, and it is not breathable at all. All the heat/sweat accumulates at the top. I didn't have this problem with the sheet off though.
 I have tried this mattress at a friend's house. I was very pleasantly surprised how supportive, and firm it was. After I had purchased my current mattress it turned out that the company does in fact make changes to their product. Hence the feel was no longer the same, not quite as firm.
 UPDATED REVIEW<br/><br/>I wish I could separate my review between the company and the mattress itself.  Due to their amazing customer service, I think Tuft and Needle is worth a shot, but save yourself a headache and just order direct from their website.<br/><br/>Company/Service = 5 Stars<br/>The Tuft and Needle website states that you get 100 night free trial, but note that is only if you buy it from their site directly.  If you purchase from Amazon, you only get the 30 day amazon return.  Unfortunately the bed did not work out for me, and I ordered from Amazon.  However Luckily Tuft and Needle has amazing customer service, and after reaching out to them, they agreed to honor the 100 night trial from the website.  The return was incredibly easy, and I even received a hand-written note expressing their gratitude for trying the bed.  Very rare that you get that kind of customer service these days.<br/><br/>Mattress = 2 Stars<br/>The mattress itself is probably best suited for people in their 20's and early 30's who have yet to spend enough time in their desk job to develop back problems.  Personally I have back problems sleeping at night unless I have a very firm mattress boarding on a futon.  Unfortunately this bed was too soft for me, and within a month I was rotating (not flipping) in order to sleep.  In the end I was on the floor.  Still I think for most people who are still young, this mattress is a great value for the money, and wish it had been available for me when I was looking for a decent mattress out of college.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>PREVIOUS REVIEW:<br/><br/>If you read the reviews here, you can see that everyone has different reactions to this bed in regards to it's firmness, some saying too firm, some saying not firm firm enough.  That should tell you that your body will have it's own reaction to the bed.  If you are going to try this bed, please do not order it from amazon.  Tuft and Needle is using Amazon as a scam because 30 days is simply not enough time to know how this bed will work for you.<br/><br/>I saw the 100 night trial adds, I even went to the store to talk with Tuft and Needle representatives.  Read reviews on websites.  All stated there was a 100 night trail.  Personally I wasn't really that impressed with the store model, but if there was a 100 night trial, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  I was very, very wrong.  It turns out that 100 nights is only honored if you buy from Tuft and Needle website.  The Tuft and Needle representatives don't tell you this at the store.  They only tell you this in a FAQ on their website.  I didn't read the FAQ, because I went to the store.  I am 2 weeks past the return day, and I having to sleep on my floor with a thermarest.  In the end giving Tuft and Needle a try has hurt a lot.<br/><br/>My personal experience with this mattress is that it is no where near what I would consider firm.  There was never a night where it felt truly comfortable.  But I know it can take your body a couple of months to adjust to a new mattress (note that a couple of months falls outside of the return policy if you buy this on Amazon).  Over the past two weeks I have been gradually waking up in more and more pain.  I have tried sleeping on my back, my side, my stomach.  All result in back pain now.  The last 2 nights I have not been able to even fall asleep, and am currently sleeping on the floor with my thermarest, which is now more firm than this mattress.
 I do not like this mattress
 Excellent product!
 This is truly a God tier bed.
 Perfect mattress
 A great buy for the money.  Extremely comfortable.
 It's just simply wonderful.  It's not the super soft kind of mattress but it works just fine for me.  I kind of miss my mattress every time I went on a over night trip elsewhere.  I'm now searching for a good pillow that's as good as this mattress I have
 First of all, the price is legit-ski. I'm talkin' divine quality mattress, at a human price point. Look, I tried other mattresses, even my baby boo's Tempur-pedic and it doesn't compare. I'm also in love with your transparent pricing, so much so, I want to marry it. I can't even! When it comes to obscene mark-ups, due to lack of market competition. Tuft &amp; Neddle is a serious strike toward fair market pricing. It's the American dream you can sleep on! Could this get any better? Yes! I'm not even done. My mattress aka "Love Cloud", was shipped straight to my face, within days. Easy to transport and hecka-easy to setup. I sleep better than I ever have, in the sum total of my foolish life! In conclusion: great sleep at a fair price, + customer consideration and service that's off the chizzy = me telling everyone I know about Tuft &amp; Needle AND showing them pictures. I wish you sold t-shirts and had an instagram account, so I could rep you hardcore and follow your every move! 10 outa’ 10~!
 This mattress is like sleeping on a piece of plywood. My back to hurting from sleeping on this thing. Cant send it back.....how can I stuff it back in the box? Will never buy anything from the company again
 Easy set-up and very comfortable.
 We had to carry this up two flights of stairs and it is heavy and awkward.  But when when unpackaged it, it popped right up into a mattress.  It appeared to be ready to sleep on.  A very comfortable mattress.  I'd say 7.5 out of 10 in firmness.  It definitely conforms to your body, and is not heat reflecting.  A keeper.
 Can I return  this? On website it says that you can have a 100 day trial.. wake up sire every day
 The reviews don't lie!
 Been sleeping on it for 3 months now.  Love it.  Nice and firm, but still more giving than a traditional mattress.  For example, as a side sleeper, your arm can still kind of 'sink in', while the rest of your body is still supported firmly and you don't feel saggy or mushy.  My girlfriend and I both sleep soundly on it.<br/><br/>You don't get any 'feedback' during sex like a traditional mattress though.  If you are used to a traditional for sex you'll notice this, but we can deal w/that.
 WELL ACTUALLY i LOVE THE WHOLE IDEA BUT THE MATTRESS WAS WAY SOFTER WITH MUCH MORE GIVE THAN ANTICIPATED AND JUST WON'T WORK FOR US.  oNE OF US HAS PHYSICAL DISABILITES AND CANNOT BE MOVED EASILY WITH THE GIVE OF THE MATTRESS...SO WE'RE DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO RETURN IT
 We have been using this mattress for 7 months and would like to provide some feedback on it.  It was good at the beginning and we were really enjoy it at the first three months.  But everything goes down since last December.  My wife and I feel very tired when we wake up everyday and back pain.  I though it may be the pillow problem(too high), so we changed pillows but the issue was still persist.  Now we figured that mattress is getting soft over time when we sleep on it.
 My husband prefers a firm mattress, while I prefer a softer one. We both dislike this mattress. First of all, we ordered a queen and a full size arrives. Second, I have never had back or neck pain like I have with this mattress. I am so disappointed, as we saved for this mattress and are quite stuck with it.<br/>On the positive side, it does sleep cooler than what we expected it to.
 Zzzzzz! Finally!
 Gooooooood!
 Awesome
 Great.
 A+
 Terrible chemical smell. I mean really bad, I got a buzz just from unpackaging and being in the room with it for only 2 or 3 minutes. It's been 5 or so hours and the smell is still as strong.
 We suffer major back problems and since getting these mattresses for our whole family, we all have slept very well! Plently of support and you don't feel like you are stuck in bed as you do when in a therapedic. LOVE these mattresses!
 This mattress was to uncomfortable for me but my husband thought it was ok. Wanted to like this one but wasn't happening.  Might work for people who want super firm.
 If I could send it back, I would....I’ve had way better.  I’m totally embarrassed that this is for our guest bedroom mattress.
 This is my first review on Amazon and I felt i needed to do it to let people know exactly what they are getting...  because reading most of the reviews.. I feel that people aren't really telling the whole story. I purchased this mattress about a week ago.. I was real excited about getting it.. and first thing i noticed was the ease of opening it and letting it "inflate" and take form... within 30 minutes full form and fully expanded Queen size... but I didn't sleep on it until 10 hours later.. to really ensure it would be ready to lay on.. so when I went to lay on it for a good nights sleep.. first thing i noticed.. no smell... heard stories about how bad the smell is from latex / foam mattresses ... so that was great... once I laid on it... it was very comfortable.. so I thought.. once i woke up in the AM.. i felt ok.. somewhat sore.. but I figured it was something else.. maybe a long day on my feet.. after a few more days... I woke up more sore than my old spring mattress...i was feeling pain in my back that i never felt before..  it did have a sinking feeling... mind you Im not that big.. 6'1" and 210 pounds.. so I don't understand.. but the one thing I have to give 5 stars on is the customer service from Tuft &amp; Needle... they were so helpful... also the customer service agent at Amazon was equally as helpful.. letting me return the mattress and expediting my new mattress for next day delivery for free.. my only concern.. is how they are gonna take the old mattress ?? The saga continues....
 I've had this mattress for a few weeks now.  It replaced an old Sealy mattress. I've always slept pretty solid &amp; uninterrupted but I sleep even better than before.  I also do not get overly warm at night anymore. The mattress does keep me cooler but I'm not cold. At first I was worried it would be too firm but it's extremely comfortable.
 Ok, I haven't actually tried it yet, but opening the vacuum seal and watching it spring forth rivals packing bubbles for cathartic fun!
 IT ARRIVED TIMELY.  THE BOX IS HEAVY AND ONCE THE MATTRESS UNFOLDS - SO DO TRY TO HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU.  IT IS FOR THE SPARE BEDROOM, AND ALL THE GUESTS HAVEN'T BEEN CONSISTENT WITH LOVING IT OR LIKING IT.
 Purchased this mattress for me and my wife first the mattress is very firm and didn't really dissipate heat like they claim.  Second they say the mattresses is compatible with flat surface bed frames ( we have a Sleep number frame) it was fine up until we lifted the mattress to vacuum the rug and noticed MOLD ON THE BOTTOM AND THE BED SOAKING WET! NOWHERE DO THEY TELL YOU OR WARN YOU OF THIS! I will be purchasing a new bed frame and a GHOST BED INSTEAD.
 Paid $700.00 for a king mattress and received a pillow... not the same.
 Bought this for my granddaughter.  She absolutely hated it.  Too hard and never got used to it.  She had to go out and buy another mattress.
 Best mattress I have ever owned. On average I purchased a new mattress every other year until I purchased this one.
 I purchased the Tuft and Needle in a king size mattress.  I really wanted to love it.  My husband and I are mostly side sleepers and were waking up with our backs and hips hurting even more which was the reason for a new mattress.  We tried it out and decided that we needed to return it.  It was just too firm.  We had purchased the Tuft &amp; Needle through Amazon and the return process was a little difficult and confusing, but after contacting Customer Support several times, we finally got it returned and received our refund.  I then considered Casper, Leesa and Brooklyn Bedding.  What I really liked about the Brooklyn Bedding was that I could choose my own comfort level.  I chose the king size in soft. I was worried that the soft might be too soft, but it is perfect. It has just the right give for being a side sleeper, yet is very supportive.  I love the plush feeling topper as well.  It really is a great mattress. We aren't waking up in the night anymore trying to find a comfortable position and in the morning the aching back and hips are gone!  Very happy with the Brooklyn Bedding mattress.  Sorry Tuft and Needle.  Check comments for how to save more.
 We've slept on this mattress for 7 nights and it is is just as hot and hard as the first night we slept on it. We are extremely disappointed and was hoping for a more comfortable experience after doing our research and reading all of the great reviews. We had anticipated it needing a break in period but this is ridiculous. I have never sweat more at night in my life! The mattress feels like very dense foam and is really hard. The center of the mattress feels like it is higher (raised) than the rest of the mattress and the edges are weak. I sat on the side of the bed and nearly ended up on the floor! The chemical smell of the material gives us a headache. Just awful. Where are all of the great reviews coming from? Did we even receive the same product they did?
 Feels great, never slept better
 I looked at other mattresses but this one was priced well. Since I and my kids have been using them we have quality sleep and no sore hips -the kids sleep right through the night.
 Very firm and takes a bit to get used to if you are not sleeping on a firm matress now.  After a while it sleeps quite nicely.
 This bed is fine for sleeping but nothing else. If I sit and lean against the pillows to either watch TV or read a book, my hips hurt.
 Wasn't in love with the bed BUT Amazon customer support was AWESOME!
 We have had this mattress for a year now. My wife has never really been that comfortable on the mattress. From the second month she started to complain of shoulder and back pain. She is a side sleeper and found that the only way to minimize the pain was to force herself to sleep on her back. However, as she is not a back sleeper, she tossed and turned all night. Her biggest complaint is that it feels like her hips are sinking into the mattress so much that it's throwing her back out of alignment. The foam around the shoulders and knees is more firm and does not sink in nearly as much. For the last few months, the pain has been so bad that even laying in the mattress for a few minutes causes her to feel pain. She has even complained that her bones feel "creaky" after laying on it.<br/><br/>We tried adding a foam topper to see if the problem was that the foam was too firm. After three different toppers, the problem remained.<br/><br/>The last two months have been full of sleep experiments to see if it is my wife's back or the mattress. We have slept on our two guest beds (spring mattresses with two different firmness levels), an air mattress and the couch. None of these cause the same "creakiness" in her bones.<br/><br/>I am pretty bummed to have to write such a negative review. Before buying we read up a lot on the company and looked at other non-traditional mattress companies before we decided on Tuft and Needle. We have had the mattress a significant amount of time and even tried to add things to make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, the mattress seems to sink so much in the middle that my wife's back hurts all the time. Keep in mind that we are 30 years old so her back and bones should not feel that way yet.
 Great bed. Pains melted away
 Okay at first.  Firm.  Not thick enough to absorb body weight crawling across bed.<br/><br/>Sides sag quickly.  Middle of the bed becomes only space that isn't rolling you to the edge.<br/><br/>Comfortable as a back sleeper, but not as a side.<br/><br/>Disappointed that we cannot return it after 34 days.
 A little firmer than I like but hopeful that it softens over time. No follow up after purchase
 We are so disappointed with this mattress.  It has been almost 2 weeks and the chemical smell is still extremely strong.  As soon as I walk into the bedroom, the smell hits you.  I have not gotten a good night sleep yet.  I am not sure if it is just because of the smell or because of the mattress as well.  We will be returning this mattress and will go with another brand instead.<br/><br/>Update - March 2, 2015 - returning the item is also a poor experience.  When you go through the online return process, it queues the return to be handled through UPS.  However, since the item is no longer shrink wrapped, there is no way to package it in the same size it was when it arrived.  It is a 10 inch thick king size mattress.  UPS will not take such a large item, and you have to call Amazon to change the return to use their large item freight division.  It's almost as if Amazon doesn't know what they are selling here because if they did they would not process the return through UPS.
 I'm really not enjoying this mattress.  It is overly firm and doesn't give enough for me to feel comfortable on it. I'm generally a side-sleeper and it seems like this is designed for people that sleep on their back and want more firmness.  I regret being cheap and deciding to go with a mattress this inexpensive, previously I had a box spring set that was about 10 years old but slept way better that the T&amp;N. When it arrived and I opened the mattress it also stank terribly of chemical fumes. I had to open all my windows and sleep on my couch for a couple nights. I would think they would have figured out a way to mitigate that, but I guess that's part of what keeps it so cheap.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was moving abroad so got rid of the old one and had the T&amp;N delivered before moving abroad, and now that I've moved I can't take advantage of the return policy. Highly recommend you don't get this mattress, even for guest rooms, the sacrifice in comfort isn't worth the savings.
 Not as comfy as i thought it'd be. I think I could find a better mattress for the price of this bed.
 Biggest waste of money. Mattress was extremely soft for someone my weight (200lbs), had back pains after the first night. DO NOT BUY.
 we bought a king mattress and it is about 8 inch to short to fit our box springs Why/
 So far so good, but in contrast to what most say: this thing has an intense and terrible chemical smell. I can't even be in the same room as it. I hope this does not last too long.
 Bought this bed 6 months ago...seems like it keeps getting softer and softer which is not a good thing. Lower back has been giving me trouble now for a month.  100 days has past for the warranty of course.  Not sure how one could even return a KINGSIZE mattress. No way to squeeze it back into a box. Bad choice on my part. If you need a firm mattress do not get this one or you'll be out a cool grand with a backache.
 Its really soft mattress, I weight 115 but it still sinks.
 I bought this confidently based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. However, this mattress has the feel of a cheap box spring. My partner and I are both healthy weight and in our 20s, and for the first time ever we are both waking up in pain. The mattress is just too firm. Im not sure how to go about returning this product as theres no way it could ever fit back into its box. I feel like I just wasted 600 bucks.
 best bed ever!!!!!!!
 After many years of service (probably too many), my wife and I decided to replace our big name brand memory foam mattress as it had developed permanent soft spots where we lay.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of time looking at different options online, and found the Tuft &amp; Needle videos informative and entertaining. They offer a generous 100 day in home trial (unless you buy from Amazon - more on that in a moment) with the mattress likely to go to charity per their website if you do not like it. When I saw they are on Amazon with Prime shipping, I was sold.<br/><br/>So here is the short and long of it:<br/>1) If you do buy this mattress, do not but it from Amazon. The 100 night trial does not apply, and mattress is subject to Amazon's 30 return policy. You don't like it? Of course you can return it, just pay return shipping and......<br/>Have you ever considered trying to pack and send back a queen size mattress? Sure, it comes compressed and vacuum sealed in a box, but anyone have a queen size bed press and vacuum sealed at home? Yeah, me either.<br/>Oh, and from their website in case you are interested (direct copy/paste): "PLEASE NOTE THAT BOTH THE 100 NIGHT TRIAL POLICY AND LIMITED WARRANTY APPLY ONLY TO ORIGINAL PURCHASERS OF GENUINE TUFT &amp; NEEDLE MATTRESSES WHO PURCHASED THEIR PRODUCT(S) DIRECTLY FROM AN AUTHORIZED TUFT &amp; NEEDLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL AND, IN THE CASE OF THE 100-NIGHT TRIAL, ONLY TO THOSE PURCHASERS WHO PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM TUFT &amp; NEEDLE."<br/><br/>2) If you are a side sleeper, and don't enjoy shoulder pain, run. Run now.<br/>This bed is firm. To firm. Well, in most places. It is oddly extra firm on the sides and softer in the middle. I would blame a box spring, if I used one, but this is sitting on a solid foundation.<br/>When my wife and I are both in bed, we both hurt. The only time I get a comfortable nights rest is when she is working overnight and I sleep in the middle where it is softer. No too squishy soft. Just comfortable. Like I thought the whole mattress would be.<br/><br/>3) Made in the USA by a company owned by real people. I like this, but not at the loss of sleeping well and having a happy, well rested wife.<br/><br/>I am sure this mattress is right for a lot of people to have the ratings it does, but if you buy, buy direct without the benefits of Amazon Prime. The cost of not doing so are much greater.
 I'm so happy I finally found a mattress that doesn't hurt my back! This mattress is very firm, but squishy enough to be SO comfortable. You just melt into it. And it's silent too, which is nice for sneakily climbing out of bed at 6am trying not to wake your partner.
 Not very comfortable and return policy is only 30 days.
 I was so confuse to get mattress,I looked up in google found so may reviews n thought to give try till now satisfied hope to b in future too,worthfull
 I'm a curvy girl. My previous mattress was a coil spring that was completely broke down. So after reading the reviews I plunked down big coin on  this mattress waiting with baited breathe for a decent's night sleep. It never came. I'm in so much pain. Mainly in the lower back and hips. Disappointed is not the word....
 This mattress injures me. I bought it directly from Tuft &amp; Needle so I'd have the 100 day trial, and I'm returning it as soon as I find something else. I have never in 40 years of life had problems sleeping or had a mattress give me back pain until now. This mattress is so weird. It's both too hard and too soft. It allows my torso to sink in while my shoulders, arms, legs and head float on top, so I'm always in an awkward position no matter whether I'm on my back, side, or stomach. I am an average sized person - not overweight, not tiny. My body wakes me up repeatedly all night long to change position because I'm getting stiff. I've woken up variously with low back pain, upper back pain, shoulder pain, and neck pain. My husband is suffering even more than me. :(
 It works for everyone does not mean it works for you. it is soft and have to turn on it. I start to have low back pain since I got it. Every night I wake up on it I think about how to return it. It is impossible to repack it to the original box since it was highly compressed when it came.
 Still getting use to it. But the more I sleep on it, the more I like it. I do wish the bed included a box of some sort at no additional cost to set it on.. My wife and I upgraded from what we thought was a queen pillow top bed ( very unhappy with) to the new Tuft and Needle... Which was still  out of our price range..We really needed a new one. For our backs sakes we took a chance. We like. but doesn't fit our old boxspring.. Which again we thought was a queen. We had to use the cardboard the mattress came in to put between the bedframe and mattress so it doesn't fall through.the frame support boards
 I received this, but wish the company would have recommended a better supplier for "Box Springs".<br/><br/>It was easy to unbox and I have slept of this mattress for 2 nights.  I have never owned a Foam Mattress.<br/><br/>I will have more to share as I continue to get a good night's rest.
 My Wife said it was to hard on her lower back and we had trouble staying asleep throughout the whole night. We are not satisfied.
 unfortunately started give us back pain after 2 months of use. our neighbor experienced similar issues.
 Way too firm for us! Tried it out for a few weeks but we're returning it even though we thought we preferred a firmer mattress.
 Smells a bit funky but the mattress is comfortable and the price is right
 It's fine, as expected. Nothing amazing but does the job well enough and probably better for my back than my old one
 Bought the mattress and didn't have time to review.The mattress doesn't hold sheets or mattress protection sheet.Get body ache and don't feel comfortable at all.
 Too warm and hard for our liking. It was beyond our understanding that foam could feel so hard and weird. The reviews for this product here on amazon are so awesome in number and quality that it plays very negatively when you get this product and feel, touch and sleep on it. We tried 3 days but just could not like it. The return was lost in transit by carrier. Amazon did great job by refunding my money. But I had to pay for return of the product which is not very cheap. I would suggest buy this mattress if you are really convinced, returning will cost you money, it's not free.
 I was really excited to try this mattress out after seeing the high reviews but am experiencing back and neck pain every morning. The mattress is too firm and lately (after just one month of use) I have trouble falling asleep. I have spent 3 out of the past 4 weekends out of town and my back pain only occurs when I sleep at home so I know that it is the cause. I wanted to return it (I like that the company donates unwanted mattresses to charity) but, unfortunately, I am one day over my 30 night sleep trial.
 Sent the wrong size! Now it can't be returned
 Love it!
 The top layer is too soft and deep for me.  It gave me a lower back pain in two days but my wife has no complaints.  I think it is more suited for supporting the curvy female anatomy than the male's.  The Casper bed solved my back pain issue but it costs $250 more.
 So far this bed is so uncomfortable.  It is way to firm and not as soft as described.  How are you to repackage this thing and pay the shipping fee?  The bed weighs 78 lbs... I think the reviews were misleading.
 I wanted to love this mattress. I read all of the reviews, liked the concept of the company, and tried to give this a full try but this is truly the worst product I have purchased. I have not had a good night of sleep on this thing. I planned to return prior to the 100 day trial but then when I went to return I saw that since I had purchased on Amazon I only had 30 days to return which I had exceeded. My back and hips have been horribly tight since I purchased this and my wife has had much the same issues. At this point we will probably just eat the $600 and get something that does not hurt us
 Exceeded expectations.  Got this for my 2 year old son bed.  He sleeps soundly through the night without tossing and turning.
 Bought it for a guest room. I only slept on it once and had to go to a regular bed after a few hours. It's not the biggest mistake I ever made but it's in the top ten.
 I think the mattress will be fine.<br/>The box arrived completely beat up, open box ends and it looked like it had been dragged behind the fedex truck.
 Very nice
 too firm
 This mattress was unfortunately too stiff for my tastes. It sounds like a great dream. One mattress to rule them all. The universal fit. That just isn't the reality. You want to try mattresses out before you buy them. The company has a decent sounding return policy if you buy from them directly, but if you get this on amazon, you cannot use the tuft and needle return policy and you will have to deal with Amazon. This thing comes vacuum sealed, so there's no way you're getting it back in the box it came in. Good luck squeezing this thing into a box that you can find anywhere near you. Listen to common sense and don't be a fool like Go to a mattress store and try it before you buy it.
 Please send information to be able to return the mattress ~~~thank you
 I ordered a queen mattress and accidentally received a king. I measured the king, it was supposed to be 76x80, but was more like 74x78...where did the 2"+ inches all the way around go?  Also note in the photos how the corners are very rounded. Anyway, T&amp;N customer service was awesome and had a queen on the way and offered for me to just keep or donate the king. We did put it the king on the floor and spend a night in it, and it is not bad. But remember, these are 10" mattresses with no frame below, so if your in your 30s or older, you may want a regular or taller mattress for ease of getting in and out of bed...overall the price is great, how long they last is a good question.
 Worst mattress I have ever owned.  I'm side sleeper and I wake every morning with pain in my hips.  Far to firm for my taste.  Beware of the fine print.  Amazon only has a 30 day return policy where as the Tuft and Needle direct site has a 100 day trial.  And of course, I waited 10 days too long.  Now I have to research mattress toppers to try to correct this problem until I can save enough money for a high quality mattress.  Buyer beware.
 Nervous about buying a bed online, without even testing it out.  But it's turned out to be everything everyone said it would be, and more.  I've gotten the best sleep nights of my life on this bed, by far.  I wake up now feeling so good, so refreshed, it's like being a new person.  And I am not tired at all during the day.<br/><br/>On my old bed, I would toss and turn all night, it hurt to lay in any one place for long, and I'd wake up exhausted and spend all day downing tons of caffeine trying to stay awake, which never really worked.  I was miserable.  But all of that has changed with this Tuft &amp; Needle bed.  I am getting extremely high quality, deep sleep on this bed and no tossing and turning and waking myself up all night.  And when I do wake up in the morning, I have so much energy it's like someone flipped on a lightswitch and I am instantly awake and ready to go.  Haven't felt like this since I was a child.<br/><br/>The bed itself is easy to setup, and very well made.  It's just the right balance of soft and firm and holds my weight perfectly.  I'm a stomach and side sleeper and there is no problem at all for either way.  No soreness or pains even after laying in one spot for hours.  It's just perfect.  I could not be happier.  I didn't know I could BE this happy from just sleep.  I mean, sleep is sleep, right?  Wrong.  So very wrong.<br/><br/>This is my first real foam bed and I am a hot sleeper so I had concerns about whether this bed would work for me, but there has been zero problem with heat.  It's absolutely fine.  A major consumer magazine called this mattress very breathable and I agree.<br/><br/>Summary: this may have been the best purchase of any kind I've ever made, given how wonderful I feel after a night's sleep on this mattress.  Nothing I can think of has ever given me this kind of feeling.  I'm so grateful that somebody invented this.  It's going to give me back my life.
 This mattress is very soft and provides little support for heavy people.<br/>I have a back ache every morning when I sleep on this mattress.
 Slept on this mattress for 8 nights now, packaging said to give it a week to breathe. First night was not at all comfortable had a very restless night, but we were still optimistic. Second night woke up numerous times in pain by the third night we were regretting our purchase. We still wanted to give the product a chance and since then we wake up every morning with bad lower back pain. We are very disappointed in this product, seeing as the advertisements promoted great comfort for a great price. We have a mattress that we disliked and were hoping that this company stood true to it's word. In our eyes this company FAILED. We do not recommend purchasing this product.
 I bought this mattress as a guest bed for my visiting in-laws.  I thought I was ahead of the game by ordering over the weekend and it was delivered on Tuesday.  I was concerned about chemical smells from the form, etc. as I have a personal aversion to being poisoned.  From the reviews, I felt reassured that there would be no smell.  Manufactured in USA in CA &amp; MA.  The first odd thing I noticed was that this package was shipped from Orlando FL.  I found this strange since it was supposedly made in CA or MA and this is the furthest possible point it could have been shipped from in the US.  We immediately unpacked it to let it puff up and noticed a plasticy, chemical smell.  I thought it was coming from the plastic that it was wrapped in so I immediately discarded the plastic.  After leaving it unpacked on its side to have plenty of air to de-gas and waiting 30 hours, the smell of chemicals/plastic is so strong tonight it has permeated my house (even downstairs),  When I enter the room it is in, it feels like I am being hit in the face. My lungs hurt from breathing it in.  I have opened the window and turned on a fan overnight to see if I can rid my house of the smell.<br/><br/>What is going on here?  How can I be having such a different experience that others?  Was it stored too long in an Amazon warehouse?  Is this a counterfeit mattress?  I will be taking up returning it tomorrow as I need to get this out of my house.  Apparently, I can donate it to a charity (which I kinda feel bad about dumping this toxic POS on someone else), but that seems to be what I have to do.  All I can say is BE CAREFUL.
 Love it
 Love it!
 I wish I could give ZERO stars. More description is needed towards the firmness (lack thefeof) of this mattress. I am 6' 1" 290 pounds and this is not the bed for a muscle bound / bigger guy. Way too soft, and no scale of firmness was provided by the manufacturer that I could read prior to buying. I'll immediately be returning after one night of use. I have a terrible pain on the right side of my back that feels as if a rib is out. So I've wasted time setting it up, returning it and now have to waste time going to the chiropractor. Let's hope the return proceeds is simple, though I'm sure it won't be.
 We love it.
 OK, a bit of explanation.  In the end, I like it quite a bit.  Initially, it was too firm without a nice thick topper.  After adding a 3"-thick topper and a good pad, it's great.  A perfect combination of firmness and softness.
 If you are thinking of buying this Tuft&amp;Needle mattress, don't buy it from Amazon! The 100 day money back guarantee only applies to Tuft&amp;Needle's website. Buying through Amazon, it's only a 30 day return policy. This mattress is very firm with no support. It's like sleeping on the floor. It does keep you cool through the night as advertised but that's because you don't sink into the mattress at all. If you have back issues, then don't buy this bed. I hurt my back about one month ago and every so often I wake up with a stiff back. If you are tired of your regular mattress and looking for something better, just stick with your regular mattress or buy something other than Tuft&amp;Needle. I have heard great things about BeautyRest mattresses from multiple sources and will test this one next.
 good
 Love it.
 This mattress is too soft for me and my wife. I slept for two nights and had aches around the shoulder in the back. My wife tried for two weeks and gave up due to the bad backache. We wish to return the mattress. But Amazon insisted the return date was closed after 42 days from the purchase. The manufacture will take the return good after 100 days from the purchase. This is a poor customer service by Amazon.
 Too firm, even for my husband who can sleep on the wood floor. I don't know what it is about this mattress, but we have tried it many ways, trying to make this work for a year. Way too uncomfortable. Really frustrating.
 I know lots of people love this mattress - I don't. I've had it about 3 months. If my husband rolls toward the middle, the whole middle sags in. At the edges of the mattress, if you are near the outside, it bends outward so much that you could roll off. I immensely dislike this mattress except that it was cheap.  It hurts the outside of my hip joint so much I had to buy one of those foam toppers. I don't understand all the great ratings unless the mattress the people had before was just plain awful. The one I gave away to relatives  when I got this one was better.
 Got back ace after sleeping here for a month. Too soft
 Wasn't able to return after 45 days of trying it out. Its really hard. I liked the idea of the company. But this mattress is way to hard. And I'm used to sleeping on just about anything. Really a let down. Makes me wondering if something was wrong with my mattress. Tried contacting the company. They couldn't help me because I ordered it from amazon.
 Terribly uncomfortable. I would not recommend.
 Way too firm! Like putting a yoga pad on concrete...
 I purchased this mattress over the Casper based upon the reviews, so I hope this helps.<br/><br/>I got the mattress yesterday so my issue might fix itself in a few days.  When I opened the plastic wrap the mattress was shipped in, chemical smell was overwhelming. We could not even sleep on it last night.  In the middle of the night I had to move it from the top the hall.<br/><br/>We are hoping that it will air out today so we can sleep on it.....I will let you know.
 Didn't work for either of us.
 I am very bummed about this product &amp; purchase.  We bought this mattress in April of 2015.  I have given it more then enough time to work, mend, stretch out and it just absolutely does not deliver.  I have some lover back pain and after reading the reviews I thought this would be a great mattress as it is firmer and from all the positive reviews seems like it is generally good for people with back conditions.  My husband can sleep on brick and be comfortable so for him ANY mattress works.  I, however, have woken up with more back pain and just uncomfortable feeling every morning on this mattress. Our 20year old mattress prior to this was so much better. I really wanted this to work so much.<br/>Now we've been trying to purchase a mattress topper.  I feel that by the time we buy that, we should have just invested in a mattress originally that is more expensive and comfortable overall.
 Excellent
 The only thing that was good about this mattress was it's awesome return policy. I really appreciate that but my husband and I didn't sleep for 7 days straight on it. Then my sister and her husband tried it and they didn't sleep for three nights either.
 I know this is the highest rated mattress on Amazon, but it just is not working out for me. In terms of comfort, I really want to give the mattress itself 2 stars, but I bumped it up one star because Tuft and Needle has great customer service (from what I experienced so far).<br/><br/>I purchased the mattress directly from Tuft and Needle, and I'm still within my 100 day trial period. I am pretty sure I'm going to tell them I don't want the mattress, in which case I'll try to update this and let you all know how that went.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like:<br/><br/>-The mattress is SO firm. I tend to be a side-sleeper, and I wake up hurting in places that I didn't even know could hurt. I'm 125lbs and 27 years old... I shouldn't be hurting this badly after sleeping. I purchased a mattress topper that should be arriving in a couple days, I hope it helps, otherwise this was a $600 purchase definitely NOT well spent. To be fair, I've noticed that I don't hurt as much when I'm on my back, so maybe this mattress I will be more loved by "back sleepers."  I feel like this mattress would be perfect if it had just a little bit more coziness/softness at the top. I'm really sad, because I wanted to love this mattress :( Side note: My significant other (a side-sleeper) wakes up in pain also. The other night we tossed and turned all night because we couldn't get comfortable<br/><br/>Here's what I like:<br/>-100 day return policy if purchased through Tuft and Needle<br/>-The unpacking process is so cool/fun<br/><br/>UPDATE: I am changing my rating to 1 star, because I've had this mattress probably slightly over 90 days now, so I can no-longer return it. I toss and turn all night, my shoulders and hips hurt. I purchased 2 mattress toppers to no avail. I recently spent a week on my grandparents cheap mattress and I slept better than I have in months..Sadly I came home to this Tuft and Needle mattress and I can't sleep again.<br/><br/>Originally I had reached out to Tuft and Needle and informed them that I wished to take advantage of their "100 day"  return policy.. At this time, I was provided with some places that I could try to donate my mattress to. Had I known that Tuft and Needle would leave all of the planning and annoying "donation"  process up to me, I would have thought twice about dropping $600 on this mattress. I live in rural NH, and it was basically impossible to find a donation place that was willing to take my mattress. Not only this, but Tuft and Needle basically was like "good luck finding a place and figuring out how to get your mattress there! If you somehow happen to figure it all put within 100 days, then we will refund you!" Needless to say, I am a small 28 year old girl, without the means of picking up a mattress and transporting it by myself. I am so mad at Tuft and Needle, and I feel like their return policy is so misleading... They make it sound so easy, like they will set it up for you. Maybe it's easier in more-populated areas, but for me it was impossible.<br/><br/>My original review had 3 stars.. Only hours after posting it, my review was completely drowned out and hidden by many "new"  5-star reviews. I am starting to wonder if all of the reviews here are fake. Originally, I was impressed with Tuft and Needle's quick responses to my emails, but they left me high and dry, and now I'm out $600 and getting the most miserable sleep of my life. Ugh.
 Hard. As. A. Rock.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this mattress. Set-up was a breeze, it is lighter than my old pillow top queen and the smell is gone so fast. The fabric covering it even feels soft enough to sleep on it by itself (if you had to.)<br/><br/>BUT. It is painfully firm. Back-slaying, sleep-destroying firm. If Motel 6 beds are softer, you know you are doing something wrong. I spent the hours between 3-5 (since I couldn't sleep and by then my back was dying) reading the other Amazon reviews which I didn't spend enough time doing before. Everyone gave 5 stars but more often than not, the rating was for the customer service they got RETURNING the mattress.<br/><br/>Someone from T&amp;N should really spend a couple hours going through and counting how many reviews saying these mattresses are too firm to how many like the firmness. If there are more complaints than not, time to readdress the formula.<br/><br/>I'll update this. Of course, I already ordered a foam topper because that solved the problem for everyone else who didn't want to go to the hassle of getting yet another new bed. I think the bed will be a great foundation, it just needs a bit more cushion on top. I do feel like, if you are on the heavy side, you would sink into their cushion more and be happier with it. The sides of the bed when you sit on them sink in just fine.<br/><br/>For comparison's sake:<br/>-5'8", 160lb female<br/>-side/back sleeper
 Was comfortable but unable to get a full nights sleep on it
 over price, shop around you will get cheaper with better quality
 When we initially opened our new mattress it felt great however, over 10 days the mattress became too soft for sleep. We began sinking further and further into the mattress creating lots of aches, cramps and pain . I requested the mattress to be picked up for return because Tuft Needle offers a return period. UPS has now tried to picked up the mattress for return 3 times and cannot take it because it's not packaged (meaning vaccumed sealed as it was upon delivery)! How in the heck am I supposed to do that? I'm disappointed in the overall process and product. I do not recommend this mattress!!!
 My stepson loves it.
 We received our new bed yesterday afternoon and were so excited to sleep in it, I read so many good reviews. About 45 minutes after going to bed and much tossing and turning, I got up and could barely walk as my back seized up. It is the hardest bed I have ever been on!! Thankfully we had a 3 inch memory foam topper in the guest room we were able to use on top of the new mattress. Even with that it was still an uncomfortable nights sleep, even my dog had problems getting comfortable. We are going to put another 3 inch foam from our trailer on it tonight to see if that helps any, if it doesn't, the bed will be going back.I am so bummed, I really thought this was going to be a great bed.  I will update in a few days.
 This is not a good mattress. I bought the 5 inch queen mattress 1 ½ yrs ago and we had it on the floor initially.  Bed was fairly comfortable, but you could definitely feel the floor beneath you if kneeling on the bed.  Within 6 months, I started to feel a minor depression on my side of the bed, which was hugely disappointing. My wife did not complain of a depression on her side. I am 6 ft and weigh 200lbs.  We decided to set up our euro style bed with slats to get ventilation on the mattress because we were both afraid of mold issues.  On slats, this mattress is horrendous. Absolutely uncomfortable.  Feeling much remorse.
 Got it yesterday! The mattress come in without a box. It was wrapped in plastic wrappers. I so want to love the mattress after lots of great reviews! However it is very soft I am afraid the mattress won't hold up the shape. The most annoying part is that the mattress come with a wired smell! I have let it sit for more than one day, and the chemical smell doesn't go away! At least the reviews on Amazon or about this company is not true to my experience so far! The most annoying part is the chemical smell!!! I thought the mattress is all natural! So disappointed!
 Way too firm for my taste but Amazon did a great job at taking care of me with the return!
 (Long and updated twice)<br/><br/>We bought our King direct from Tuft &amp; Needle because of the 100 night guarantee. What's to loose right??! Well...sleep!!!! At least for me. We've had it for 5 weeks now and I've never slept worse, some nights NOT AT ALL, zero minutes. I toss and turn all night. The first night was horrific. I went out and purchases a mattress topper the very next day to pad the bed. It's just too firm! I'm a side sleeper and I could never get comfortable enough to fall asleep at all the first night. With the foam topper, sometimes I actually fall asleep, but most nights I toss and turn. In the past five weeks I've had to take sleep aids just to fall asleep. I suffer from "occasional" insomnia, but since getting this bed, its almost nightly. I just can't get comfortable enough to fall asleep. I bought a new pillow as well because we wake up so stiff from neck to tailbone. I wanted soooo badly to love this bed, both because our old bed had huge craters in it and was wrecking our backs, and because with two young kids, we're on a budget. But it's just not working. I wish it was softer. We actually went into the showroom in San Fran to lay on the bed and it seemed softer in store (don't they all?). But some nights it feels like I'm laying on a taught rubber band, there's just not enough give. Without the mattress topper we bought it's intolerable. With the topper, we're just struggling to sleep. Well, I am, I think my husband loves it as a back/stomach sleeper, but he also doesn't want to admit it's not working out, AND he can fall asleep leaning on a fence if need be. I've emailed customer service and will start the return process. Super bummed. I was so excited about the company, their philosophy, and their warm customer service. Just wish I could sleep in their bed  :/<br/><br/>8/9/16 UPDATE: Upon contacting T&amp;N about the return process, they offered to send us one of their T&amp;N mattress toppers made from their special foam. We received it today and it makes the bed sooooo much softer for me! Also, its been 6 weeks with the new bed and after some walking on it and breaking it in, I'm happy to report we are actually sleeping better!!! I definitely think going from an inter-spring mattress to giant foam block takes quite an adjustment period. And we are finally adjusting, stiffness subsiding, and we are getting much needed rest. Changing my review to 4 stars. As mentioned in first review, this company is amazing to work with, but the bed is definitely firm and takes an adjustment period to get used to if you're used to a pillow top plush inter-spring mattress. But for $800, our experience and experiment seems to be paying off. Kudos to T&amp;N for the stellar customer service and going above and beyond to help a customer get comfortable before giving up and returning it. I dont know many companies that would do that. Will update again if warranted, but as of now, were finally comfy and happy :)<br/><br/>6/1/17: Update. Our mattress is the most comfortable bed I've ever had. We needed to get used to it. It needed a topper and its heavenly. I've since referred my parents to buy one for their guest room for us to sleep on when we visit. The customer service with this company is just exceptional. You have zero to loose trying to this bed. They will make you happy or refund you. Simple as that. All star company.
 The simplicity of buying a bed online, having it delivered to your house, and living happily ever after sounds wonderful, almost a fairy tale. Unfortunately it is. The bed was lackluster, too firm and compact, and something I would have realized immediately in a showroom. Instead of just buying a different bed, I am in my second month of trying to return this uncomfortable bed. Go to a store.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Return still unresolved and it has been almost 3 months.
 Some people hate memory foam mattresses, other love it. If you absolutely hate memory foam, there is very little chance you'll like this mattress. It's not quite memory foam, but it's very similar.<br/><br/>My main point of comparison is a $2,000 (over 3x the cost) Tempurpedic mattress I owned. I was happy with that mattress, but lost it in a fire. Researching mattresses I came across Tuft and Needle, contacted their costumer support (incredibly responsive by the way) and decided that given their return policy (take it to charity within 30 days, show them receipt, and you get your money back) I gave them a try.<br/><br/>I am so glad I did.<br/><br/>I had 2 minor gripes with the tempurpedic:<br/>1. It gets very hot between you and the mattress<br/>2. You kind of sink in - no bounce, kind of hard to move about.<br/><br/>I loved the comfort, support, etc. Well, except the price tag, everything is well made.<br/><br/>This tuft and needle just one upped it. NOTE: I bought this right after they started shipping mattresses with their custom top layer of foam. The mattresses went up in price by like 20-25%, but supposedly this is a really good foam. I cannot compare how the mattress was before, just the new version of it. (2015)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Does not get hot! You don't sleep hot like with a tempurpedic.<br/>- Feels great. Most comfortable mattress I've ever slept in. They did a great job with it.<br/>- You don't sink in quite as much, it pushes back a little. "localized bounce" is their marketing term, but basically, you don't totally sink in.<br/>- All materials and constructions from the USA.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- None so far.<br/><br/>So far I love this mattress. I hope it lasts, but I got nothing bad to say about it. It is very comfortable, their support is amazing, return policy great. Honestly, seems like a great company and they are producing a quality product are a good price.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you are considering any memory foam mattress.
 Update 12/27/17: Alight, I've had this mattress only week, but already I feel it necessary to update this review. I still wish my box was complete with instructions, it was a very stressful start but I'm beginning to LOVE this mattress. It was supposed to come with a warrant and I didn't receive any paper work. I need information about that. The first couple nights were really rough but it's gotten better! I think I hurt my back pretty bad pulling the mattress out of the box by myself. I'd highly recommend having someone help you set up the mattress; it's a two person job, unless you're a big strapping lad. I slept terrible the first couple nights. I don't know if that's from hurting my back or just needing time to adjust to a drasticly different mattress type or maybe the mattress needed time to firm up. I have to say, I've been sleeping so good the last few nights and feel like I'm climbing into a luxurious bed at a five star hotel. I find myself at work thinking about how I can't wait to go home and lay on my new bed. When my mind drifts I'm thinking about how well I sleep and how I should have gotten this mattress a lot sooner.<br/><br/>I've always been one to wake up 5 to 10 times a night... my whole life. I've simply attributed this to my small bladder because I have to get up a lot. The mattress is the only thing I've changed and now I've only been waking up 1 to 2 times at night. Three times at the very most. That probably doesn't sound like a big deal to most of you but for me that has made a huge difference in my quality of sleep. I hope the bed holds up well over time but right now it feels like a worthwhile purchase. If I were to buy it again, I'd buy it from Tuft and needle directly because the return situation would be easier if any problems did arise, but overall I'm very pleased with this Amazon purchase!<br/><br/>Update: The mattress comes so compressed I thought that I had the wrong size mattress. This was a stressful situation that would have been easily alleviated by Tuft and Needle simply including instructions. For an item that costs hundreds of dollars the least I'd expect is a simple b&amp;w instructions print out. I was able to wiggle the folded up compressed mattress tag around while keeping the mattress still compressed. This took a lot of careful wiggling and prying in order to not puncture the plastic compressing the mattress. I finally got the tag flat enough to read the 60X80 size description. I went on google and looked up a standard queen mattress size. Cool the size matched. At that point I felt comfortable to cut the plastic off my mattress since I realized they did in fact put the correct size mattress in my box even though my box was missing the piece of cardboard inside to stabilize the box as well as it was missing any directions. The length of this queen mattress was much more compressed than the width which I wouldn't have imagined. As I didn't have instructions I went on YouTube to watch other people open their mattresses which was how I realized my box was incomplete. On YouTube, the length of the queen mattresses did not seem nearly as compressed as mine was. I wasted a lot of extra time and worry on something that would have been easily remedied by having received complete instructions to begin with. I'm adding a star to my review as the mattress did expand to the correct size. It looks really nice now that it's expanded and after I've slept on it a bit I intend to update this review again. A stressful start but hopefully good nights of sleep!<br/><br/> Original Review: My mattress came with no paperwork. No instructions. I unrolled it and to me it appears to be a full size mattress but I ordered a queen mattress. I thought without having to undo the packaging my mattress size would be clearly labeled. I have no way of knowing how much it's supposed to expand without removing the vacuum seal and I'm scared to do that because if it is the wrong size I'd have no way of getting it back in the box to return it to Amazon once it's unsealed. It doesn't appear to be long enough for my queen size frame. I researched Tuffed &amp; Needle on consumer reports and felt confident and so so excited about this purchase. I'm very surprised this item didn't at the very least come with instructions. Unfortunately I'm going to have to figure out how to return this item.
 We've had the King size Tuft and Needle for almost a year and it is lumpy and has lost its loving feeling.  The mattress was good for the first 3-6 months. We stopped enjoying it just after the 100 day trial of was over.  We have been too cheap to buy the TempurPedic we have always wanted.  We've learned the hard way to make a smart investment that will last.  The memory foam knockoffs do not use the same technology as TempurPedic. If you buy it and don't like it, make certain to return it before the 100 days.
 Not sure how 90% of you gave this five stars. It almost makes me question the Amazon rating system.  I'm a 31 year old male of 170 lb with only minor skeletal/muscular/sleep issues.  I've been using the Tuft and Needle for one week and I haven't yet had a good night sleep.  Additionally I've been more achey and sore since sleeping on it.  This mattress is extremely firm.  Feels like I'm sleeping on concrete.  To make this mattress work I'm going to have to buy an expensive topper of some kind so you are better off just finding a different mattress.  The ability to ship a mattress is cool and all, but there is absolutely no way you are going to be able to compress this mattress back into the way it came without machinery so I have no idea how returns would work. Maybe 90% of you are over 250 lb and you sink down into the firm mattress and that's why you give it five stars? All I know is that I'm very confused at how the rating system screwed me for the first time.  If you are under 200 lb then I'd say don't even risk it.  A cheap mattress on clearance with a nice topper would be a better way to go if you aren't ready to fork out huge cash.  Although memory foam toppers are too hot and will wake you up sweating.
 (watch how after my negative review they pay to post 3-5 new positive reviews, do not trust paid reviews, read the negative reviews they are not paid for)<br/><br/>This mattress gave me the worst back pain ever. I'm going to bed like a normal person, waking up like unable person. 3 month trial is a scam, in order to return it and fedex to pick it up, you should be able to put it back to the box it came from, and it is impossible as you know . Ofcourse when we contacted customer service, there couldn't do much about it, told us to turn it around. So don't waste your money again, truly and honestly. I can sleep on the floor and I will wake up with no pain in my back, I don't know how, but this particular mattress makes me handicap person in the morning. My lower back feels like cemented and it's started after first night on turf and needle and never ended. Many reviews says you need to get used to it. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Very disappointed. I hope by giving a honest review I will prevent more people from wasting their money. It's the only good thing I can do.
 Go with a casper instead. The foam started getting soft after 3 weeks.
 I want to start with, I am no stranger to foam beds. My first was the Bragada Avalon which was AWFUL for the first two nights, and then for the next five years I heard a choir of angels sing whenever I laid on it, the next year wasn't good.  After researching other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that no foam mattress lasts longer then five years.  I pay close attention to previous Tempurpedic owners reviews which seem to agree with my theory.  My next mattress I purchased right here on Amazon, and it was fabulous right out of the box, but started to lose its support faster then the Bragada.  That said, I still have it, and it's still better than any other mattress I sleep on in other houses.  I did need a new mattress at another house and so it was time to delve into the reviews again.<br/><br/>After much reading I decided to try the Tuft and Needle.  I am not new to foam, and this one feels like a foam mattress, until you try sleeping on it.  My review comes after only one night (I'll update as I go), but I woke with numb hands and a sore back.  I can attribute the sore back to the extra lifting I did the previous day.  (I did pick up a king size pillowtop and carry it to the barn for storage) of extra lifting.  We'll see, I'll keep updating, but I won't buy a topper for a mattress when I've never needed a foam topper for a new mattress before.<br/><br/>Update 02/26/16. Ok, it never got better, and I don't need to own a mattress for a month for it to be comfortable, or buy a foam topper for a foam bed.  None of my previous foam beds have required that, I don't feel that exceptions need to be made.  It feels firm, but it didn't support properly, my hands were numb each morning, my woman's neck, shoulders, back and head ached.  If you read above, I've had foam before, previously memory foam, and when I brought my old memory foam to this house she could immediately feel a difference.  So their pitch that it is bouncey for sex is negated by all the soreness from lack of proper support, and the pitch for cool sleeping compared to memory foam is negated by the need for a memory foam topper to try and make it sleepable.  The reviews were good, the mattress was not, look for a memory foam mattress instead, you'll be happier that you did.  I will be checking out one the Amazon Prime eligible Dynasty Mattress next.
 It's great!
 This Mattress is ok, it does not have exceptional quality and it is not uncomfortable. It is worth the price but that is all, it like the rest of Mattress companies, over hyped just to get more sales, honesty is hard to find today. This product is not a bad product, but it won't make you sleep any better than a similar priced mattress.
 Absolutely fantastic. Have been dealing with neck, back and hip discomfort while trying to sleep, as well as overheating, causing a great deal of thrashing about and repositioning every night. No more. I had concerns about buying a mattress I'd never tried in person, particularly because I'm a fussy princess who can't ever get comfortable, anywhere, ever. This bed is the greatest and most awesome bed I've ever experienced. I have zero complaints. Zero!<br/><br/>UPDATE - 2017<br/><br/>When one of our raccoons did some damage to the mattress, Tuft&amp;Needle replaced it. It was not covered under any sort of warranty, they just did it from sheer awesomeness. It's been years now of sleeping on their product and I couldn't possibly be happier.
 We were in so much pain we returned it ASAP
 From all of the five star reviews on this mattress I thought this mattress was going to make me feel like I was floating on clouds. Unfortunately, it was less like clouds and more like a very dense, and stale, marshmallow.<br/><br/>I was fine with it at first, and considered keeping it, but then I realized that there was a weird cavity in the middle of it that the fabric part of the mattress stretched over. In the photos I took, you can see how the box is supported on all other parts of the mattress, but in that middle part, dips down. (You wouldn't be able to tell there was a defect just by looking at it, because the fabric stretches over that layer.)<br/><br/>Fortunately, customer service at Amazon is top-notch and they issued me a refund without any hassle.
 This is a very firm mattress that does not conform or adjust to the body or position like the manufacturer describes. This mattress is also the hottest mattress I have every slept on. I am unsure what cool foam or heating wicking is but it does not work for me or my wife. I was so excited to get this mattress I have read so many positive reviews on that I was absolutely shocked that I was unable to sleep 3 hours on this horrible mattress and forced to sleep on the couch to get through to morning. There is nothing notable or groundbreaking with this mattress and I have little doubt that I could have saved $100 buying the king foam mattress in a box at Costco with less problems.<br/>My current problem is returning this monstrosity. As it is purchased through Amazon, the return goes through Amazon. Amazon it seems is not prepared to return this item and has no process to facilitate the return. As the foam mattress expands at least 5 times it no longer fits inside the shipping box and short of spending an unreasonable sum on a king size mattress box I was able to modify a refrigerator box to get this mattress returned. Though I started the return process on May 12th the morning I woke up, it is now May 18th and I have a useless mattress taking up half my garage. I can never recommend this mattress. However, if it must be purchased, or it directly from the Tuft and Needle factory site as apparently they send a courier to pick up the mattress if you are not satisfied.
 This mattress is very uncomfortable and lacks support.. I was wanting to send back but can't figure out how your suppose to fit it in the box as no way will it fit in the box it came in plus no way to shrink wrap.. I feel like it was a total waste of money very disappointed in the service for return.
 Not good for people with discs problems, I personally found the mattress to be too firm and hard for my actual need. I realized that the description said firm, but this is a totally different level.
 Great mattress, much better than our previously brand new mattress that we returned for this. Definitely a great buy. Plus, it's kitten approved.
 I'm disappointed it is to soft
 Okay. So I did extensive research for weeks on the internet trying to find the "perfect" mattress without breaking the bank. Ultimately I settled on this mattress due to the claim that it was not hot, could be delivered with Prime, and it wasn't super expensive.<br/>Although it did arrive quickly and was easy to unroll and place on the frame, it is a terrible mattress. Probably the stiffest piece of furniture I have ever had the displeasure to place my body on. No give whatsoever. It did not contour to my body at all. It was also very hot. A typical memory foam mattress. My husband and I ended up ordering a gel foam topper for it just to sleep on it. It was going to be WAY too hard to return it (trying to get it out of the house, vacuum sealed, etc).<br/>If you like sleeping on a concrete slab, this is for you. Otherwise, consider other options.
 I can’t believe this mattress is a Consumer Reports Best Buy. This mattress chemically off-gasses terribly. If you have asthma, allergies, headaches, sensitivities, or just like to breathe clean air you should make another choice.
 We bought this mattress around a year ago. When we purchased the mattress, the packaging and unpackaging was really amazing. The first impressions of the mattress were very good; it was soft but firm at the same time. We were getting good night rests with this mattress and at the time were satisfied with the purchase.<br/><br/>However, things changed after around 6 months. The mattress started to form the typical canoe when lying on the mattress and no longer was able to support our body weights. This caused us to have severe back pain, and lack of sleep. Unfortunately, the indentation and canoe formation was only present when we were lying on the bed so we were not able to activate the warranty, and it was already past the trial period for the mattress.<br/><br/>We no longer use this mattress because of these issues. Just beware that it might be good in the beginning but there is a chance the mattress feel will change after a couple of months.
 I have had my tuft and needle mattress for roughly 2.5 years. It was a college graduation gift from my parents who LOVE their tuft and needle. However I think I must have gotten a defective model, after trying everything in my power to get comfortable and sleep though the night on this has been impossible. I don’t understand. The reason I am doing this review 2.5 years later is to update on this mattress. We have turned it, flipped it, my husband and I have switched the sides of the bed we even sleep on, and nothing has helped.  This confuses me because, well housesitting at my parents house I have slept on the bed and it is extremely comfortable, my best friend also has a tuft needle mattress, also very comfortable and I’ve been able to sleep on that mattress fine. My husband is a stomach sleeper and I am a back sleeper, and we weigh 155 and 120 perspectively. We family had bought this directly from the site and I have seen other reviews stating it could be a bad batch of the foam! Will update if I have any other changes!<br/><br/>UPDATE: After talking with their customer service about my mattress, btw they were SUPER nice, they assessed my situation and are sending me a mattress topper to help!!! Amazing! Will update on the comfort of my tuft and needle!!
 Queen sheets do not fit full bed. That is very strange. King sheets are tight. Would be great if we were not expecting full mattress to fit full platform. So maters is on floor for now
 Had this mattress for a month, my back is killing me.
 My Husband: Bye bye back pain! Me: I have never slept this comfortably while pregnant! We absolutely LOVE our new mattress! I waited close to a month to make sure I gave enough time to give a fair and honest review. I'm not good with being brief but I'll do my best-- my husband has had back pain for the past 10 years. We are both in our early 30s. We visited a well known mattress store over the summer and the salesman told us our current pillowtop mattress was likely to blame as it provided next to zero support on his back and joints. We had never even considered leaning towards a firmer mattress but started researching it more after that initial conversation with him. And after testing a couple out we realized firmer would be a much better fit for us. I never had issues with back pain but I had problem with tossing and turning 800 times during the night! I could never seem to get and STAY comfortable. We tested out multiple mattresses that we liked. What we didn't enjoy was the price tag on those mattresses. Enter: Google. I did a simple search for best affordable mattresses and came across Tuft and Needle. I immediately fell in love with the company. After reading lots of reviews and watching you tube videos of people testing out the mattress I decided this mattress would be perfect for us. Best part was that it was under our budget! Beautiful music to my penny penching husband's ears. The price and money back guarantee were a huge deal to him. Well, the mattress arrived a day early and we will likely begin celebrating the anniversary of that date because it has changed our life! Seriously. I am 8 months pregnant with our second child and have been sleeping more comfortably than I ever have before!! I credit it 100% to this mattress. I don't toss or turn at all! And even better -- I don't even feel it when my husband moves or gets out of bed in the morning. I wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead. My husband, someone who has complained for the past four years of our marriage about all his aches and pains in his back, has not complained once since we received this mattress. I asked him for his honest opinion of the mattress so I could share it on here and he said it was one of the best purchases we've ever made. He's extremely happy with it and only regrets that we hadn't found Tuft and Needle sooner. Even if you think you prefer soft, pillow-y mattresses, I would urge you to give this one a try. By no means is it cushiony. I would say it's about a 7 out of 10 on firmness scale but it forms to your body just enough to make sure feel supported without feeling like you're laying on a board. To us, the bed still feels "soft" while being extremely supportive. I can't think of a person who wouldn't enjoy the way this bed sleeps! I hope this review helps you make your decision. The reviews were what helped give me the confidence to move forward with the purchase so I wanted to pay it forward and provide my own review now that I've experienced the mattress for myself.
 After friends of ours purchased 4 of these earlier this fall and we got a chance to test them out - I was well on my way to being sold on Tuft &amp; Needle as a brand. We ordered our December as a joint xmas gift to ourselves, then left on vacation. Once back, the set up couldn't be easier. I opened it, and let it air out on its side for the day and we slept on it that night. From the start both of us loved it. Since I tend to like a more firm and he likes a softer one the mattress was a perfect hit to keep up both pleased. Only a minor "new" smell on occasion (mostly when we pull the covers down after the bed was made all day), which was similar to how Fabreeze smells to me - but within a week it was gone.  For the price and service - you can't beat this. The website is great and provides lots of useful information. The Bed comes compressed and rolled up in a large box - so depending on your strength you may or may not need help getting up any stairs. I don't recommend opening it until you are in the room you want it in (or close by) just for the ease of movement. Run, don't walk! We are now several weeks in and I think I am sleeping betting than I have in some time. Note - I am a bigger guy so for those of you wondering about weight issues - not even a worry. Not is the overheating - I don't feel it runs any hotter than a regular mattress to me.
 We just bought the full size Tuft &amp; Needle on the  2/12/18, it was at our door in 2 days we didn't pay for shipping.<br/>We bought it for our murphys bed (wall bed) the original mattress was not comfortable.<br/>My husband had a back fusion 19 years ago and just had shoulder surgery on 2/13/2018.<br/>He was not able to sleep threw the night on his back or side because of his shoulders made his arms fall asleep.<br/>We did all the reviews on YouTube and found the one best for side sleepers. Walla we found the Most comfortable bed Mattress<br/>possible within our financial means. We have 100 days to return no questions asked.<br/>I dont think it will ever go back, because He has slept threw the night for the first time in over 19 years.<br/>We Highly Recommend this Mattress!!!
 This mattress looks GREAT on a bed. Good, sharp lines. Excellent for staging a house.<br/><br/>If you actually want to sleep on it for more than six months...run away. First few months were great, but now you sink so far into the mattress that there's no support. It's not comfortable at all and we wake up feeling sore and not well rested.<br/><br/>I wish I'd listened to all the reviews to this effect. About to buy my second mattress in 12 months because this is unlivable. My kids all have cheaper, no-name brand foam mattresses from Amazon that are miles better than this overpriced product.
 Honestly, this is terrible. It's VOC (volatile organic compound) overkill. It's probably the same for all the other foam mattresses. I had a headache and couldn't sleep on it, even after 2 weeks of airing it out. TERRIBLE. I started researching, and it's all about polyurethane etc. - and there is a youtube video of a guy measuring the VOC levels in the mattress. They are about 150 times (!) higher than indoor standard levels. That's ridiculous. Even if they air out to some degree over time, do you really want to sleep on a thing that was fundamentally toxic before? I am especially mad because I researched this, and there are so many reports how "green" T&amp;N is. Ridiculous. I am mad. Return and Amazon was great, though.
 I've had this bed for over two years now and I LOVE IT. It is comfortable and I haven't had any issues with indentations, depressions, or any sort of sagging. I didn't find it to be either too hard or too soft initially or now. I worried it would be like sleeping on a rock, and perhaps it's because my previous bed was a memory foam that it didn't feel so hard to me? I don't have back pain and I've slept like a log on this thing for a while. I'm confused by reviews that state otherwise, honestly. I've had many beds over the course of my life and this is my favorite by far.
 I'll start by saying I bought this directly from their website, not Amazon. Shipping was fast - it literally arrived the next day. Unwrapping it was easy, and it fully inflated within half an hour. There was a slight chemical smell, but I let it air for 48 hours before sleeping on it and didn't experience any issues. It was difficult to move as one person - not too heavy, but the lack of handles made it hard to get through doorways once it was expanded.<br/><br/>When I first laid down on it, my impression was of medium firmness - basically hotel mattress-like. I'm a larger person - 220lb, 5'5" - with broad hips and shoulders. On my back, it was perfectly supportive. Stomach, same thing. Side... I could definitely feel the base foam. It wasn't uncomfortable, exactly, but it felt like there was a layer missing. There was also no bounce - while it's "bouncier" than memory foam, it's not actually bouncy. It's difficult to describe. I wouldn't say it's a negative, just something to be aware of.<br/><br/>Because of the sensation of a layer missing, I had to buy a topper. I didn't get this from T&amp;N, just a company on Amazon. With the memory foam topper, the missing layer sensation disappeared. It also gave some extra softness to the mattress, which I very much like. I've slept on it for two weeks now, and it's still very comfortable. Supportive, but also not too firm. I'd like it if it was a bit softer and bouncier, but I expect it'll soften a bit with time. I haven't noticed any issues with heat retention or smell (past the first couple of days, anyway), even with a memory foam topper.<br/><br/>I'd give it 5 stars, but I feel the mattress is incomplete. Without the topper, it wouldn't be comfortable because of that "missing layer." I don't want to return it because the topper makes it work for me, but I think it's important to call that out. If you are a side-sleeper, larger person, or like a softer bed, you will probably need a topper to make this work.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Fast shipping<br/>- Excellent value<br/>- Good support, even for larger people<br/>- Universal comfort "feel"<br/>- No heat retention<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Feels like there is a layer missing<br/>- Not designed for side sleepers<br/>- No edge support
 Update.....<br/>Called back &amp;  s/t  mgr .  I am now getting full  credit AND  I can keep mattress if i like ....<br/><br/>Amazon goes from "0"  to 5 stars  !!!!!!<br/><br/>Than you  Dequan
 I love my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress! I was dealing with back pain due to my old spring filled mattress. I decided to try this product and now I can't say enough after sleeping on it for several weeks. I'm not in pain anymore and sleep soundly. I read up on the company too and love everything they are about! Great product for an even better price. I could go on and on and I'm not one to write reviews. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new mattress!!!!
 After extensive research we bought BOTH the Tuft &amp; Needle and the Leesa.<br/><br/>Firmness - you "float" more on the T&amp;N, while you "sink" more in the Leesa (but not as much as in a Tempur-Pedic)  The 2016 Leesa is a touch firmer; I heard that T&amp;N's made before 2015 were very firm.<br/><br/>Off-gasing - the smell definitely lasted longer with the Leesa.<br/>Expansion - the Leesa took three days to expand to 10", the T&amp;N was immediate.<br/><br/>Packaging - Leesa's did not include separate instructions aside from what's listed on the box. The packaging was also slightly damaged. The T&amp;N box is more appealing, but who cares as I cut-up both after set-up.<br/><br/>Cooling - the T&amp;N is cooler.  I'm concerned about the Leesa as I'm already warm and it hasn't hit 90 degrees yet.<br/><br/>Edge support - Leesa's is stronger<br/>Mattress Cover - Leesa's is much nicer, but they don't recommend removing it.  We also purchased a SafeRest waterproof cover, so I hope the mattress doesn't get too hot as we're going to place it over the included cover.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/King-Size-SafeRest-Premium-Hypoallergenic-Waterproof-Mattress-Protector-Vinyl-Free/dp/B003PWK2A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">King Size SafeRest Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector - Vinyl Free</a><br/><br/>Customer Service - MUCH longer hold times with Leesa.  The T&amp;N reps are very friendly and seem to know their product better.<br/><br/>Price - T&amp;N wins<br/>Return policy - both offer a 100-day trial, but Leesa requires that you keep for at least 30 days.  For those with little room, keeping a King mattress you don't want is a problem.<br/><br/>Overall, the quality of the Leesa feels just a bit better.  And since we're going to keep it for 8-10 years, the extra $165 might be justified.
 I would love to tell you guys that this is the mattress you should buy, but I'm done convincing myself that it's a good mattress.  I am a 180 pound stomach sleeping man, and this thing has absolutely no support. It will sag your spine and I can no longer sleep in the same bed as my wife. The sheer pain this has caused my back is enough for me to sleep on the couch. I would rather sleep on a concrete floor then wake up repeatedly through the night with terrible back pain.<br/><br/>Pros: You can jump on the one side of the bed with no affect on your partner.<br/><br/>Cons: It has no support. If you like a firm bed, do not buy.<br/><br/>Regardless of what they say, this mattress is very very hot. It doesn't breathe. If you are a hot sleeper like myself, I highly recommend staying away.<br/><br/>Becareful of ruining your box spring. As this mattress doesn't have much support, even getting on your bed with the slightest bit of roughness will risk you breaking your box springs. My wife and I have had to buy two new sets in 5 months, with us being very cautious about not breaking them.<br/><br/>Unless you are a side sleeper, this mattress is not for you. My wife absolutely loves it, as she is a side sleeper and 80 pounds lighter then me. If you weight over 170+ pounds, invest in something that will actually hold up your weight. I regret buying this mattress, and can't tell my wife how much I hate it without causing a fight. Avoid the hassle, spend the extra money, and have a good sleep.
 We ordered our Tuft &amp; Needle king sized mattress directly from Tuft &amp; Needle. Since there's no place to put a review there (that I could find), I thought I'd put one here. We had previously owned an innerspring mattress and an air mattress.My husband and I are both, I guess, medium sized people. He's definitely leaner and more muscular than me, but neither of us is either tiny/skinny or huge. I sleep on my side, and he sleeps on either side or back.<br/><br/>I did read on the T&amp;N site and here about the mattress needing time to "break in." This seemed a little odd to me at first, but then I remembered when we bought our couch, it was definitely much firmer at first than after a month or so. I guess it's just how foam is.<br/><br/>So - on to the mattress experience! First, I got an email from the company even before the mattress had arrived, thanking me for the purchase and asking what I was hoping/looking for in a mattress. I responded and they actually answered me! The mattress came pretty quickly. While heavy, my husband carried it upstairs alone, and it was pretty easy to unpack and get on the bed. Size is perfect: fits our bed frame, box springs and sheets. I laid down on it and wow! So cushy and comfortable! I thought, "How can people say this is too firm?" There was a very small amount of off-gassing, so we let it air out a few hours before making the bed.<br/><br/>We slept on it the first night, and YES, it was VERY FIRM! I'm not sure how a mattress that feels so cushy initially can feel so firm when you lie on it all night! It improved noticeably in softness the second night. After about a week, it was definitely softer, but still firm enough that I was feeling pressure points sometimes in my hips and shoulders. So we took the memory foam top layer from our old air mattress and used it as a topper. This definitely helped.<br/><br/>However, one month from my order, I got an email from T&amp;N asking how we liked the mattress. I emailed back and said that the jury was still out - I was still getting the occasional pressure point. They emailed back immediately and asked if I would like to have their topper at no charge to see if that solved the issue. I agreed, and they shipped it right out. We put the T&amp;N topper on the mattress one month to the day after getting the mattress. That was two weeks ago.<br/><br/>The topper took a day or two to reach full softness, but it did help immediately (as much or more than the old topper), and now (after 6 weeks with the mattress and two with the new topper) the mattress and T&amp;N topper very comfortable. No more pressure points in the last week!<br/><br/>I will say also that some people had mentioned the edges being so soft they couldn't sit on the edge of the bed. We have not had any issues with that at all. The edges are soft, but not such that it makes me slide off when I sit on the edge to put on socks or whatever. And our bed is pretty highs, so I really am sitting on the edge, with my toes just touching the floor.
 Be very careful when moving the mattress, it doesn't clean well at all. I moved it in a friends truck, should've used a tarp, I can't get the stains out.
 SO SOFT, NOT SURE HOW TUFT AND NEEDLE GETS GOOD REVIEWS....THIS BED IS TOO SOFT TO BE CALLED A MATTRESS...UNLESS YOU ARE HILLBILLY, STAY AWAY.......have had Tempurpedic Mattresses for years, which are over-priced, but the Tuft and Needle is too soft ..
 The corner are to soft and the middle to hard?
 I didn't like it.
 Went with zinus 12in green tea on are second mattress purchase and there are much cheaper and better !
 I’ve had my Tuft &amp; Needle 2 years now (since spring of 2017) the company itself is so great and has seriously  AWESOME customer service and support. However as much as I’ve wanted to love this mattress, I can’t get over the fact that it sleeps hot. Even my 5 year old complains about waking up too hot every night.<br/>I’ve tried it with an expensive wool mattress protector in hopes that would help mitigate some of the heat, but it did not. I’ve tried every type of sheet and comforter combination (down blanket, wool, cotton) and none helped. I’m finally giving in and looking for a new mattress to help me get some cool sleep.<br/>It is very comfortable and for the first few hours of sleep a night it is heavenly. Then the heat starts to set in and become trapped. In the summer it’s awful.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>Very comfortable.<br/>Easy to transport in a mid size hatchback car.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>Sleeps hot.<br/>Arrives with a strong odor and needs weeks to air out. (It finally started to be odor neaurtal after about a year)
 First of all, T&amp;N customer service is OUTSTANDING.<br/><br/>Their mattress is very clearly high quality. Very light occasional chemical scent for the first couple nights, then nothing. Easy to set up, amazingly small package when delivered, fits and holds sheets well.<br/><br/>I'm a side sleeper and prefer a softer mattress, something that will let my hips and shoulders sink in quite a bit and keep my back aligned. Unfortunately the T&amp;N, while clearly a high quality mattress, simply is too firm for me. I'm a 240lb guy and even so I'm not getting much give, these must feel like a solid board to lighter people. If you're a back or stomach sleeper, you'll probably be fine but if you're a side sleeper like me, expect some shoulder and hip pain. I asked T&amp;N if there was a way to soften the mattress or a box spring they could recommend that would soften it, and they immediately and without charge sent out a mattress topper. Looking forward to trying it, as the mattress as-is, is painful and will not be kept. Please note that this is NOT a fault of the mattress, just firmness preferences.<br/><br/>A++++ on the customer service.<br/><br/>Edit 9/6/16: Topper arrived, made a world of difference. Would still prefer it be softer but I'll almost certainly be keeping the mattress at this point. If you need a medium or soft mattress, this is not the mattress for you.
 I ordered this mattress directly from Tuft &amp; Needle to take advantage of their 100-Day Trial on Monday and received it on Wednesday.  Wow!  Unpacking was easy and the mattress inflated in a few seconds and was firm enough to sheet and test.  I almost fell asleep in the 30 minutes I was testing the mattress!  I've never owned a foam mattress and this mattress definitely did not feel like how I thought a foam mattress would feel (mushy, saggy, blah).  The only time it feels like a foam mattress is when you're getting out of bed and all your weight is concentrated in one spot on the edge, but that's probably to be expected in any mattress other than inner-spring.  I usually sleep close to the edge, and this mattress holds up fine all the way to the edge.  This mattress is soft, but firm.  You sink-in just enough.  The support is nice and even, no pressure points, and no zones (place head here, place buttocks here...).  I often wake up in the same position as when I went to sleep.<br/><br/>I'll definitely update this review after sleeping on the mattress for a few months.  As of now, 2 thumbs up!<br/><br/>Update:  After about 30 nights sleeping on this mattress, I love it!  But my wife does not.  I'm a back sleeper, she's a side-sleeper and feels that this mattress is too firm.  We tried a memory foam topper for her, but she's still not getting a good night's sleep.  So, sadly to say, we are returning the Queen-Size.  We've decided to get 2 twin mattresses and get a King-frame.  I'll be ordering a Tuft &amp; Needle XL Twin for myself, and she'll just get something else from a mattress store.  It's great that Tuft &amp; Needle has an excellent return policy, so we are both still happy customers.
 (I went to the Scottsdale location)<br/>Tuft &amp; Needle is too good to be true.<br/><br/>I will admit they are very friendly, however, when it comes to providing correct information. They tell you what you want to hear instead of telling you what you need to hear.<br/><br/>Not only did the in-store employees feed me misinformation, they did nothing to even try to make it right.<br/><br/>I cam into the store ready to buy a mattress at full price. Had no clue they did financing and instead they talked me into doing financing because there is a 0% interest rate if you do 3 or 6 months.<br/><br/>I get home to try it and upon approval of my 3 month financing at 0%. It turns out that was not at all the case. They determined that because they use "a bunch of different factors" to take into account whether they can finance you. That I wouldn't qualify for 0% interest financing.<br/><br/>The employees in the store made no mention of this whatsoever! They gave me the impression that all you had to do was sign up online and you'll have 0% APR financing.<br/><br/>Not only that, but why I didn't qualify makes absolutely no sense. My credit score is 774 and I have over $7k in savings. I originally came into to buy the mattress at full price but then my time was wasted with hopes that I could just make monthly payments at no extra cost.<br/><br/>When contacting Tuft &amp; Needle they pushed the blame onto their financing partner Affirm. Easy way out of saying we did nothing wrong and can't do anything. After speaking to multiple different people and even a manager at support. They weren't even willing to offer a discount for them misleading me and for their employees not being knowledgeable enough to warn people about this.<br/><br/>If they just would have been honest from the get go I would already be sleeping on their mattress. Instead I'll be purchasing a better mattress from a better company with better customer service. Thank goodness their true colors showed before I got stuck with their mattress for 10 years. I bet warranties through these guys are even more atrocious.<br/><br/>I would not trust Tuft &amp; Needle! There is a reason why they advertise so hard.
 I purchased the King T&amp;N Mattress in January 2016.  It arrived promptly and served me well for over three years.  Recently, I found small beads were appearing in the top of the mattress.  I contacted T&amp;N directly and after sending them a few pictures they promptly shipped a replacement mattress for me!  Their service is spectacular and they have a customer for life in me!  So happy to have a Tuft and Needle mattress!
 So I've had this mattress for about a year and half now. When I first received it I thought the mattress was way too firm. I should have returned it during the 100 day free trial but wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. The shipped and setup were great though! It was fun to open my mattress and have it instantly inflate before my eyes. I even took a few fun pictures and videos of the unboxing. And the price for the mattress was almost half of the others I was looking at. I guess you get what you pay for though.<br/><br/>After a year and a half the mattress has slightly softened but is still on the firm/hard side. I purchased a plush mattress protector to help but it doesn't do that much to offset the firmness, next I will probably need to buy a topper. My other complaint is that there are obvious indents now of two bodies that you can feel when you lay down. I understand that it is getting "worn in" but it actually causes a lot of discomfort if you move and happen to lay in the middle of the two indents as it causes a hard ridge to form in the middle. I emailed the customer service and they were friendly but said this is normal wear of the mattress. For me though it is very uncomfortable and I probably would not recommend to friends and family to  buy a Tuft and Needle anymore.<br/><br/>I will now search Amazon for a good mattress topper and if that fails, I will need to throw this one away and go with another brand if I keep waking up with pain.
 I LOVE IT!  I've had my Tuft &amp; Needle mattress now for almost 3 years.  It is my most favorite purchase ever.  I chose it over the other online mattresses because of the reviews about their customer service.  I was very pleased with my experience from Tuft &amp; Needle- ordering and answering questions about the trial period.  The first night I slept on it was probably the hardest I've slept in my life.  You, of course, get used to it over time, and you don't think about how great you felt the first time you slept on it and maybe you forget how amazing it is because it's part of your daily routine now.  But then you travel and sleep on any other mattress.  And you're immediately reminded of how absolutely incredible your Tuft &amp; Needle mattress is!!<br/><br/>This mattress has it all.  It gives in all the right places, conforming to your body, with a quick response if you move around (unlike memory foam that has a slow response, leaving you stuck in your indentation).  It yet is also firm and supportive!  It sleeps incredibly cool.  You can use your old box spring with it if you don't have a platform bed.  And best of all, the price was sooooo right.<br/><br/>My last mattress was already sagging by year 3.  It cost the same as this mattress.  I will never go back to the mattress stores for another ripoff, if I ever need to buy one again.  I have a feeling this mattress will last me a very, very long time!
 My God, O wasted $475.00<br/>This mattress is to hard, everything hearts after sleeping on it.
 For the past 3 years i've slept on a cheap and relatively thin mattress that is honestly closer to a mattress pad or futon pad than an actual mattress. In the beginning I liked it because it was firm and didn't break the bank. After a few years, the padding began to collapse in the middle which caused a few problems. When two people slept on the bed, they'd roll to the middle and wouldn't be able to stretch out and have space. Also, I'm a stomach sleeper so sleeping in what was essentially a bowl was beginning to cause me terrible back pain. I'm 28 and in great shape so for me to feel like I'm 75 every day because my hips and lower back are throbbing is not acceptable. I began looking into memory foam mattresses and doing some research via Amazon reviews and youtube videos. After such stellar reviews of both the mattresses and the Tuft and Needle team, I eventually decided to go for it. Lei C from their customer service support was very helpful when I needed purchase confirmation and tracking info emailed to me. I just moved to a new city so I had the mattress shipped there and it was waiting for me when I arrived a few days later. After cutting open the plastic it quickly inflates in a matter of seconds and was ready to be used. That night, coupled with my exhaustion from moving all day, I had one of the best nights sleep of my life. I would typically wake up sweating a few times a night and have to fan myself and adjust my blankets accordingly but I slept soundly throughout the night and woke up refreshed. Once I got up I noticed that I had zero back pain after only ONE NIGHT sleeping on it. It's been about a week now and I couldn't be happier with the purchase as it has literally changed my day to day life. Something else that speaks to the mattress' ability to regulate temperature is that I have a 90lb wolf hybrid who will literally start panting if I so much as turn my oven on. For this reason he typically likes to keep to himself and would never really lie on my bed with me because he would get too hot. In the past week he's taken over my bed and has basically claimed it for himself. He even lies in it with me now which is something that never use to happen so I have this mattress to thank for bringing my big furry child and I closer together. If you're considering a new mattress I couldn't recommend this one any more. Thank you Tuft and Needle!
 Not the bed for us.  You get what you pay for
 Let me start off by saying that the mattress is by far one of the best I've ever owned. Super comfortable, stays relatively cool while sleeping, and was easy to set up. That being said, Amazon dropped the ball on this one. I've ordered tons of stuff in the past and they have always been quick to ship. Not this time. It took almost a week to even process the order! Of course the payment was deducted immediately, but the processing was painfully slow. I, and my significant other both work at an Amazon warehouse and know all about everything that happens there. No excuse for the delayed processing. Without that I would have given 5 stars right away.
 We’ve slept in a Tuft and Needle for a bit more than a year and I am writing this review from the floor because it’s more comfortable than our mattress. I’ve been waking up at night from the back pain this mattress is causing. I know it’s the mattress because I recently stayed in an Airbnb that had a cheap old coil mattress and woke up with no back pain for three nights in a row! This mattress was fine at first, but (like other receivers have mentioned) and started to break down after just a couple of months. Now, there are noticeable craters where my husband and I sleep (he had back pain as well) and my hips sink so far into it that it feels like sleeping in quicksand. Also, I didn’t understand what “Edge support” meant from other reviews, but I figured it out the first time I sat down on this thing. If you try to sit on the edge with your feet on the ground, you sink right down to the bed frame and/or just roll right off.<br/>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does sleep very cool (unlike the Casper we tried, which was just as uncomfortable but also hot). And, the price and easy if shipping and unboxing is definitely worth mentioning.<br/>Before this we had a sleep number, which was the most comfortable bed we’ve ever slept on, but after about 5 years had broken down too bad to keep using. Before that I slept on an old coil mattress for 15 years and that thing is still at my mom’s house as good as new.
 Just had my first night with my Tuft and Needle King mattress and so far I like it.<br/><br/>I didn't buy the mattress from Amazon, but from T&amp;N directly because if I didn't like it, T&amp;N makes the return much easier.<br/><br/>My first night was a good one. With all the furniture moving, taking out the old mattress and boxspring, making adjustments to my existing bed set, which is a queen, so I could put in a king platform bed frame, putting together that frame, getting the T&amp;N mattress ready, etc, my back was feeling it and usually that means the next day I have terrible back pain after sleeping on my old mattress. FYI, that was the case with that mattress from day one. After sleeping on the T&amp;N mattress, my back was sore, but not in pain where it was hard to walk. I think it helped and that is a welcome change and that is worth more than $750.<br/><br/>I am using this foundation.<br/><br/>https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B017YETI16/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Below are some observations.<br/><br/>- The setup was as advertised and when you break the seal, the bed inflates in less than a minute, but they say continue to let it expand for 2 to 3 hours before using it. We did test it out for a few minutes before letting it sit for 3 hours. They also say to not put things on it that reduce breathability, like a mattress protector, for 1 to 2 days, so I haven't put mine on yet.<br/><br/>- This bed is firm, possibly more firm than other foam mattresses based on what I have read.<br/><br/>- I am heavy, over 400lbs and I was concerned I would sink in this bed, but other than when I am sitting on the edge, I don't sink. I stay on top with it conforming to me and I am able to move without feeling like I have to pull myself out of a hole.<br/><br/>- My one real issue is the sides don't support well, you can slide off, but there is a positive. I can get out of bed real easy, no falling, I will describe it like popping off the end of a slide that's not low to the ground. I have read in some reviews that the sides get better, but even T&amp;N notes that they don't install extra edge support, so it may get better, but probably won't be like my last mattress. Therefore, don't get a size where you have to sleep on the edge. Our last bed was a queen and we both ended up sleeping on the edge at times, so we would likely have issues with the Queen. With the king, me, my wife and our son can be on it with room to spare.<br/><br/>- Being over 400lbs and fat, my rear is pretty large and while I feel supported correctly, when laying on my back it would be nice if that part sunk more. This may get better over time as they say the break in period is two weeks, but the reality is that if it sinks too much, it would likely be harder for me to move around and there could be other issues like additional heat.<br/><br/>- T&amp;N states the king will hold 1000lbs, 500lbs per person and with my experience, I believe it. It's one of the reasons I invested time in researching this mattress.<br/><br/>- I can't really speak to the bed pulling heat away. I am using Nestl sheets, which are listed on the T&amp;N site and we love them so far, and I didn't sleep hot, but we are in the cool part of the year. The real test will be when it get's warmer.<br/><br/>I plan to update this review periodically.<br/>- After two weeks to see if it's the same, better or worse.<br/>- When the weather is hot and perhaps.<br/>- Over time to let you know how it lasts.<br/><br/>So far, I am loving this purchase and my fears about buying a T&amp;N mattress without trying it first are gone.<br/><br/>This is my shopping story and I hope it helps you.<br/><br/>We are frugal and usually keep mattresses well past their comfort end date. This is something I want to change, but I don't want that to mean we replace the mattress often, regardless if that is through warranty or an expense, but especially not if it's an expense. We checked out some Ikea mattresses and they were fine, but to me more of the same. I wanted to find something better. I stared looking online, Casper, Ghost Bed, Leesa, Purple, etc and I'd say that Purple had my attention, but I became less convinced after seeing some comparisons of those beds. The down side to those beds, is you can't try before you buy and while they all have a trial, that is an investment money, time and effort. We tried some others at local stores and we not impressed.<br/><br/>Then I dragged my wife to the sleep number bed store. I like technology and options and having a bed with the ability to change the firmness level could be great. I would say I was impressed by the bed comfort at different hardness levels, but not wowed and for those prices I want to be wowed. Additionally, those remotes were terrible. With as long as they have been doing this, I figured they would have the one piece of electronic technology solid. I would select a setting and it might do nothing, or it might act like it will do something and then do nothing, or it might partially do what I set. I would say 3/5ths of the time it worked and the other 2/5ths it failed especially of my wife and I were changing settings at the same time and that was with multiple beds. I am not saying this will be your experience, but it was mine. The model to get was a high end model, if I understand their models, it was their best or 2nd best, because a discount brought the price down to around $3k, it's normally around $5k. My wife came out of her skin. I balked, but I am a little more accepting of paying more if you get something worthwhile that you can't get for less, if we can afford without creating debt or giving up things we need. Surprisingly, my wife was turned around when the sales person mentioned the 25 year warranty and I was as well. At least I was until I read it.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not an attorney and I cannot confirm that what I read is current or accurate. I strongly suggest you read the warranty before coming to a conclusion. These are my interpretations from what I read and I do not list them to help you make a decision about this product, but to encourage you to read the warranty and other documents and understand them before your buy.<br/> - Ambiguous terms are used to describe what was covered and to me they could cover nothing.Now the likely hood is they probably will cover some things for a time, but they leave room to play the game. Meaning they can change what they cover to keep their image up and avoid lawsuits.<br/> -  As I understand what I read, they explicitly do not indentations in the foam, not the first year or any year.<br/> -  Therefore, I concluded that they only cover the mattress cover, the air bladders and anything else that isn't foam for the 25 years, but I guess if the foam has some other defect that is not just an indentation.<br/> - The 25 year warranty is prorated. It covers at 100% for 2 years and then at year 3 you pay more than 20% and it goes up every year.<br/> - If the unit that airs up the mattress has what they call Sleep IQ it has a different warranty which is only 2 years, if I am remembering correctly.<br/> - Please read all the documents and come to your own conclusions.<br/><br/>With Sleep Number beds being off my list, I went back to research and I googled for the purple bed again since that was my leading choice. In the results there was an article that stated something like, don't buy purple until you read this. That link took me to info about T&amp;N. I was impressed with T&amp;N.<br/><br/>- They seem transparent in their design and policies.<br/>- They have a less is more approach, but is not always true, but my experience so far is that it is.<br/>- Their warranty seems very explicit that they cover things like indentations. Again I am not an attorney, so read it and come to your own conclusions.<br/>- They list the weight limits of their mattresses and to me that is amazing with the warranty as I understand it.<br/>- Their FAQs are useful, not just CYA and make T&amp;N look good including providing links to what I think are great accessories.<br/>- Sent them an email to verify that their warrant covers everything at the listed mattress weight limits and that having the mattress sideways the head and foot of the mattress are the sides for us so we have it as 80" wide and 76" long. The response I received was perfect, all questions answered clearly and not CYA for T&amp;N. The response, even said "Feel free to print this email out and keep it as a copy of the warranty."<br/><br/>Now for all I know T&amp;N may be great at selling a lie, their warranty could not cover what I think or they know how to get around it legally and what they email said may not carry any weight, I can't know for sure. However, I have the mattress and so far it is exceeding expectations.<br/><br/>Update 2017-02-27<br/><br/>Been using the bed for eight days and it still holds me as well as it did on day one and I am able to move well. Even on my knees I sink very little and it handles "special activities" without issue. I have been getting more used to the bed, so my body is adjusting and/or it is contouring to me better. The sizes still sink a fair amount, but no so much that I feel the frame, but it does seem to have gotten better and it's comfortable. The corners sink a great deal, but again not enough to feel the frame and it's comfortable. The edges recover quickly return to normal height. I believe I will be keeping this mattress and I will update this review after I have had it for a while.
 First, I bought it directly from T&amp;N because of some reviews stated T&amp;N was not honoring their 90 day guarantee when purchasing from Amazon (some customers complained that if the mattress didn't work for them during the 90 day guarantee, T&amp;N wouldn't send anyone to pick it up from them and they had to take care of disposing of the mattress themselves).<br/><br/>I loved the mattress at first. Previously, I had a mattress that was too soft and was giving me extreme back pain so after reading so many raving reviews of pleased customers, I decided to buy this one. It worked wonderfully the first year, no more back pain. I'm about 2 years in and my back pain has returned- the mattress has become too soft. I wake up with extreme back and neck pain. Last night, I tossed and turned until 4 am not being able to find a comfortable position. I'm not sure what my options are but as much as I wanted to love this mattress, it's just impossible. My back pain is so severe that I started to go for adjustments and deep tissue massages. My massage therapist suggested I buy lumbar support to sleep on while he works on fixing my back. I've always been pretty flexible and the last few months, I can barely get out of bed and even stretching doesn't help at first. As the day goes on, the pain wears off and then the night comes again.<br/><br/>Also, I enjoy reading books at night in bed and I just can't do it on this mattress, my back is in too much pain and I feel like I sink in too much.
 At the insistance of my husband, we went with a queen size tuft and needle mattress as out old innerspring mattress was a painful nightmare. At first T&amp;N was an absolute dream. Several months in, I am ready to drag it into our yard and set it on fire. It sleeps so hot that I wake up absolutely drenched after a couple hours of sleep, even with central air conditioning that is knocked down to 72°F, a problem I had never experienced prior to the T&amp;N as I am actually a cold-natured person. I also have the worst spinal, scapular, hip and neck pain on a daily basis. I am so disappointed. This mattress was a huge investment for us, and I am extremely pissed that we are stuck with it for quite a while before we can afford to make a switch. I will never purchase another Tuft and Needle product!
 Tuft and Needle used to be my go-to mattress.  I purchased one on Craigslist, another on Let Go. Now, I had the original 5-inch mattress and it was great!  The newer mattress is too thick and bulky and it wears down after about 8-9 months and it is like sleeping on any mattress.  When I first started my journey for the best mattress, I was looking for the closest thing to a shikibuton, which reviews online said, it was.  Well, it may have been years ago, but it's not anymore.  I don't really have an answer, except the best mattress I ever purchased was a traditional skikibuton from Japan, at Authentic Japanese futons. Floor sleeping is better, but it takes the right combo... I wish tuft and needle would make a new skikibuton. Or at least a firmer, thinner mattress.. 10 inches seems like overkill and it's hard to manage the larger mattress for cleaning and turning... : (
 Hey.  I'm a real person.  And I actually bought the mattress.<br/><br/>My wife and I saw Tuft and Needle and were intrigued with the mattress and the company but very skeptical.  We didn't buy right away.  We went to a mattress sale at a local high school they were holding as a fundraiser to check it out and see what was out there.  It gave us the chance to try out all kinds of mattresses and really see what we wanted.  They had one foam mattress at the fundraiser but it cost $1900.00 (seriously) and it wasn't the fancy memory foam stuff (which was also on our list to look at but never got around to it).  What the experience did for us was solidify our opinion on how firm a mattress we wanted and that we couldn't find anything close to Tuft and Needle's price.  So we hesitantly decided to get the queen mattress from Tuft and Needle, not liking the idea of buying a mattress sight unseen (or un-felt).<br/><br/>The experience was great.  The price on the website was $600.  After all the taxes and fees and delivery it came out to.......$600!  Even.  Maybe that's not a big deal to most but it was a comforting feeling that they didn't tack on a bunch of extra charges and I end up paying another $50+and left with a bitter taste in my mouth.  The shipping was fast.  I honestly can't remember how long it was but only a few days and it arrived when they said it would.  We were starting to get excited so I would have hated to wait longer than expected.  It came in a box, we drug it up the stairs and opened it.  I immediately thought I got the wrong size because it was shrunken so much.  After I cut it open, it fluffed right up and seemed like it was ready to go even though some things I have read said wait this amount of time or that.  We laid on it and it felt great.  Side note:  They included a small booklet and a couple stickers which was pleasant to not have tons of paperwork, packaging and crazy stuff falling out of the box.  Just another simple thing that was cool and shows someone over there is thinking about the details.<br/><br/>I read some of the other reviews just out of curiosity and I found it strange that some said the mattress was 5" thick.  Ours is around 10" or 11".  Maybe they sell a smaller one but I never saw that.  It's thicker than our old mattress.  A bunch of the bad reviews said it was too hard.  I have to say that I don't agree.  Now, everyone has their own opinion on how they want their mattress and my wife and I both like firm-ish mattresses. This mattress is firm but I think it's perfect.  What I can say is that after trying all the other mattresses and having the salesman direct us to different firmnesses (is that a word?) I would say on a scale from 1- 10; 1 being the softest mattress we tried and 10 being the hardest, this was about a 7-8.  There were many mattresses that were far firmer than this.  But I also have to say that even if you throw firmness out, this mattress is SOFT; soft to the touch and very cushy.  You don't feel springs and tugs and stretches and all the other stuff you get with a regular mattress.<br/><br/>I've had back problems and I haven't had any since sleeping on this mattress.  Maybe my old mattress was that bad, i don't know.  And I realize there are seven thousand kinds of back problems but this was my biggest concern buying any mattress and I'm glad to say I feel better every morning.<br/><br/>So I conclude by saying that you don't have to be scared.  We were scared too, but we are completely satisfied.  I know there is a lot of info to process out there and you sit here reading this wondering if an employee or a friend of a friend wrote it.  I don't really ever write reviews but I just know the review I'm writing would have been of help to us when we were looking.  We don't have a lot of money and this was a HUGE purchase for us (I'm 37 and this is the first mattress I've had that wasn't a hand-me-down).  So I know what you're going through looking for a mattress and not wanting to make a mistake.<br/><br/>I'm Eric.  I live in KY and I promise you I have no reason to write a good review other than I want to help and I am very happy with the whole Tuft and Needle experience.
 It was time to replace our 15 year old king size bed mattress.  I am a male age 78 and like to sleep in a more upright position.  My wife age 76 (I robbed the cradle) (our grandkids call her Grams) is a side and back sleeper.  We decided to buy two Twin XL Adjustable bed frames (Hofish) and two Tuft and Needle 10 inch Twin XL mattresses direct from the company (as opposed through Amazon) to take advantage of the 100 day trial period.  We talked our son and his two boys ages 11 and 14 to help us set of the beds.  The job was completed in about 1½ hours after which the boys had fun trying out the beds.  We wrapped both mattresses with mattress covers and then fitted sheets and then a flat sheet.  We slept on them right away the first night.  The mattresses seemed cool and not too soft. Our last mattress had a memory foam top so you sunk into it too much.  The Tuft and Needle gave better support allowing you to roll over and back without much effort.  We woke up the next morning feeling refreshed without any pains in the hips and legs.  I had a knee replaced several years ago and my doctors told me to keep my leg elevated to permit better blood flow.  The adjustable frame allowed me to do just that.  I was worried that the mattress would not bend properly with the adjustable bed frame but it did and does just fine.  It even allows for an almost upright 90 degree position for the back and head.  We only were missing two Duvet Covers so we went to our local Bed Bath and Beyond store and bought two dark blue Duvet Covers made especially for College Students Twin XL beds and paid only $19.95 each.  We woke up the second morning and Grams said she felt like a young college student again.  Well Gramps had an idea.  I suggested that evening we dress up as college students (you know – Grams in a short skirt and Gramps in a muscle shirt) and spend the evening studying anatomy together.  Well let me tell you that was quite a night.  We studied and then slept on Tuft and Needles 10 inches of heaven and woke up the next morning feeling like young kids again.  Thanks Tuft and Needle for the perfect heavenly mattress. PS  Grams said she gave me an A+ and suggested we have these study nights more often!
 So listen, like everyone else I thought I made a terrible mistake. It’s REALLY firm and in my first month, my back was killing me.  I’m 165 pounds.  I’m very confident my body was practically realigning itself because after that first month, I have nothing but true love for this mattress. it’s been a year now and I LOVE this bed every single night. Even after going to hotels/resorts/etc, I can’t wait to come back and sleep in this bed.  It holds up so well and I’m sure it will not deform anytime soon like others have. The firmness does come with some drawbacks but is much better for your body. I sleep more with the ‘pillow between the legs’, kind of approach than I ever did....... but I have to... and I have NEVER slept as well as I have on this mattress.  I used to sell matresses without a doubt, other brands of the same construction would have been the $1300-$2000 range EASILY.  great deal, great bed. if you 100% ABSOLUTELY can not stand firm mattresses.. then do not get it. However, If you a firm mattress would be ‘ok’ as long as it had ‘just a little cousioning’ for your elbows and  knees, then wait out the month and I truly think you’ll come to love this like I have.  Better yet, f you already like firm... this is a no-brainer purchase.
 What a great mattress. I saw all the videos of reviews and comparisons and read the reports and reviews and took a chance that this mattress, priced so well, would meet my needs. I am happy to report that it does, very well. It is definitely not a "hot" mattress despite some ratings and reviews and though it's rated as "firm" it perfectly conforms, without swallowing you, for back sleepers and does a good job for side sleepers. I say "good" because it conforms well but after 8 hours I still feel minor sore points in my hip and shoulder. Not as bad as my last mattress, a plush conventional, but I'm thinking that the firm spot is why the mattress is rated "firm". I started with sleep problems but this mattress and a little Melatonin have given me the deepest sleep I've had in 20 years. When I wake up I want to get out of bed, not because I'm so uncomfortable, because I feel refreshed and ready, not sore and achy, feeling like I've had a good sleep. Where other people have complained about the mattress not expanding, I didn't have any of that and no odd smell either. I opened the plastic, let it sit for about 8 hours and slept on it the first night. I will say, because of the structure, sitting on the edge of the bed like when getting dressed is different but still adaptable and fine now that I've had it for 6 weeks. I heartily recommend this mattress.
 8 day Review. My wife and I have adjusted well to this mattress from T&amp;N in the 8 days we’ve been sleeping on it. Our previous mattress was a traditional innerspring queen size mattress, nothing fancy and hard as a rock. Our previous bed was at the end of its life and was killing both our backs so we started researching “bed in a box”. Happened to come across the T&amp;N and liked what people were saying, and the price! The price and the 100 night trial, we figured what the heck we’ll give it a try. Both of us are glad we did! We no longer wake up with back pain, soreness or aches and pains. The mattress is a little more firm than we had expected but that hasn’t been a deal breaker for either one of us so far. Very supportive with a little sink. From what I understand after a couple weeks the mattress will soften a little according to the reps I’ve spoken with at T&amp;N. Really impressed with this company and their straightforward prices and the quality of their products. We just ordered one of their pillows and gonna give it a shot tonight. Note, there was absolutely no smell when we unboxed and cut the plastic wrap off the mattress. It took about 5hrs for the mattress to raise to 10”.

Could hardly believe that's how long we had our mattress, but it was definitely showing its age by sinking considerably in the middle. So I decided to start researching new mattresses online. It was a definite tossup between Tuft&amp;Needle and Casper. In the end, most reviews I read stated that the T&amp;N mattress was a bit more firm, and that's what I was after. It was also hard to pass up a $100 credit I was being offered through AMEX rewards for shopping with T&amp;N...But now that I've got the mattress, I couldn't be happier. Mattress is definitely soft to the touch, but very firm once you lay down on it. Shipping was super fast (3 days I think?). Unboxing was easy, and the mattress expands almost immediately once you unwrap it. There is a bit of an "odor" with the mattress at first, but it dissipates after a few days. Wife and I have had the mattress for about two weeks now and we're sleeping very well with no complaints. Tried my hand at an unboxing video, attached.
 I bought this mattress from Tuft &amp; Needle for over $50 what the price is now. I read that their mattresses can be on the firm side so I thought “oh perfect”. Well no. Not perfect! There is little to no support but I just figured I’d get used to it. Well somehow it didn’t start causing lower back pain until 6 months in. I’m 5’4” and 115 pounds so I don’t feel like I should be having these types of problems.<br/>Of course Tuft and Needle can’t /won’t help me now and I feel like I threw away $650. Ugh. Should’ve spent the extra cash on a better mattress that wasn’t made entirely of garbage foam. Not memory foam - foam like squishy foam. I think they call it some “special” kind of patented T&amp;N foam.<br/>Oh btw the cover sucks too! It’s super thin and doesn’t fit properly. No wonder T&amp;N had to lower their prices and make a whole different supposed “upgraded” mattress.
 I purchased this mattress about 2 years ago. From time to time, I would notice it dipping and so I'd turn the mattress which seemed to help. But now the mattress is at a point where it's just not supporting me at all. I go to bed at night in a cavity, a depression. I've developed horrible back problems especially in the sacroiliac joint. The pain has gotten so bad that for a few days recently I couldn't walk! A nightmare!  To be frank, I have a connective tissue disorder that makes me prone to back issues but I talked extensively to their customer service rep before purchasing to verify that this mattress would provide the kind of support I need. The whole point of splurging on this mattress was to find something that would be good for me with my condition. I actually dread going to bed because I know I'm going to wake up in a lot of pain. We fell prey to their clever marketing with the cute videos and cute name and pseudo-scientific explanations. Money is tight so it'll be awhile before I can replace it. Did I mention this is a nightmare?
 Could not sleep, backache.
 I’ve had my classic T&amp;N about a month now.  And yes - it does take a few nights to adjust to it.  But due to a chronic injury, it was a little too firm for me.  I talked to customer service at the company about options (bc I didnlove the mattress alone) and they helped me get a topper within a week, and promised if I was still having trouble I could return them both problem free (their customer service really was fantastic!).  But no need to return it!!!  It is perfectly now.  Firm enough for my back and hips, soft enough for my abdominal/side injury.  We were out of town for 3 nights last week and I barely slept on the hotel mattress.  I was extremely happy to return home to my T&amp;N.  ONLY suggestion/complaint I have is the topper slides off the mattress a bit, and needs to be readjusted every few days.  I’m thinking about putting a little piece of the no-slide stuff you get for rugs between the two.  But overall I am thrilled.  We’ll be back as our other mattresses need replacing.
 If you ever slept
 My spouse and I bought a king size Tuft&amp;Needle mattress two years ago now. I did lots of research before purchasing this bed and we were initially very pleased, two years later we are not impressed. The good reviews, the company’s story, the affordable price, the positive reviews of their customer service, and ease of delivery was what convinced us to go ahead and buy. Now we are two year out of our purchase and the lack of longevity and durability show. The mattress sinks on my husband’s side of the bed (he is 6’4” and 260lbs- other reviews said the mattress can withstand larger body types), the firmness has deminished, we wake up with hurting backs. It’s unfortunate because the mattress initially, for about the first year, held up fairly well, but the firmness was the first thing to go. Also, the edges of the bed do skin significantly when sitting on the side of the bed; no support in the mattress to prevent that.<br/>Some positives- we ordered directly from T&amp;N and received the package quickly. The vacuum seal was great and the mattress re-inflated instantly. No chemical smell. They have a good warranty, but I don’t know if the deteriorating quality is covered.
 First of all a mattress review is very subjective and just because it doesn't work for one person doesn't make it bad for others. Overall I think this mattress will be good for many, it just wasn't for me.<br/><br/>Because of another comment here that suggested the manufacture's 100 day return might only be in effect if ordered direct rather than through Amazon I ordered direct. I didn't independently verify that replacement issue though.<br/><br/>It came on time and looks like a quality product. It filled out quickly and while, like most synthetics, it did have a smell, but not overpowering to me. It has taken two weeks for that smell to fully dissipate or for me to no longer notice it. My first impression on laying on it was that it is pretty firm but not exceptionally so.<br/><br/>After two weeks I found a couple of issues. First of all it seems that sometimes it sleeps too warm, other times not. I have no idea why that would be. Next, and the reason I will return it is personal and may not affect others. I have some hip and knee issues and those seem to be exacerbated as my two week test went on, to the point that last night I went back to my master bedroom inner spring with the 4" memory foam topper.  My last morning on the Tuft and Needle kind of ended up with me barely able to support me on my right side.  If not for that I would have kept it, but the hip and knee pain just kept getting worse over my 2 week try.
 After quite a bit of research, I ended up purchasing the Tuft &amp; Needle mattress for my wife and me. At the time of purchase, I had narrowed our selection down to the Leesa and Tuft &amp; Needle. The Tuft &amp; Needle mattress just seemed to be the better choice based on our preferences.<br/><br/>For the past seven years, I've been sleeping on a Tempurpedic mattress. At the time of purchase, I specified that I would prefer a firm style as opposed to something softer. My main reason for this was that I wanted to first go for support, and I didn't think that a firm mattress would immediately mean uncomfortable. The guys at the store were also quite helpful in assuring me that I wouldn't feel discomfort with it. It's been a great mattress for all these years, but now that I'm married, and we allow our dogs on the bed, the queen just wasn't big enough for me.<br/><br/>The Tempurpedic mattress also suited my needs because I've had a history of back injuries. I think I've thrown my back out five times now, so having a supportive mattress is necessary. While I believe that a firm mattress is beneficial to my back issues, I wouldn't say that it is the deciding factor in back health and maintenance. Exercise is also key, and I've worked to improve my back health through that as well. Either way, the mattress has been great help in giving my body the support it needs so I can sleep through the night.<br/><br/>On to our recent purchase of the Tuft &amp; Needle: Given how we both have have liked the comfort and support of our fairly firm Tempurpedic mattress, the Tuft &amp; Needle firm support seemed like the best option. I checked out numerous sites and reviews to get a feel for how others responded to the various mattresses. After all, with online mattresses, you cannot go to a store to test them out before purchase (although we did purchase directly from Tuft &amp; Needle and are still currently within the 100 day trial). I did find a comparable Tempurpedic mattress to the Leesa, and we tested that out in the store (the sticker price on those Tempurpedic mattresses, however, is quite a bit more). While it was quite comfortable for the short amount of time we spent on it, it did sink more and have more hug than what we have been used to. This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing even for people like us, because I did read that its overall support is really good.<br/><br/>Sleepopolis was where I read and watched most reviews and comparisons (he prefers the Leesa and still sleeps on it today). His reaction to the Tuft &amp; Needle was fairly positive, but he preferred a somewhat softer mattress. He rates the Tuft &amp; Needle firmness as a 7 out of 10, with 10 being most firm. To make a comparison to our seven year old Tempurpedic, I would say that the Tuft &amp; Needle is a little softer yet possibly a little more supportive, both of which are great things. The Tuft &amp; Needle is more comfortable, and I get great sleep every night. As for my back, I think that the Tuft &amp; Needle has proven to be great for it. In fact, I'm a busy guy (I work at the computer for 10 hours most days), and my exercise lately has been less than average, yet my back has not suffered for it. I cannot say for certain that the Tuft &amp; Needle is the reason why my back is holding up as well as it is through my limited recent exercise, but I think it's more than fair to say that it's been quite helpful in keeping my body comfortable through the night and into the following day.<br/><br/>Another important thing to note about Tuft &amp; Needle is the customer service experience. In this age where you can make a transaction and never hear from each other (seller or buyer), Tuft &amp; Needle has made an effort to reach out to me and make sure my experience with the product and their team has been an easy and enjoyable one. One of the co-founders reached out to me via email very early on after I made the purchase. He asked why I decided on Tuft &amp; Needle, and what my experience has been in purchasing a bed. I responded that I first heard of Tuft &amp; Needle via the RELEVANT Podcast (they sent a mattress to the crew for a promotional spot, and the podcast crew loves it), and I went into detail about how I decided on purchasing their mattress. I soon received a reply from another person, Edmund, at Tuft &amp; Needle, who indicated that he too loves the RELEVANT Podcast, and he also congratulated us on our upcoming first child. So not only did the team reach out to me but they also related to me personally. That's awesome customer service! Beyond that, they've kindly asked if I would write a review here on Amazon, and I am more than happy to.<br/><br/>You also can't really go wrong with the price of the mattress. At $750, it's not only competitive with other high quality mattresses but also more affordable. The Leesa runs a little more, but if you want softer, that might worth it for you. For us, I think we've got the right one. It's going to be such a nice rest for years to come.<br/><br/>If you want to protect your mattress, I can recommend the Luna mattress protector (pictured). It easily fits our Tuft &amp; Needle, and we've had another one on our Tempurpedic all these years. They are easy to care for and really do a great job protecting your mattress.<br/><br/>I would say that based on other reviews, I was expecting the Tuft &amp; Needle to feel a little firmer than it does. I am actually very happy it's a little less than what I was expecting, because the comfort is the best we've ever slept on, and the support is certainly ideal for my wife (a side sleeper) and me (a guy with a history of back issues, and a stomach and back sleeper). It's the best mattress I've ever slept on. Thanks for all the great work, Tuft &amp; Needle crew! I hope you are successful, because you have a great product, and your customer service should be a model for everyone else!
 After extensive research, I decided on this bed for an anniversary present as we now have a second baby and with our toddler, we've outgrown our queen. I tried to buy June 4th and as I was checking out, I noticed the price went up by $150! I thought that it must've been an Amazon thing and after checking their site, I confirmed the price. I remember one of their marketing videos proclaiming their pricing and how customer driven they were. Where in that marketing pitch does a 20% hike overnight help their customers. So, I decided to go with a Nest bed.
 I bought this mattress a little over 2 years ago and raved about it after the first night because for the first time ever  I no longer felt the aches of aging that I'd been feeling on my old very firm spring mattress.  Now 2 years later I love it even more and felt that anyone contemplating buying it should know that.  It is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. Honestly, I can't say enough good things about it.  No negatives at all!!
 I spent months doing research on new mattresses for my husband and I. I came across a recommendation for T&amp;N on Facebook and was instantly drawn in by the amazing reviews and crisp, informative website. We had an 8 year old, worn down, dented pillow top mattress and I will NEVER look back. I feel a detailed review is only fair because everyone needs to know about this quality company!<br/><br/>The first thing that sold me was the 100 nights sleep guarantee. Secondly, their price point is so spectacular and so is their 10 year warranty. Third, the mattresses are made in America. Lastly, their customer service was prompt and friendly, along with their speedy shipping. I felt confident spending our money when they felt confident enough in their product to offer the 100 nights sleep guarantee (If purchased directly from them, not Amazon. No price difference.)<br/><br/>We've now had our mattress a month or so and it's been so amazing to us. Setup was a breeze and no chemical smell upon unwrapping. I sleep like a rock, don't hear my grizzly bear of a husband snoring anymore or feel him tossing throughout the night. Now, I will say that after our first night's sleep I was worried it was too firm. However, that was because my body was used to our old, dipped and dented pillow top. As it broke in, the better we've slept. We feel as though it's the perfect balance of softness and firmness. It conforms so amazingly to our bodies and we both cannot say enough good things about our king size T&amp;N mattress!<br/><br/>If you're on the fence, take the plunge. You won't regret it!!
 I have had my Tuft and Needle mattress for almost a year now and tried giving it a chance, but I am just not comfortable in it, at all. I don’t know if it’s because I am a side sleeper, I read some other reviews stating that it is not good for side sleepers. I am sleeping horribly, and feel that this mattress has not softened at all, as some other people have commented. Help!<br/><br/>I know that it has been a year since I purchased this on amazon, but I wondered if there was any return policy or anything at all I can do to alleviate my situation. I am planning on purchasing a new mattress but would like to see if anyone else has had an issue with this bed. It just feels unbelievably stiff and uncomfortable, after 10 months of sleeping in it.<br/><br/>Thank you!
 As many others have done, I am leaving this review on Amazon, even though we bought our mattress at the T&amp;N website. I am a regular Amazon customer, and use it to research products regularly, simply because there are so many reviews, you can get a much more informed opinion of an item(so long as you spot/ignore the professional 'reviewers').<br/><br/>My husband and I have slept on a waterbed for 31+ years, since 1984. 6 mattresses over the years(large dogs, lol), same Cal King frame. I have slept on a waterbed since I turned 19, and got my first apartment, in 1977. So when we started realizing that, no matter how much we loved our waterbed, and make no mistake, we loved it!, our aging backs were craving a firmer, more stable surface, I started researching mattresses.<br/><br/>After 3+ decades of always being relieved when we returned home from vacations, etc.and got to sleep in our waterbed again, we were kind of dreading making the move to a 'regular' bed. My husband is retired Air Force, and spent 8 months in the Gulf War, and the first thing he did when we got home from base when he returned was lay on the waterbed with a HUGE sigh of OH, thank God for getting my bed back, rofl.<br/><br/>So, after months of reading about mattresses, how to choose them, what to look for, we were Not looking forward to the whole process, and the possibility of choosing one, and not being happy with it, and then having to deal with That problem.<br/><br/>One thing I was sure of was not wanting a memory foam mattress. I don't like the sensation of being 'hugged' by my bed, and no, waterbeds do not do that. And I absolutely cannot stand to sleep hot, and memory foam Does do that. As do the gel foam, though it is less 'hot' than standard memory foam. It was during yet another youTube review of various mattresses that I hit upon someone reviewing a T&amp;N mattress. It looked interesting, so I came to Amazon for the reviews. And was almost overwhelmed by the sheer preponderance of positives, and almost complete lack of negatives.<br/><br/>I read review after review, page after page of reviews, singing the praises of this mattress. I was really hesitant about the idea of buying a mattress unlaid-upon, sight unseen, but the return/refund policy made it a no-brainer. My other concern was whether the edges would 'squish' down too much when we sat on the edge-my husband is a big man, 6'2" and 260#. We really wanted to keep our waterbed frame, and I was afraid sitting on the edge the mattress would 'squish' down too far and leave him sitting on the wood frame, instead of on the bed when he put his legs over the side.<br/><br/>However, again, the return policy made me absolutely willing to give it a try.<br/><br/>We ordered a Cal King mattress on Dec. 19, and received the mattress on Dec. 24. The box was heavy, but no where near as heavy as a regular mattress that size would have been, and easy to move because of being packed in a box. We opened the box in the front room, and moved the still packaged mattress to the bedroom. After spending 2 hours draining and clearing out the waterbed frame, we placed the T&amp;N in the frame, and cut the vacuum wrapping. It opened and expanded in about a minute, no joke, a minute. And, TA DA, amazingly, it fit absolutely Perfectly in the frame. We removed and discarded the waterbed mattress and the heater(which we hadn't used in years anyway), but kept the liner, because the inside of a waterbed frame has brackets in the corners, and I didn't want them to catch on the T&amp;N mattress. We gave it about 3 minutes, and laid down. Our first impression was, oh, jeez, this is a hard mattress, but after a couple of minutes that sensation went away, and even though it doesn't 'sink' at all, you have the feeling of just being held. Just really, really comfortable. No pressure points, no 'hard' spots at the hip, just top to bottom support, but softly supported. Not squishy. And, maybe because of being surrounded by 2" x 8" wood, no 'squish' at the edges. We can sit on the edge of the bed, swing our legs over, and still be 'above' the frame, supported by the mattress. The frame is 8" deep, and the mattress is 10", and the fit, again, is perfect.<br/><br/>My husband is a side sleeper, and I am a stomach/side sleeper. He has a substantial stomach, and I have every disc from L1 to S1 bulging(from a fall off of a porch). Neither of us has had Any problems sleeping on this mattress. The first couple of night it took a couple of minutes to reconcile the 'hard' sensation(read:not water), and it took a couple of weeks to get used to Not sinking into water when we first got on the mattress.(You expect your knee to go down about 5 inches, and hit this surface, jarring to the senses at first, lol) That said, we have both had, and continue to be amazed by, the best sleep either of us has had in years. Every day we ask each other how we slept, and go thru the 'if we had only known' routine. Oh, and we had 2 mattress toppers for our waterbed, one for winter(6"), and one for summer (2"). We stopped using our waterbed heater years ago, finding that the thin one warmed with just our body heat(and they Do hold your body heat) was great for summer, letting the naturally cooler temp of the water keep the bed from being hot, and in winter the thick one kept the same cool from chilling us thru the bedding. So, to start, we put the thick one on the T&amp;N after the first night, and that alleviated the 'hard' sensation, but was too hot. The second night we put the thin topper on, and it is absolutely perfect. Maybe after completely adjusting to actual firmness and not water, we will get rid of the topper completely.<br/><br/>All in all, we are both absolutely satisfied with the T&amp;N mattress, and couldn't be happier with our sleep comfort/quality. I will try and remember to come back in a few months with a follow-up, on how the mattress is holding up.
 First things first, I bought this direct from Tuft &amp; Needle. I wanted the full 100 night trial, instead of the 30 nights through Amazon. They did not ask me to post this review on Amazon, I wanted to give feedback since I had noticed some rumblings about reviews coming from Non-verified purchases, etc.  I've had the mattress since Friday.<br/><br/>Here are my initial observations:<br/>1. After taking out of the box, I would say that from unrolling the first layer of plastic to fully expanded took about 2 minutes<br/>2. I think it might be an inch or two wider than a standard king mattress. I have not measured it but it does not quite fit in between the rails of my platform bed. It is not bothersome and does not hang over.<br/>3. Agree with other reviewers, the sides do not have much support when sitting upright with the full weight of your body on the edge. But I don't typically linger sitting on the side of my mattress. Maybe a lean back to pull on a sock or two or shake the cobwebs out of my head before I get up.  I don't feel that it in any way diminishes the sleeping area of the mattress because when you are sprawled out and spreading your weight more evenly on the mattress, you don't notice it.<br/>4. Smell - there really wasn't an odor to the mattress at all. In fact, it just smells fresh/new.<br/>5. Firmness - I think the reviewer that stated it was about a 7 out of 10 was pretty close. I am a side sleeper and find it closer to an 8 out of 10. My husband thinks it's fantastic, so I am sure that tossing a memory foam topper on it will make us both perfectly happy.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are looking for the marshmallow-like squish and conformity of a classic well-known memory foam brand, this is NOT the mattress for you.  It is however, uniformly firm and supportive with just the right amount of give and a complete lack of motion transfer.
 Start to finish, this was the best purchase I've made in a long time.<br/><br/>Before purchasing, I had a question about the mattress so I used the chat feature on their website. It was late (about 11:30pm) and I got an immediate response from Freddy. He was very helpful. Checking out was easy and quick. I received a confirmation email, then another email just a couple days later telling me my mattress had shipped. I love when companies are good about communicating with the customer.<br/><br/>A few days later (on time!) the mattress arrived. Opening the box and packaging was super easy, the mattress was in perfect condition and includes a zip on cover that's washable. I was a little concerned that the mattress would be thin/flimsy because of how easily it's compressed but this thing is sturdy. The mattress has no smell like I hear some others mention about foam beds.<br/><br/>A couple days after the mattress arrived I received an email from the owners of Tuft &amp; Needle asking me to share my experience. Again, fantastic customer service, made me feel like a valued customer.<br/><br/>I bought this mattress for my son's first "real" bed and he loves it. He's usually a hot sleeper but he hasn't been any hotter than normal with this mattress. Not sure if it's just a coincidence, but he sleeps later (8ish instead of 6:30!!) than he used to with his old mattress.<br/><br/>I have laid on it quite a lot myself and I've already decided that when my husband and I need a new mattress (we've only had our current one about 1 year) we'll be buying from Tuft &amp; Needle. I have a ruptured disc in my lower back and degenerative disc disease. I wake up every day with back pain. I like a soft mattress but with my back problems I need firm support. This mattress has both. It's soft and cushy on top with plenty of support underneath. I actually feel relief from my back pain when I lay on this mattress.<br/><br/>It seems weird to get excited about a mattress but this company is incredible. The mattress is made entirely in the USA, there are no sales pitches / gimmicks / price games, the customer service is as good as it gets and the product is of high quality. When you're spending a good chunk of money (although I feel their prices are very reasonable) on an item that literally is a huge part of your everyday health and happiness, you want the best and as far as I can see, Tuft &amp; Needle is the best.
 Okay so to start . When I first ordered my bed I weighed well over 300 pounds and had continuous back pain. I used to sleep on two twin mattress stacked on a box spring (i know , really stupid) either way that shit sucked . Bought my bed in 2014 , I have the original, original TN mattress - the very first design , and I still have it. I no longer have back pain, that went away shortly after I bought the bed and way before I lost weight . So take it from me - this bed will feel slightly firm when you first get it - not when you touch it but when you sleep. After about 1-2 months of everyday use it should be well broken into and much more comfortable. You must give it time . Don’t be turned off by bad reviews this bed isn’t for everyone . If you want a super soft all the time mattress don’t buy this bed you’ll be upset. But for those of you willing to take the dive into the bed in a box world this is the bed you want . Not only for the amazing quality of the bed , the best most peaceful sleep you’ve ever had but because of this company’s CUSTOMER SERVICE. Their customer SUPPORT team ROCKS . Every time you contact them they responding quickly and pleasantly and they strive to actually help you . Their customer service alone is why I recommend them, but tie in the unbelievable price , the amazing bed it’s a winning combo. I also wanted to shout out the wonderful ladies that helped me this past time I contacted the support team - Kelly , Ashlie, and Marcie C you guys are rockstars thank you for the amazing service as always 🙏
 I have nothing but good things to say about this king mattress. My Tuft is impossibly comfortable and has an odd combination of both firmness and supportive softness.<br/><br/>Currently, I am using it directly on a hardwood floor and after the first night I knew I would be keeping it, no 100 days needed. The primary reason I choose Tuft &amp; Needle was the third-party reviews that reported Tuft's mattresses were the firmest amongst the mail order competition.<br/><br/>At 94lbs I found the mattress easy to bring inside, unpack, and setup by myself. However, I'm 6' 2" and the room it was going in was empty, so as they suggest you probably want to have some help.<br/><br/>Overall, I would buy a Tuft &amp; Needle again. I have had better sleep in the last week despite holiday craziness then I've had all year. The first few nights sleeping on this mattress made me feel like I had never slept before. Plus it's a better price than the nearest competition.
 I ordered a Tuft &amp; Needle Queen-sized mattress on Labor Day, after doing a lot of research and reading a lot of laudatory reviews here. It arrived within 2 days, and I slept on it that night. And while it did take a full week or so to acclimate to the mattress, after sleeping on it for more than 45 days, I have to report this is one of the best sleep experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!<br/><br/>I go to sleep pretty quickly, and I SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT, which is a big deal for someone like me, who post-menopause was always waking up and getting up. This did not lead to great sleep, and I'm finding that I'm also having long, vivid dreams, a sure sign that I'm getting deep REM sleep for a LONG time.<br/><br/>I wake up totally refreshed and ready to go, and I feel terrific!<br/><br/>I did notice the faint new smell of the mattress when it arrived, but smells like that never bother me, and to me, it's a little like a new car smell--something that reminds you that what you have is a brand-new experience. It was no problem at all, and now I don't smell a thing.<br/><br/>Most important, this mattress is SUPER comfortable. For someone like me, who prefers soft (plush) to firm, it's great to lie down on, because I instantly feel so cushioned and comfortable. However, this process does take awhile--up to about 2 weeks, I think, before your mattress adjusts to your body.  I've noticed on waking that often my back or shoulders feel slightly sore. However, literally as soon as I sit up, the soreness is gone.<br/><br/>This mattress is a godsend, and I intend to enjoy every single night's sleep from now on! Bravo to Tuft &amp; Needle for their brilliant product!
 We had this bed for about 5-6 months before I started getting horrendous back pain.  I would wake up feeling like my hip was sinking.  It was really horrible.  I was doing foam rolling and stretches all over the place.  For context, I am in my mid thirties, 5'4, ~120 pounds.  Last week, out of desperation, we flipped the mattress upside down (so that the part that should be touching the bedframe is now on top).  It is now firmer and more supportive but not the most comfortable.  My back pain went away after 2 days this way.  It is not a permanent solution but it may help some people who are dealing with this mattress softening up too quickly.<br/>I would not purchase this mattress again.
 I've been waking up with pain every day. I don't have back problems but now majority of my back aches in the morning. I can't get comfortable whether on the side or back. The back hurts the least but if I don't arch my back before going to bed the pain is unbarable. It also gets hot and doesn't seem to breathe like a regular mattress. I like firm mattresses but this ones too hard for my liking. I bought a cheap memory foam when I was in school and hated it, but I figured that this has to be better technology now and more quality. However, it reminds me of the same foam. I bought it for the ease of transport since it's bendable, that it's thinner than most modern matresses and the claim of comfort. That I still like the size and bend but everything else isn't worth the pain and discomfort.
 So I had a very expensive Beautyrest pillow top innerspring mattress for about three years, and my back started aching.  I am a very active middle aged female, about 140 lbs., and sleep quality is important to me.  It couldn't be this mattress, I said to myself....but then I went on a weekend camping expedition, and slept in a tent with a sleeping bag on the ground...and my back felt SO much better!  I took that thought home, and started sleeping on the floor.  After several weeks of sleeping on the floor and realizing I would never go back to pillow top anything, I gave my really expensive (like, almost a few thousand dollars expensive) Beautyrest mattress to my son, and graduated to the plywood that was on top of my two twin box springs (I had a king sized mattress).  After a few months of sleeping on plywood, I concluded that was too firm for me; thus started my mattress search.<br/><br/>I decided on Tuft &amp; Needle because of the reviews on Amazon and Youtube, and also elected to save a few hundred dollars over their direct competitors in the process (Lull, Leesa, Brooklyn Bedding).  It came down to Brooklyn bed or Tuft &amp; Needle.  I considered a Brooklyn bed because it just looked nicer (similar warranty), but then rationalized that once you put a mattress cover, sheets, etc. over the bed, who is really going to see the company's mattress cover anyway???  Some reviews stated the Brooklyn bed was just a tad softer than T&amp;N and I wanted firmer anyway so I kept it basic and went T&amp;N.  In all fairness, I have never tried out the other competitors, so I am only speaking on my experience with T&amp;N.<br/><br/>I ordered my bed from their site because I wanted the 100-night guarantee, but since I have purchased a lot of stuff from Amazon, I decided to write a review here.  I went on their online chat before purchasing, and chatted for quite a long time with a rep named Jon, who answered all my questions in the middle of the night ha! (Jon.is.awesome). After I purchased the mattress, I received emails from several other staff members over the course of the week - ...just reaching out and being wonderfully customer accessible.  Some people may not be used to that, or be annoyed...but I'm sorry, but this IS good old fashioned customer service at it's finest....something that I don't experience often anymore unless I'm visiting New York City where I patronize my friend's family-owned Italian bagel shop in Long Island.  Good customer service was the other ultimate seller for me:  So many compliments on how they run their business was the second piece that made me purchase this mattress.  Serious.  If you don't like the mattress at any time within the 100-day trial,, this company helps you find a place to donate, and then you get your money back and someone less fortunate gets a bed.  Who can beat that???<br/><br/>I received the mattress less than a week after ordering.  My local Fed-Ex actually held it up an extra day (NOT happy with them), but I liked the fact that I could track the order using the direct link Tuft &amp; Needle customer service provided in the order confirmation email they sent.  The package was pretty heavy, so two people are needed to move the package inside and to lift it onto a bed frame, which I suggest you do before actually unfolding the mattress.  I put my box on top of my bed frame with the help of my 13 year old daughter, then cut the box open (be careful not to slice the box open deep, as you may damage your mattress!), and unrolled the mattress onto the foundation.  It inflated in maybe 10 seconds if that (it was actually awesome to watch lol) and was ready to go.<br/><br/>The only problem?  I can't get my 9-year-old son to stop sleeping with me!<br/><br/>So this mattress is NOT as firm as plywood.  I would classify the 7/10 firm rating as accurate.  I didn't want pillow top.  I'm a back and side sleeper, and I didn't want to "sink in" and drown like I did with that horridly hot memory foam topper I previously purchased.  No, I want wood block firm, because that's what makes my back feel better.  This has just enough give to keep the firmness, but also provide pressure point relief.  Honestly, I LOVEEEEE IT!!!!<br/><br/>The mattress covering is really super soft...Kinda wish I could have just slept on that by itself, but I put a protective cover, a basic mattress pad, and some great sheets over mine.  I smelled ZERO off-gassing.  My nose is very sensitive and I had previously tried a high quality, highly recommended memory foam mattress topper last year, couldn't take the smell, heat, thickness and the caving in so I returned it after only a few nights of horrid sleep.  This mattress is NOTHING like that so if you have had a bad experience with memory foam like I have had, don't worry, this is TOTALLY NOT the same!!!  I didn't have to air out the mattress or anything, just slept on it that night!!!  No sinking, no heat retention, nothing but a great night of sleep!!  YAYYYYY!!!  Yep, been having great sleep ever since, too!<br/><br/>The truth is: I just don't want to get out of bed in the mornings.  For real.  If there is one criticism I have, it would probably be that there is a lack of support when you sit on the sides of the bed...but I already knew that from the reviews...that's the nature of beds that are not innerspring.  I don't sleep on the sides of my bed, so I can totally live with that.  I have read several reviews here on Amazon that state the firmness changes over time.  I am very hopeful that my mattress stays just like it is, because IT'S PERFECT!!!!<br/><br/>I guess that's the risk you take when ordering a product from a new company that has not yet stood the test of time...but my experience has been that ALL of the mattresses I've ever owned have succumbed at some point or another, sooner than ever anticipated.  If I get the full 10 years out of this mattress, I'll be thrilled, because I have never owned a mattress beyond six years for that very reason.  Reading up on this stuff, the standard recommendation is to change your mattress every 5-7 years, even when you rotate it regularly, so maybe we need to start budgeting for bedding.  Anyway, I can only hope that this one stands the test of time....and I'll be updating if for some reason my sleep quality changes because of the mattress.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this will be a product that those of us who love it can say it was a great investment.  Long live excellent customer service!  To Tuft &amp; Needle:  Don't get too big and get swallowed up by corporate foolishness, keep honoring your word, being humanitarians, and guard your core values that launched your company and helped sell your product. :-)
 First of all, this is not a review of the Tuft &amp; Needle company.  It is a review of the T&amp;N twin XL mattresses (2) that I bought and eventually returned.  I did not buy them on Amazon because by buying it directly from T&amp;N, I received a 100 day trial period vs. 30 day on Amazon before deciding whether to return them.<br/>Like any new mattress, the first night was like heaven.  The mattresses felt fine to both of us while sleeping.  My wife, however had a problem with the softness of the edge right away.  She felt like she was slipping off of the edge while sitting to get in bed.  That got better as she got used to the softness of the edge.  Moving around, i.e., turning over once in bed was challenging for her too.  But that too got easier over the course of the 100 days.  The straw that broke the camel's back for both of us however, was the back aches we both woke up with every morning.  We wanted to love this mattress but decided that we had to return them because of the back aches.  Thank you T&amp;N for your grace in the return process.  We've returned to a flippable innerspring mattress and the back aches have gone away.
 We have had this mattress for a few months now and we have absolutely no complaints. We are both athletic built people who wanted a mattress that had a perfect amount of support without being too hard. We had been on a softer mattress for about 5 years (pillow top) and noticed we were having a lot of lower back, shoulder and hip pain/discomfort. Switching to the T&amp;N Bed-In-A-Box was something we were both skeptical about, but after reading all the great reviews (many hours of research and tons of videos on YouTube) and the free shipping &amp; returns, 100 night trial period and 10yr warranty, it was a no brainer. We especially loved that this mattress is really affordable and also available on Amazon Prime. It arrived in two days. It was super easy to set-up. I do recommend having 2 persons set it up. We ended up putting it right on our box spring. It works fine without the recommended platform. We haven't had an issue with sleeping hot, the falling off the bed feeling near the edge or any discomfort upon waking up in the morning. It didn't take us long to adjust to a firmer mattress either, maybe 1-2 nights, best sleep nearly immediately. We are definitely one of the 95% of people who love the T&amp;N mattress. We ended up getting the mattress protector as well. This is an amazing mattress for the price. Well worth it. I've recommended this mattress to many people who are on a budget and want a great mattress without having to pay thousands of $. This mattress really impressed us being the "budget" mattress and all.
 The wife and I have been sleeping on the same mattress for 14 years. September was her birthday and I decided to buy a new mattress for one of her presents. I looked at a couple different brands and watched some review videos on youtube. The consensus I found was Tuft and Needle is the best mattress and the best price. I figured with the 100-day return policy it was worth trying out. I ordered a king size from the Tuft &amp; Needle website and it arrived in 2 days! I was so excited I gave her the mattress early and we set it up that night.<br/><br/>We have had the new mattress for almost a month and I can't believe how amazing this thing is. I'm a very big guy (6'10" / 280 lbs) and this mattress supports me like a champ. I don't sink into the mattress like I'm drowning and it doesn't feel like I'm laying on a sheet of plywood, it is the perfect blend of soft and support. After 14 years on the same mattress the wife and I would always wake up with back and neck pain, and that disappeared on the first night with this new mattress.<br/><br/>Seriously, this thing is amazing. I've been telling everyone how great this mattress is and if you are trying to decide if Tuft &amp; Needle is right for you, take my advice and go for it. You will be very happy with your purchase.
