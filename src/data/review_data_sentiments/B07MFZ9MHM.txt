 Picked up the special edition as I have a phone without nfc and decided "what the hell".. So on to the review, pros, cons, etc.<br/><br/>It looks pretty good and isn't as thick as the ionic, gps via phone works fine when it works, altogether it's not a bad product. I am going to list cons before pros as i feel they are more important when choosing a product.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1) Fitbit still hasn't deemed it necessary to provide any relief for night shift workers or night owls. Your day starts at 12:00 am and ends at 11:59 pm; no ifs, ands, or buts. Which means, step reminders can not be set for any hour range that crosses the midnight mark. I used to be a programmer before family health issues drove me to being a healthcare worker full time. It is NOT hard to change the code for time tracking, otherwise every time clock and accounting app out there would screw you. There is absolutely no reason for fitbit not to fix this.<br/><br/>2) Sleep tracking on mine, with the original clock face, different clock face, rebooting it, etc... reliably loses 2 hours at the end of my sleep cycle. If you get up, then go back to bed, you are SOL. I mainly bought this for sleep tracking and step counting.<br/><br/>3) Heart rate tracker... I have a 39.99 smart watch from china that can sit on my wrist and measure heart rate. This fitbit has problems with tattoos. Even when not over the tat, it still loses monitoring occasionally and that may be part of the problem with the sleep tracking.<br/><br/>4) The pedometer works well when it works. When I first got it, i put it on tight but not too tight. I took 100 steps, it counted 7. I loosened it up, tried again, 102... Not bad, better than my china watch. I then wore it all day, worked on a car, and have to wonder if my impact wrench gave it the extra 3000 or so steps that day.<br/><br/>5) Bluetooth.. Is iffy at best.. any app, clock face, etc I load, it errors.. I have to turn it off, on, then manually sync to get it to load. The wifi is great, if it would actually utilize it for anything other than music or firmware, it would probably fix that issue as the regular sync via bluetooth will auto retry... clock faces, etc... not so much.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1) Fits well and is unobtrusive. I now only remove it to charge it or when working in an environment that may damage it.<br/><br/>2) The app really isn't all that bad except for the lack of night owl / nighshift abilities.<br/><br/>3) The open SDK is great, I have played around with it a bit and besides the lack of tutorials on fitbit's website, it is a decent attempt to open up their hardware to developers.<br/><br/>4) The design is refined. It doesn't look like it was just tossed together.. With some work it could probably maintain all features and be the same thickness as a regular watch. With the price paid, that would be nice.<br/><br/>5) I forget i am wearing it... There is something to be said for a watch that feels ok all day... I own a lot of watches, and yes, I consider the versa a watch... Until they iron out some issues... True it is a watch with decent features, but at this point in time, that is all it is.<br/><br/>In closing, I really wanted to give it 5 stars... Especially at a 200+ dollar price point. But I do not feel that I received what I paid for, In the end, it is a very nice watch with a semi-usable app, and not much thought given to how it side-loads apps. Overlooking people with non-standard schedules is pretty much inexcusable these days. The app offering new features like "sleep insights" is all well and good, if the actual hardware would track and sync properly.<br/><br/>I wanted to love it, but at this point, the alta hr seems like a much better deal if you want the app compatibility and such.<br/><br/>And just in case anyone suggests changing the time zone so i can have my activity and step reminders on night shift, or manually logging my sleep... No... Just no... I didn't pay 200+ for a tracker that has half @ssed software that won't perform properly.
 I purchased the fitbit on May 1st and received it a week later when it came back in stock.  I loved it at first until it went to perform a software update and failed in the middle and completely bricked the device a few weeks later.  My device wouldn't reset, turn on or anything.  I called fitbit to get a replacement since it was under warranty and their customer/technical service is horrible.  They walked me through the steps through email and then wanted me to take a video with the claim number in the video shot so they could verify I was truly trying to reset the watch and it wasn't working.  I sent the requested video to fitbit and a few days later got a confirmation that they would send me out a replacement. I received the replacement with instructions to throw away the defective fitbit.  The replacement showed up in a barely padded envelope through USPS and without a signature required.  I tried setting up the new device and nothing, I left it on the charge station over night and somehow it finally synced.  I started noticing syncing problems and nothing was tracking accurately to my app.  In the app I noticed that the watch was rotating from syncing, looking, connected and kept looping like that.  I called fitbit and they began troubleshooting with me, after 50 minutes on the phone with them where they had me try multiple devices, made me log in to my router to verify what channel wifi was being used I finally demanded to speak to a manager since they sent me a defective watch that was clearly not working.  The manager informed me that fitbit may send you watch that has been returned by someone else and is "like new" and that it states that in the fine print under the warranty information of your watch.  so at this point i'm waiting for another watch and have requested that it is a new one never been used to replace my watch I had for a little over 2 weeks.  After this watch and previous fitbits I had that required the ocassional reset to make it sync again I will never buy another fitbit product.  They have no idea how to treat a customer or to make a reliable product.
 Had the Charge 2 for a while and loved it. Then switched to the latest apple watch at the encouragement of a few friends. While that apple watch was nice for the few months I wore it, I found I was not using a lot of the features in it that may have been why it was double the cost of the Versa. On the apple watch I found the battery would not last more than 36 hours and the phone app was no where near what Fitbit had in terms of activity and sleep tracking as well as just overall display of the many data points.<br/><br/>When the Versa came out I said why not try it, hearing how slim it was and the extended battery life. It was that or go back to my Charge 2 that is also a fantastic tracker. My goal was to get back to the Fitbit app. I love this watch/fitness tracker and know this is going to be a huge hit for Fitbit. The app I love is now back in my life for the detailed activity and sleep tracker and the battery life is nearly as good as my Charge 2. I have gotten five days of battery life on the Fitbit Versa already - this is with a 45 minute workout on each of those five days included. At the end of the five days I was at 28% remaining, telling me I had another day or two of charge remaining. The texts all come through, the watch rings when I get a all on my iPhone, the screen is crystal clear, the watch itself is very slim compared to apple(no bump on the underside), there must be hundreds of clock faces to choose from, and it has all the apps I could think of needing in the watch store (the store is already noticeably growing). This is the fitness tracker\watch to get. Very impressed and kudos to Fitbit for a well thought out fitness focused watch that is a true competitor to the apple watch.<br/><br/>Just a quick comment on the setup of the Versa. I saw a few comments here about how the setup took 30 minutes or so to complete with an update. My comment is so what? I just put my Versa on the charger, used the app to update it, walked away, came back and wha-la - it was done! It hasn't stopped since!<br/><br/>Enjoy!
 I have had mine about 2 weeks now. I ordered the rose gold special edition version. I had an alta HR prior to this and used it mainly to track sleep, steps and for text and call notifications while at work. I wanted to be able to see any calls or texts while I was on the floor since we aren't allowed to have our phones out. I am rarely near my desk and I was wanted to make sure I could see calls or texts from my sitter or my childs school. The Alta worked well, but I love the new Versa even more. I really wish there was a way to sync two phones to it. I would love to be able to have messages from both my personal and work phone show up on it. The size is great. It isn't too big and its actually lighter weight than the alta HR. Its thinner as well. I added my bank card for the payment feature which is pretty cool. I like that I can change the watch face on a whim. There are new ones added every day as well, plus you can make your own or use a photo with some of them. The steps seem accurate but the floor counting seems a little high. It counts the 3 low steps from my porch as a floor which I didn't expect. I had no issues with set up at all. I have a galaxy S9+ and all the features work. Set up was extremely simple.  You can charge it with the bands on. The bands are harder to swap out than on the Alta HR since you have to get the little pi s in just right. The sleep tracker works well. I have used it to play music with blue tooth headphones a couple times. It works fine but it isn't something I use often. I hope the text replies come soon as I was really excited about that feature. Overall I am extremely happy with it. I still love the Alta Hr and I gave it to my mother and also bought one for my neice.
 Love the product, after 2 months I woke up to a black screen and I wouldn't turn on again. Had frustrated experience with support and was required to RMA my watch. It's now a month later, I have no watch, no response..  How can Fitbit track my health when it breaks and the company has no CS policy to keep it's users tracking. I asked for a refund but Fitbit will only support returns if it comes from Fitbit not Amazon. I will sell this when it's returned and won't by another Fitbit.
 I was really debating between this and Apple watch but so glad that I bought this Versa.<br/>I bought this only for fitness reasons and didnt want to be bothered with constant notifications/messages/calls, etc.<br/>So far this Versa does exactly what I need it to do and gives me all the data which helps me stay healthy and motivated.<br/>You really need to keep this on you 24/7 in order for you a accurate data over time.<br/>I did not know if sleep data would help me but it has become one of my favorite features of the watch.<br/>Also love the fact that this watch is so light, battery life is long and dosen't get in the way while in the gym.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can think of is that sometimes the screen dosen't always come on when you raise your wrist to see the time. But you can always double tap the screen to get it on.<br/><br/>If you live an active lifestyle and want to refine your training or you are a newbie and want to get active, I would highly recommend this Fitbit Versa watch.  However, if you just want to have a phone on your wrist for notifications, love all things apple, play with apps, etc. then get a Apple watch. (by the way I am an iphone user)
 Have owned this for a week now and can’t say enough good things about it. Fantastic smart watch that is about 80% of an Apple Watch for less than half the price. If you love the Fitbit community and want a waterproof tracker that adds a ton of smart watch features and has great battery like to boot, this is your Fitbit!
 I thought I was upgrading from a Charge 2, however, after a couple days I think I am going back to it..  The Versa looks amazing, and the back is smooth, unlike the Charge, so it wears well.  I have not had the setup issues that some of the other reviewers are saying, and my battery life seems to be OK (using about ~27% a day).  My biggest complaint, which is of course why I have a Fitbit, is to keep a reasonable accurate count of my steps, to include floors.  I enjoy the Sleep information, which by the way, is not working, but at least Fitbit is aware of the issue (if you go to their community page, a message is up top stating they are working on a fix, but have a temporary solution.  On the first day I noticed that I have walked up 39 floors, which I thought was odd, because on average I am at about 6-8 floors a day.  I searched the community forums, and the Fitbit moderator was saying how, if it is windy or the weather is bad it will affect the accuracy.  I find this an extremely stupid response, when this NEVER happened with my Charge 2.  Anyway, so I decided to run a test.  I work from home usually, and I am on the call several hours a day.  I took my Versa off during one my longer calls, and set it on my desk.  After the approximately 2 hour call, I looked the Versa told me that I went up 12 floors and took 463 steps...come on!  This is ridiculous.  Yesterday, I decided to wear both my Versa and Charge 2, the differences were vast to say the least (to include steps, miles, calories, and floors).  I am not sure if any real testing was done before this product was released, but unfortunately, this product is garbage as is right now.  I plan on keeping it for about another week, just to see if they come out with some updates to fix all of the issues, if not, sending it back, and using my Charge 2.<br/><br/>***********************************<br/>Update 23 April<br/>***********************************<br/>After wearing every day, all day, for about a week, nothing is better.  I have reset it numerous times, and in fact, starting 2 days ago, it does not even count ANY floors.  The sleep function does not work consistently, some nights it works, the others it tells me that I only slept 3 hours.  However, as I said in the original review, the watch looks awesome, and fits great.  Problem is, I can't keep a device that is supposed to keep track of my activity, just because it looks good.  Very sad, but sending it back.  I have attached a picture, so you can see the floors.  You can tell the exact day I switched from my Charge 2.  I went from averaging about 50 floors a week, to 172 floors in 4 days, and now it does not count any floors.
 Not impressed. Had it 4 months and it completely stopped syncing to my phone and kept glitching. Asked for my money back and was refused stating they would just send another Versa. That was 2 weeks ago and have still not received it. Battery only lasts 3-4 days vs the Blaze which was about 7-10 days. The versa is honestly nothing special. I’ve had three different Fitbit’s and all have glitched and been replaced. I don’t get them wet and don’t have a physical job. I take great care of them. But of all the hassle and returns and glitches I could have had a nice Apple Watch. This was my last attempt at trying Fitbit products. It will also be my last.

 Update after 2 weeks of use:<br/>I've put the Versa through its paces over the past two weeks... 110 miles of walking (235,000 steps) and 400 flights of stairs, plus tested its waterproof claims. Here's what I've found:<br/><br/>- The distance/step tracking is pretty accurate without the GPS, nominally better than the Blaze, but with one exception. It appears to be sensitive to arm movement without walking. For example, I attended a concert and picked up a "mile of walking" just by standing and clapping my hands at the concert. I tested this a couple times. Just sitting and clapping or tapping my knees to music will add steps and distance to the counter. Couldn't find any solution for this other than use the GPS function - connecting it to your phone's GPS - as you exercise, which works well. But now that I know the issue, I can adjust my tracking accordingly. Since I walk with my phone anyway (for security) this is not an issue for me either way.<br/><br/>- Stair/elevation changes track very similarly to the Blaze. My daily outdoor walk route includes some hills and the number of "flights" it tracks never varies by more than one on any given day.<br/><br/>- It is definitely waterproof. In the shower, in the pool for more than an hour, walking in the rain. No problem. You can even read the screen underwater. Haven't tried the ocean yet... that will be next month.<br/><br/>- Without connecting to GPS and only syncing on demand, not constant, I get a good full 5 days of battery life. I find I have no need to have it continuously sync.... if I want to know my progress, it's on the watch anyway with less effort than opening the phone app.<br/><br/>- I have not tested out the music yet, though I've looked at it and the instructions appear pretty straight forward. Since I'm taking my phone with me anyway, I don't need to have the music on the watch. I'm sure I'll try it eventually.<br/><br/>The bottom line for me at this point is that it is everything the Blaze was with a better interface, charging solution, and waterproof.<br/><br/>I’ve had a Fitbit Blaze for 2 years.... it helped me lose 175 lbs over that time period. I replaced it with this Versa mostly because the Versa is waterproof. Other than being waterproof the only functional upgrades are (1) the ability to store music and play music directly thru Bluetooth, the watch’s ability to connect to WiFi (to do OS updates and download music) and (3) the updated operating system that allows third party apps to be installed and used. Otherwise than these it gives me the same functionality as the Blaze.<br/><br/>It is a little smaller and thinner than the Blaze and because, unlike the Blaze you don’t pop it out of its frame, the control buttons seem easier to use. The screen display is much brighter too. The Blaze in direct sunlight is unreadable; this one is fine. Screen resolution appears to be much higher too.<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze. Just follow the step by step directions on the app, which needs to be installed on your phone before setup. There are also some fine videos online that will walk you thru the setup too.<br/><br/>I’ve taken it thru 2 days of activity so far (about 24 hours) and as I write this the battery is 83% charged.  Sensors seem a little more sensitive than the Blaze.<br/><br/>Some reviews complain about the apps or the watch faces. I think there are plenty of the latter to choose from and most are free. The one pictured here was free and I liked it because it displays all the tracking on one screen (and with a simple tap on the screen I can change the display color).<br/><br/>All in all I’m happy with the Versa upgrade from the Blaze.
 Was working well but now it's almost completely useless except for telling time. No HR function, no exercise tracking, won't change from factory default clock face, and it's slow to sync less than 2 months after purchase. Manufacturer offering to send new one in 2 weeks(!) with the same old warranty. Definitely would not recommend this product as it's quick to break and manufacturer is slow to respond. After 4 years as a fitbit user I'm disappointed. Save your money.
 I love this watch so much! I have a small wrist and was concerned it may look too big and unattractive, but not the case...it looks classy. I have gotten many many compliments. The health features are great, I have already lost a few pounds! I do like the 7 minute workouts on my coach app, they are quick, easy and effective. I went for a run with the Versa, I know that many were upset about the lack of GPS. Honestly for me it was not a problem. I usually go the same route so I already know the mileage...I was just so glad I did not have to bring my phone along to listen to music! I love this watch!
 I love this watch!  It is awesomely intuitive with exercise even if you forget to put it on that mode.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles (or price tag) that the Apple Watch does, its a fitness smartwatch-not and entertainment watch. But people do mistake the design for an Apple Watch.  It has a nice look!  My wrist is small and it is a little big on it, but I really like it.  You can see texts (but cannot answer them) and you can see and answer (if you have bluetooth) incoming calls.  Guided breathing and coaching sessions. Timer (stop and countdown) and alarm.  Weather, including extended forecasts.  Reminders to move if you aren't on target to hit your goal.  Calories burned. Miles and of course steps. You can also download songs onto it ( I have yet to do this) Its like a power packed motivator on your wrist!!!! I absolutely LOVE this watch! It does scratch easily, and I would recommend a protector purchase immediately.
 For a smartwatch that markets itself for fitness use, I felt it did so very poorly.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the watch is very light and simple to use. it's screen, while a bit small, is clear, detailed, and faster than most WearOS devices. It's gesture activations are simple and work almost flawlessly. The vibration notifications from the smartphone were strong and easy to setup.<br/><br/>On the down side, putting the physical activation button on the right side of the watch meant that I was constantly hitting it by bending my wrist or using my workout gloves; which would interrupt whatever monitoring I was trying to do. That was annoying and happened a lot.<br/><br/>Heart rate monitoring was also very poor.<br/><br/>I ran the Fitbit Versa in a side-by-side test with a Ticwatch-S WearOS-2 device to check the accuracy against my Rhythm+ chest strap. While I know that NO smartwatch is going to be as accurate as a chest strap; I do expect a "fitness watch" to be close.<br/><br/>For starters, the delay in capturing heart-rate is 15-20 seconds from start of the app. During exercise, there is a large variation in the accuracy of the measurements (5-8% skew) and if you sweat, the measurements are skewed even further. I would have expected this to be a step above what you get with WearOS devices simply because this is Fitbit's bread-and-butter (and there should be a lot less processing in a Fitbit OS); but alas, my experience was that it didn't offer anything that a 3rd party android app wouldn't get you.<br/><br/>The complete lack of robust Fitbit heart rate apps that can do continuous monitoring and logging was disappointing. There are none that can connect to an external app via Bluetooth to log your RRs and HRs (most Wear OS 2 watches have this capability).<br/><br/>In fact, there is a dearth of apps in their marketplace at all. For the price, I would have expected a lot more watch faces, fitness monitoring capabilities, and sleep tracking. Even the sleep tracking was pretty poor.<br/><br/>If I were Fitbit, I'd re-engineer the HR monitoring part of this to make it more robust by using dual, raised LEDs and make it more sweat resistant. I'd also love to see them get something that is FDA certified as a medical device...Apple and Google will have watches that will have this later in 2018/2019 and will be required if they want to do any health-monitoring that is legitimate as opposed to "entertainment purposes only".<br/><br/>In the end, I sent the watch back and stuck with the Ticwatch-S (it's $50 more, but you get a complete android smartwatch for the price).
 I am very impressed! This watch has certainly met my expectations. As a previous fitbit user, this is an upgrade from my Alta HR. The versa shows a full text message, as compared to the Alta HR which only shows the first few words. Love the large screen, you can clearly see all your important stats. Was worried about the size of the screen and the square design not looking nice on a small wrist but it looks great. Lies fairly flat, and super comfortable. Touch screen is very responsive.The watch itself feels very lightweight, which is also a plus for me. I have only had the watch for a day so I cant testify to the battery life or durability, but will update my review if I run into any problems. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their fitbit to something a little more fancy!
 Love Fitbit, I've had almost all of them, and was extremely excited to find I could swim laps with this one. I swim twice a week; but the day after the return date ended (1 month and 1 day) the screen became completely pixelated, the screen then went completely black. Fitbit is amazing, so I will be receiving a replacement for it in about a week. My real problem now is I still need it for swimming since that's why I bought it. I will continue swimming since I can't get a refund, and will update here in about a month. The discussion groups on the Fitbit site have a lot of complaints about water damage so beware. And Fitbit does state that this device is for swimming.
 I wasenjoying the fitbit versa.  However, at least once a week, my Versa looses Bluetooth connection and I have to reset the Versa. When I contacted fitbit, they seem to be aware that the versa's have this problem and that there may be an update at some time. My husband has a blaze, which they have discontinued, and an Ionic, and both work great. Neither the Ionic or Blaze have this problem. I would be hesitant in buying a Versa until a fix is found.
 First let me state that I am a big fitbit fan.  I have been using the charge HR for years and my only complaint is that it was not waterproof.  I was thrilled when the Versa came as I regularly walk on the beach and then go in the water.  I bought the Versa prior to a 2 week island vacation.  I even upgraded my pandora subscription so I can use the Versa to listen to music when I am walking where there is no internet service.  I used the Versa for a month and was very happy with it.  I was able to use the pandora app and the tracking (both steps and sleep) was very accurate.  I then went on vacation and literally the first time I used it in water it died.  I ended up spending over an hour with customer service online to determine it was actually broken.  Through the app they were able to see it was fully charged when it synced in the morning and then a couple of hours later it was dead.  At this point I expected them to send me a new one.  No, I had to make a video with the case number and show them with it plugged in and then push all the buttons to show it was truly broken.  Because service on the island is not good, it was a pain to get them the video file (not their fault).  Finally, I got them the video.  So now they should be able to send me a new one.  No, now they want me to mail them back the unit and within 5-10 business days they will let me know what they will do.  Since I will be on vacation for over 2 weeks, I will not be able to send it until I get home.  Then waiting another 10 business was days to find out what they will do.  You’ve got to be kidding.  Why have me send a video if that was not enough proof that it is broken.  Needless to say I am extremely disappointed I the fact that the unit did not work in water but even more by how hard they are making it for me to get a new one.  At this point I will be trying to get my money back and go to an Apple Watch.  Fitbit you have lost customer that has bought 6 different fitbit a for family members who will now be converting to Apple.
 I spent a lot of time looking at other smartwatches. I'm so glad I went with the Versa. This is my 3rd Fitbit. I like the sleep tracking and didn't want to give it up. I have had the watch for 2 weeks. It charges quickly (about the time it takes me to shower). The charge does last a few days which is another reason I chose this watch. I didn't want to charge it everyday! I have used the exercise app when running and walking. I entered my Strava info into the Fitbit app on my phone and my exercises sync between Fitbit and Strava without having to manually start Strava. Notifications are much easier to see than on my Alta. If I miss seeing a text I can swipe down from the top and the message will show again. I like that feature. It was hard to see text messages on my Alta and many times they were too long to show everything. The Versa shows the entire text and will show emojis.<br/>I read some negative reviews about the watch and band looking cheap. I disagree. I love how it looks on my wrist. It is quite pretty.
 The Fitbit Versa is a piece of junk.  I have ample evidence for that harsh statement which I will herewith relate.  I bought my Versa early in 2018.  By the fall of 2018, it had become inoperable. I tried  in vain the fixes provided on their website and by phone. Fitbit replaced it on warranty.  However, the replacement sent to me was also inoperable and did not respond to the same suggested fixes.  Fitbit sent me yet another watch.  This one did work.  However they sent me the watch face without bands. Of course, I had the original bands, but trying to install them on the watch proved extraordinarily difficult.  After numerous tries by both my spouse and I, I called Fitbit and asked whether they could send me one with bands installed.  The representative simply told me that they couldn’t do that.  Since I bought it online, my only recourse was to go to a dealer where I hadn’t bought it (Costco) and ask for help.  To their credit, they installed the bands for me (it wasn’t easy for them, either).  So now I am on my third Versa which I have had for a few months, and its battery charge decreases quickly, and green lines obscure the clock face.  I suppose I could go through the warranty replacement process again (including finding a creative way to get the bands on, but I have no appetite for it.  I’ve written off the two hundred dollar cost to experience, and my only satisfaction is to suggest to other potential consumers not to repeat my unfortunate experience.
 Disappointed overall. Pros: Tells time, tracks steps locally. Cons: Major issues with syncing, bluetooth connectivity, NFC payment not working, activities not being tracked properly with the phone to GPS link. It is frustrating because this watch could be so great if all features worked 100% of the time. Currently only getting most features to work less than half the time. Even the alarms are unreliable. Step count is inaccurate. Bus and boat rides both count as steps even though I'm not moving. Like I said, I am disappointed. Especially considering the cost.<br/><br/>Update 8 July 2018 - Was forced to uninstall the Android Fitbit app because the app was consistently draining 20-25% of my battery and was causing every other app to slow and malfunction. Bluetooth connection was not reliable. Watch was only showing notifications occasionally, regardless of settings for persistent connection, always sync, etc. Contacted Fitbit for support and they were unable to offer a solution or a timeline for when their app will be fixed and for when the watch will be usable again. "At this moment we don't have an estimated date to release this update, however, rest assured that we'll release it as soon our software development team finishes with the investigations and testing." Extremely disappointed since I'm already outside of the return window.
 I thought that I would love my first Fitbit Versa Special Edition.  For the price, it should have been easy to setup and stay in working mode. The initial setup went well.  Then after two weeks, the sync stopped working.  I wasted 3 hours reading every online article from tech support including Fitbit.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the app on my LG4 android device. I restarted the phone multiple times.  I took off the overlay.  I granted permissions to Fitbit and turned them off for all other apps.  I even  tried to setup a new account under a different email.  The application is simply not connecting to my Fitbit.  I have received multiple messages to restart bluetooth.  This is not working.  I am so disappointed.  What a waste of money!  This is so annoying!  This watch is a piece of junk.  Either replace it or repair it or take it off of Amazon.
 I got this device as a birthday present. And I was really excited about it. I want to give the Versa 5 stars because when it’s working it’s great. But I can’t because it only worked for less than 5 days before it all started going wrong. And customer service is a complete nightmare. First the heart rate monitor started reading way high despite my doing no activity. So I contacted customer service and they provided some troubleshooting ideas. Reset the drevice, etc. No luck still faulty. They said they would contact the engineering team and get back to me. After not hearing anything for a few days I email them back, and they say to do another reset. Then the device started acting weird, getting stuck between screens, unable to respond to swipe commands, opening apps randomly and starting them, etc. so I turned off and charged over night. Contacted customer support and they told me to do a factory reset. OK I’ll give it a go. But before I could do that, the device up and died. Contacted customer support and they suggested it could be faulty charging and to clean the contacts (despite already having had a full charge the day before, supposed to last 4 days!). Um ok, but considering I just got this thing I seriously doubt the contacts are the problem. So I cleaned them. And moved it around to different outlets. Still dead!  I email them back saying it’s dead. And what do they respond with! A detailed email on how to do a factory reset. Hello! The device won’t even turn on! It doesn’t respond to button pushes! As soon as it started working weird they should have offered to replace the device. They still have not offered to warranty it out! Unbelievable. And it doesn’t help that I’ve had 3 different people at this point respond to me in the same email thread. As I have two more weeks to return to amazon, if they don’t replace it,I am returning it and washing my hands of Fitbit.
 One of my main concerns with wrist activated heart rate monitors was their ability to accurately track your heart rate. Not anymore. Recently I was admitted to the hospital . My stay was about five days. I was hooked up to a telemetry monitor the entire time. I also had my Versa on the entire time and checked it frequently against the monitor. I was shocked at the accuracy of the Versa. I've always relied on a typical chest strap heart rate monitor for accuracy. Never believing that anybody had "gotten down" the wrist pulse yet. Finally...It's here people. Not to diminish the rest of the Versa's abilities. The app Rocks. Tracking my sleep patterns is a big plus as well. I would say it is about 90% accurate, which is very good. I don't really use it for a lot of the exercise things that it can do. I've been a personal trainer for 20 years so I pretty much rely on my own abilities along with heart rate to do the job. Bottom line: It's light weight, looks great, has lots of faces and a great app, but, the accuracy of the heart rate monitor takes the "is this thing working properly" out of the equation. BTW, my heart rate was between 60 bpm and 150 in the hospital.
 I can't pair my Fitbit Versa to some Bluetooth speakers to play my music.  I called Fitbit and they told me the Versa does not work with all devices.  The tow devices are popular music media, Jeep Uconnect and Bose Soundlink II.  The product was purchased as a Fathers Day gift at Amazon back the Versa was introduced in April.  In fact, it was on Waitlist until available.  Now the Versa cannot be returned to AMAZON.  Worse $240 purchase and even worse customer service from Fitbit and Amazon.
 Upgraded from the charge 2<br/>I am really happy with this watch so far.<br/>I was worried it would look clunky bc I have childlike wrists, but it looks really good. And it's super light weight.<br/>Battery life seems to be holding up well.<br/>If you're looking for something with more apps or more phone like features (I.e LTE connectivity), I don't recommend this watch.<br/>It's the cross between smart watch and fitness tracker that I've been waiting for.
 I've had the Fitbit Versa for a month now and I loved it for the first week then I noticed a few small bugs, but nothing that I couldn't deal with the.  The smart wake still has some kinks in it.  When I would go to actually look at the screen, it would take a couple tries to get it to work or I just manually turned the screen on, but the smart screen would turn on whenever I was just readjusting my arm and didn't need to look at the screen (not very convenient in the middle of a movie theater).<br/><br/>My biggest issue is that you cannot drop the fitbit once without the screen shattering.  In it's defense, I drop things a lot, but did not know that cracked screens are not covered by the warranty.  If you do purchase the Versa, I highly recommend purchasing the accident protection and looking for screen protectors for it.  I'm not thrilled about paying $200 to use the Versa for only a month.
 ****Update**** 07/07/2018<br/>Over the past week the app was updated and now my watch is basically useless.  The app won't stay running on my phone.  It keeps turning off and so now I can't sync anything.  If you can't sync anything what good is it to have this watch?  I love everything about the watch, but the app needs help.  It seems like there is a log limit that has been reached on my phone because it won't let the app run.  It will start, but it won't run. It just keeps closing down.<br/><br/>I love a lot about this watch!  It has really helped me rep up my levels of activity, and be more mindful of my habits, and it also has so many conveniences built into it!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The ability to change the watch face.  I am super stats driven so I always have a face that I can get most my stats at a glance.<br/>-Being able to use it to pay for things<br/>-being able to use it when I sleep.  It was hard to get used to sleeping with something on my wriat at first, but the stat output is cool.<br/>-Being able to sync my steps with myfitnesspal.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-It doesn't sync my workouts to myfitnesspal, only my steps.<br/>-the Heartrate portion of it doesn't work so awesome when I workout.  I figured this going into my workout anyways. The further it is from the heart, the harder it is to be accurate.  I have the same issue with my arm band HR monitor.<br/>-The app store is very limited.  There are very few apps you can use with fitbit because they all have to be programmed for Fitbit.  There are some apps I use, like the wallet, relax, alarms, exercise, weather, and timer; but I don't use Pandora, I use Spotify, and I don't use Starbucks or Deezer.  I haven't tried transferring any songs to it because I don't have bluetooth headphones so it doesn't do me any good right now.<br/><br/>That being said, I bought this watch to help me be more contientious about my health and it is excellent at that so I am extremely happy with it!!
 I had the Fitbit Versa for only a couple of weeks. I loved it at first, until yesterday. I woke up yesterday and it was working fine. In the middle of the day, I went to check the time and the watch screen wouldn't respond. I tried clicking all of the buttons. It was fully charged. I restarted the fitbit and it would only show the time, none of the buttons would respond. The time displayed was 4 hours earlier. Today I went to work out and during the exercise, it constantly was glitching. None of the buttons responded. It wouldn't sync to the phone. The screen kept glitching between the current time in the workout and about a minute prior. I had to restart the entire versa to close out of the exercise because nothing else responded. After I restarted it I went to try and sync the bluetooth to try and see if maybe there was a software update for it. After several hours of it not syncing the bluetooth I have given up. I am sending my fitbit versa back. I went online and it seems a lot of people had the same issues. For the first time in years, I am going to try a different fitness watch. Fitbit lost my business when they couldn't make a smartwatch that lasted even a month before breaking.
 First let me preface this with the face that I worked in IT for 25 years at all levels.  I'm a power user of devices and applications, but also am the CEO of a fair sized company--bottom line is that I'm not stupid.<br/><br/>Problem #1 - The unit counts steps while I'm riding a motorcycle on pretty smooth roads and streets . Each day it added about 3000 steps on a 20-30 minute ride from work to my home.  Others are complaining of the same issue.<br/><br/>Problem #2 - I went out of town this weekend and forgot the charger so it died.  After recharging, it would not sync back up to the app on my phone.  My phone is a OnePlus 5T and is one of the best on the market.  Best phone I've ever had by a mile.<br/><br/>For $200 this thing should have worked much better.  Pretty ridiculous.
 My wife was very excited about getting a new smartwatch. The Versa seemed to offer everything she was looking for in a fitness tracker. After about 1 month of use, it stopped counting steps and heart rate (Google this issue...you will see it is very common). After doing a factory reset and uninstalling the app on the phone (you cannot de-link the watch in the app - you have to uninstall it), we got the watch working again...for 3 days. First is stopped counting steps, then it read a heart rate of 105 (doing intense cardio or resting). Talk about frustrating!<br/><br/>I called the Fitbit technical help number. It is funny that they mention that "if the call gets dropped, they will call you back". Their phone line works as well as their watch...like crap. After getting disconnected 2 times (and not receiving a call back) I was finally able to talk to someone without their line dropping. They confirmed that the watch stopped working and offered to send a replacement. Third time calling was the charm.<br/><br/>We will get the new watch, but we are very pessimistic that the issue will not crop up again. It seems to be an inherent problem with the Versa.<br/><br/>If you don't care about steps or heart rate, or a customer service line that will drop your call multiple times...this may be the watch for you. If not, let us know if you find a watch that works. We are in the market for a new watch.<br/><br/>**Update 10/8 - The replacement Fitbit Versa that was sent stopped working after 2 months. That is 2 Versa's failing in less than 6 months. This is a very bad sign for Fitbit. Quality seems to be a big problem on this model. Buyer beware.<br/><br/>**Update 10/20 - Customer service was supposed to send an email for me to confirm them to send a replacement again...no email received. Once again had to contact Fitbit to get the email and another soon to be paper weight. You do not get what you pay for...warranty will last 1 year from original purchase...even though each replacement fails. In 1 year I will out $200+ and have several paper weights sitting around.
 Had the product less than a month; screen went black, and won't turn back on. Tried to power cycle and factory reset... nothing. I read the reviews before buying knowing that some people had the same issue of it dying shortly after arriving; took a chance anyways. Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm disappointed in the fact that Fitbit has been in the wearable tech game for some time now, and this is the quality of product that passes for them. As for the software I can't give a review either for or against since there wasn't enough time to formulate an opinion.<br/><br/>I don't write reviews, so take it for what it's worth; this was just so bad that I couldn't let it slide unnoticed. If you still plan to buy, I hope your experience is better than mine has been.<br/><br/>I'll be looking for another solution elsewhere.
 I purchased my Versa at the end of March.  It is now mid-September and it burns through a 100% charge (which takes about 90 minutes) in 28 hours.  I use this pretty much JUST for the fitbit features and as an alarm clock daily.<br/><br/>For a watch that is supposed to hold a charge for days with lots of advanced notification features, the battery life just doesn't live up tp what was promised.<br/><br/>When I called customer support, they asked me to fully charge it, then turn off all alarms and notifications (all the features they advertise!!)  to see if that "helps the battery life".  I performed their test and I am now waiting for them to tell me what the next steps are.<br/><br/>This is very disappointing.  I've been a fitbit customer since 2013, and have owned the flex, Charge HR, Surge and now the Versa.  Never before have I had this issue with a fitibit device.<br/><br/>It may be time to check out the competition.
 Very disappointed with this one. I have owned Fitbit products for years and this one broke on me within a month of owning it. I was at work one day and it just went black on me. That morning it had a 40% charge and by midday, it was dead. It also would not charge correctly after that and the screen was not working as it it should. Fitbit is replacing it, but here it is a week later and I still haven't received the "replacement". I spent far too much money on this thing for it to not work.
 I have been a long time user of FitBit devices, starting from the Zip and graduating to the Versa after using an Ionic for about a year+. I love the Ionic. It tracks my workouts and Heart Rate well, shows the 'zones', etc. Has good battery life. The only thing I don't love about it is the SIZE so when the Versa came out I was excited to have a new, smaller option I could upgrade to. I waited until my Ionic got a bit scratched to have the excuse. LOL.<br/><br/>Anyway, I got my Versa about 10 days ago and it hasn't tracked my heart rate correctly since. It barely reads my resting HR and wasn't tracking my workouts at all. I've included some pre and post watch switch workout stats . You can see how it looks like I did nothing for an hour in the gym using the Versa where I'd normally have a bunch of info in my HR zones.<br/><br/>Anyway, I reset it to factory settings, made sure firmware was updated and did everything FitBit instructed to get the HR working correctly to no avail. I should also mention at this point that I have a SLEEVE OF TATTOOS on my non-dominant arm/wrist. As an experiment, I switched the watch to my dominant less-tattooed arm/wrist and the HR started working IMMEDIATELY. I then moved it back to my non-dominant fully tattooed arm and it again went blank. I think my mini-experiment, coupled with positive results already wearing the Ionic for many years (which excludes it being my own user error), proves it is my tattoos that are causing the HR to not be picked up.<br/><br/>Aside from that HUGE downside, this is a beautiful smartwatch. I love the sleeker profile and all the functions these FitBit watches have - HR tracking, music funtion, in-watch workouts, etc. I'm back to wearing my scratched up Ionic for now and am considering buying another one of this same kind until they can figure out the issues with the Versa. I LOVE FIT BIT but this watch just didn't work for me as a tattooed chick.
 This smartwatch is a very good purchase. Being a Polar fan for years, I really wanted to stick with the brand. My intentions were to get the Polar M430 but after reading that their wrist heart rate monitor demonstrates a too erratic behavior, I decided to look at other brands. The Versa is a perfect fusion of style, sports oriented performance and practicality.<br/><br/>Like everyone has mentioned here, the watch is super light and feels great on the wrist. I like it better than the Apple watch and I like the fact it has less apps and so easy to operate. As per the wrist heart rate performance, it is very accurate. I am getting the same readings of my usual runs and cycling workouts without the need of a chest heart rate receiver. I emphasize on the value of having an accurate readings from your wrist only. The sleeping readings also are of great value (give resting hr) and give you a better understanding of your sleeping patterns.<br/><br/>I give this watch a 4.5 /5 score (rounding it to 5). The only aspects I wish were different are the heart rate zones and the software interface. On the Polar platform, heart rate zones are classified into 5 levels. Fit bit only has 3 levels and you cannot modify it to separate the heart rate zones you want to stay at when you are working out. With all honestly, Polar might just have a better exercise platform (software). I do not want to take anything away from Fitbit's software platform but I wish it was a little more presentable (less colors and less animations). Obviously this is just my opinion and other people might like it.  I am very content with this watch and it feels like suddenly Polar is not as competitive as it used to be.
 I have had this watch for a day.  I got the special edition so out of the box it comes with two sets of bands both the fancy charcoal ones and a set of the plain black, in both small and large.  Very nice.  There is a lot of plastic to undo but hey that's life.  Setup was fine, it does take a long time to update, a solid 30 minutes and the software both on the watch and phone does not do a good job of letting you know what's going on.  But hey its does eventually finish and it’s good.<br/><br/>The smart watch apps are fine, nothing great but I have had other Android smart watches and they are all kind of boring.  I'm not a big fan of the smart watch functions on any watch so I don't care that much.  The messaging works well and DOES support Allo!  That's great for people that want this.  I already want to turn it off as getting all my texts on the watch gets annoying fast.<br/><br/>The watch itself is very comfortable and looks nice.  It seems to work the same or better than my charge 2.  It recorded my first night’s sleep great with no issues.  And my walk to work was the same steps as my Charge 2 so all good.<br/><br/>My only gripe and it’s going to get a BIG 1 star reduction (should get 2 really) is the Fitbit Pay!!  I paid extra for the NFC function as I assumed it would just pass Google Pay through the watch.  I use a smaller bank and Google Pay does work with it.  Well Fitbit Pay does not.  And come on... we don't need yet ANOTHER NFC payment option out there.  This is just Fitbit being greedy and trying to make money in an area that is not their business.  Even if it did take my bank card I doubt very many places would accept "Fitbit Pay" ... come on.  So this was a waste of money.  Don't buy this watch for the NFC unless you confirm that it will take your bank first.  And then have realistic expectations about what stores and vendors will actually accept “Fitbit Pay”.  What a shame.
 I've had this watch for two months. For the first month, it worked great. The idea of it is also great, and there are some great apps that have been developed for it that make it more robust than what #Fitbit alone provides. But since it doesn't sync, it's not worth anything. It's an expensive waste of your time.<br/><br/>For the last few weeks, it won't sync to the app (in my phone). My coworker bought one on my initial recommendation,  but hers also won't sync. Hence I know this is not a singularity.<br/><br/>#Fitbit customer service is GARBAGE. The first time I contacted them to report my problem, they had me repeat EVERYTHING I'd done to troubleshoot the syncing issue. The second time, they told me to factory reset the watch even though I told them I'm not the only person who is having this issue. Also: I have music and fitness routines loaded in to my watch - what a waste of my time for something that is clearly an issue on their end! I might give in and factory reset... but if I have to do that every single time I want to sync it (daily), there's no point in half the features I was interested in when I bought the watch.<br/><br/>Also, because it is so difficult to get it to sync I spent half a day without a clockface (I tried to change it, it go stuck trying to sync) so it wasn't even useful for it's basic function (a watch!).<br/><br/>If you never care if you sync it or not, then it might be the fitness tracker/smart watch for you.<br/>Reviews on other features: the guided breathing goes too quickly for me, and I typically end up with a higher (not lower) heart rate than what I started with as I try to match my breathing. Maybe it's the bluetooth headphones I use, but there's a syncing issue there as well (although deleting/re-adding them is quick so it's not a big deal). The idle alert is useful, but not customizeable (outside of choosing your active hours of the day).
 I like it so far but I've found the Fitbit app to be a little more complex than it needs to be. The only watch basically does what its advertised to do so if you're looking for a watch that tracks your steps and exercising, this watch is a good one to go with. Here are some of the cons I've experienced so far:<br/><br/>1. Not syncing properly with 3rd party app - I use the Loseit! app to track my food, calories, etc and was really excited to have a device that synced to that app so I wouldn't have to enter in exercise manually. It has never worked properly. None of my exercises from the watch show up in the Loseit! App even though some of the burned calories do. Through lots of troubleshooting and research, I've found this is more of a problem with the Fitbit app rather than LoseIt!. I still haven't found a resolution.<br/><br/>2. Some data isn't listed correctly in the app - You can view all the exercise you've done inside of the fitbit app. For some reason it doesn't list the calories burned for some exercises though. For example, a 30 minute walk from a few days ago shows calories burned, but 60 min of biking from yesterday does not. Both were tracked the same way on the watch.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why it shows for some and not other. I've looked on several forums where other people have been experiencing the same thing too. It's super annoying.<br/><br/>3. The Fitbit app can be cumbersome - The fitbit app has a lot of features but it definitely is made more complex than it needs to be. I am very tech savvy but still had a problem figuring out what certain features do what and how to navigate it properly.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I'm editing this review after having used the watch for about 7 months or so. Last month my watch started experiencing battery problems. It went from only needing to be charged every 4 days, to now needing to be charged more than once a day. After less than a week of this my watch would no longer power on or charge. I spoke to FitBit customer service who replaced my watch. I had to wait almost 4 weeks for the new watch to be mailed to me. Once I got the refurbished replacement, I was extremely disappointed to find that the replacement had touch screen issues. The watch was completely unreponsive to touch. I contacted FitBit customer service again who then sent me out ANOTHER refurbished replacement. Thankfully this time they overnighted it to me. When I got the second replacement, there was a big red X on the screen and it would not boot past it. After a couple of hours of internet searches and reading forums, I was able to figure out how to get it working and synced and a week later it seems to be working fine. I am really angry that a watch I spent over $200 for would stop working completely after only 6 months. I understand that sometimes thing can go wrong with electronics, but I can confidently say that it's very unlikely I will be buying another Fitbit again in the future.
 After only two weeks, my Versa stopped working.  It would not turn on, stuck on a Fitbit logo screen.  Looking online, it seems that this issue is very common and appears to be a defect with the watch, and can’t be resolved by the user.  After leaving it for a couple of weeks due to travel and other issues , I contacted Fitbit to resolve the issue.  Contacting Fitbit customer service, they were so difficult to deal with, even though this issue appears to be a well known issue for them.  Having owned other Fitbit devices, I’ve found their customer service to be great in the past, definitely not anymore.  Not only am I disappointed with a product clearly not ready for commercial release, I am so frustrated with Fitbit’s new customer service approach!
 I have had three Fitbits before this one, the other three still work after years of use but this one stopped working in a matter of months. After two months the screen would start to fade if on for more than a few seconds, and now the heart rate doesn’t work at all. This was definitely a waste of money for me. I am going back to using my Alta HR, since I didn’t have any problems with that.
 I am on day 4 with the new Versa and I absolutely love it. I have gone swimming with it, the main reason I got it in parallel with the fact that my old Fitbit wasn’t holding a charge anymore. I can see the integration of the acquired Pebble team which I was a huge fan of. This marries best of both worlds and puts it into (in my opinion) the most beautiful design. It’s not a blocky, gooby, and awkward looking Apple Watch, nor a clunky large workout watch. This watch, I think, is literally my favorite watch both design and function. Thank you Fitbit for getting it perfect! Can’t wait to use all the other amazing features this watch has!
 Pro: Cute<br/><br/>Cons: Will not synced to PC or Phone. Apps forget their settings. Convoluted time consuming process to change Clock Face.  Even more tedious if you want to purchase one.  Trial faces and apps will lock up the watch until synced with PC to uninstall or purchase.  Kind of like ransomware. Watch continuously needs to be rebooted. Music is prone to RF interference like at a gym with electronic equipment.<br/><br/>Worst: Fitbit Pay or NOT. Watch keeps forgetting linked payment accounts. Solution is uninstall/reinstall the phone app and reboot the watch. Sometimes several times. Not many banks support Fitbit Pay and some listed ones don't either.<br/><br/>Sorry zero stars are not an available choice.
 Absolute piece of crap.  Out of the box, heart rate monitor doesn’t work.  Checked the forums, this is a serious, common problem, and Fitbit is incapable or unwilling to fix it.  I had an Ionic but I beat it up in a waterfall, and it was buggy as hell (don’t buy one of those either), so I decided to try this “upgrade.”  Total disappointment.  Fitbit has continued their practice of treating hardware like software:  release a terrible product and cross your fingers that you’ll be able to fix it after enough people complain.  Meanwhile they’re quickly developing a reputation for releasing shoddy, untested, crappy hardware.<br/><br/>Consumer Reports gave the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro the highest rating of any modern fitness tracker, and it appears to have all the same features as the top-of-the-line Fitbit.  Plus it’s cheaper.  Mine arrives tomorrow.  I’m never buying another Fitbit product, and neither will I ever recommend one; in fact I will loudly recommend against them.
 Fitbit Versa, Vantage Point: this review is focused on uses by one very interested in incorporating scheduled and found activities in an ever changing week.  Topics of interest are not solely footwork running, swimming and seasonal biking/skiing.<br/>  PROS: Informative for combinations of steps, heart rate range, sleep and hydration. Surprisingly light weight.  Watch Face is comfort on woman’s arm. Making use of changeable faces (info during classes and individual effort vs travel vs dining or theater.  Like options for seeing weather and availability of high contrast and analog second hand. I enjoy relaxation mode and prompts for deep breathing.  Nice adding motivation with familiar music.<br/>FIRST DAYS.  Not intuitive for 4 year jawbone user.  30 minute setup? Used YouTube and downloaded detailed manual (hard to find) to swiftly, confidently detach bands for charging. Some elements/detail only available through multiple selections on I-phone. Is customizable, sort of. But, I do like it.<br/>CONS (POV for Innovager:<br/>1.  Activity monitors should not be  just pedometers.  That is, “workout” category is too general.<br/>  a. I want to look at step class, total body/burn, weights class, sit-ups, dancing:line dancing Zumba and others may want Silver Sneakers Leave workout as a catch all.<br/>  b. For these activities as well as walks, I’d like to self  rate my effort for that slot of activity; easy, mod, difficult, In zone, gut buster.<br/>  And calories burned should reflect this (e.g., jawbone model).<br/>  2.  Sleep and daily average heart and activity are are  to read.  Vertical bar charts by day? In fact summary bar charts vary in legibility and I haven’t figured how to display sleep and overall activity or steps together by week or month.<br/>  3. Innovagers are a huge potential market. I was put off that as soon as I entered “female,” I had to answer questions solely developed for ages 11-50ish.  At least give us NA option?<br/>  Bookmark: consumer panel on 5 aspects of self-rated memory response.<br/> 4. Quick peer comparison; wrist width changes with hot weather. Need 1/2 inch more to move it up to get heart rate as shown in instructions.<br/>NOTES. Because I’m urban and walking at various times and paces, I have continuous monitoring and am charging more often than each 3 days.  Am purchasing alt bands and smaller charger. Glad I found this. I will update review as apt.
 I really wanted to like this Fitbit. I have had the Charge and the Alta so I guess you can say I am loyal to Fitbit. Love my Apple products but didn’t need to be tied to another gadget like I felt the Apple Watch would do.  I was excited to get a Fitbit with a very clear crisp screen. HR tracker, apps. Fit Bit coach, weather and choice of watch faces ( best clocks cost a nominal fee).  Pandora works with paid subscription. Most apps that I use only occasionally would require a paid subscription. Why not have Amazon music available?  The very first time I tried a mini workout with the fit bit coach feature it malfunctioned. The BP went way up. It wasn’t a hard workout. Received a text during the workout but could not get off the workout screen. I could pause but could not close. There was no way to exit the workout ( at this point I wasn’t working out, just my finger trying to get out of the app) The HR and app responded as if I was working out.  What?  HR went way up to workout rate. It should have shown close to resting. I let the app run its course and finally after the workout cycle I could get to the clock/ other screens.  I have had the watch for a little more than 24 hours and I had notification the battery was low and I had to place it on the charger.  Nice try Fitbit with the “smart watch”. Best stick to the basics.  On my way home today I purchased the Alta HR.  Yes, I am returning the Versa. Maybe I can try the Versa again after all of the glitches and aggravation is worked out and tested on more consumers.
 I have been a Fitbit user since the first charge HR came out. Previous to the versa I used the charge hr2.  Was so excited to upgrade to a "smart" Fitbit when this was released but made myself work for it.  After losing the 10 lbs I promised to myself, I purchased the versa.<br/><br/>Day 1 of using and the HR is extremely off. I went in a vigorous hike and my HR never exceeded 120 bpm.  I've done the same hike with my charge2 and it tracked much more accurately, at times over 150 bpm.  at first I thought holy crap my charge2 has been wrong this whole time but then I did a physical check of my pulse and found I was in the 140 bpm range.<br/><br/>Upon returning home I looked at all the forums to see it others had this issue and seems that the new charge 3 is also guilty of this.  Some claim it's the longer battery life that took priority over heart rate accuracy, others speculate that its dropping from 2 sensors down to 1.  Whatever the case, I am so disappointed in Fitbit for not addressing these issues.  I have been a loyal user since 2014 and will be returning the versa until Fitbit can market an new reliable product.
 I have been a loyal fitbit wearer for 4 years.  I have had the Force (recalled), Charge, Charge HR and when the Versa came out decided to get it.  I got 4 months of use out of it before it died.  The screen basically turned black and it would no longer work.  I emailed Fitbit.  After 8 emails, numerous pictures they state they will "send a new one."  If you google the fitbit versa there are numerous message threads about these watches not having a long life.  If I am spending $229+tax on a watch I expect it to work for a while.  If I had not been out of my return period for Amazon I would have returned it.<br/><br/>If you must buy a Fitbit versa buy it at a store where you can return it.  Fitbit does not give money back and you dont even get a new watch but may get a refurbished one.<br/><br/>I had an apple watch and sold it due to loving my fitbit more but this will be the last fitbit I ever buy.  When a company knows their product is defective and won't issue a recall or issue refunds there is an issue.
 This is the most infuriating electronic device I have ever owned. This was meant to be an upgrade from the Charge HR, but I will be returning to my older tracker for simplicity sake.<br/>1. I was excited to use this to track bike rides for distance traveled and speed. In order to do so, it needs to connect to your phone to use the GPS. I have used the tracker twice for this purpose and both times it took ~10 minutes to connect to my phone. After connecting, it worked for about an hour and then kept losing connection and gaining connection throughout the workout. I lost a total of 10 miles on the ride due to connectivity issues.... and then the battery died (it was at 100% at the beginning of the ride. After 2 hours of continuously trying to reconnect, the battery ran out). When this happens, the entire workout is lost and not recorded.....I was very frustrated, as was my husband who had to listen to me complaining about the connectivity.<br/>2. Significant lag when switching between screens on the watch. Not smooth at all. Very clunky interface.<br/>3. No more pressing the side button to start recording a workout. You need to switch between these slow to load screens and find the matching workout and press start. So much more difficult than recording a workout on the Charge HR.<br/>4. Good luck recording a workout if you are doing any weightlifting. Basically anytime you hold a barbell in front rack, the workout will pause due to your wrist touching the bulky watch face.<br/>5. General lack of any useful apps, especially the lack of Spotify.<br/><br/>In general, I just really dislike this watch.  I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants to track workouts that require GPS connection through your phone, or to anyone that does weightlifting. This watch does fine for simple heart rate/calorie burning/ step tracking, however I would recommend any other cheaper and less bulky model over this "smart watch"
 Recommended for: Regular people who want to take care of there health in a budget-friendly way!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Price - Just too good as compared to other ill thought products such as Android Wear.<br/>* It's for regular users who want fitness checks, limited smart-watch functions, great experience(battery life).<br/>* UI is simple, the design is simple.<br/>* Battery does last for 4 days.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Not for a fitness freak as it lacks GPS.<br/>* It's not as good smartwatch as Apple Watch but hey it's not as pricey as Apple watch.
 I love this fitbit. I've had multiple different fitbits (flex, charge hr, and blaze) and this is by far my favorite. It is light weight, aesthetically pleasing and has a LOT of customization. If you've owned a fitbit before you'll be happy with this one as it improves on all the older models, most importantly the addition of being waterproof allowing for swimming activities.<br/><br/>However, there are a few downsides i wanted to address<br/>I opted for the special edition one in part for the band. I am allergic to the standard fitbit so i was excited for the possibility of getting one at launch with a band that i wouldn't be allergic to and not requiring an immediate band upgrade. The fact that it has nfc pay as well was just a bonus.<br/><br/>However something they really did not factor in when creating this woven band is exactly how bad it can smell if you dont routinely clean it with soap and water. I typically go to the gym and straight to work, with little time in between to literally wash my fitbit band between uses,  i'm used to wiping it down. While showering with it is possible, that creates its own set of issues as leaving a sopping wet band on my skin is not good for either. So if you actually workout while wearing this fitbit be way that it may start to smell if you do not clean it routinely after each workout.<br/><br/>and while not a deterrent for me, it is a bit upsetting that they have partnered with Pandora and something called...Deezer? but dont have a contract with Spotify for music. However that is a minor thing as i rarely use my fitbit separate from my phone.<br/><br/>overall though, its their best product yet they just haven't been able to make a standard band that doesnt create a problem for me.
 I was excited to finally to have saved enough money to get a smart watch that I can sync with my fitness app. The directions that the watch came with were extremely vague. So I played with it for a couple of days and was able to figure out most of the basics there were a few things that I never did figure out. The biggest draw back on the watch is that I noticed that when I was driving or doing anything that required motion from my hands it logged it in as steps and at the end of the day the step were way off. For me that was one of the biggest reason for getting this besides the fact that you can take it in the pool when swimming. I returned it and am still looking for a smart watch that can do all the things that I want it to do!!!
 I have been an avid Fitbit user with having had 4 watches in my lifetime.  I finally decided to buy the new versa and within 2 weeks the screen cracked and broke with normal gym and daily use.  I was able to swap it out for a new one.  This time deciding to buy a cover and screen protector- within 1 week it had a crack.  Called customer support, they were useless and pretty much told me they don’t fix watches and I needs to fork over another $300 for a new watch.  I have never had such a horrible experience with a Fitbit product.<br/><br/>If the screen is crap, you need to have better way of servicing these broken screens.  After my chat with support, I will never purchase a Fitbit product again.  Hello Garmin!
 I first started wearing FitBit products 2 years ago. I started with the flex but decided I wanted something that also functions as a watch when I decided to upgrade. I ordered the Versa in May (2018) and only had it for 3-4 months before the face went blank and it stopped lighting up. I contacted customer service who had me go through a zillion steps to reset it even though I kept telling them that the screen remained blank and wouldnt light up or show anything. They finally agreed to send me a new tracker but I had to return my old one. They did send me a label and fortunately I had some boxes laying around so that was pretty easy. About 2 weeks later after taking the original one to USPS, I finally got my new Versa and at first everything seemed ok. But then i realized that it was calculating steps when I was doing absolutely nothing to warrant steps counted. One time I noted it counted steps when I was petting my dog and then another night when I was at a comedy club, I somehow reached my 5,000 step mark from just laughing really hard. This is kind of a huge deal as it throws off all the other calculations.  I'm also unsure about the heart rate monitor as it was at 100 bpm when I was sitting down one day. At this point, its just an expensive watch that also happens to have the date and helps me keep track of my cycle. There seem to be some people that haven't had any issues with their trackers but unfortunately I am not one of them.
 I purchased this watch on October 19th, 2018 through Amazon.  I returned it on October 31st, 2018.  Fitbit Versa was released April of 2018, which is still fresh.  When I purchased the watch the first few days were fine, no issues. But then on October 28th, 2018 vertical lines, discoloration, and dimming appeared on the screen. Even though it is waterproof, I never showered with it, never got it wet. The most moisture it may have had is sweat. I never accidentally banged it against anything or anything like that.  For whatever mysterious reason it just started acting up. I even caught it not monitoring my heart rate at one point. Oh let me not forget to mention it would record me climbing stairs although I hadn't climbed any. I decided to return it and wait about 6 months to repurchase it or another smart watch. But waiting 6 more months may give the company some time to workout their glitches as I have read on Fitbit forums that vertical lines is very common with this watch. Good luck!
 I am an avid fitbit user. I have and tested flex, alta HR, blaze and versa.<br/>I also purchased fitbits for my entire family to keep everyone actice and connected.<br/><br/>Here fitbit versa review. Whike it is one of the best fitbits (look and gadget capacity ) it still has a long way to go.<br/><br/>Pro: continuously evolving apps similar to approach/smartphones<br/>Con: app installment can take a long time, there are numerous other  glitches and disconnecting/syncing interruption and other alerts midway are common. (Fitbit blaze and alta HR have a more solid connectivity even when picking such simple,things like clockface).<br/>Also numerous apps ask for payments without being flagged as such meaning this is is only apparent when clicked on the app and looking it up itself.<br/>If it would be possible to sort them into free versus not free that would improve user experience similar to providing a quick legend /info as headline.<br/><br/>Pro: music control improved from prior models.<br/>Con: unable to run/see running stats while music is,on<br/><br/>Con: drains phone battery (unusually more than other fitbit models - so be aware to adjust settings)<br/>Pro: water resistant - excellent in a pool/doing laps<br/>Note: after 3 test swims in the atlantic the watch crashed (backlight remains on and watch battery drained within 3 hours) and even a factory reset did not help. While I do like the versa and think,it is a great imorovemnt and first start for fitbit regarding entering the smart watch market, there are numerous glitches that range from mildly annoying to to full failures. I hope,fitbit figures them out soon so ot can be a more reliable wearable device.
 I love the sleek/slim design of this watch and how easy it it to use and navigate. The reason I didn’t give it 5 starts is because my GPS tracking is off. My mileage is always shorter than what Map My Run says and my husband Garmin Fenix 5 watch says. I upgraded to this watch from the Alta HR and am overall very pleased—mostly due to the more accurate HR. This seems to record way more accurately than the Alta. My Alta would read a HR of 75-95 during my cardio workouts. I’ve also included pictures of Today’s stats. You can easily scroll down on your list to get a glance at an overview of your day.
 I'm very disappointed with the Fitbit Versa. The first one I ordered did not updated and eventually stopped linking via blue tooth even after resetting it. Got a replacement a few days later and after repeated failures to update on 3 different devices via blue tooth and wifi I'm returning it for a refund. This is the first Fitbit product I've had a problem with.
 I've been a Fitbit user since the beginning and upgraded devices a few times. I was excited to purchase the Versa in the end of May but a few weeks after I purchased the device the screen just went black. Customer service was AWFUL and after being promised "expedited shipping" my replacement arrived 6 weeks later. Less than 2 months later, my replacement device has failed. Screen appeared distorted, then became unresponsive to touch. Fitbit support walked me through the steps to reset it multiple times which then lead to a complete black screen and broken product AGAIN. I wore my Versa daily but didn't even shower or swim with it.  After voicing my disappointment they informed me expedited shipping was no longer an option and that I will receive the replacement in a few weeks. While Fitbit customer service use to be great it is now horrible and they are selling defective product.
 Really like the Fitbit products then it started glitching and needed (within first 4 weeks) replaced which happens. Still a great watch just happened to get a faulty one. This is more about the service I got tryiNG to fix the problem. The customer service is friendly but do NOTHING to make it convenient for you. I will now be without it for 3 weeks or more waiting for a replacement which I feel is like a big F-YOU to the customer. It was a legit malfunction with the product nothing I did. Amazon did nothing to help either. Even the warranty I bought off Amazon ended up doing nothing to help (apperantly doesn't start for 1 whole year either, until manufacturer warranty runs out which I didn't notice, so it's kinda pointless) Amazon would only do a refund which I didn't want or I'd  buy an upgraded watch the iconic which I'd have to front the money for until they got my return product and put money back in my account. I understand things happen but neither company went out of their way to try to help, improve the situation, make it better or most importantly make the customer a happy customer or as happy as can be with the situatiom. It was pretty much your out of luck man, Oh well. Instead of you know what let's see how we can improve this situation for you, let's fix this! Extremely disappointed in the services provided by both Fitbit and Amazon not so much the product
 I'm not sure I would buy this watch again. My past smart watch was a Samsung Gear Fit2 and I have to say it had so many more functional aspects than the Versa. I can't believe that Fitbit hasn't integrated some of the features that you'd automatically expect it to have. And when you comment on the Fitbit website about the various missing features their comment is "We'll take this into consideration." However them taking it into consideration doesn't ever translate into action. I've been waiting for the Versa to be able to silence phone alarms since I bought this product months ago. Notifications and vibrations are not constant. When you set an alarm on your Versa - You get three short vibrations and then it automatically snoozes for 9 minutes! These three short vibrations aren't enough to wake me up so I always have to have a backup alarm set on my phone.<br/><br/>The fact that you can't store watch faces drives me bonkers! I love changing my watch face with the season, but with Fitbit once you change your face you have to go searching through the hundreds of other faces just to get the one you used back. No favorites, no saving faces to the Fitbit app. Very poor user features. This is another issue that Fitbit responded back with "We'll take this into consideration". But still nothing changes.<br/><br/>While the watch is nice and functions as a step tracker sometimes - I'm not sure how accurate it is. I went on a bike ride yesterday - set the watch for bike ride yet the watch clocked me having walked 11,000 steps. I didn't step one foot off the bike in over an hour yet it clocked me walking 11,000 steps.<br/><br/>In a nutshell - I think Fitbit as A LOT of work to do on this model. I wouldn't recommend buying it until the issues are fixed.
 Being nearsighted, I have always worn a watch to bed because I cannot see the clocks in the room. So a cheapo LCD digital watch with the basic light function has worked for the past 30 years.  Now I've got this amazing smart watch which not only serves the main function of time piece during the night, it also tracks my sleep states!  I use a CPAP so it has allowed me to actually see the change in sleep states when I take the mask off halfway through the night.  It would appear I have many more "awake state" periods than I expected. (Dang)<br/><br/>The device I'm fondly referring to as my "wrist nag" will let me know 10 minutes before the hour that I've not gotten up and away from my computer to take at least 250 steps.  Funny thing is I really need to do this (back problems) and I had a computer nag that did something similar but it did not vibrate.  Something about that vibration on my wrist and that 10 minute window motivates me to get up and take the long way around to the bathroom, down a flight of steps, outside, around the building, back in the main entrance, up the stairs and to the bathroom, then back to the office.  which is about 600 steps, and then I get a happy vibration letting me know I achieved this goal.<br/><br/>I know that sounds silly on the surface of it. Childish even, but smart behavioural Psychologist figured out that these simple things like the vibration, the little gold stars, completing the circle goals every day, actually motivates.<br/><br/>I'm doing things I never thought I would do just in order to achieve my daily goals. To get that gold star!<br/><br/>I've had this for a couple of months now and I still love it.  I really like the very fast charging feature since I rarely take this thing off.
 This watch is simply below quality for the price. My watch had a small rubber piece coming apart at the top.  I sent it back and asked for a new one, which cracked in the corner after a few months due to poor manufacturing. This is my 7th fitbit product, and I have had quality issues with 3 of them. I never complained on 2 of them, but the 3rd one I did and Fitbit customer service treated me like it was my fault. Time time to move off the platform.
 When I first started wearing this watch I absolutely loved it. As time went on the notifications of my phone calls and text messages slowly started to decrease to the point of where I would only get about 5% of my notifications on my watch. So I called Fitbit customer service. They reset the notifications and resynched my watch to my iPhone 7S. We ran a test while I was on the phone with customer service and it worked, so we hung up. About 20 minutes later I realized it still wasn’t working right. So I called customer service back. They reset my Fitbit to factory settings and we resynced the Fitbit to my phone again. All day long today I only received one missed call notification and no text message notifications, which would be right around 1% of my notifications. So I called customer service back. They told me there is an issue with the IOS Fitbit app. They refused to replace my Fitbit which is under warranty. The women I spoke with said it usually takes 4 weeks to fix a bug like this. So I guess I am supposed to be satisfied with a non-working watch for a month while I wait for them to fix the issue with the app?
 This is my third product by Fitbit.  I've owned the One model, the Blaze, and now the Versa.<br/><br/>***Update: 5.28.18 my Versa screen went completely blank this morning after about 5 weeks of normal wear. The backlight comes on, but the screen is otherwise blank. The tracker will still track steps, flights of stairs, etc., but it is useless as a watch. I have contacted Fitbit and am in the midst of troubleshooting. I suspect I will need a replacement.***<br/><br/>The short, concise review is: if accurate, consistent sleep tracking is not a high priority to you, this tracker is superb!  And, this tracker is definitely water resistant.  For my purposes, this is the best fitbit I've owned and I definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>For a more detailed review -<br/><br/>Things I love about the Versa:<br/><br/>It is water resistant!  While I haven't tested the Versa in a pool yet, I have worn it in the shower several times without any issue whatsoever!  For me, both personally and professionally, having a water resistant watch is a MASSIVE perk!<br/><br/>I have small wrists, and one thing I did not like with my previous Fitbit (the Blaze) was how bulky the watch band was.  The band always stuck out from my wrist, leaving gaps.  While I did get a third party replacement band for my Versa (solely because of personal style preference), the band that came with the versa fit more flush to my wrist and I like the fit MUCH better than I did with the Blaze.  I also love that there is no casing around the device itself and that you can charge the Versa without removing the band.<br/><br/>This tracker is also *very* accurate - probably the most accurate out of the 3 different model's I've owned! I always felt like my Blaze was missing steps if my arms were not always in motion when I walked (this posed a step tracking problem if I was carrying a child or a load of laundry, etc.), so much so that I would often take the Blaze out of the wristband and tuck it into the side of my bra because it registered more accurately when worn on my core (similar to the fitbit One) than it did on my wrist.  The Versa seems to be extremely accurate - yes, I've counted steps and double checked on several occasions at times when I have been carrying something and at times when I've just been walking.<br/><br/>While this is a lesser detail, I like the variety of free watch faces and the options to purchase watch faces.  While I generally prefer a digital watch face, I work part time in the medical profession and having a digital watch with a second hand can be very helpful.  The Versa covers both these bases!<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor also seems to be very accurate.<br/><br/>Cons: Probably the most common complaint about the Versa is the inaccurate sleep tracking.  I'm among those who have experienced this issue, or me personally, this isn't a huge deal.  Sure, I'd love it if the tracking were as accurate as the Blaze was, the inaccuracy of sleep tracking is a worthy sacrifice for the Versa being water resistant.  Most nights, tightening the band one notch above my daytime wear fit does improve tracking.  But, I do still get simplified sleep results or just downright cut short sleep results.  Much of the time this can be improved by simply logging into the Fitbit app and adjusting your awake time.
 I purchased this as a gift for my wife. Initially, she was very happy with it. Then, she set it up, and it's been downhill since then.<br/><br/>Since it came out of the box 3 days ago, it has not tracked her steps properly (she didn't wear it to bed last night, and still registered THOUSANDS of steps!), it won't sync to her phone properly, fails to connect via Bluetooth, and couldn't recognize our wifi when it was physically placed on the router (the directions said to place it as close to the router as we could, so...).<br/><br/>She did a factory reset, had to delete the app from her phone, and go through this set-up process multiple times. She called customer service yesterday, and they were friendly, but not very helpful.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that disappointed is a good word to describe our experience. We've both had the Flex for 4 years and never had any problems with it. My wife wanted the Versa MORE THAN the Apple Watch, but now, I'm not sure she wants to keep the Versa.
 My husbands Fitbit blaze stopped holding a charge almost a year and a half after purchase. While shopping for a new one he saw the Versa and liked what it had to offer so we bought it.  Our biggest and only complaint about it, and it’s a deal breaker, is that it counts steps while driving.... a lot of them.<br/><br/>My husband is a truck driver, he would usually average about 15,000 steps a day with the blaze. With the Versa it shows he gets anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 steps on days he drives and 10,000 to 15,000 on days he doesn’t.  Quite a drastic difference right? Well not according to Fitbit customer service.<br/><br/>They refuse to acknowledge there is a problem with the device although there are hundreds, if not thousands of people complaining about this very problem. Customer service claims the device has been tested with various modes of transportation and the increased step count is minimal. Ha! 15,000 to 45,000 additional steps is hardly minimal.<br/><br/>They also recommended purchasing a third party app to track when he is driving that will change the fitbit data. Really?!? For as much as we paid for this device we now have to purchase a separate app for it to work properly!!!! With this app you have to remember to turn it on before driving and then off when finished. This would be an annoyance for my husband as he is in and out of his truck all day.<br/><br/>My husband didn’t have this problem with the blaze nor did I have it with the Alta HR. My husband purchased a Versa for me for Christmas and we will be returning it. I will just stick with my Alta HR for now. As for my husband, Fitbit refuses to replace it or refund the device because they don’t think there is a problem with the device and even if they thought otherwise they wouldn’t anyway because it is outside the 60 day warranty window. What a joke! This whole experience has us dead set against purchasing another Fitbit product ever.
 I have had the Versa for over a week now and I have concluded that while it does everything it says it does, there are some caveats.<br/><br/>1. Step counting.  The Versa seems to be more sensitive than other Fitbit's in this category, particularly when driving.  I recommend the 3rd party app DriveBit to help control this over-counting.  Kind of annoying.  This also helps control the ridiculous floor count that will accumulate when driving up a hill.  See? Kind of annoying.<br/><br/>2. Sleep Tracking.  This almost had me pulling my hair out. It tracked the first night, and then no data for the next few nights I've been with customer service and on Fitbit community to figure out why the heck the sleep tracker is so erratic. The conclusion....<br/><br/>3. Heart Rate Monitor!  This thing was cutting out on me to the point that I was checking if it was getting a read every 5 minutes!  It'd lose read and then not establish a new read!  gah! I almost returned the thing until I switched the Versa to my dominant arm and now I've had constant tracking! The thing wasn't getting a read because my left arm is covered by a dark tattoo!  I looked it up and sure enough other tattooed individuals are having the same issue.<br/><br/>So, buyer beware!  I'm keeping the thing because it does work, is comfortable and overall like its functionality but It would be SUPER NICE to know that tattoos affect this type of heart rate monitor.<br/><br/>Heads up Fitbit: You have a tattoo problem!
 I like the product concepts overall. BUT disclaimers about the possible non stopping headaches + migraines for sensitive people NEED to be broadcasted by Fitbit and I truly feel like this company is NOT taking its costumers seriously by burying and denying this.<br/>It was BY FORTUNE that I linked the Fitbit with my 5 days long migraine + aura that left me out of balance, gym, work AND getting medical trials.<br/>Few hours after I started using my Fitbit Versa it started! I immediately had an aura and couldn't function for the next 5 days up until yesterday when AFTER the medical trials returned ok I started to debug all what was new in my life and by luck placed my debugger on the Fitbit.<br/>I was OF COURSE reluctant but removed it to sleep. I woke up feeling MUCH better - no aura and (being able to see enough so I could google my assumptions and it TURNS OUT there are forum threads in Fitbit reporting exactly this<br/><br/>Now my headache might wear off and I hope it will entirely as the days pass<br/>I don't want to EVER know about fitbit products again<br/>I want a refund and an apology (will return the watch for sure) because you can't just toy around with people health like this. Shame on Fitbit team and 0 respect. IF you know this might happen EVEN if it is to sensitive people you HAVE to broadcast this. You have to add BIG RED UPPER LETTERED warnings.
 This is my second Fitbit and my first smart watch. Set up was easy and took less than 30 minutes. I haven’t used many of the features outside of the regular fitness tracker stuff but it is working flawlessly. Versa has a nice bright screen and I’m having lots of fun changing watch faces...there must be close to a million! It fits nicely and is neither too big or too small.  So glad I got this cute smart watch!
 I was, at first, a bit leery of moving from the HR Charge 2 to a "smartphone" kind of device, as I don't like large watches, feeling that the Charge was about on the cusp between "okay-sized" and "too big", but I was pleased that the Versa doesn't feel too large.  It feels on-par with how the old casio calculator watches felt on my adolescent wrist.  It's light enough that I feel my concerns here were justified, but mollified enough to be tolerable.<br/><br/>I'm able to shower with it, and I've worn it during a bath with no issues.<br/><br/>The display is bright enough with crisp resolution, and is no less frustrating than any other "lift to turn the screen on" device out there.<br/><br/>The battery life feels like five days worth.<br/><br/>As far as fitness tracking, when it works, it works. It hooked up to my Google Pixel 1 phone readily enough and was able to transfer over a new watch face and track my GPS during biking once.  *ONCE*.<br/><br/>I have tried rebooting, doing factory resets, etc, but this watch is an enormous bamboozle.  It manages to sync step and sleep data perhaps once or twice per week, but other than that, it's useless for live data tracking.  (I have it set to "All Day Sync" with "Keep-Alive Widget" enabled.<br/><br/>This is despite never having issues with GPS tracking during biking through the HR Charge 2, nor with my fitbit scale.<br/><br/>This is not a 1-star product, though.  As a time-keeping device, it is fine.  As a step-tracker, it is fine.  As a heart rate monitor, it is fine.  The hardware aspect of it seems fine.  Coupled with a pad of paper and a pen, this is a 3-star device, but ain't nobody got time for that.<br/><br/>I suspect the reason that the battery life is so good is that it hardly ever engages in any wireless communication with my phone anymore.<br/><br/>This is also to say nothing of Fitbit's lack of human support, seeming to prefer cut-and-paste responses that deflect or repeat empty promises (the HR2 is supposed to have SpO2 measurement, but still doesn't, to say nothing of anything else they make).<br/><br/>Fitbit are bad people, and they should feel bad for producing shoddy software and providing shoddy support for that software while charging as much as they do for it.  If you have an HR2 and are content with it, stay with that. (I have no experience or opinions about the HR3 refresh.)
 This thing is unfortunately a piece of **** because of a ridiculously poor Android app. Do a little searching and you will see a huge volume of problems with syncing. In our case we have a Panasonic home phone system with BT link that allows us to answer our cell on any of the house phones. But syncing will not work reliably if the phone has that link active. After trying a great many combinations of re-installing the app, turning BT on and off, re-booting the phone, and all the other things their technical "support" dictates - it seems the only way to get the crummy app to sync is to unpair the home phones. That is ridiculous. Fitbit - you should be ashamed of yourselves, fix your app. If my wife didn't want it I'd happily send the thing back.
 PROS: I like this watch and think the design is sleek, simple, and clean. I love that there is a heart rate monitor that isn't bumped out so you get a smooth, flat back that doesn't dig into the wrist or leave pressure marks. Set up was easy--it took about 30 minutes, which Fitbit was abundantly clear about, and there were lots of helpful instructions and images to make the process straightforward.<br/><br/>CONS: The bands are really hard to change--the pin system is not highly functional, and it's very finnicky to actually get them into place. My major complaint about this watch, however, is that without GPS, running data is simply inaccurate. For the last five days, I've been wearing the Versa alongside my Garmin Forerunner, and the distance data for the Versa is consistently .2-.25 miles behind. For every mile I run with the Garmin, the Versa only reads at .75-.8 miles run, which is especially frustrating since the sales consultant I spoke with at Fitbit assured me that the Versa was capable of accurately tracking distance without GPS.
 I’ve had a Fitbit charge 2 for almost 2 years and have loved it but I really wanted one that had a screen that was easier to read. So far I have had no issues with the watch. It takes a while to setup but only takes about 30 minutes to charge every few days. I did buy a different band that is soooo much easier to attach than the one that comes with it. I also bought screen protectors as several reviews stated their watch scratched easily. I love being able to set alarms easily from the watch instead of having to use the app. I also love that it fits so much more flush to the skin than my charge 2 and doesn’t leave indentions in my skin. With the charge 2 I often had to take it off and scratch my skin where it felt irritated. With the versa I forget I’m even wearing it.<br/><br/>I decided not to pay the extra $30 for the special edition because I always have my phone with me to use Apple Pay so I don’t need my watch to do that.<br/><br/>The women’s cycle feature is a nice new addition as well. I also like the ability to change watch faces easily.<br/><br/>So far really am happy with this purchase and have my charge 2 as a gift to my sister.
 So far so good! I’ve only had the Versa for a few days but I love it so far. It’s pretty, comfortable, and functional. Battery life is good. It has multiple apps and customizable watch faces. It can play music you load onto it. You cannot reply to texts but you can get notifications. I like that the watch bands are customizable. Tracks sleep and multiple types of exercise. No built in GPS but I don’t mind carrying my phone. Overall, it’s a hit with me!
 Loving my Fitbit Versa!<br/>* First of all, I received my watch on the day of release, which I kind of expected from Amazon, although delivery was estimated for Wednesday! ☺<br/>** I ordered the rose gold so I can pair it up with a rose gold band. The color of the rose gold band I purchased was a little off but it was livable.  The vendor actually sent me an improved color match so I'll see how that works out. I like my smartwatch to look like a regular watch so this was one of my criterias in choosing the Versa.<br/>*** I installed apps and figured out other capabilities one by one during the week and they were all awesome! Versa had more precise stats than my moto 360.<br/>**** It took me awhile to download music but found articles in the FitBit community conveniently.<br/>***** I love all the features that moto 360 didn't have especially the sleep monitor.  Now I can honestly say that I don't sleep enough so will need to improved that!<br/>****** Yup, that's my sixth star!  The Fitbit Versa is much smaller than my moto 360 so it looked much better on my small 6.3 inch wrist! Hubby said that and I agree!<br/>Hence, thank you Fitbit and I love my Versa! ☺
 Bought this for my father. Tested for several days with Google Pixel and got very positive impression. It does not feel bulky, sits well on the wrist, syncs with the phone, battery survived for 4 days as promised.<br/>My father though has OnePlus One and he does have sync issues from time to time. It's not a big deal but a bit annoying. Would require manual sync or watch restart from time to time.<br/>Ended up buying for myself as well.<br/><br/>Update 2: It took a couple of emails (including sending a photo) to get a replacement. Nice, efficient and polite support. It took me some time to figure out that I need to "forget" old device and reboot the phone before trying to register new device. But as soon as I've done that - no issues. Back to 4 stars<br/><br/>Update 1: Was very excited until summer. Suddenly it appeared they do not need too much to fall apart (at least for me). California summer is good enough. The screen fell off the body while being on my hand just out of the blue. I guess the glue is not very reliable. Trying to contact support, will see how it goes.
 I wanted to like this "smartwatch" as I purchased it as an upgrade from a Gear 2 Neo.  I thought "It's been 4 years, surely with all of the advancements in technology, this HAS to be better.  More functional."  I was wrong.  First of all the pictures of the watch are a little skewed with respect to the size of the watch.  The face is smaller than I would've expected.  Were that the only complaint I could get past it.  I tried to actually use this watch in place of the Gear 2 Neo for 1 solid week.  One of the sole reasons for this purchase was that it was supposed to act as a stand alone collector for a CGM.  After asking all kinds of people where they got their CGM displaying watch faces and downloading it, I realized that you can do very little else unless you are connected to the internet (through your phone of course).  You have to download the Fitbit app.  And this app will do pretty much nothing unless you're online.  And it will tell you- YOU NEED TO BE ONLINE TO SYNCH.<br/>This watch claims to run through your bluetooth and link to your phone- allowing you to receive calls and texts to your $200 watch.  Congratulations, amazon recommended a $12 smartwatch that does the same thing.  And while it can answer phone calls (if it notifies you of an incoming call altogether) and read text messages, for some reason the people at Fitbit did not think pushing notifications from the phones alarm clock was an important feature.  Do you have multiple alarms on your phone, with different tones/volumes and or titles? Well good for you.  Fitbit has its own "alarm app".  Which is just "set time to go off".  No customizations. No reminder frequency, no title for that alarm and no notification that the phone (in your pocket) is also ringing off the hook and vibrating, but you can't hear it or feel it because you work with heavy machinery.<br/>The versa also seems to have a problem with bluetooth connectivity.  Surely for a technology released to the general public in 1998 should be at the very least be able to stay connected, as well as, if not better than the Gear 2 Neo.  This is where the versa also fails miserably.  There are all kinds of "fixes" from any number of message boards that have apparently  been established as some kind of "beta testing control group".  This is what they all seem to read like.  Because I really have the time to go find a wireless network, or connect to the internet, and do a FACTORY RESET on the watch to get it to connect to the phone again.  And let me be clear- this does not disconnect the watch from the phone- it SHUTS YOUR PHONE'S BLUETOOTH connection off.  So anyone else trying to get this for a CGM- it will also sever your connection to the CGM.  No notice, no readings, nothing.  Even the gear 2 neo tells you when the bluetooth has been disconnected, and then reconnects in about 10 seconds, by itself.<br/>So for me, it's back to the Gear 2 Neo.  From 2014.  Waiting for someone to update a watch that does what its supposed to do, or even one that does what the creators tell you it does.  Buyer beware.  Don't just look at the reviews, look at the "fixes" listed along with the problems.  Maybe you could post some things to the "Fitbit Suggestions" page as you test their $200 "final product" for them.
 I've been wanting a smartwatch/fitness tracker for a while now but I've never quite found one I thought was worth buying. Either I didn't like the looks or thought it was too expensive and this device solved both of those issues for me. Battery life is a little over 4 days with 24/7 use and the steps tracker seems accurate except for registering a few steps while driving or while moving around while on my office chair but nothing substantial. The sleep tracking kinda blew my mind when I first used it as this was one thing I had my doubts about but so far seems to nail when I've fallen asleep or woken up. App selection isn't huge but does offer enough for me and there's plenty of watch faces to change things up. I was concerned about the difficultly in swapping out bands based on reviews but I've had no issues swapping them out. My only issues I've had so far is using it to control music and being able to read texts from my Android phone. I've followed the directions and read a few forums and looks like I'm not the only one with these issues. Overall I think this is a great smartwatch that has good battery life, doesn't cost too much and looks good. Definitely a good buy
 I upgraded from a Blaze to the versa, and so far am not disappointed. I like how small it is, and the battery seems to easily last 4 days or more. Compared to the Apple Watch, this is a huge advantage. I would like to see the watch faces be more customizable like the Apple Watches are, but there are still a ton of good community created watch faces available for download.<br/><br/>Two complaints in comparison to my Blaze: the watch band is very hard to remove and replace. The blaze was very easy. Also, the Versa is not as responsive to the wrist raise... often the screen does not illuminate when you raise the watch, compared to the Blaze. But otherwise, it is a great product! Hopefully the battery lasts more than a year this time.

I checked, thinking it was going to tell me how many more steps I should take before the end of the hour, and I was horrified to find that the display had scrunched itself up into the top half of the screen. WHAT is going on??? I wore it overnigut just to be able to say whether it was still tracking steps, sleep, etc -- yes it is -- but now the display is still scrunched disappears in about 4 seconds ... I do not like this. I am sure I purchased a protection plan, but it should still be under warranty for defects. I have two videos one 97 seconds, one 61 seconds, neither of which seems to load here. Somebody please tell me what to do.
 I love the look and features of this Fitbit, but they really need to fix syncing issues with it.  I had to return the first one because I couldn’t set it up (I tried for over a week).  Customer service wasn’t helpful at all.  Said they were working on a ‘graduated’ fix.  I sent it back and ordered another one.  That one set up fine, but it stopped syncing with my devices so I can’t see my steps on the dashboard.  My stats don’t show up on my friends Fitbit lists so I can’t compete with anyone on my friends list.  I’ve been trying to sync it for days and it just won’t, so I’m going to send it back if I can and not get another one.
 Does everything it says it will do. Not 100% accurate (my biggest gripe is it not counting 30 minutes on the stair climber as steps OR flights of stairs) but it does the most you can expect.<br/><br/>There are a few tricks that take some getting used to, such as how to make the stopwatch readily accessible if that’s one of the major things you want; but Google has all the answers.<br/><br/>Biggest pro: The battery life is RIDICULOUS. I wear it 24/7 and charge it when I shower and have not had a problem. I’ve even gone 2 days at a time and the lowest I’ve seen it is like 40%.<br/><br/>Second biggest pro: it looks pretty cool and is pretty much indistinguishable from an Apple Watch to the casual observer. My only gripe would be that the fit bit “peach” is really just pink — It’s not as neutral as Apple’s “sand”.<br/><br/>Biggest CON: Trying to replace the strap is a BITCH. I ordered 3 different sport straps off Amazon and spent about 30 mins on each one. It got to the point where I was concerned I had scratched the little pinhole so much that no band would ever stay in place. But I got the original band back on and so far so good. Have come to the conclusion that I need to just order the bands from Fitbit, but haven’t even tried that yet. And as far as I can tell, none of the other Fitbit bands have rose gold buckles. Not a huge deal, most people wouldn’t notice, but I would know. So Fitbit, if you’re listening, please make a white and a black sport band with rose gold buckle, k thnx.
 Really disappointed, returned within a week. Could not get it to sync with iTunes. I followed the directions to a tee and spoke to customer service more than once. There were other little things that bugged me but I could have gotten over them if the music feature would have worked, but without that, no thanks.
 I've been using Fitbit for a few years now and it was good. Well except those trackers with the bands that always peeled off. That was a fail. I eventually got a blaze which was good. I could swap bands. When it died, I trusted Fitbit would have a better replacement so I ordered the Versa. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews. I just trusted Fitbit.<br/><br/>So a month in and the watch's battery life seems to shorten more and more as the days go by. Sometimes it refuses to sync or just restarts for no reason. Went through some trouble shooting that asked me to turn off all the features I could and use a Fitbit clock face. Still the problem persisted.<br/><br/>When you pay so much money for these things you expect a good product that at least lives up to it's on claims. Even out of the box I've never seen more than three days of battery life and now I can barely get a day if about 16 hours.<br/><br/>If you do purchase, keep a eye on it and note how it works and how long you go between charges. If you see any weirdness before that 30 day mark just return it. Otherwise, you'll be struggling with Fitbit. Sometimes you get a good report and sometimes you don't.
 Very disappointed with this watch.  I purchased the Fitbit Versa back in July 2018.  I am on my third replacement so far.  I previously owned a Pebble watch which I loved, but thought I would upgrade to the color graphics of the Versa.  Mostly because Fitbit bought out the Pebble company, and I thought the merged technology of both of these companies will give me the perfect watch.  I was so wrong.  This watch has issues that have not been addressed by the company at all.<br/><br/>My watches problems have ranged from music not downloading to partial loading, the messages not coming thru the watch and plain old not holding a charge or not charging at all.  I am very disappointed in the amount of money I spent to get a decent watch and all I got was a pretty bracelet.<br/><br/>I will have to say that the customer service has been top notch, I have called explained the issue and after running through a rebooting test that didn't work, I received a new watch in the mail in a week,... but not fixing the problems and sending out refurbished watches to their customer is not the answer. Fitbit you better up your game significantly or I will be switching to Apple. Ugh!  I can't believe I said that.  Please Fit bit get it right!!
 I bought the Versa in October 2018, and the screen stopped coming on by the end of December 2018. Fitbit sent a replacement that arrived in early January 2019, and the screen stopped working again by the end of February 2019. I am not hard on my watches, and was intentionally gentle with the second one. Either I've had terrible luck and got two lemons in a row, or these smart watches have serious reliability issues.<br/><br/>I'm mostly pleased with Fitbit's customer service, as both times I contacted them they provided a replacement with little hassle. Unfortunately, the warranty period is only one year. $230 is an awfully large sum of money to pay for a watch that will only be usable for (most of) one year. I'll update if/when the screen stops working on the third watch.
 Quick setup! Super cute! Already customized my wrist band, bezel shell case, and added. Glass shield screen protector. I’ve had this watch on for 3 hours and the battery has gone down 8 percent from 89%. 20-30 minute setup. Step by step walkthrough. The only thing I didn’t like is that a charging block didn’t come with it. I love my new clock screen! There are plenty of free ones to choose from but I fell in love with mine! Only 99cents and there’s a 5 day trial on it. It’s super comfy and light. I’m so happy I could care less about that Apple Watch I had planned on getting for two times the amount of this one. I’m debating on whether or not I want to upgrade my pandora account to utilize the offline streaming on the watch.... I like how I can see my calls and texts on my watch for my iPhone. I don’t care about the response part. I know I was all over the place but all in all, I love the watch!
 Great fitness watch, battery life makes it typically 4-5 days with plenty of phone connected GPS use.<br/><br/>2 month update<br/>Still great overall, however couple times it refuses to sync with phone and need to restart watch.  Went for a run the other day and after a mile it kicked out of the run app.  I started the connected run option again and after about 0.05 miles the watch did a complete reboot.....not happy.  Another run and no issues at all, however last night I happen to awake when the Fitbit vibrated from a restart; not sure what that was about.<br/><br/>3 month update<br/>Watch resets on itself almost every day.  On my way into work at the watch restarted 3 times and froze on the Fitbit symbol.  I went for a hike and turned on the hiking app and AllTrails app on my phone (iPhone X on AT&amp;T).  by the end of the less than 3 mile hike, the Fitbit compared to phone were separated by 0.2 miles.  I have given up on this watch and gone back to Garmin.  I wanted to like this watch but it just didn't work.
 The watch itself looks great.  It is the right size and light weight, comfortable to wear for whole day.  It charges pretty quick.  I usually charge 10 minutes or so in morning and it is 90%+ charged. I was pretty excited when I got the watch in first few days until I started using it to track my run and mountain biking in trail.<br/><br/>First annoying part is that it needs internet to sync.  It takes a few minutes sometimes.  I don't mind it requires internet to sync but Fitbit should implement it better.  It should be sync'ed to the phone first then whenever internet connection is available then push the data to the cloud. I did turn off All-Day Sync and keep Always Connected and Keep-Alive Widget on.  All-Day Sync drains my phone (new Samsung S8) too fast to be useful.<br/><br/>I use the watch + phone to run or bike. It takes a while to connect to phone GPS.  Sometimes it does not connect and stay in "connecting" forever.  Even it is connected, it loses the connection to the phone then it records the mileage incorrectly.<br/><br/>It is not that smart or do what it supposes to do.  If Fitbit addresses the software issue then it would be almost perfect.  However it is unlike, the connecting or sync issue has been around for a while.
 Best Fitbit watch I’ve ever had. It’s so much better than the blaze (which was the last watch I had). I love that it is waterproof up until 50 meters. Can’t wait to wear it while swimming. I love the brighter screen and the wrist band is so much more comfortable than the one that came on the Fitbit. No need to change immediately unless you’re looking for metal or leather wrist band.<br/><br/>I have found no cons yet since I received it on Tuesday April 17th.<br/><br/>I love that there are apps on this watch and more to come.
 Does everything as promised.<br/>Easy to set up and user friendly.<br/>Very comfortable to wear, I bought this model as I swim a lot and it’s water resistant. I would buy this again.
 So far I love it! Still learning how to use it but its really cute I love that I can change up the face whenever and change the bands too! something more feminine when I'm out or at work and then something for exercising. That's the thing that always bothered me before with fitbit is how ugly they were but this one is cute! I am a loyal fitbit user I like their app and I love competing with my family who also use fitbit. Hopefully it holds up well I'm on day one! :)
 Ok, not an exercise buff, but like that it's a watch, and I can see my daily steps, heartrate, can monitor my sleep patterns and set alarms on it too.  Did I mention it alerts me to phone calls and messages too?!  I have fun changing up my clock face display now and then. Quite a few options for that! I bought a clear cover for it because my husband says that I am the " master of disaster "! Ok, he's right about that! Love how well it protects this pricey purchase. Fun and fairly easy to use. Love this Fitbit and very happy with it. ( although it says it's waterproof, I NEVER immerse mine in water. Splash, yes, but NOT immerse. ) That's just me, don't really need to take the risk.
 So far I love it. I got it when it came out 5 days ago. The battery was at 90%. Its Friday and its at 39%. I love the fact that it looks more like a watch then a tracker.
 BUYER BEWARE! The woven bands are not for everyday use. Even light exercise or activity will ruin this band and FITBIT will not replace it after 45 days. The customer support is worthless. I paid extra for the special edition lavender and rose gold. The band is fraying after only a months worth of wearing. I do not swim or shower in it. I charge it at night. I do not do intense workouts and I work at a desk. FITBIT refuses to take any responsibility for the quality of the band and had basically told me I am lying about my activity level. They refer me to the FITBIT store but I cannot buy another woven band because they do not sell them. I have had my case escalated twice with the same BS response. There is nothing I can do at this point but warn others. I LOVE the versa as a fitness tracker. I would give that part 5 stars but the band is not worth the extra money.
 I have bought lots of things throught amazon.com and every purched I have done I have had good experiences so far. But unfortunatly with this one I cant say the same. First, the watch screen broke down with only one day of use, normal use, without any fall o anything out of the ordinary use. Assuming It was some factory problem, I contacted Fitbit but they gave me no answer, they said it was no factory issue and in adition to this, they told me they had no repairing center. So I ended up with a broken watch with no answer from the company.<br/><br/>I think, first of all, the screen its extreamily fragil, al least mine. It broke down just with normal use, it must have been my nail or something I dont know, because I never hit it with anything. But I think that even worst than that is the company service, giving no answer to my problem, that really speaks bad about fitbit.
 I purchased this to replace my Blaze.  I didn't have any huge issues with the Blaze, it is/was a fine product, I just like to have "the newest and the best."  Unfortunately, the Versa isn't it.  I typically have no real issue with setting up technology, I'm adept at getting things hooked to WiFi and I'm plenty friendly with computers.  In that context, the Versa is nothing but solid frustration.  It took three or four tries to get it connected to my phone.  Also, even though it recognized my WiFi, it would not hook to it.  Finally, even though it was linked to my account, it would not sync my data.  After much web searching, I found a few solutions (along with several other people with similar problems)...but most of them were multi-step workarounds meant to trick the device into uploading the data.  And, seriously, why should I have to turn my phone's Bluetooth on and off every time I want to sync my watch?  Do I really need to delete my Blaze off the account?  Maybe I might want to wear both watches.<br/><br/>I ended up going back to the Blaze...but now I'm having serious thoughts about the Versa and all Fitbit products.  For all this frustration, it makes me think Apple Watch might be the way to go.
 The Versa works VERY well at tracking my heart rate and steps, plus can also correctly monitor bike rides, swims and weight-lifting sessions.<br/><br/>I'd always expected to get an Apple watch someday, but when it was suggested we get a pulse-monitoring watch by our Keto diet coach, it quickly became obvious that this Fitbit Versa does a better job at the essential tasks than the Apple alternative (even though we use Apple products for all our computing needs.)<br/><br/>The better strap and ability to pay bills handsfree in places Apple Pay doesn't work is well worth the added cost of this edition of the Fitbit Versa. I also like its relative thinness compared to many other watches, and the ease of reading its large display. I hadn't expected to care about its ability to display incoming text messages, identify incoming phone calls, and display upcoming calendar events, but am finding all three features useful daily. The alarm feature is also extremely flexible and useful. The watch faces are very configurable, and fortunately include one that displays hour, minute and second in large clear numerals, along with day, month, year, current heart rate, percentage of charge, and how many steps I've taken so far today.<br/><br/>The only feature I haven't bothered with yet is the ability to load 300 MP3 songs and play them back via a Bluetooth headset, mainly because my iPhone can already do that for my entire music library.
 So far so good.  I'm a little disappointed that fitbit hasn't upgraded some programming since my first purchase of a fitbit product 4 years ago.  Specifically, there is still not enough choice of activities (e.g. no dancing/aerobics/zumba) nor, apparently, is there any way to import data from other major fitness apps (i.e. samsung gear fit, google fit, huawei fit). Nonetheless, I like the Versa and am super happy I can leave it on in the pool. I would buy it again as long as it lasts longer than the last two fitbit products I had.
 I’ve had this for a few days and I like it more than my Apple Watch as far as what I use it for. The Fitbit interface with the challenges and workout tracking is so much better than Apple health, and so I was wearing a Fitbit and an Apple Watch. I love that it integrates the best of the two - style, notifications and information, easy access to control music, etc like the Apple Watch, and gives me the functionality of a Fitbit. The only downside of the Versa is that the bands are not as easy to change as the Apple Watch. It’s not a huge deal, and it’s still pretty easy, but being able to slide the bands on and off with the Apple Watch was a plus. With the Versa, there are pins with little “easy release” levers on them. Still, it sure beats wearing two devices!
 My first smart watch/activity tracker.  It's a very solid device with a few minor-ish annoyances... such as the quick-view capability not being that reliable and the device, even in "manual screen on" mode still turns on occasionally by itself.  I have gotten into creating my own custom watch faces and if you know anything about programming, it's super easy and fun.  I really dislike the charger though.  You can't put a case on the device and charge it at the same time... boo.  The charger is awkward  and doesn't really allow the watch to sit flat and steady while charging.  It charges very quickly however and holds the charge for at least a few days.  The new quick replies are sweet and hope fitbit expands that functionality in the coming months.  This is a solid 4 star device... for $200 that's a solid deal.
 Ok, I tried and tried since April to like this tracker. I LOVED my Fitbit Charge 2, but it was getting old and I didn't like having to take it off to shower, so I looked for one that was waterproof/swim proof... The battery lasts me about 3 days which is nice. It's not too large for my small wrist.<br/><br/>The AWFUL part about it is that no matter what it thinks I am walking or climbing stairs. I was in the car and it said I walked over 1000 steps just sitting in the car. I wasn't even driving! So my pulse rate was steady at resting (it showed that too). It said I got 9972 steps, and 13 floors while riding on the train (ok I kinda get that since it's a bit bouncy). I set the sensitivity to Dominant hand even when it was on my non-dominant hand and that didn't help either.<br/><br/>It's been 6 months... I HATE IT!!! I want to throw it away so much! I feel lied to and cheated out of $200! This is just SO BAD!!! Shame that they put out such a horrible product.  If you go on their community website there are TONS of people having this problem!
 I'll start out by reiterating, Fitbit has excellent customer service and I will most likely buy smart watches and fitness trackers from them in the future, but I currently cannot recommend the Versa.<br/> I wore a single Fitbit Surge nearly four years and in less than two months I'm already on my third Versa.  The first one lasted about two weeks. It never held a charge the way it was supposed to and it erroneously would say I climbed 50-100 flights of stairs per day.  These idiosyncrasies I could live with but after a couple weeks the bottom half of the touch screen went out completely and the top half was only about half brightness. The touch interface still worked but it was not terribly useful when I couldn't see what I was touching on the bottom half of the screen.  I called Fitbit customer service and after about 20 minutes they agreed to send me a free replacement.  The replacement arrived promptly within a week and after setting up it became clear that while the screen worked for now on this one, the touch interface was not calibrated correctly.  The watch would randomly cycle through screens and select apps or options within apps that had not been touched or even when nothing was being touched.  All this well not acknowledging actual touches on apps and options within apps.  I reset the watch a couple times and tried to give it a day or two to calm down with no luck.  Again fitbit's customer service was excellent. Realizing I already had problems and I had now been given a second dud I was on the phone less than 5 minutes before I was being sent a second free replacement. This time with Rush delivery it took only a couple days to arrive.  Now on my third Fitbit versa with several weeks of wear it has outlasted both of the previous watches and all of its features and functions are currently meeting my expectations.  Should this watch function this well for a year or more I will probably increase my review to 4 stars, but with the above stated issues of quality control that I have experienced I'm not sure I'll ever be able to give this watch 5 stars.
 2019-03-10: One month in, and I'm still in love with it! Maybe even more than in the beginning. I have had no bad experiences, no hardware or software issues. It syncs to my phone/the app perfectly. GPS works great for tracking walks and runs. The heart rate monitor seems sensitive and accurate (although I don't have anything else to compare it to). Step-tracking seems to work perfectly. The stair/elevation tracking is a little misleading because it only tracks if you increase elevation at least 10 feet in one "go", but that's probably about as good as the technology in a teeny wrist watch will get. I'm OK with it.<br/><br/>I typically put the device on the charger while I'm in the shower, but it's gone 3 days or so without charging and only got down to 30-some percent, which seems like great battery life to me... (It is waterproof and I've worn it while doing dishes and cleaning my fish tanks with no issues.)<br/><br/>I love love love the notifications - this allows me to always keep my phone on silent, which I prefer to accidentally having my phone go off at the wrong moment. The discreet vibration and abbreviated message on the Fitbit screen is all I need to see to know who's messaging/calling/emailing me and I can decide whether or not I need to even look at my phone. This is a total game changer. Yeah, it's another device to look at, but I definitely pick up my phone LESS now than before, because I already know what the notification is. It's perfect. Amazing.<br/><br/>As far as the actual point of the Fitbit: YES I am more active - I want to close those circles on the steps and active minutes. I've been walking the dog and going to the gym more than ever. I drink more water. I go to bed earlier. I want those stars! At the same time, I'm also careful not to let it take over my life and sometimes a day of relaxation is a good thing - Last Sunday I didn't even make 3,000 steps and I was OK with that. I drank wine and read a whole book! Everything in moderation. :-)<br/><br/>Generally: fitness trackers seem like a good thing! Use it to help inspire you to reach your goals. Get your friend one, too, for a little camaraderie and competition!<br/><br/>2019-02-09: I have wanted a fitness tracker for a while, not because I'm a gym rat (although I do go to the gym at least once a week) nor do I want to lose weight, but my profession is sedentary and I wanted the reminder to stay active. Something wearable was perfect for me because I have been wearing a watch daily for years, but I never owned (or wanted) a smart watch.<br/><br/>The Versa seems like the perfect balance between high-tech and low-tech for me. It's attractive, discreet (I have several fashionable analog wristwatches that are much larger), and SHOCKINGLY lightweight. Since my job is corporate/professional, I opted for an alternative metallic band, which I think adds to the beauty.<br/><br/>The watch's functionality is perfect for me. I love that it doesn't try to do too much, and that all of the fitness stuff is easily accessible. Being mindful of being active and healthy is huge when you're busy - it can really get away from you to just drink water and stand up from your desk.  I also really like the deep-breathing "game". I'm excited to use the coaching activities. I wore the watch to my hour long HIIT class at the gym and was satisfied to see the heart rate stats reflect the intensity of the work out. Go me!<br/><br/>The smartphone app is engaging and the animations are cute and captivating to keep you interested in meeting your goals. I love the water-logging feature and I really appreciate the woman's health tracker. The sleep stats are FASCINATING. My husband got a Versa at the same time and we are really enjoying comparing our sleeps!<br/><br/>I would warn people looking for a smart watch to keep looking. The features and user interface are extremely basic. It's a fancy activity tracker in the body of a smart watch. Don't be fooled or get your hopes up.<br/><br/>I've only been using the watch for a few days, but I'm excited to see my fitness and health trends take shape. I'd very easily recommend it to anyone looking for the same application. I'll come back and update this review in the future once I've had a chance to plunge the depths of what else it can help me achieve. :-)
 Update 1/27/19<br/>It won't hold a charge longer than a day now. I have restarted it and it still happens. I guess it's life has come to an end. It's been a little less than a year and I got a lot of use and loved it but sure wish it lasted longer.<br/><br/>Update- 11/12/18<br/>I was hasty in my negative update. I had the thought it might just be the clock face I had on my fitbit right then and it was. I changed it to the regular fitbit face..it worked.  Then I changed it back to the one I want....and it worked! Back to 5 stars.<br/><br/>Update- 11/11/18<br/>This has been the best health tracker I've used. BUT Just today my screen stopped showing my steps,  calories, and heart rate. It still shows the time. So strange to me. I'm hoping it can do a update/refresh or something and fix its self.  I lowered it to 2 stars (instead of 1) because itis still at least syncing with my phone so I'm able to keep track through that for now.<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/>I just got it a few days ago and it is everything I wanted. I love the size and quality of the screen. I had the alta HR before and decided to go for a change. So fun! I love that I can get it fully wet with no worry. I'm enjoying having a timer on my wrist and setting alarms from my watch instead of my phone now. The fitbit coaching is cool! I love seeing all the stats from the phone app on my wrist. The leaderboard is neat. I haven't put music on it yet. Anyway, awesome smartwatch!
 I'd had a WearOS Smartwatch for several years (ASUS Zenwatch 2) which did all the smartwatch things, but wasn't terrific for activity tracking. I got my wife a Fitbit alta HR for Christmas. She wore it one day and decided she didn't like it. After it sat there a couple of weeks unused, I asked if I could try it. So for a week or two I wore my smartwatch on one wrist and the alta on the other (what a geek). The alta could provide some notifications, but the smaller display prevented it from replacing my smartwatch. Then I saw the Versa and decided to give it a try. It's far superior to my Zenwatch2 as far as activity tracking, provides all the notifications from my Android phone, really fits all my needs. I rarely tried to send messages from my watch or anything like that, so the Versa does everything I need. The only thing I miss is not having a Duo Mobile app on it. My employer uses Duo for two factor authentication. The WearOS watches can approve these by tapping on the notification on the watch. The Versa can't do that, meaning I have to dig my phone out of my pocket and approve the request there.  That's about the only time I miss my old watch.<br/><br/>I'm consistently getting 4+ days on a charge, and suspect I could stretch  it to 5 some times, but haven't tried it.  The step counter seems to be more accurate than my smartwatch was, and my smartwatch didn't provide any of the other activity data. The reminders to "Move Around" 10 minutes before every hour are what my wife didn't like on the alta. I guess I've been married long enough I can just ignore those nags ;-). I know I can control them, but the concept is good. It's just that having a job sitting in front of a computer 9 hours a day isn't conducive to lots of movement. If I'm up already, I have wandered around more to get the recommended steps in, so it has modified my behavior a little.
 Great looking at a perfect size. Easy to set up right out of the box. Great tracker features Plus sinks with fitbit's app. Live exercise stats on your wrist and great detail page at the end of the workout. Smartwatch features are adequate with more to come. No trouble getting 4 days Plus on the battery.
 I don't wear watches, I don't like the way they fit on my wrist. But I bought this hoping that it would help me be more active and get me motivated to be healthier. So far so good. I have had this for a little over a month and I have to say that it is helping a lot. When I first got it I was having a lot of trouble with my left knee. It was getting to the point that I thought I was going to have to go to the doctor about it. But after a week of being more active because of the watch my knee pain is completely gone. I am in no way saying that this is a medical solution if you are having knee pains but, being more active has helped a lot. It monitors sleep and you can log in other things like water intake and what you eat. It has an alarm and other functions that you will learn as you go along, that's how I've done it. I have not tested it under water, it has gotten wet a few times but still works fine. I don't wear it all the time. I take it off when I shower and sometimes when I go to bed I leave it on the charger. The battery life lasts about 5 to 6 days for me, and that's great. The only few problems I can honestly say I have is that I have big hands and wrists so sometimes when I'm exercising my hand will push the button on the side and pause my workout or finish it and I have to start it over. The band also seems to irritate my skin on one side. I'm most likely going to have to buy a different band but for now I will keep aloe vera on it. I do recommend this product. If you have questions that I can answer please just ask.
 I had the Fitbit Charge 2 for 2.5 years, and really didn't have many complaints until the end, when wear and tear made it malfunction occassionally. I was excited to upgrade. However, I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed by the Fitbit Versa.<br/><br/> I bought this watch for the fitness aspects alone - all the other stuff (notifications, apps, etc) were just a bonus, and they were fine. The fitness tracker was where this watch severely lacked. I (sort of obsessively) like to know my heart rate while I'm exercising, to know if I need to work harder or chill out. This heart rate tracker was abysmal. After a run it would say my heart rate was 98. Impossible. I'm fit but not THAT fit. It also would track my heart rate as ***57*** while doing abs and planks. Again, I am not that fit. My resting HR is listed as 59. So this watch is telling me that in a grueling session where I'm drenched in sweat, my heart rate is LOWER than my resting? Again, impossible.<br/><br/>If you're a casual exerciser and want a Fitbit SmartWatch, I guess this could be a good option for you... But in that case why not just go with a real SmartWatch, like the Apple Watch or Gear Sport? And if you're a big fitness enthusiast, I'd say get the Charge or switch to a Garmin.
 I think in life you are either a fit bit person or an Apple watch person.<br/>This review is for the fit bit lovers out there.<br/>Preface note: I am allergic to Nickel and other metals, and I have NO allergic reactions to this watch.<br/><br/>I have owned a few other fit bits in the past... I lost both sure to the poor clasp design, so it took me a while to get up the courage to invest in a 3rd fit bit, but I'm glad I waited and chose this one. I am an active person, more of a gym rat than a runner, so I can't speak to the running functions of this watch, but as a full-time college student, also working 2 jobs, this lets me keep an eye on how much I've been working and active I've been, when I need to refuel my body, how I'm sleeping (my favorite function). It also lets me know when I get a text or call, which is super helpful at work or in a class where being on your phone is frowned upon, and I keep my phone on silent all the time.<br/><br/>I also love this color because I can put a metal or leather band on it, and it makes it looks less like a fitness watch and more like a general smartwatch. The metal is slightly more pink tones than I would have preferred, but the different bands really tone that down for my personal preference. It's more of a pink metal than a coppery gold that can also fall into the "rose gold" category.
 The watch was a gift for my wife.  The new Versa arrived and required an update before it can operate.  I tried updating via WiFi (the preferred method) but it failed.  The manual said to try using Bluetooth but that failed.  I called the help desk and they had me do a factory reset on my watch, reboot my phone with no other blue tooth devices, and reboot my router.  Nothing worked.  Help desk said they would get back to me in 48 hours with a solution but never did.  I have returned it and waiting for a refund from the 3rd party seller.  I will be purchasing a different brand.
 The crystal on my Fitbit Versa underwent what appears to be a stress fracture as shown in the photo within a couple of months after I purchased it. I contacted Fitbit and after sending a picture of the damage was promptly told that it would not be covered by the warranty. What's more, according to a plethora of complaints online about similar experiences with Fitbit, they do not have spare parts or a repair service. This is ridiculous for a $200 product. I will never purchase from them again.
 I purchased because like so many things in life I need to improve my health. I love fit and finish quality is there. I've only had it for a day and I like it so far. I just whish they could design it for biomedical uses. The watch has a heart rate moniter but why not O2 and ekg capability also could be designed to accept input from a sensor gets blood glucose. I am a type 2 diabetic so I am using the software to help improve my bg. I just whish fitbit would explore biomedical applications for the watch it would be a hit for health care providers to use to obtain data to help treat a number of chronic condions.<br/>I love its customisian of watch face applications. As far as payments goes I generally use my android phone nfc would be better served to use as a method data storgae like medications health conditions etc.<br/>This watch band is tricky to remove but I already figured a trick the bank has be installed at 45 degree angle then it is easy.<br/>Good watch lots of potential. My only bone pick is nickle dime for watch faces and applications they are not free nor is there many for now. I'm enjoying I hope they add on many more devices that can expand biomedical applications thru blue tooth example glucomter temp sensors ekg etc O2 sensors
 I love the way this Fitbit works.  I previously use a Charge 2 and decided to get the new Versa.  When you on this new own when you get more than 3 hours sleep it tells you they type of sleep you had (light, REM, deep) based on heart rate which was an upgrade from the wake, restless and deep sleep from before.  You can set a workout reminder for steps per hour and it will buzz a reminder about 10 minutes (time frame I have set) to get my minimum steps in before the end of the hour.  I really like that I can easily change the picture on my watch face through the fitbit app.<br/><br/>I would give it 5 stars but it seems to be more sensitive to movement than the old fitbit.  I spent most of my time in a car on a recent road trip and it registered 31 floors climbed and I didn't have 1 flight of stairs.  I continue to use the fitbit on my non-dominate wrist.
 Love this fitbit! I have an Alta HR and I used it for a long period of time before ultimately forgetting I had it and not really caring to use it again. It was a great little watch, but I really wanted something with more capabilities that made me rely on my phone app less. Having the Versa is great with all of it's features and apps. I was really sold on the ability to add my own music and use my bluetooth headphones when I work out instead of bringing my phone with me. There's a bunch of different clock faces and the display is a perfect size. Love having my Starbucks app, weather app, and Pandora. I'm still learning all that this fitbit model can do. But I love it so far!<br/><br/>I was worried it would look huge and clunky on my wrist but it's actually a perfect size.  The set up was really straight forward. It took about half an hour, but that didn't bother me. I like the charging port for this fitbit too! I bought screen protectors with mine because I am worried the screen would get scratched over time like what happened with my Alta.
 I made the switch from an Apple Watch series 1 to the Fitbit Versa. I liked it at first, but it lacks features to really compete in the smart watch realm if you’re an iPhone user. The features are limited, rendering as little more than a slightly more advanced fitness tracker.<br/><br/>The battery life was stellar at first, but after about 6 months the battery wasn’t holding a charge quite as well.<br/><br/>Now, just last eight months of ownership, the device shut off yesterday despite having a full charge, then when I reset and recharged it, the screen was busted. It’s under warranty so I’m going through that process now, but it’s very frustrating for it to have only lasted eight months. I guess I’m lucky it died within the warranty period at least!<br/><br/>If you’re debating between this and the Apple Watch, pay a little more and go with Apple. It’s worth it.
 Great quality,  the charger is also great .<br/>Very sensitive and has a lot of beautiful background . I would highly recommend to whoever is trying to lose weight, keep remind me how many steps are left and also notice you every day that you have to drink water more and more .<br/>Price sounds a little higher than usual but it worth it.
 ZERO STARS. I accidentally wore my fitbit to bed and woke up with 2nd degree burns.  This product is DANGEROUS.  Fitbit customer service try to tell you it's a rash, but it's a burn. BE AWARE.  Do not buy this product.  When I called they said they'd never heard of someone getting burned.  Yet, when I Google the problem,  it's common.
 Bought this after waiting for several fitbit watches to come out and kinks to be worked out. Thought I had waited long enough. Don't buy this watch, don't gift it and don't buy any other Fitbit product. Their app is garbage and syncing issues never cease. Forums are online about Fitbit versa syncing issues from 2016 and I'm still having the same issues in 2019. They don't care about the customer support they only care about getting your money and dumping an inferior watch. I've had the watch for 6 months and my wife got one as well. Immediately out of the box my wife had issues syncing to her phone. After a few hours it was resolved only to have the same issue pop up between us countless times in the past few months. Now my watch won't connect to my phone, won't connect to the app, no longer reads heart rate and the time is off by ten minutes because it won't sync. I have tried every troubleshooting fix on their website. DO NOT BUY this is a TERRIBLE company.
 My first Fitbit was a Charge HR and this Versa is my third. The ever expanding capabilities are lovely, though I don't need them all. I do like the reminders quite a lot. As a writer, I can forget to get up an move when I work and that little vibration on my wrist is probably very good for me. That said, I did experience the same thing many others have reported. My Versa simply couldn't sync after the first couple of days without a great deal of bother. Unlinking, restarting of bluetooth, restarting the watch...all of it. Very frustrating. I've just got a new phone, and there was some additional bother getting that set up, but we'll see if the sync stays put on this one.<br/><br/>One major flaw was that I put it on all day sync. On my old phone (S7) it took it down about 24% a day, but didn't adversely impact the Versa. On this new phone, it drained 100% of the entire charge of the Versa in 16 hours. I turned it off and recharged my Versa, and so far, it looks okay. BUT, I will monitor it rather more closely. I'll have to be sure to use the app daily now in order to ensure it syncs and I don't lose my active hours history (which doesn't seem to carry over from one day to the next).
 I have had a Fitbit for a long time, but after ALL the time I spent trying to make the Charge work with anything except my iPad I just gave in &amp; took what I could get.<br/>Now I think the Versa will solve all those problems &amp; add value &amp; I have LESS than I had with the Charge.<br/>It does not hook up with the Windows 10 computer any better than the Charge did &amp; I know I was NOT alone in that hassle because of the 100's of posts to the "Community".<br/>We are supposed to solve each other's problems because Fitbit is no help at all.<br/>Great weather app as long as you are near your phone.....AND you are on the SAME wifi network you were on the day you set up the Versa.<br/>I don't know about you, but I move from network to network all day long.<br/>AND FORGET the music app.....which can only be download your music from a Windows computer that may be on another network.....and FORGET everything if you were one of the "community" that wrote in constantly to say that your previous Fitbit couldn't even be found by your windows machine.<br/>VERSA offers LESS than previous Fitbits because unless you have DAYS to try to figure out all the problems you just have a watch that counts your steps.<br/>I stayed loyal while one person after another in the "community" said they were dumping Fitbit &amp; going to Garmin or another, but after the last 24 HOURS OF HASSLE WITH NO RESULTS....I'm returning the VERSA &amp; going to another brand where I can get some service &amp; some results.
 Bought this on another site to track gettjng back in shape.  Steps are terrinbly inaccurate.  I get up and walk around the house getting ready for my walk and jt puts up over 1000 steps!!!  Ridiculous.  Also sync is terrible.  I jave jt linked to my fitness pal and it is constantly going off line.  When I try to resync it.  No amount of fiddling with it gets it to go back.  Poor quality, bad software, non responsive.  Beginning to hate it.
 This little device does a lot.<br/>While it is sort of a smart watch, it sort of isn't, too. But what it does, it does well.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>- Excellent selection of watch faces, including cute, clever, big, pretty, etc. You can change your face every day to match your clothes if you want.<br/>- If I understand correctly, you can use it with other services, like Spark People.<br/>- measures pulse, steps, miles. Tracks exercise on demand.<br/>- motivates in numerous ways. Reminders to stand up, encouragement to finish your goal steps for the hour, challenges, even "travel" challenges that are longer term.<br/>- large userbase. You can network with more of your friends on Fitbit than on any other fitness watch.<br/>- big face without losing attractiveness<br/>- large variety of replacement bands available from third parties, some very pretty.<br/>- Can be used with many other fitness applications.<br/>- Detects sleep surprisingly accurately<br/>- Lots of settings options<br/>- A decent number of apps available<br/>- Handles the shower well<br/>- If you never have to take it off except to charge, it's harder to lose it.<br/>- Charges very quickly<br/>- The charger is an awesome design and easy to use<br/>- You can always have your alarms with you so you never miss them.<br/><br/>The irritating<br/>- All changes have to be made through the app.<br/>- If you don't sync often enough, it loses your data<br/>- Sync can take a long time.<br/>- The battery life is considerably shorter than I expected. It's about 2 1/2 days if I have constant sync turned off.<br/>- Don't even bother with constant sync unless you're willing to take it off to charge a lot.<br/>- All the music apps are paid<br/><br/>All in all, though, the pros are big and the cons are small. Enough that it still warrants a 5 star review.
 I got my wife a charge 3 and she loved it so much I thought I would give this Versa a shot. 2 weeks in and it has not tracked sleep correctly once. Hue integration is spotty and the app is broken. For me there is no way to navigate the app without exiting HUE every single time using the left button once you select a light to adjust. You're supposed to be able to swipe right to go back, not me, left button and speding inordinate amounts of time reconnecting it is... Also, connecting to HUE is INSANELY SLOW... So that was instantly non functional, which HUE being one more reason i was swayed is because it was a built in advertised app.<br/><br/>HUE APP. BROKEN.<br/><br/>It tells me I climbed dozens of sets of stairs when I maybe climbed 2 steps the whole day. My work is a flat warehouse with zero elevation changes... so yeah.<br/><br/>It counts thousands of steps on my commute to and from work and hundreds at night. I have a buddy that got rid of his fitbit because he drives a semi truck and after 30 minutes of driving it logged 15,000 steps.<br/><br/>I got a cold and it said in one day i spent more than 9 hours in fat burn zone. So this thing just takes your heartrate and calculates whatever information it does, zero motion be damned... Why have a 3-axis gyro if it won't use movement with heart rate to calculate anything but false steps and false flights of stairs?<br/><br/>Step and stair counter. BROKEN<br/><br/>Sleep tracking worked 3 times in two weeks. It kept breaking my sleep into 1 hour increments no matter how the band was situated. I wore it loose at first and told me it wasn't detecting my heart rate. So I wore it tight enough that it was uncomfortable to make sure it did not slide around one bit... Yeah, it said I got 3 hours of sleep between 3 different 1 hour increments. It was the better nights rest i had in the last two week.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking. BROKEN.<br/><br/>The only thing that works on this thing is the heart rate sensor. But its barely accurate. Using 2 other methods to measure heart rate at the same timen the versa was measuring higher. I was using my doctors nurses pulse ox devices on both hands.<br/><br/>Heart rate sensor. Consistently inconsistent being slightly inaccurate on the high side.<br/><br/>This review is from 2 weeks of everyday use. I called fitbit, they said it was "abnormal behavior for a new one". What did she mean by "for a new one"? If you read forums and these reviews you will learn that errant and completely inaccurate calculations are absolutely normal for this device. I highly recommend that if you are considering spending this kind of money on a watch, save up a little longer and get a real watch, or a decent android watch.
 Fitbit Versa *** MISERABLY FAILED as a pedometer which is BASIC FUNCTION *** of any fitness device on this earth. It counts mystery steps way more than you walk and it spoils the basic purpose of a fitness tracker.<br/>It’s been quite sometime and many people complained about it and Fitbit was unable to fix the issue and the Fitbit reps claim it is working as designed.<br/>It counts steps even when it is docked to charging station which is the worst part. Fitbit reps ask lame questions to each and everyone who complains about the issue.<br/><br/>I gave 1 star for the sleek design and light weight.<br/><br/>Please don’t buy it if you want to track your fitness accurately.
 Updated Review 2/12/2019…I had a Pebble and loved it. Fitbit introduced the Versa just after buying Pebble. This is very much a successor in terms of battery life and how light it is.<br/><br/>I'm adding to my original review to give some perspective on a few things I think are important when buying a smartwatch. 1st, don't undersell how important battery life is. I gave my original Versa away recently and bought a Ticket Watch (Watch OS). It promised 1.5 days of battery. Fine, I figured. I usually don't wear my watch at night anyway. The problem is that to get that much batter life you have to be conscious of how you're using the watch. I was constantly not using it for fear the battery would die..which it did anyway.  The Versa takes that stress away. Easily 4 days.<br/><br/>The second consideration is how the watch feels. Don't talk yourself into a watch that looks to big, because it most likely will feel too big. The Tic Watch and many of the Samsung watches are heavy and thick. You're always aware when you have one of those watches on. The Versa is almost weightless. So easy to wear it sleep with.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I've gone from Tizen to Wear OS looking for a watch that could beat the Versa for what I want a watch for, but I keep coming back.<br/><br/>One last note: if I had an iPhone I would not buy a Versa. Apple locks things down hard for third party devices. You lose text replies, which are a huge benefit to wearing a smart watch.
 Loved it while it worked. My husband bought this for me for Christmas this year and now it's not even the end of March and it will no longer track heart rate or sleep.  Apparently this is a common problem that I didn't read about when doing my research so I want others to know about it. I did all the suggested 'fixes' , even a factory reset but nothing helped. Over $200 is a lot of money for something to not even last 3 months!  Very disappointed in this.
 I like the Versa. It is lightweight and easy to use. The one thing I am really upset about is I went to change the bands, and one of the levers was jammed and bent so we had to cut the band itself and pry the lever out. It would have been fine if I wanted to keep the same band. But now I have to buy another peach fitbit band if I want the same one. Super upset that it came this way.<br/>Update: after using it for a little while, I have grown to dislike it. The watch is constantly freezing, it will not open Spotify though I set it up through the app, it does not accurately track your sleep (I wake up 3-4 times a night due to having a newborn and my watch states I was in "light sleep" at that time....I don't believe I am sleep walking and I am pretty positive I'm awake...but that's just me), and I changed the settings to show the screen when I check my wrist but most of the time, I have to push a button for it to wake up. Overall, Fitbit has NOT perfected their technology and has a ways to go! I am returning mine and getting another brand watch.
 Was a struggle to get set up because it couldn't be found by the app on Windows10 even though I shut off the firewall, bluetooth and ensured both were using the same router.  Went to extreme of using a wifi hotspot where I could monitor connections to get it updated.  Downloading music was likewise frustrating and took hours.  Then discovery that it can't play music thru bluetooth and track biking at the same time.  Next the discovery that it stops monitoring sleep if I wake up and go to use the toilet which is the thing that I stuck with Fitbit when my Charge died.
 I jumped into the pool when the day's temperature was probably hovering about 63 degrees Fahrenheit in NJ. The device got fried, the screen display was completely black and unresponsive, including the sensors at the back (usually has a green light).  I got home and charged the fitibit versa and it looks like it showed me that it was back to normal by showing me the watch and how much charge it had; claims that it had a 95% charge.  I left it overnight and when I found it around 7 AM, the device was completely off and no active sensors on the back. The whole square watch (front &amp; back) was hot to the touch.  I notice there are teeny-tiny droplets of condensation on the sensor windows, at the back of the watch.  I called FitiBit  customer service and they were very courteous and efficient.  They sent me a return label so I can have it returned and a new one will be sent back to me. I'll be hesitant to used this again in the pool, but I'll probably make that mistake again.  And if I do, I'll update this review.<br/><br/>Prior to the pool, I was happy with this device.  I loved that it reminds me to get up and be active.  I love that I can check weather on my watch.  I also love that the steps I take and the distance I have covered is tracked daily.  I miss it.  I can't wait to have my Versa back.
 Enjoying this watch. Slimmer than my blaze 2. I enjoy the woven band but it started to smell after a month of dead skin. Easily hand washed to freshen up. I prefer this to the Apple Watch due to the sleep technology.
 Easy to use. I like being able to customize the screen and see all the various real-time stats. Disappointed it does not work with my Android phone to reject calls. Working on figuring out how to use it for music, as it arrived only a day ago.
 I had high hopes. This item is a paperweight until its firmware is updated. It won't update without an internet connection. It won't connect to the internet. Fitbit on its forums claims to have fixed this problem in August. It hasn't. There are multiple steps, uninstalls, resets, installs etc to fix this issue on forums. They don't work. A couple of hours already. Won't spend days trying to get it to work.
 the watch has to be connected to your phone via bluetooth in order to accurately measure distance.  however, it refuses to sync most of the time despite supposedly being connected. the only way i found to get it to start working is to un-pair all bluetooth devices, re-pair the watch, and keep all other bluetooth devices disconnected.  the heart rate monitor appears to work well. the step counter is way off and easily fooled...washing dishes gets me several thousand steps.  using the watch to measure distance without a phone is pointless.  i have a usual 5.5 mile route which the watch told me was 4.2 miles.
 I bought this to replace my Fitbit Surge because the band broke on it and you cannot replace the band on the old Surge. I really liked the surge and thought if buying a new one, to upgrade to the Versa, bad idea!<br/>I have had this about a month and the only way the Versa syncs is by manually syncing every few hours, if you do not, it will not update weather or anything else.<br/>I always have my IphoneX with me and it still does not sync. I have tried every trick that Fitbit suggest and have just resigned to the fact that I am out on this one and to manually resync every few hours, yes I do have it in auto sync as I said before I have tried all the little tricks and instructions I have even tried pouring salt over the shoulder, jumping over the broom backward, you name it!. Very disappointed.
 Really nice watch! I like the look of it very smooth and keeps track of distance really well, better than Samsung galaxy gear 3 and better than Fitbit Blaze both watches I have owned before this.
 I just purchased this watch in July and it has stopped working already.  Very frustrating for the cost of this watch.
 I was orphaned by Nike when they announced via email in mid April 2018 that internet and app support for the Nike+ Fuelband was ending April 30.  Thus my search for a replacement began.<br/><br/>I started testing the waters with one of those under $30 fitness trackers and was ultimately disappointed. The app was awful, the device above average for the price point. It did expose me to a baseline for comparison.<br/><br/>Fitbit has a great app that can be used for multiple models, including the Versa. I like that it integrates heart rate, activity, sleep monitoring, goal setting (steps, calories, miles, etc) and (if the scale is equipped) weight monitoring. It is safe for use in wet environments whether shower or pool and all in all seems well built.<br/><br/>I did order a new band and detaching and attaching was an effort.  I don’t know if there is a learning curve as I am not intending to swap bands on a regular basis. Note that while fiddling with the locking mechanism while trying to attach the band, I found the regular touching of the buttons and face of the Versa caused alarms to be set and settings/menus being entered/exited. No harm from it, but it added to the difficulty.<br/><br/>Aside from the curiously difficult band replacement, after having used this device for about a week now, I’m pleased with the purchase and the additional capability that came with the app and supporting ecosystem.
 Says a lot about a company that doesn't believe their $200 product will last more than 45 days.  My fitbit Versa is just 4 months old.  In the last month the watch face started flashing, and today it died altogether.  Big wakeup call to me, after contacting customer support, the Versa comes with a 45 day warranty.....forget the one year warranty, it's a sham.  My defective watch is not really covered.  Fitbit will give you a refurbished replacement unit (won't  even guarantee that it's new or even a current model) or you pay half of their list price for a new unit, plus shipping.  be sure to read the Fitbit forums before you purchase.  Then make your decision......lots of problems with heartrate monitor, syncing, steps, etc.  Wish I had done better research before making the purchase.  And Amazon will only defer you to the Fitbit company for returns and warranty.
 Beware of how fragile these are.  I had this for 30 days and bumped the screen against a counter top and the screen cracked like an egg shell.  When I contacted Fitbit to see what my options were -- they basically said sorry -- there aren't any options for repair or replacement.  They offered me 3 months of free fitbit coaching. lol  I'd be happy to pay for a repair but nothing.  Before you buy, do a search on "cracked fitbit versa" and you may change your mind.
 Okay, so I've had the product for over four months and I am pleased to report that the FitBit was a great tool in losing weight!  I am a woman who stands at 5'1" and I weighed 135 in April when I purchased the device and now I weigh 112.  I am so pleased!  ^_^  I think that the reminders and calorie counting on the FitBit app (along with intermittent fasting), all worked together to create the perfect weight loss conditions for my weirdo body.  So let's break this device down and let you know my thoughts!<br/><br/>Product Design:<br/>It's alright.  I can't say that I am blown away by the design but it's okay.  You can trade out the bands with cheapies you can find online so you're not stuck with the same old colors.  The watch face is a bit large for my petite wrist, so keep that in mind if you're small.  However, if you're a normal sized person you should be okay.<br/><br/>User Experience/User Interface:<br/>This is an area that I think could use a little work. The touch targets and gestures are somewhat intuitive but I had difficulty with the exercise modes (Do I press this icon to start?  Do I press the side button?  The corner?  Why is this not working?! ***swipe swipe swipe***).  The app for iOS also needs more fine tuning.  Seriously.  The watch faces section is a hot mess and really should be curated (perhaps allow the user to sort by favs?  Maybe give the user the power to delete the ratchet looking ones?).<br/><br/>Customer Service:<br/>Oh, did I tell you that my product just. . . died?  It did.  FitBit had me record a video of it dead with a special serial number.  They replaced it in a week. Excellent customer service.<br/><br/>So, would I recommend it?  Yeah, I think it can work for you (I feel I am a success story!) and FitBit did have excellent customer service.  But I want to reiterate that FitBit should really focus some of their efforts on updating the UXUI to make the experience more delightful.  And the product is a tad large, so smaller people should keep that in mind.
 Update: I contacted fit bit and after only having the watch 40 days and trouble shooting not fixing the issue they refused to replace or refund me because I bought it through Amazon and not them. I would definitely reconsider. I just threw $260 into the trash, essentially.<br/>My watch stopped syncing to my phone after a couple weeks of normal wear. I thought if I redownloaded the app, it might sync. It didn't. Then I restored the watch to factory settings. It still won't connect to the app, so now it doesn't even tell time. It just tells me to download the app, which it won't connect to. For the price I was hoping for more than a couple weeks of wear. I'm calling Fitbit. I might change the rating if they're willing to refund/send me a new watch. The watch was nice for the couple weeks that it worked.
 I got this watch (Fitbit Versa Smart Watch) from my wife for Christmas from Amazon (order placed on Nov. 30th, 2018).  As usual... I waited and did not open it up right away, and waited until January to try it out.  When he opened it up... the watch DID NOT work (at all).<br/><br/>So by that time... we thought "lets return it to Fitbit" and at least get a running copy since we paid over $200 for it, and they are supposed to have a 1-year warranty. So I went to the "Return" website, typed in my zip-code and Amazon order number, and got back a "We don't seem to recognize that order number or zip code. Please double check and try again" error.  Since the devices was sold by "Amazon Services"... I don't know whether there is some magic  Amazon Services zip-code/order number that I am supposed to use instead of the one that was stated on the Amazon order.  This is quite confusing.<br/><br/>That is where I sit.  I will update this review if I make it past the Fitbit return site, or if I get clued in on the actual order number.<br/><br/>As an aside... not cool that the charger/watch combination was obviously not tested together beforehand (or) that the directions are so sparse that some troubleshooting isn't supplied with the device.
 I knew I wouldn't use all the features of an Apple Watch, but I also wanted more than what my Fitbit Charge HR offered. This is it. I get the notifications I need, can track my runs and other fitness info, and can also do a few other things as well. I love the look and the size. (It's been mistaken for an Apple Watch multiple times.)<br/><br/>A few other notes based on other feedback and questions I've seen:<br/>- Everything loaded quickly and intuitively (Follow. The. Instructions.) and it has worked flawlessly. No technical issues.<br/>- I've been getting 4-5 days on a charge.<br/>- I haven't found a perfect watch face, but the one I'm using is fine. I do wish I could save favorites as there's a couple I like for different purposes.<br/>- The band was easy to switch and has stayed on fine.<br/>- Step counts seem to be accurate, I'm getting results similar to my Charge HR.<br/>- The glass is sturdy, I've bumped/scraped it a few times already and no scratches to show for it.<br/><br/>My only big dislike is the music apps. I don't like Pandora, and I'm not going to pretend to know what Deezer is. It needs Spotify, otherwise it's perfect for my needs.
 I can't tell you how much I love this very pretty watch.  I never really liked my clumpsy looking Samsung Classic Watch even though it did everything my phone did.  It was just ugly.  This is beautiful I get compliments, it give me great information about my sleep, exercise, steps &amp; I get my text messages, can reply with quick response and I have the best watch face called "Bloom."  It starts as a small bud and it turns into a beautiful full bloomed flower when you meet your step goal each day.  It's very classy and pretty.  I actually get compliments on my fitness watch, imagine that!
 great watch for its price. Cannot totally compare it to apple watch. The battery definitely lasts for 4 days which and it has been proved that fitbit versa tracks accurately compared to apple watch.
 So far so good. This one stays on my wrist, I lost a few of the older cheaper ones. Glad to have stair count, my personal motivator was absent in the last Fitbit I had.
 I bought the Versa fitbit for the sole purpose of being able to listen to music.  I've purchased two different blue tooth listening buds and they won't pair with the Versa.  I am so disappointed.  The listening earphones work just fine with my phone so they are not the problem.  I had one set paired and was able to use them twice to listen to music as I worked out.  Now it won't work.  My other fitbit was working just fine to track all of the other things and I just wanted the versa to be able to listen to music without having to carry my phone!
 I got my Versa two days ago. I feel compelled to write this review because it may save you some grief.<br/><br/>So far, the Versa operates pretty much as expected. I upgraded from a Charge 3, which I didn’t like because the band didn’t meet the face smoothly, ie there was a sharp edge between the face and the band and because it would spontaneously stop while I was swimming. Jeez.<br/><br/>The migration from the Charge 3 to the Versa was flawless. That’s ONE thing in its favor.<br/><br/>Had I know how difficult it was to attach the appropriate-sized band to the watch, I might well have just gone to an Apple Watch. Whoever designed the mechanism to attach the band to the body should be banned from ever doing any product development ... ever again. I’m fairly adept with mechanical thingies, but it took me nearly 30 minutes of exasperation and nicked fingernails to attach it. This is the worst design I have ever seen. I thank god I attached the correct band and didn’t have to change it for the longer one.<br/><br/>#shameonfitbit.<br/><br/>If you are older, somewhat clumsy, vision impaired DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH. You’ll want to return it before you ever put it on.<br/><br/>The instructions that come with the watch are horrendous. I had to watch three videos on Youtube to learn how to attach the band. I’ve included a pic of the instructions. Absolutely horrid. The instructions from Fitbit fall woefully short of being helpful. If you want directions, you have to find them on the internet. The "owners manual" devotes 23 words to English-speakers.<br/><br/>I’m going to keep the watch for a few weeks to see if I like it (#ThanksAmazon for your incredible customer service!) I’ll update this review later and let you know if my final solution is to visit the Apple Store.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/20/19: While the Versa has a broad selection of faces to choose from via its app, the vast majority of them look like they were created by grade-schoolers. Based on comments on the FitBit support groups, many of them are buggy and don't work as intended (the "weather" icon doesn't do anything, for instance).<br/><br/>Overall, the Versa is surprisingly mediocre. I have to say that I'm surprised Fitbit hasn't done a better job with their product. Maybe they've gotten fat and lazy because of their success.
 This Fitbit Versa smartwatch was purchased as a gift. The recipient loves it and wishes they had the Limited Edition version with the NFC chip feature that allows for secure payments. Battery life is great, you can get almost a week of use before recharging again. There are two things to note. One, the smartwatch does not ship with an adapter to charge it, only the charging cable. And two, the Sm and Lg bands as advertised seems untrue. Not that it was needed but the Lg band was there and the small band was only the piece with the holes. I still give it 5 stars because the recipient was happy they received the smartwatch as a gift and with the usefulness of the apps.
 I was previously a surge owner but decided to take the plunge on a new FitBit product last year. Initially the product seemed to work well, had a few decent apps built in to it, and looked very stylish. Syncing was an issue for me almost immediately. For a product that claimed to sync continuously without opening the app or manually kicking off the syncing process, it almost never did. And if you went a couple of days without a successful sync, the process would take so long that the bluetooth connection would never stay stable long enough for a full sync process to run before it coming disconnected and having to restart the sync from the beginning. With the latest update (this year 2019), the syncing issue seems a bit better. The battery life is great (roughly 5 days for me and I use it to track weightlifting workouts 3+ times in that span in addition to daily/nightly normal tracking). Charges quickly and the fit is customizable enough to be comfortable for anyone I would think. The GPS running through the phone is not as effective as I would have hoped. It often comes unpaired in the middle of a run and then will revert to the old counting steps and using them to measure distance traveled rather than the more accurate GPS method. This issue too could possibly have been addressed with the latest FitBit update, but I have not attempted an outdoor run as of yet to know. All in all, if you are looking for a decent fitness tracking band for the money, this is a good bet. However, if you want more advanced features or a seamless integration of all the tracking capabilities, you may want to opt for a more expensive option.
 This watch has a lot of cons and some pros. Pros: easy to change watch faces. Longer battery life than apple 2 watch. I usually only get 2 maybe 3 days out of a charge. Depending on how much I use it. Somewhat easy to navigate.<br/>Cons: battery life is okay if you don’t use it frequently. If you are a very active person that uses their watch for multiple things the battery won’t last but may 1-2 days.<br/>It connects okay to apple. But YOU CANNOT RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH YOUR WATCH. OR RECIEV PHONE CALLS IF YOU ARE USING AN APPLE IPHONE. this may be perfect for a android device. But does not like apple. You can read only text messages and you can see someone is calling but you can’t answer.<br/>Don’t rely on the alarm on the watch. It will not wake the lightest sleeper. Also we have ring door bell. It alerts me when I am awake that someone is there however it will not alert me if someone is outside while I am sleeping. I have everything turned on so it should tell me regardless of the time. But this does not tell me. Really frustrated with this unit. I wish I could swear by my fit bit. However, I need dependablity and reliability. If we have someone walking around at night and the trip the motion on my ring door bell system I would like to know about it.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1VWAJV9C1N5TC"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gylkhHKpS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915ue3fBxdS.png"/> I’ve had several Fitbit products over the years from the ALTA to the Charge 2 to the Versa.  While they’ve all served their purpose, each one has been for a limited time.  The versa wears nicely and is an ok size for the screen.  I appreciated the ability to customize the watch face, change out bands as well as all the other functionality aspects.  I found it kept my HR fairly well the first 6 months of having it.<br/>Now the negatives, it is NOT water resistant, tolerant or otherwise.  I’ve only showered with it and it has condensation in the back.  From the video you can see it malfunctioning randomly.  Apparently this is a known issue with the Versa and has been since June 2018 with no fix in place from the company other than sending a replacement.  Unfortunately this will be my last Fitbit product as they’re items are too inconsistent.
 I've had a flex and a charge, but this is my first Fitbit with heart rate. So far it's pretty awesome. I like the apps, especially the water and calendar. Also love the new parent clock face, super useful with a newborn!<br/>Heart rate seems pretty good. Love the sleep monitoring. Also happy with how the back of the Fitbit is plastic and not metal since I'm sensitive to nickel.<br/>I found setup clunky and had to restart phone and Fitbit several times to pair. I have replaced the band already and find that to be a bit of a pain compared to my friends Apple watch. Otherwise, I'm happy I bought it! We shall see if I feel the same later!
 I have been a long time user of Fitbit products.... So, when the new fitbit versa came out I was more than excited about this purchase.  I noticed when charging the device the first time that the charger wanted to slide off of my desk due to the light weight of the watch and charger.  I enjoyed wearing the watch for all of three weeks until I sat the charger on my bathroom vanity to charge the watch.  As soon as my hand left the charger it shot off of the bathroom vanity like a spring and shattered on the floor.  Fitbit has a warranty and so I called them with my situation.  I spoke with two representatives and told them my situation and my belief that the charger design is flawed causing my watch to fall and shatter.  They said they were sorry but could only offer me a 25% discount on a new watch.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  It is not my fault for the faulty design problem that led to my watch being shattered.  I will not buy anything that a company will not stand behind!!!  If they do not replace a product for a faulty design... ecspecially an expensive product.... they will not get my business again.  PS: 25% is a joke!
 I was hoping this watch would do a little more than it does, but I'm still satisfied with it. I am not a fan of the limited apps and interaction I can have using this. I was hoping for a bit more from this watch than I'm actually able to do. My 17 month old loves it though, because he can make the screen do different things while he's sitting in the shopping cart. It has one baby/toddler focused app that keeps his attention for a little bit, but that one kills the battery faster than I'd like. I do enjoy that it keeps my stats like I was hoping, as it is a FitBit product. The step counter isn't as accurate, since sometimes my footsteps are softer than others.<br/>All in all, I'm happy with my purchase, but may keep an eye out for another smartwatch in the future.
 Here are a few of the reasons I love this watch:<br/>- It is cute, and I get compliment on it every day - I know, that’s not the most important quality on a watch, but the other smart watches I looked at seemed bulky and masculine. I was told by a Fitbit representative at Best Buy that the versa was designed primarily for women, and it shows.<br/>- Women’s health - when you get your versa, the Fitbit app on your phone will update to include a women’s health section. It allows you to track your period and symptoms. It’s a nice added bonus, since the app I was using before to track periods charges extra to track anything other than the period itself. You can also look on your watch to see how long you have til your period. Kinda nice.<br/>- Waterproof!!! - I’ve worn this watch for my water workout class, and it works like a champ in the pool. I love having a more accurate idea of how hard my body is working.<br/>- Hourly step reminders - the Versa doesn’t just remind you to get up, it enourages you to get at least 250 steps per hour (and congratulates you when you do!). I have a desk job, so this has been a fun challenge.<br/><br/>There are a lot more things I like about the Versa, but those are the ones that immediately come to mind.
 I switched from a 1st Gen apple watch to a Versa because I decided to move from iPhone to Pixel. This works fine as a fitness tracker but is a general downgrade as a smartwatch. I do like its sleep tracking and should caveat that my workouts are strength/interval training and not running/biking which most trackers optimize for. Still, the heart rate is often pretty far off, and there's this terrible feature (or lack of feature) that makes it way too easy for your wrist to accidentally pause a workout.<br/><br/>overall I'm hoping this grows on me because it's definitely an overall good device, but the experience has been a general downgrade.
 Gave it two stars because it technically works (almost as well as my old charge 2) and is prettier than my old charge 2.<br/>This is my 4th fitbit model over the last 5+ years, and I've been increasingly disappointed with each "upgrade."  The only reason I kept with fitbit when looking for a smart watch was it seems that they may have the best heart rate monitor on a watch, although it's hard to tell and I don't really know.  It does seem to track my heartrate accurately as far as I can tell and no problems with counting steps or anything like that.  The notifications are annoying because it will only show the oldest notification, that hasn't been cleared, from each sender. so if someone were to send me more than one message in a short time (or I forgot to tell the versa to clear an older one), I can only look at the first one.<br/>My biggest complaint is that syncing is a near-constant headache.  I usually miss messages (and then once a week I'll get a data dump of all the messages I've already seen on my phone).  Almost every time when I try to sync manually (which I shouldn't have to do since I have ALL the options for improving a constant sync turned on), I get the message in the picture "Your sync has been scheduled and will start soon."  And almost every time I get that message, it does not end up syncing.  I would return the product over this since not syncing properly makes all the "smart watch" features useless.  Of course it worked fine until my one-month return window closed.  I wonder if their servers prioritize requests from the recently-purchased items, and then shuts down bandwidth once return windows close...<br/>Also their customer service stinks now.  When I got my first fitbit, their customer service was the best (probably because their products were so cheaply made), but over the last few years they have become very cheap in their willingness to make things right when their products don't hold up to expectations.  Now when you have an issue the responses tend to be some canned quote from the product manual, as if there couldn't possibly be a legit issue and it's just that people buying smart watches are stupid.<br/>Fitbit 2013: "The customer is always right"  Fitbit 2018: "The customer is always an idiot."
 I love my Versa, I swim with it daily and shower with it on.  No problems what so ever, it is good for 50 meters in the water, much deeper than I will every go!  I love it!
 There was nothing wrong with the Blaze, but after two years I was interested in the Versa's great features.  I was also able to take advantage of a sale.  NFC and water resistance pulled me in, but I've since found other reasons to love this watch. The touchscreen is much more responsive and reliable, I'm regularly using some of the apps and have downloaded a couple.  It also looks great.  It appears to have roughly the same excellent battery life as the Blaze, which puts the Apple Watch to shame.  I get along just fine without some of the more powerful features offered by Apple and Samsung.  I hope I still feel this way after wearing the Versa for a year or two.
 I didn't want to get addicted to this thing, but it happened.... I preach about having "off line" time, yet I now have this piece which reminds me about messages and work outs, etc... but you can set it to tell you what you want it to remind you about what you don't - and it plays my music !!!! and i love that!!!! I bought a wireless head set for it after figuring out how to download the music  - took a bit of playing with it but I got it and I love it! no more wires, no more phones or ipods for work outs!  the battery is pretty good too and the charge is FAST!
 Been wearing fitbit for a couple years now when the versa came out I bought it and love it. The fit is excellent, sits low on the wrist and wears nice. Love  all the features especially being able to change clock screens. Waterproof feature is nice!
 So far so good. Only had for 3 days. Simple to set up.
 I personally tried another smart watch before I got the Versa because I wanted to see if I could get something cheaper. When it all boils down I just Really like the way Fitbit makes their stuff and that fitness tracking is the top priority. I love How I can Easily start tracking my bike rides with a few pushes of a button. Before I would Have to go into a total separate bike app and go through all of these channels to finally get to tracking and now with my versa it automatically tracks it. Very pleased with my purchase. Worth the money in my opinion. I also love the clock face called “Nothing special” kudos to that creater!
 What I like:<br/>The watch is very comfortable to wear and I forgot it was there minutes after I put it on for the first time.<br/>The thin profile easily slips under dress shirt cuffs .<br/>The battery life lasts for days even with frequent use.<br/>The screen is bright and vibrant.<br/>Good selection of watch faces and a few useful apps.<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/>Lack of ability to reply to texts on Apple<br/>After hitting clear all text messages, some messages don't go away.<br/>The music remote repeatedly will lose connection with the phone.<br/>These are all bugs that I'm sure Fitbit will eventually address but if you look at the discussion boards you can see that people are having a wide range of tech issues and this watch was probably release half-baked.  I'd rather wait for ready-tech than pay to be a guinea pig for a technology barely out of beta.<br/><br/>Design issues:<br/>The thick bezel around the screen. The LED lighting makes blacks look gray and highlights the bad screen to bezel ratio.<br/>The logo on the front, Why?? None of the other smart watches do this.<br/><br/>If this watch had an OLED display the battery life and image quality would improve, I would have been willing to pay more for the improvements.
 I hesitated to purchase my Versa based on the poor reviews I had read, even though I'm a long time Fitbit wearer.  When my daughter-in-law bought one and had a good experience, I decided to go for it.  Set up was easy, with the only hiccup being that it wasn't sending text notifications from Verizon's Message+ app (which I had to go on a chat with Fitbit Support to find out).  Once I switched to Samsung Message app, it was all good, and am also able to quick reply to texts, which is great.  I got four days on a charge this time, but people need to realize that, just like with your phone, the more you use your Versa's apps, etc., the more quickly you're battery will drain.  My daughter has an Apple Watch and has to charge it nightly.  Charging is easy, the band does NOT need to be removed, just "pinch" the charger and it goes right in.
 I have this Versa for 6 months.<br/>What I like:<br/>- In my experience, the steps, calories and heart rate accuracy are acceptable to what I need.<br/>- In the beginning I was really happy with battery life. Not not so much now. Battery is lasting half of the time after 6 months of use. Used to last 4 days, now I must charge it every other day.<br/>- Size and light weight.<br/>- Display brightness. Easy to see even under sunlight.<br/>- Waterproof.<br/>- Sleep tracking<br/>- App is neat<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/>- After 6 months battery life half what it used to be<br/>- Sync with my iPhone: even setting it for "All-Day Sync", it doesn't. I have to manually sync to see update weather for example. On top of "All-Day Sync" you need to leave the app opened on the background. Even though is a hit or miss.<br/>- No internal GPS. If I am exercising outdoors I need to take my phone with me.<br/><br/>For the price, I would say it is a great fitness tracker. I don't see it working as a smartwatch.<br/>I would give 4 stars if it wasn't for the battery life goes down pretty prematurely. I open a ticket with fitbit. They asked me to reset the device, charge if fully and let them know how long it took to fully deplete the battery. I am on it now. Let's see what they will do to solve it.
 I bought this Versa for my wife, and she loves it.  But she wore it when she went to the water park, and a week later (not sure why it took it that long) it just went dead.  First it was charging, and the screen became unresponsive.  That was followed by a complete shutdown and could not be turned on.  Thankfully the awesome customer support from Fitbit ran us through the necessary troubleshooting and will send her a replacement after making sure it was indeed dead.<br/><br/>After this incident, my wife has read quite a few forums where Versa users reported damage and malfunctions after wearing the tracker in pools, beaches, etc., despite being rated at 50 meters water resistant.<br/><br/>So make sure to not take it for a dip and you’ll love everything else about it.
 I'm loving it!  Easy to set up, and I like all the features.  Battery life is great too!  This is my first Fitbit.  I am definitely more aware of how much I move, sleep, and eat now.  Makes me more motivated to get up and move.  I'm not a big exercise person, you will definitely not find me at the gym in my free time. This gave me the small unobtrusive motivation I needed tho, to get up, and move.  I love the sleep tracking and the female cycle tracking also.  The food diary/tracking is easy to use and I am now waaaaaaay more aware of the calories I am consuming.
 I purchased the versa after using a mio alpha2 for years.  I compared the two heart rate monitors and the readings were quite similar.  The alpha2 has a feature that shows the heart rate zone with 5 different lights on the side of the watch, other than that, the versa has answered all my requirements.  Extremely user friendly, easy setup and every feature has worked well.  I used the cycling feature to monitor a spinning workout and was very impressed with the data, how easy the screen was to read and access.  I chose a watch face that features time, date, current heart rate and other tracked data and it is all easy to read on a very bright screen.  The fitbit app is easy to navigate and gives me the information I need, especially the amount of time in the different heart zones, average heart rate, peak heart rate and the most time in a target heart zone.  This is very important for my workouts and is a great motivator.  I have owned several heart monitors over the years, the versa is by far the best I've owned and has surpassed my expectations.
 Until a week ago, I would have reviewed the Versa with 5 stars, but then the heart rate tracker stopped giving me accurate readings, making sleep tracking and activity tracking completely useless with the heart rate tracker enabled.  The information I can get with it off is no better than a much cheaper and more streamlined device.  Customer service has been absolutely no help in 3 interactions, stating that this is a "known issue" with no resolution.  My request for a warranty claim was denied since the individual device is not defective.  I will no longer recommend the Versa at all!
 I was really excited about getting my Versa only to discover when I got it that it is not compatible with my Moto Z2 Force. Shame on me I guess for not making sure that it was compatible with my phone but I thought that two mainstream products from two of the top manufacturers in their industry would surely be compatible. I was able to set up the Versa on a 4 year old GS6 that my dad uses. Then I bought the dongle for my laptop so I could sync with that and that worked. But I could not get music to load on the watch over my wifi with the dongle, and I couldn't use my phone because it was not compatible. So finally with the frustration of not being able to use all the features and not being able to track my progress on my phone. I returned to and bought the TicWatch S2 and have not looked back. It was cheaper than the Versa and being a Wear OS device is much more functional. And SHOCKER it actually works with my phone.
 Great buy! Love this Fitbit Versa! Went from a Charge2 to the Versa after saving a drowning child fried my charge. I figured never a bad thing to go waterproof. The only con is the Bluetooth transmitter. It works fine playing music while working outside or walking, but when I run, I have to just use my phone because it can't keep up with the fast motion of my wrist. Not that big of an issue to subtract a star, because everything else makes this way worth the buy!!
 I am a bit outside return window, so I am stuck until I have money for Apple Watch, (Refurbished have great reputation, are cheap and they stand behind it.). The Fitbit Versa, advertises it, “Sleep Stages” fearure, loud and clear and It is a deciding factor for many customers. The problem is that there is a bug in it and they admit it openly. They’ve been working on the bug, as they say, for 3 years.  If you push them about this business practice, they will tell you that if you thoroughly read the warranty, and the small print, you will see that they do not have to stand behind it.  So it amounts to legal, false advertising.
 Love the Versa but I miss some of the previous features. I wish I could readily see the battery so that I could charge the Fitbit at a convenient time. I missed the walking trails that I could follow alone. New features that are great is seeing calories burned and heart rate is always displayed. I’ve used the coach feature but I’m not fond of it on the Fitbit maybe it’s better on the phone. Not sure why I can answer a call or decline it from my Fitbit since I need the phone to answer a call. A notification is all that’s needed in my opinion. I’m very satisfied with my purchase.
 Purchased 2 of these Versa watches and was very excited to start using them.<br/>But so far can't - They only work with mobile devices like newer Android phones, iPad or iPhone . The only PC they work with must be running Windows 10 and have Bluetooth conductivity.<br/>My wife was able to set hers up through her iPad but our Chromebook will not talk to the other one.<br/>Next we have lots of mp3 music buts it's on our PC running Windows 7 so another problem.<br/>We'll see if there might be some work around to get both setup and then transferring music , but not holding my breath.<br/>Otherwise we'll be returning all.
 I love my Versa!  My only negative is that I can’t get iTunes with it, but that’s more to do with my WiFi than with the watch.  I do the walk/run training and this watches has an interval timing app which is a huge factor for me.
 The watch is great, I love all the apps you can get and how it tracks your fitness products. That said, the only two negatives would be the foul oder and Bluetooth issues. The foul oder comes after sweating. The sweat gets trapped between the skin and the device, this happens and the sweat can't get absorbed into the default band it comes with. The sweat just stays and lingers on the wrist and after taking the device off you can emmit a oder people will notice. My other complaint is about Bluetooth every time my devices connects to my phone via Bluetooth my phone saves it in my Bluetooth list. Once saved in the Bluetooth list my Fitbit versa can't connect to my phone anymore. You have to forget the device in Bluetooth everytime you want it to connect. That is annoying. 3/5 stars from me.
 Love the Fitbit versa. I’ve had a Fitbit Charge and Blaze. Both lacked the smart watch aspect. Went to Apple Watch and hated the spinning tool as well as the bulkiness of it. It made me sweat so badly underneath. I found myself taking it off often.<br/><br/>This versa is so light and with the nylon band you don’t even notice your wearing it most times.<br/><br/>I did buy the basic black Fitbit and then upgrade to a nylon band I bought on amazon (for $10) for comfort.<br/><br/>No one can beat the Fitbit app as far as activity. All the data in one place. Easy and organized. Plus I love the sleep data.<br/><br/>My battery last 4 days and that’s with all day syncing and activity.<br/><br/>Only downside is you can’t reply to text on it but overall I found I don’t really need that feature very much anyways. Aka not having a life! 😂
 Its okay for now but it just came out last month imma just give time for better apps but its better then the apple watch ⌚️ in i had my watch on for 4 days now in its only on 39% apple watch last about 24 hours 😂
 This watch is great. It tracks my steps and fitness goals very precisely, and I love using it with bluetooth headphones. It is so much lighter and less bulky than its competitor, the Apple Watch, and about $100 cheaper too! I love the band it comes with, and I love that you can change the band too! You can swim with it and be just fine!<br/>The one thing that I don’t necessarily like is that there are no speakers. I presume it is to help with battery life, so I really don’t mind.<br/>Speaking of battery life, it is great! Fitbit says that this watch can last four days on a single charge, but I’ve gone for entire week without charging it.<br/>You also get text notifications to your watch from your phone- even with an iPhone!<br/>This watch is very helpful and I absolutely adore the coaching app that it comes with. I exercise every night now and I’ve lost several pounds.<br/>This watch is a great buy!
 I use this smart watch every day. The battery life is amazing! I previously have tried the Apple Watch 1&amp;2, as well as the Motorola. None of them had a good enough price to justify having to charge it every other day. I charge my Versa every week or so? Not even sure. It’s at least 5 days between charges. I wish there were quick text responses for iOS, but it’s certainly not a deal breaker.
 I love it! The versa is eveeything i have wanted it to be! I had a fit bit flex for about 4 or 5 years before it died. When i started looking for an upgrade there wasnt 1 fitbit that did everything i wanted. I was just about to give up and say i geuss ill have to settle when they anounced the versa! I preordered it and just got Tuesday! I love loves everything about it so far!
 Great alternative to the Apple Watch (which is WAY too expensive) and it’s also upgrade to my FitBit Charge 2. It seems more reliable than the Charge 2 for catching Heart Rate and pleased with this especially with the Black Friday discounts from the vendor that were available from Amazon! I got my wife a Rose Gold one which was on back order at the FitBit website and I got myself a black Versa also! I just wish the batter lasted 7 days like the Charge 2. I’ll play with the autowake and notification settings to prevent the screen from lighting up and buzzing all the time and maybe that will save some battery.
 I have had several fitbits and an Apple Watch, the Versa is my new favorite. It is thinner than the Apple Watch but as intuitive. I use Fitbit mainly for tracking steps vs exercise tracking and hr, however I chose versa bc it is waterproof and for the text/call notifications, they are great. Love love love this Fitbit, and Unlike other users, set up was easy and took less than half hour.
 My old Fitbit Surge was always just a little too big. Felt too manly. I love my nice smooth wristband, the color and feel of the watch. Its pretty cool you can update your watch face only bummer is realizing some only last 7 days without having to buy it. I actually really enjoy the basic watch face with all the stats hidden. Its also seems WAY more accurate. I love syncing my watch and gaining over a half mile! So far I am very happy and a lot of people think its an Apple Watch which I need like a hole in the head. Sometimes its nice to disconnect.
 I love it. Just cannot wait for it to support more women related health features. It will happen in May according to Fitbit.
 Notice that the newest glowing reviews for this product have been written within a days off receiving it. I first bought my Versa 6 months ago and loved it, in spite of the fact that it's not so accurate with stairs or sleep. A few months later it died. I didn't have any trouble getting a warranty replacement, which worked for a couple of months before it also died. Again they sent me another replacement and it arrived dead! Now I am struggling with customer service to stop having me repeat over and over the same troubleshooting steps that don't work. Likely they will eventually send me another used one and then it will also die. The Versa is a terrible model. I've gone back to using my old Alta, which works great.
 I would return this if I could. It's been non-functional more than functional. They mess things up when they do updates and you have to either deal with no clock face or a clock face that you don't want while they figure it out (though it does display a very tiny time in the top right). It's happened twice in the short time. I'm tired of restarting bluetooth, the app, and the watch. Even had to do a factory reset.  I've owned it.  There's also issues syncing. I bought the special edition for the ability to store credit cards but none of the stores I ask are able to use it, even when signs say they can. No one does so they are not prepared. It's just faster to give them payment. There aren't many apps for it and it's very unimpressive. There are no sounds with this watch at all so all alarms are vibrations which usually won't wake me and sometimes I miss it during the day. Not worth it.
 I was so excited about getting this Fitbit. I have been contemplating between this and an Apple Watch for quite sometime. After reviewing and comparing the two products, I decided the Fitbit was a more affordable and reasonable option as it had just what I needed.<br/><br/>I received this on Tuesday 3/12/19 and spent the whole evening setting it up while charging it. I had no issues with it charging. Set up went smooth some times, other times there were glitches and bugs but overall it seemed to work great. I was able to wear it about 65% of the day the next day until the battery died. It was fully charged when I left my house and I didn’t even make it home before it died. The battery did not last long at all for something that should be “brand new” and I was so busy that day I hardly touched it. But that’s not even the most frustrating part, when I got home I wiped it down as suggested and put it on the charger. Came back a little later to check it and it still wouldn’t turn back on. It wasn’t even charging. I tried every recommended way on 4 different forums on how to troubleshoot or position change to get it to charge and NOTHING worked. I honestly think it’s a dud. Or they sent me a refurbished POS that they claimed was “new”. After reading all these forums I realized this is a VERY COMMON ISSUE, like insanely common that Fitbit is aware of and has been but clearly hasn’t done anything about.  I’ve reached out to Amazon, FitBit and Assurion and have not heard anything back. I got this so I could use it. Not to deal with this hassle. I’m to the point where I would like my money back if this isn’t taken care of ASAP! So glad I opted into the extra warranty - make sure you do that!!! Now I’m regretting not going with the Apple Watch.....
 Best smartwatch I've had to date and best fitbit I've had.  I think it does most smart watch and fitness band functions well. Especially when you consider the price point. Battery life is great. I usually get 3-4 days out of it. Adding music is a real pain but I usually use my phone for that anyway. I think a lot of the shortcomings that people complain about will be fixed with software updates. I think Fitbit finally has a smart watch that compliments their excellent fitness app.
 Make sure your device is currently supported. And don't be surprised if your mobile device suddenly gets removed from the list of supported devices.<br/><br/>This watch was great when I first purchased it.  The detailed sleep analysis and alerts my favorite features.  4 months after I bought, the alerts stop working and automatic sync became sporadic at best.  Instead of fixing the issue for everyone, Fitbit excluded many phones from it's supported device list.  I've since dusted off my flex 2 and I wear it with a Fossil gen 3 watch which is great for mobile alerts from the apps on my phone.
 I purchased the Versa as my first Fitbit product, because I wanted to further and more accurately track my fitness as opposed to using just my phone to count steps, track runs, etc. The first one a received was defective as the battery lasted no more than 4 hours even with zero usage or interaction. This second one I received held a charge much much longer, and initially was able to track my runs accurately, but ultimately could not hold up to the challenge. The biggest issue was that the app kept having to be restarted because the bluetooth on the Versa was having connection problems. This meant that runs were not being tracked because there was no connection. My phone and my headphones, along with all other devices I've connected have had no problems. Ultimately I feel like its nice, but if you're really looking for a running companion, this isn't it. Full Pros and cons below.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Relatively cheap for a fitness / smartwatch considering the features<br/>- Nice display that is viewable is all lighting conditions<br/>- Water / sweat proof<br/>- Battery Life (5+ days on a single charge, easily)<br/>- Lightweight, and aesthetically pleasing<br/>- Fitbit community app<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- Bluetooth connecting ability.<br/>- No GPS for tracking activity<br/>- No online / web interface for viewing map of runs, walks, etc.<br/>- Lack of reply options when receiving alerts (text, email, calls)<br/>- Charging cradle / setup. The watch either has to be placed on the edge of a table, or laying on its side for the band to not accidentally dislodge the charging contacts
 Awesome fitness buddy! I loved that such a slim design was water proof and able to track my swimming much like the iconic (which has gps installed but appeared little bulky) and flex (which has no face, not my preference). The design of the Versa is much less bulky than the Blaze which I have and even dare I write lighter than Alta HR! I never wore my Fitbit for sleep but since I’ve purchased the Versa I have worn it often! Very nice watch the special edition comes with nice purple band pictured and two black bands large and small size! I enjoy the weather icons and exercise motivation...light weight great purchase! Though the numbers appear blurry in the picture due to focus of my phone the numbers are very clear! Oh and Amazon was great...sent it right away within 3 days, this is my first electronic purchase with Amazon I was very skeptical however could not be happier!
 Awesome..Best Smartwatch on market with Bluetooth off i get 7 days of battery life ...fitbit pay is awesome
 Loving this smartwatch.  After getting used to a much larger watch than I normally wear, I am addicted.  Looks quite stylish with a new band also.  Integrates great with many other apps and the Fitbit app is very helpful feature wise.  Easy to use.  Great functionality and customizability.
 Big improvement since the firmware update just 2 days ago.  Was initially disappointed on the battery life.  Was only getting between 1 - 2 days per charge.  Battery going strong now, only down 19% in 38 hours.  On target to beat 4 days easy!  Also had an issue where the HR was not displaying properly during exercise and was different than what was shown on the Fitbit app.  That is hopefully fixed as well.  If so, this review may just go up to  5 stars.  The watch is light and easy to use which is a welcome change from my Asus Zen Watch 2.
 Watch worked great for about a month, then the phone/text notification stopped working, then shortly after, the sleep tracking stopped working. The heart rate monitor was never accurate, we compared it to a heart monitor wrapped around my chest at a gym, and the watch was off by 25%. And I read the poor reviews prior to buying and NEVER got it wet or even damp...soo disappointing, going to try to return.
 Great upgrade from the Charge2 and a better device than most typical smartwatches that are available. Most smart watches focus on trying to replace your smart phone but in a format this is not really great for the needed user interface. This means that the most features such as fitness tracking fall below expectations because they are simply trying to cram too much into the "smart" watch. i.e., they fall to the old saying jack of all trades and master of none. This device is focused on Fitness tracking and does that with far greater efficiency and better thought out features and usability than any other fitness tracker I have seen. I highly recommend this brand of fitness tracker and this particular device for those wanting a bit more out of their fitness tracker such as ability to play music, detailed notifications, exercise tracking, GPS (using the phone's GPS), etc.
 Love, love, love it!  I’ve had it for 5 days now and I don’t know how I lived without it. I enjoy all the features. As a woman, I was slightly concerned about how big it might be but it’s not at all too big. It actually feels better than my Charge 2 did, especially when I sleep with it on. It did take awhile to setup and to transfer music but I just made sure I had plenty of time when doing those things and I never felt inconvenienced.
 Out of the box and set up in less than 30 minutes.  iphone 6.  No problems.  Seems right on for tracking my walk.  Listened to Amazon prime music on my phone and controlled it on my versa.  Love that feature.  Called tech cuz I couldn’t find how to add yoga in my exercises.  No waiting, immediate help.  Solved my problem. BTW There is only one band in the box because that’s all you need to make it larger.  So far so good.
 I am enjoying my new Fitbit Versa Smartwatch. It feels so comfortable on my wrist; it is lighter than my others two models (HR &amp; HR 2) that I had before.<br/>The battery life is very long and all the features are amazing. I love that I can download free apps according to my taste and necessities.<br/>I bought the black Fitbit Versa and an extra silver stylish band to use occasionally.<br/>The only thing that I didn’t like is how hard is to put back a new band; it is tricky and took me some time, but even though, I decided to give 5 stars because overall, this product is great.
 The Versa certainly looks better than my Charge2 and I love that it’s waterproof.<br/><br/>However, since I’ve already experienced it not properly tracking my exercise and distance and now the display won’t...DISPLAY I’m not sure I’m a fan.<br/><br/>I contacted Fitbit via chat since my Amazon return window had passed. Fitbit is sending a replacement. What a pain to have to setup another Fitbit and have it linked to my account (just to keep my data).<br/><br/>I’m hoping my currently non-functional Fitbit is just a random lemon and that this issue is not indicative of the Versa.<br/><br/>I had very few issues with my Charge and Charge 2. Keeping my fingers crossed and will update my review if the replacement warrants it.
 Product information shows that this Smartwatch should have "4+ day battery life", but I have found that with just basic watch usage, with only the basic original apps running, I'm only getting about 2 1/2 days of battery life.  This is definitely disappointing, but I still like the watch &amp; its capabilities.<br/>As for add'l Watch Bands, I was disappointed there as well.  I ordered the Versa Special Edition watch, so I received both the black band &amp; charcoal.  They are good Basic colors, however, I was looking for some other ones to change out as my heart desires.  There are many generic watch bands out there that advertise that they are Versa compatible.  But I have found, after ordering several of them in different styles, colors &amp; material, that because there is a "groove" in the watch, at the backside of where the watch band connects, most of the generic bands don't have that rear "groove" (just the pins) &amp; so they pull out / become disconnected easily.  Very disappointed with this problem.
 For a company to treat their loyal customers like this is a joke. After 4 days of troubleshooting they didn't have an answer for me, wouldn't replace my product, but I have an answer for them - I'm leaving.<br/><br/>I bought my Versa a few months ago. I was really excited to get this new product because I've been a huge advocate of FitBit since there very first versions and I've always loved the new features and devices they've come out with. However, my experience with them over the past week has led to them losing me as a customer.<br/><br/>I noticed quickly that something was wrong. When I would go to sleep at night I would turn off the notifications on the device. Then, the next morning, when I would turn them back on, notifications would not come through. I also noticed that the notifications that were stored were sporadic and random. My log of notifications would be missing most of them and it seemed weird. I did find out that if I totally reset the device in the morning then when it rebooted it would get notifications.<br/><br/>After about a week of this, I got frustrated and didn't want to keep having to reset it each morning. So I contacted customer service. They had me reset the device multiple times and even took me through some steps that were laughable, like turn them on and off again. I reset certain settings and each time they had me restart the device... which always solved my problem. That was the issue in the first place that I wanted it to work as promised and not have to restart it each morning. Each time I would restart it the notifications would come in and they would get all excited. I explained that this was my fix since I got it but I didn't want to have to keep doing this. So the only way to resolve was to reach out again the next morning if the notifications didn't come in.<br/><br/>Flash forward after 3 days of trying this and the rep basically told me they didn't know what the issue was. Her team was going to "discuss it" and to just sit tight. They refused to replace my device or to even let me send it in and blamed Apple updates for the problem. Which is laughable.<br/><br/>They refused to help. Passed the buck. And gave me no solution at all. For a company of their size to treat customers like this says a lot about them. They have lost me as a customer which honestly pains me.
 This is everything I wanted and everything they say it is!
 Absolutely amazing smart watch. The battery life is probably the best in the industry, I use it all the time to check the weather and my stats throughout the day and I still go 4-5 days between charges. Aesthetically, it rivals the smart watch and anything that Samsung or Garmin has to offer. Functionality is great as well, I've used the Starbucks app installed on it to pay and it works flawlessly. I love that you can cycle between so many different watch faces as well, all available through your smartphone at the press of a button! Kudos to Fitbit on this one, job well done!
 When I first got the fitbit versa the battery lasted for about 3 days. Two and a half months later it will only last a single day from a FULL charge. I got the versa specifically because it boasted a 4+ day battery life while having the features I wanted. I contacted the seller, if I get a replacement I'll update this review until then the watch is pretty much useless.
 5 stars for a great product and even better customer service! My Fitbit worked fine for about 2 weeks then the display started glitching. Showing just half the screen or had lines right down the middle. So I contacted Fitbit directly through their website and after seeing the issue they gave me options to get my Fitbit replaced! Whole experience was fast and easy. Sad that the one I received was defective but definitely happy with how they handled it!
 I bought this for my husband as a present in December 2018. It is February 12th 2019 and the Versa will no longer synch, turn off or even allow for a reset, it just runs and runs in multiple languages saying to install fit bit app. Even uninstalling and reinstalling the app does nothing. Turning the phone on and off, does nothing, nor does turning off the Bluetooth and turning it back on, rendering it USELESS. Holding down buttons also was futile.<br/> The sad thing is that my husband LOVED this watch/tracker. I'm updating my review today, because, even though the device failed, FITBIT customer service proved to be very accomodating and helpful. After making a call to them, my husband was delighted to find that they are sending him a new Versa. So, even though I seriously planned on never buying their products again, I'll give them credit, and reconsider.
 UPDATE: I tried over and over until I was finally able to reconnect my versa to my phone. Maybe it was a phone problem...<br/>My versa is updating normally now. Whew!<br/><br/>My versa works great at first. I didn't have the issues I read about here on Amazon. However, a month and a half in, my versa stopped connecting and updating tonthe app properly. I've tried restarting and resetting and now it won't connect at all. My return window ended mid June so I'm extremely disappointed.
 I've worn a Samsung Gear S2 Classic for 2.5 years and loved it, but the wellness program at work doesn't accept samsung's data, and the Google fit version wasn't cutting the mustard. I've had a few Fitbits and was generally satisfied before, but WOW. The Versa is FANTASTIC. I didn't realize  how much it stressed me out having my phone connected to my watch for notifications. Now I just have my watch to tell time and track fitness data. SO MUCH NICER. The bluetooth signal is a little weak, but that could be my cheap earbuds. I lose signal when I turn my head, but that is pretty much the only complaint I have. The sleep data pretty  much matches what I get from my biostrap, which cost waaaaay more and doesn't even tell time. Battery life after initial setup has been fantastic. DO RECOMMEND.
 Did quite make it 2 months before the screen went out. Worked fine last night when it was placed on the charger, but had lines in it when it was removed this morning. The watch worked perfectly up to this point. The wife actually preferred wearing it over her Gear S2 3g.
 Fitbit Versa nice device but no native support for newer phones.<br/><br/>Cons - Fitbit Versa did not work out of the box spent countless hours troubleshooting before being forced to return the defective item.<br/>- No native support for latest Google Flagship phone ie Pixel 2 &amp; Pixel XL 2<br/>- No support from Fitbit<br/>-Notification laggy and not working<br/><br/>Pros-  Able to return for a replacement device<br/>-Once replacement device arrived was able to pair the device and update the firmware.
 This watch was a total pain to set up it took days of trying over and over again on multiple devices to finally get it connected to my account. It has always been inconsistent about syncing, even with all day sync on I was lucky if it would sync once a day. It stopped syncing all together around the first of the year. I went through all the troubleshooting steps, finally taking the device off my account. It once again took multiple attempts over the course of several days to get it re connected again (I had to put it way for a while to keep myself from just throwing it in the garage.) I finally got it working again but after only about a week of working it is not syncing again. I have tried everything short of removing it from my account because I know what a pain it is to add it back on. At this point I'm just mad that I wasted $200 on this piece of junk.
 If you’re looking for a great fitness tracker, the Versa is an excellent choice and definitely worth the money. It is not a stand alone GPS device though so you do have to connect with your phone’s GPS (if you wanna track map routes) which is fine for me because I run with my phone. But the Versa does track your steps so if you didn’t want to run with your phone, you have the options that are already built in. If you’re looking for a fitness tracker with some smart watch options for approx. $199, then this is a device for you. But if you’re looking for a smart watch first/fitness 2nd, then maybe look towards something more like the Apple Watch.
 I had issues with the first original order and the replacement order from amazon. I contacted fitbit and after a while on customer service they saw that I was shipped one with a bad battery. I suggest just going through FitBit directly to buy but I wanted the 2 day shipping so I went through amazon. The Versa itself is amazing. I love it. I run with it and it tracks all the great stats. Logs sleep perfectly and shows me phone notifications.
 Only "worked" for about 2 weeks, before bluetooth just stopped working, meaning it would no longer send any of its data  (such as sleep logs, etc) to the app.<br/>While it was working, nothing it provided was useful. It WILDLY overestimates steps, calories burned, and liked to assume activities. The other day I rode an ATV, 30-40mph mind you, and it thought I was cycling even though my heartrate never increased since I wasnt actually doing anything active. It assumed I burned 400 calories in less than 20 minutes.<br/>The apps food tracker is almost useless. Shows you total calories, and a pie chart of percentages of your macros, but not the actual number. When you're shooting for X amount of grams of fats, protein and carbs, it becomes a real hassle. They must know its junk, as there is a workaround where you can link myfitnesspal to it, and track your food that way. Bonus is that you can set your own macro goals, and MFP will show you micronutrients as well, which fitbit does not.<br/>As a smartwatch, its extremely mediocre at best. Half the time, the auto screen doesn't work, unless you do an overly dramatic "looking at your watch" arm motion. It never showed half the notifications it was supposed to, and had so few features and control, I found myself pulling my phone out all the time.<br/><br/>If you're in the market for these things, go with literally any other brand
 I bought the Fitbit Versa in Rose Gold/Peach. First, I love the color of the watch and band! It’s the perfect touch of feminine. I have smaller wrists, and was worried that this would overpower my wrist and look silly. But I must say, this has not been a problem! I love that you can sync and use this no matter if you have an IPhone or Android. It is accurate with tracking steps and fitness activity, and has been accurate with GPS tracking. Fitbit has always provided great fitness trackers/ watches, but they stepped up their game in the smartwatch world with the Versa.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I have to say about this watch is that the band can be tricky to switch out. I hope Fitbit will make this easier in the future!<br/><br/>Overall, you will not be disappointed with this purchase!
 We have been ysing fitbits since they first came out and have pretty much had every model. We decided to buy the nee Versa model for Xmas as a gift and sre very pleased! The new model has a very beautiful design to it and very good size. Also love the color selection. I was never a big fan of the firbit bracelets though so we did change it to a metal gold color one that you can buy separately and is very easy installed. The Versa is water proof, smart watch(can tead texts on it, add apple pay, music, work outs and etc..) and works amazing. If you are looking to be more healthy or want a nice watch for the look this is a combination for both!<br/>PS-It does get confused for the apple watch a lot! But who cares because both are awesome! :-)
 I received the Fitbit Versa on 12/31/18/!  When I first received the Fitbit Versa, it set up easily. It seemed to count steps easily and I was able to understand and use the apps that work with it.  Then all of a sudden in February of 2019 it stopped receiving my phone calls and messages.  I have completely rebooted the Fitbit application on my smart phone, unpaired and re-paired the device at least once a week.  It will receive calls and messages for about a day now and then stops.  This past 7 days I have rebooted everything 4 times!  VERY FRUSTRATING!  VERY DISAPPOINTING.
 I love my fitbit- i've had it for over a few months now and wear it DAILY. Not only does it look great and have variable options for the band- it's super light weight and barely feels like i'm wearing it! I never have worn a watch before and have a pretty small wrist. Working out I barely even notice it. The battery life is also very impressive. I can often go a day or two without charging it (surprising since I even wear it when I sleep) and when I do put it on the charger it charges really fast so that I barely miss any of my day's steps and activity. It's also been great as far as not getting dinged up or scratched!
 I love this watch. I had a fossil smart watch 6 months ago, and it doesn’t even compare. My fossil broke quickly, didn’t have many watch face options or apps and the health tracking was not great.<br/><br/>What I love:<br/>This Fitbit is great! The step counting is very accurate, and I love the hourly reminders if you don’t take enough steps. The battery life lasts a very long time. There are so many beautiful watch faces to choose from and the App Store is limited compared to the Apple Watch, but has everything I think I would need on my watch. The screen is a good size for any wrist.<br/><br/>Complaints:<br/>-actual screen is smaller then anticipated<br/>-complicated to work at first<br/>-touching screen to turn on doesn’t work all the time, best way to turn on is to flip wrist<br/><br/>Overall I love this watch. It’s a good fitness and health tracker and cute at the same time. And it’s a great price! Love t so much orderedsome for my parents for Christmas.
 The only reason for 2 starts is that Fitbit does have excellent customer service. I am currently on my 3rd replacement device since May. The first one worked great, then suddenly died beyond repair after 3 months. The 2nd replacement arrived with a ridiculously low battery life of only a couple hours straight out of the box. The jury is still out on the 3rd. Before the 1st one suddenly stopped working, the battery life was an acceptable couple days &amp; all the features worked great. I hope I can say the same for the most recent replacement &amp; it has a life of longer than 3 months.<br/><br/>I do have to compliment the customer service staff &amp; their willingness to replace defective products, it's just a hassle to have to go through the process to begin with. If I could go back, I would have read the reviews &amp; went with a more reliable product.
 Love the technology.  The only shortfall that I see (though maybe theres something in settings ive not figured out yet) is during my swim when im using a kickboard and fins it doesnt count the laps.  But not a huge deal...it just records my effort or HR erroneously because it gets my distance wrong.  But beyond that super happy with it.
 I love how comfortable this is. I've only had it a day so far and it does an amazing job at tracking my movements and reminding me to move more often. I have been to afraid to see how waterproof it is, but I am happy with my purchase.
 My versa worked flawlessly for the first couple months. BUT, then I noticed that the battery life significantly dropped, almost dying within one day of usage/wearing. It was shutdown and disconnected from my fitbit account and then reconnected. It has since not held charge for a full 3 days (72 hrs) with settings for prolonging battery life. No call or text notifications, no alerts to move, no silent alarms, no stored or listening to music, manual screen wake; only the bare minimal: pedometer and HR monitoring. And it still dies in less than 3 days. The last time I tracked the battery life, it lasted only 55 hrs until I noticed it was completely dead. I had shut the watch down in the past while at work because the battery was around 10% because I didn't have the charger with me and put it away. When I had got home to charge it, the battery had drained even though it had been shut down.<br/>Customer service had been contacted and they repeated told me that "this is expected" with my level of usage and to continue to monitor the battery life??? I have followed all the fitbit recommendations to extend the battery life and it is still barely lasting 2 days. Customer service refuses to accept that there is a battery problem.<br/>This watch is advertised for a 4+ day battery life. Not happening.<br/>Would not recommend. Customer Service extremely unhelpful. I was told to continue to monitor and sync my versa’s battery. I would have rather spent the extra money to get an apple watch with features that can actually be used.<br/>I will be continuing to track my versa's battery life and contacting customer service.<br/><br/>Update: After tracking and syncing my versa’s battery life for a few weeks and contacting customer service, they have responded and a case has been created. (By this point it was lasting less than 48hrs after being fully charged.) I was contacted by email within hours of the case being created.<br/>Will update as it progresses.
 I just got this yesterday and I am LOVING my new Versa! The display is crystal clear and customizable. I love that I can say which apps from my phone can give notifications on the Versa, including which messaging and email apps are the defaults, since I don't use the default phone email/messaging apps.  I, personally, don't mind that you can't reply to messages on the watch, because it is such a small surface that it would probably be too frustrating to try. It is easy to see that you have a notification you care about, see what it says, and then if you want you can grab your phone (because we all know it's next to you anyway) and type a response. I don't really care about the Fitbit Pay feature because I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet, but I was surprised that it DOES have the Starbucks app linked to the watch, so you can link your Starbucks card to the watch to pay for that much-needed caffeine!  I also love the sleep tracking feature. That is the reason I got earlier versions of the Fitbit, but they have upped their game to show when you are in REM, deep, and light sleep! Now I can PROVE how badly I sleep...<br/><br/>The ONE drawback, which held me back from entering the smartwatch game before now is the size of the watch itself. The Versa does a better job than others I had seen which is why I finally pulled the trigger, but as you can see from the picture the Versa looks pretty big on my small wrist. I wore it all day and didn't mind it thought because it is SUPER lightweight and stylish.<br/><br/>I am definitely happy I bought this watch. Now lets see if it holds up to long-term wear.
 love it.... BUT after 3 months it stopped holding a charge. I was put through the ringer by support to see what the problem was. They ended up sending me a new one in October 2018. I have been wearing my replacement Versa every day and it held charge for 4-5 days at a time like it was supposed to... until last week. At about 3 months like the first one it started to only hold charge for 24 hours. Yesterday I charged it up and by 7pm it was already dead again. Brought it home and charged it on the original cradle it came with and this morning when I went to put it on it almost burned my wrist it was so hot! Now it doesn’t turn on at all... support is going to send me another one after they get the second defective unit back but I don’t want to keep sending it back every 3 months. Spend the extra $100 for an Apple Watch this sucks! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
 *******UPDATE swam with it as I have before for the month I have owned it. This time it died after I got out of the pool!!! So sad, they assured me it is water proof and are sending me a new one, (very good customer service) and they told me with the new one I can swim with it... not sure I will though. I have seen a lot of complaints about this happening so beware if you buy it for swimming.<br/><br/>I LOVE this watch! I’m very active and needed something that would track my heart rate and daily exercise, but I didn’t need anything else. This is a great buy if you don’t need all the bells and whistles of an Iwatch works great and I love I can swim with it. I have had no issues with it. Very comfortable too
 I love my fitbit versa. It tracks exercise, sleep, heart beats, menstrual cycle water intake i.e. how much water you drink, you can log what you eat.<br/><br/>Powerful and fun. I change my watch faces as often as I like....and my bands. Back to the gym. Got it for Christmas, so I'm gonna rock it.<br/><br/>Cheers
 I was surprised that I wanted to return this but my previous garman (that still worked perfectly fine, i just thought it was dying because I was now charging it once a week) wont connect to my phone after a factory reset.  So I'm stuck with this.  If you bike, know that this will never connect to you GPS so you get no pace, it pauses your ride all the time (while riding), it's pretty useless. Next, the beautiful screen with fun watches (see image) is all for nothing because it only stays on for a few seconds. Flipping my wrist never works to get it on but there is a button, but that sucks while your working out. I've only had this for 1 month and already I've had to delete the app and factory reset the device because it stopped talking to my phone. I can go on and on. Only positive, much better accessories
 I'm not super impressed by the Versa. Flight count is soooo off. It drives me crazy the way that it counts minutes awake while sleeping. It drops my sleeping stats an hour every day. I think I'm sleeping worst since I have it. Too much detail. It counts steps when I'm driving or in an airplane. (I know I can delete them in the website, but that's not the point). The fitbit pay is not accepted by many readers. I can't see stats from previous days on the watch. I can't send a customized reply to a message. It is just meh. And since I lost my original band (this one is on me) even more meh.
 If you want a smartphone attached to your wrist, buy an Apple Watch. If you want an amazing step counter with notifications from calls and texts, get the Versa. I had a Fitbit a few years ago. I really loved the dashboard and layout of the app. I read up the pros and cons of the Apple Watch and the Versa before buying the Versa. I’m in love with it! I am amazed how much better the step counter is than it used to be a few years ago. It never misses any of my steps! So many watch faces to choose from as well. I am so glad I chose this watch! I have had it almost a year now with no issues. I recommended it to my husband, in-laws and friends who all bought them and love them! Big fan!
 This is my first Fitbit watch and smart watch. I’ve have bought them for many people so I needed one for myself. This watch does the job and is great for fitness people. You can change the themes on your interface so you don’t need to stick to one look. The OS does seem a bit outdated but it’s not bad. As far as it working on my phone for notifications, I love it. I tend to look at my watch first before my phone for messages and any alerts. That’s what I love about this watch the most.
 Update! 8 Months later and the strap is already broken!!! Definitely annoying.....<br/><br/>This is my first smart watch.  I've been researching them for months and decided to wait for the versa to be released.  Being a newbie to smart watches here's my list of pros/cons<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- simple to use - I like being able to move around the apps to prioritize the ones I use most i.e. exercise, weather, alarm<br/>- I really like all the options for watch faces<br/>- I like getting the text and calendar notifications directly on my watch<br/>-battery life seems reasonable I get about 3 days out of it and try not to let it run to 0% also seems to charge quickly if you buy an adaptor and plug directly to outlet.<br/>-the black band looks SUPER stylish and modern (esp. with purple nail polish hehe..) I feel like I can dress this up even without changing the strap<br/>-I like the starbucks app.  I can buy coffee directly from my watch so don't need to bring my wallet for after the gym or my run. This was a nice surprise since I didn't purchase the special edition.<br/>-Most importantly this has increased my self awareness about my activity level, sleep and caloric expenditure.  I've only been wearing for a few days but have already started making small changes (i.e. going to bed earlier to get more sleep, parking father and walking to get more steps in, taking walking breaks to get away from my computer when working from home, being more aware of my nutritional needs as they relate to my caloric expenditure).  Ian already active and fit but would like to lose this stubborn lingering last 10 lbs.  I hope these small changes will help me!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-wondering why there aren't more apps in general<br/>-why can't I sync with my iTunes library :(<br/>-this isn't syncing with my mind body or weight watcher apps even though it says these are compatible apps.  Would be really cool if I could track my WW points on my fit bit since it says its a compatible app why does it only say you can track activity?  Its inefficient for me to track dietary intake in two different places.  this is frustrating!<br/>-Sometimes I press on the tabs and they don't respond (i.e. nothing happens) this seems like a glitch<br/>-No exercise option for "barre classes" like in previous versions of the fit bit (I've seen this on some of the fitbit devices of the girls in my barre class)
 I have had the Pebble Time Steel watch that is stylistically and functionally similar. Because fitbit bought Pebble I expected the versa to work in a similar way but was very disappointed. The two things my watch has to do without compromise are reliably inform me of incoming texts/calls and control streaming music (Google Play Music in my case). This watch did neither. The texts were relayed only about 1/2 the time and the music control never worked with my Google pixel phone. Some internet searching suggested that streaming GPM was a problem for Pixel phones and the Versa. The Pebble Time Steel was flawless in these respects and had non-proprietary watchbands. The Versa band looks like it is almost a standard size, and probably could have been, but it is not. The versa looks nicer and the heart rate monitor is a nice plus but I sent it back and now use the Pebble Time Steel again. Hopefully  the watch will not be crippled when Fitbit shuts off the Pebble servers this month.<br/><br/>Updated January 2019<br/>I bought the Versa again as a result of a price drop and hoping the software had improved. The watch now works consistently for my text and call notifications, however Google Play Music streaming is still a problem - it only works about 10-20% of the time and it not worth the hassle. At the gym I use my Pebble Time Steel to control music and this is a reasonable  compromise as it is easy and quick to switch watches. The heart rate monitor is not accurate for higher rates but is accurate for lower ones - I am more interested in lower rates and use a heart rate monitor strap if I want an accurate reading for higher rates. It is nice looking watch with good battery life. Increased the rating to 3 stars.
 Eh....<br/><br/>I love the fact that fit bit can give you so much detailed info on your sleep. But I'm not a fan of their what watches. I had the blaze before this and the charge before that. Both barely lasted a year. Figured I would try the versa. It's a nice looking watch and the NFC pay is really nice and works well. The issue I have is with connectivity with the phone. Misty of the time it doesn't notify me of calls or texts. Even after I sync the two I will get a call and nothing. When the notifications work is great, but they mostly don't work.<br/><br/>Save your money on this one, maybe there will be an update that will fix it, but I'm not holding my breath. Based on the longevity on the last two unit from this company I don't expect it to last that long.
 I bought this I’m November, 2018 and it broke in half by March 2019.  Besides the fact that it broke in half this watch is not worth the money.  I’ve had fitbits since they came out and have been impressed with the quality and price.  This watch feels cheap, it scratches very easily, and only a few notifications will come in.<br/><br/>Customer service was the worst.  A watch breaking in half doesn’t merit a refund?!
 I love love my versa! Just perfect ! I like the selection of workouts and see st the end how many calories I lost time,heart rate and I’m amaze in the feature of counting your steps! Now I challenge myself daily to walk more, and burn more calories! LOVE ya Versa!!!
 This is my second Versa. After about two months I decided I want an Apple Watch when I ordered my husband one for Father's Day and sold my Versa. I wore the Apple Watch for a little over a month and hated the health aspect of it! I could not adjust to their health app at all. So I ordered another FitBit Versa. I absolutely love the health aspect of the Versa, the battery life, everything. There are certain things I wish I could do on it like I did on the Apple Watch, like answer calls and text messages but I prefer the health much more than the convenience of answering calls and texts.
 I got this back in September as a watch to use when I'm interning at physical therapy clinics (it's not polite to check phones when working with patients). Ever since September, I've never managed to get more than 10 hours of battery life even when I'm not wearing it. All day sync is off, the screen is set to turn only only manually, and I've tried just about everything that I can but to no avail.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I got a defective watch, but other than the battery life, the build quality is nice and the features are fine. But due to the battery life, I can't recommend this watch to anyone else.
 I think I love this smart watch.  It's taken some time and effort to arrange the apps and fix wifi connections though. After 2 online chats with the help department,  it's finally ready. I managed to pair it with my wireless headphones too. This allows me to listen to Pandora without having to carry my phone.<br/>I like the rounded corners and low profile.  It now sports a magnetic mesh band too. In retrospect,  I think the champagne color watch would have been more my style,  but the black watch looks classic and almost elegant.<br/>It does everything that my old Blaze did, and much more.<br/>Changing clock faces is easy and fun. It's nice to have so many choices, including using your own photos.<br/>I'm very pleased with it so far.
 This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves it! It’s just as good as an Apple Watch if not better, especially for those into fitness. The only thing it can’t do is answer calls or text reply with iPhone as of right now. But I love how you can read entire text messages with a finger swipe down compared to the Charge 3 that makes you wait as the text scrolls across and never the full message. He actually turned around and bought me one for Christmas too. I love it!!
 Love the watch, love the design, love the bands but don't love the fact that it only lasted 6 months before the screen went completely blank.  It's under the year warranty so the fact that they're replacing it and the ease of replacing it was surprising welcome.  And of course, the time without it while they send me a new one is a bummer.  Again fitbit customer service was outstanding but reading the problems other Versa customers seems to be experiencing makes me wonder if the new one will last only 6 months as well.  I've had a Garmin in the past for several years and no issues.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  The only reason I'm going to stick it out is because of the superior customer service fitbit provided.
 spent a lot of time with their support team, to get the following reply:<br/><br/>Nikki: Thank you for providing all requested information.Nikki: Allow me a few more minutes to review your information.Nikki: Based on the information you provided, cracked screens are not covered by our 1 year limited warranty.Nikki: Our warranty policy does not include replacement for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or damage due to normal wear.Me: do you have any repair center, how can I get fix itNikki: I appreciate you are willing to fix the tracker, Leonardo.Nikki: With regard to it being repaired, we do not have any repair programs so we will not be able to fix the damage...... and Nikki: I was able to pull some strings for you, Leonardo.Nikki: Though it's not covered by our warranty I managed to get you a 25% discount that you can use for your next Fitbit purchase.  Yeah... right I will for sure buy a new one
 As a physician, the health features of the smartwatch are the most important to me.  I tried out both the Fitbit Versa and the Apple Watch that just came out.  I have an IPhone so I was leaning towards the Apple Watch.<br/><br/>But I compared all the results and the Fitbit was much more reliable and accurate with its tracking data.  Plus the battery life was outstanding.  I get all my texts with the Fitbit too from my iPhone at half the price.  The Apple Watch you have to charge each day which is a drag.  So I returned the Apple Watch and kept the Fitbit Versa.  I couldn't be happier.  I think the Fitbit Versa is not only a better value but also a better smartwatch in many ways.  Highly recommend to everyone!!!
 I love my Fitbit Versa!! It is so easy to use. Lasts 4 days on battery. I love the sleep feature. One small downfall is how it measures stairs. You have to climb at least 10 steps for it to register a flight of stairs. My mom's stairs in her house is 9, so it typically doesn't show when I go upstairs at her house. You can chose from many different faces to use as the display. It's cool.
 On my second android phone, Moto E3. On hikes or long walks the Versa is usually looking for a connection, seldom does it actually connect to the phone. When looking for advice I'm told they know of the problem and are working. Same statement of about a year now.<br/>Time to look for another company, these things not that good. Walking past the same landmarks I'll get distance reading that vary by nearly 1/4 mile from day to day.<br/>Try to get these people to take back a defective product and you get " Sorry but we're working the problem" and I'm still under the 1 year warranty.<br/>Should have known better, I have the Charge 3 and Blaze. Then bought the Versa because I heard that improvements have been made … NOT!
 My wife loves it. This is definitely an upgrade from the blaze. The vibration is strong enough to wake her up in the morning without being overly intrusive.
 Love this watch. The Apple had more than what I needed, but I needed more than a simple Fitbit. The Versa is the perfect sweet spot. It is light on my wrist, easy to use, fairly intuitive, great for HR and step monitoring, and I can control my music. So happy I didn’t get the Apple. If you don’t need the extra bells and whistles of apps, texts, and calling from your watch, buy the versa!
 I wish the bands weren’t so hard to change out now and the way they changed the notifications takes a few times to get used to but rather than that it’s awesome  all the clock faces and the apps you can have.
 I have had the Versa for a week and I love it! I was worried it would be heavy but it is not at all. The silver and gray color is great as I felt the Black was too dark.  I have a fitbit already but the Versa has so many more things to keep you motivated.
 I looooove my Versa! This is my fourth Fitbit (in the past I’ve had the Charge HR, Blaze, and Ionic) and this is by far my favorite. Cute, comfortable, lightweight, with all the features I need. Keep in mind that this isn’t a complete smartwatch - if I wanted to reply to texts and have a ton of apps, I would get an Apple Watch. I like Fitbit because of the fitness aspects. Very happy!
 I have had nothing but issue since I purchased my Versa.  I previously had the Fitbit Charge 2 and while it lacked features, I never had all the issues like I do with the Versa.  I've read a lot of reviews and posts on Fitbit's site and it's pretty clear that overall, this item is a dud!  It's impossible to keep it synced, the tracking and sleep features are extremely inaccurate and the Fitbit support is pretty much nonexistent.  I feel like I wasted the $200+ on the "special edition" and the band literally smells awful.  Now it's time to start all over again.  Do yourself a favor and find another tracker instead of the Versa.
 I really love this product! I previously owned an Alta HR, and so when I decided to upgrade I had nothing but good expectations for the Versa. And the Versa delivers and more! Doing a lot of research on this, this is a convenient and fitness geared smartwatch that is easy to personalize. It also helps give visuals on the activity you are doing, as well as use different options for whenever you're exercising (ex: treadmill, road running, etc.) I am wearing a size small band!<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Sleek look<br/>- Comfortable<br/>- Not too bulky<br/>- Fitness oriented<br/>- Priced fairly<br/>- Works quickly and efficiently<br/>- Has all the important necessities of a smart watch<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Slides on my wrist a lot because I am between notches, and one is slightly too big while the other is too small<br/>- I was expecting the to get the pink band with this instead of the black, and that was a little disappointing<br/>- Buttons can be confusing at first (Note: you can easily learn what the buttons do!)<br/>- Bands are difficult to switch out<br/>- There is no Spotify app :(<br/><br/>This is definitely more of a Fitness Watch than a Smart Watch, so if you are looking for a handy way to reply to texts or talk on the phone with your watch this isn't for you. I like this because it is simple and gives me access to my phone without making me feel a need to constantly reply. I also highly enjoy the fact that it is easily customizable. My only true complaint is that there is no Spotify app, which is where I have all of my music stories, and I am hoping that that is something they will add soon! :)
 Fitbit Versa was great for 31 days. Now face won’t display and I’m past 30 day return window. Very upsetting.
 The Fitbit Versa is a slick looking watch. Thin and black on clasic black.  I am still getting used to the interface.  Long battery life. I got notifications on phone and email when the battery hit 25% letting me know it was time to charge it.  The fitness aspects are neumerous.  I am able to link it to Google Fit with the Fit to Fit app.  The interface is intuative, the icons large and clear.  The app is excellent.<br/>I have a complaint when using the timer.  I have neropathy and cannot feel the vibration.  It would be so very helpful if the screen would turn on when the countdown timer reaches 0.<br/>I am very hppy with it.
 I bought my Versa four months ago and started having problems a week or so in. It resets itself constantly and doesn't pair after first charge. Due to the resetting I will often look down and not get a response from my Versa for at least 30 sec and while it's resetting it doesn't log any movement. After scanning the forums I found that it was a regular problem. Knowing how new the Versa was, I thought it was a problem with the software, so I waited for the update that was pending. Missed the refund date. I contacted Fitbit about the issue. After looking at my device log they told me it was a hardware problem and to send my Versa in for a replacement. I got my replacement this past week and the same problem is already occurring. I'll be doing some troubleshooting with it since I can't get a refund for something better, and update in a month or so.
 I've used a handful of different wearable technology watches (different Fitbit models, Apple Watch), but this is by far my favorite. It's comfortable, easy to use, and the best part? The battery life! I loved my Apply Watch but hated that I had to charge it every night. I missed out on sleep tracking because it sat on the charger. I received my Fitbit Versa on Wednesday, charged it to 100% and was wearing it by around 3pm on Wednesday afternoon. It is now Saturday morning and my battery is still at 47%! I don't anticipate needing to charge it until tomorrow afternoon/evening or even Monday morning. That's at least 4 days of battery life. I'm blown away by that! I love it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great piece of technology. Because it's still new, I haven't utilized all the features yet, but I'm looking forward to it.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I’ve now been using my Fitbit for a little over a week. There’s two things I think worth mentioning that I don’t love.<br/><br/>The first is that I found the bands difficult to take off and put on. There’s a little pin you have to push and you have to get the band at just the right angle, and I struggled. It was challenging.<br/><br/>Secondly, I know you can change the brightness setting for the watch face, but I wish I could turn the watch face off completely at night. There’s nothing like rolling over in the middle of the night in a dark room and having your watch face light up so bright it’s like staring into the face of the sun with sleepy eyes. It’s rather unfortunate.
 I’ve been a Fitbit fan for awhile. I had a ChargeHR long ago, but stopped wearing it because it wasn’t helpful at work. This versa tracks steps, workouts, heart rate, sleep, and gives text notifications. I like that this isn’t just a phone on a watch, that’s the purpose of a cell phone. You can also change the bands which is nice. This watch is perfect for me.
 I've had several fit bits in the last couple of years and I love my versa! My main reason for buying it was for the waterproof capability of it. The Charge HR 2 was nice, just couldn't get wet. I'm an RN, a runner and I have a 7 yr old son whom loves to swim, so being able to get my fit bit wet is important.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3M6LDMVZ12RHO"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915gG23lXPS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mgKf0JjxS.png"/> My main concern was how accurate this is as far as heart rates go. Luckily I have access to heart rate monitors and was able to compare. I’ve posted a video/ picture. Now this is my heart rate after moderate amount of activity. Have not tested accuracy during exercise.
 Would not connect.  Used the Fitbit website help, still would not connect.  Now after following Fitbit advice the watch is locked up, won't do anything. So 2 hours on the phone with Fitbit and 2 factory resets, rebooted the phone several times, every other Bluetooth device in the house turned off, the watch connected. From the start I followed the instructions on app.  I had to use a second device to get it connected then move it to the original phone.  Yes both devices are on the Fitbit approved list.
 My husband purchased this for me for Mother's Day. However, I didn't know it was available in silver aluminum to match the cool silver bangle band I purchased separately until I had the black Versa.  So back it went to Amazon only to have to wait the the silver Versa to be back in stock because they were back ordered until the 11th, then the 13th, the 15th, oh you get the idea.  I can only assume they were back ordered so they could fix those bugs a lot of the early reviews on here talk about.  Well, I've had mine almost a full day so I've had a chance to check a few things out.<br/><br/>1. Accuracy.  Initial reports show this fitbit being wildly inaccurate in regards of heart rate, steps, flights of stairs, sleep, etc.<br/>I looked at heart rate first and while I've always thought my resting heart rate was around 60 this device is showing a resting heartrate of 98.  Well I'm sick right now and hopped up on tons of Sudafed and cough meds so rather than assume its wrong I manually took my heartrate radially and it was actually closer to 105.  So the heart rate feature is pretty accurate.<br/>Next, I looked at steps.  A lot of people complained that it counted steps as they drove, moved their hands a lot, or even when they were typing.  I did all of those things and really didn't experience any more than the standard margin of error you normally see with pedometers in general. The 20-50 extra steps that were logged that weren't really steps are negligible to me when I'm logging thousands of steps per day.<br/>Flights of stairs.  Versa reports that it counts an elevation of about 10 feet as a set of stairs. So if you're going up or down stairs that are way more or way less than 10 feet then it won't seem accurate.  However, I only went up one flight of stairs when I came up to bed and my arms were packed full.  It still managed to be able to tell that I went up just 1 flight of stairs. And despite all the moving I did all day those were the only stairs I climbed and the only stairs it logged.  So that appears to be working okay.<br/>As for driving in a car, I drove all over the place to day and my step counter didn't really change except for when I swung my arms too much dancing in my seat to Justin Timberlake.<br/>Lastly sleep.  I'm afraid I can't help you there unless I fall asleep at work.  I can't stand having anythjng on my wrists or hands while I sleep,  not even my wedding ring, so I can't really track my sleep. Sorry.<br/><br/>2. Those things addressed, its time to talk about form and functionality.<br/>Form: 0HATE the bands it comes with and not because of the pins.  The bands are too bulky and masculine for women to wear everyday.  I put mine on and I didn't feel feminine at all.  But like I said, I got the silver Versa so it would match this awesome bangle band I purchased separately.  I've had several people compliment me just today who are shocked that its a Fitbit.  I am concerned about the face scratching or cracking so I may purchase one of those gorilla guards for it.<br/><br/>3. Functionality:  the setup wasn't as smooth as it was when I had that first black one I sent back.  The required 3 part update kept failing and I had to switch from wifi to bluetooth.  It failed a few more times on bluetooth but fortunately picked right up where it left off every time,  even when i restarted my phone to see if that would help. (It didn't.)  Finally after about an hour it was good ti go.  However, the fitbit app was very slow and had a hard time pushing the clock faces and apps I chose to the watch.  I kept getting error messages.  I also wasn't too happy with the selection of apps.  The driving one looked cool but the fine print said it was a free trial of a paid app.  I would have liked too see more exercise or yoga apps or even just more games. Gotta love games.<br/><br/>4. Lastly, the buttons and swiping around through screens has been a little hard to get used to.  They're a tiny bit confusing but they don't seem too hard to eventually memorize the layout.  Overall, I like it.  I'll edit my review if things change.
 I ordered this Versa with the high hopes of tracking my exercise as I was under a medically supervised diet and exercise program prior to bariatric surgery.  The Versa is waterproof, which is perfect as I do water aerobics every day.  I received my Fitbit the second week in May.  After a few issues getting it set up it worked great, for about 2 months.  The battery stopped holding a charge in the middle of August and my Versa died.  It took 3 weeks to get a replacement from Fitbit, after jumping through some hoops to prove that the battery was not holding a charge.  Once my replacement came I could not get it to sync to my Bluetooth to use the app on my phone.  It took 2 hours with customer service to get the issue fixed.  Now 3 months after getting my replacement the Versa died after charging overnight.  Fitbit will replace it, but only after I send them the Versa and charging port, and then wait for them to receive it, look it over, and then decide to send me a replacement.  I don't know if other people have had this many issues with their Versa, but I regret my purchase.  Look for another product as I would not recommend the Versa at this point.
 The Versa does not have onboard GPS. It must be synced via Bluetooth to you cell phone and use it's GPS.  I knew that before I bought this product so that's not the problem. The problem is both of the Bluetooth connection and GPS continuously drop.  And so far it appears that Fitbit is ignoring the problem by not issuing a firmware update solving this issue. To clarify the GPS and Bluetooth are two separate things. Both are extremely unreliable. If you're looking for a $200 Pedometer,  this is the smart watch for you. If you're looking for a fitness too, stay as far away from this piece of equipment as you possibly can.
 So disappointed, I bought this for my boyfriend with very high expectations, we never got it to work, it was impossible to get it to receive notifications, further more, it counted 421 steps when it was on the table the whole day. The company is aware of all issues, and seems like they don't care. The only thing that works is the time, but who wants a fitbit just to give you the time? This is the dumbest watch among samart watches.
 This is my first Fitbit, I purchased the Versa based on reviews from several different sources.  After owning it for about a month here are my thoughts.<br/>Good:<br/>Style, I like the squarish look and the overall size<br/>Weight, very light, I forget I have it on<br/>Battery life, I get 4-5 days on average per charge<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>Heart rate monitor is not accurate during workout sessions<br/>There is no way to lock the screen.  If you're in the pool, or the shower and the screen turns on, the water will cause it to jump to unpredictable sub-menus and/or activate/deactivate functions. This is a must have for a waterproof smartwatch and a major flaw with the Versa.  My old Garmin Vivosmart HR had this capability with a simple press of a button. The company has been unresponsive and has no plans to add this feature though it has been requested many times (on their website).<br/><br/>Everything considered, I would not buy a Fitbit again, nor would I recommend it.  I expected Fitbit to be more responsive to feedback from their customers.<br/><br/>Major software update and still Fitbit refuses to listen to their customers.  No way to lock the screen..
 I bougt the fitbit versa less than a year ago and today customer service explained that there is an issue with the Ionic products and the Versa products that they don't accurately calculate my distance in running and there is nothing they can do for it. They can not provide a date where the problem will be fixed and they won't offer any kind of assistance to remedy the issue. I have a half marathon planned in April and my fitbit won't accurately calculate my runs. If I am outside it will cut me though random areas and if I am on a treadmill it just quits working. I am so disappointed. I guess it's time to start looking outside of fitbit since they don't stand behind their products.
 I got this to tell me how much I’m sleeping. Spoiler alert, I’m not and when I do, it’s not very well. Also I’m not active.<br/><br/>But... that’s neither here nor there. I don’t have iWatch money, but was jealous of the cool faces and apps... well, the Versa is great! I can reject those calls without picking up my phone (quite discreet when I’m in a meeting), I was able to download a Nightmare Before Christmas face for it (the moon wanes as the battery dies), and there are little games I can play on it.<br/><br/>Good alternative to an iWatch, especially when you consider it has a 5 day battery.
 Seller sent this Fitbit Versa in the original box, sealed up, with everything ready to go. Love it - Fitbit really doing everything it said it would do when it comes to tracking workouts, walking, calorie burn, heart rate, etc. What really did it for me was that it's completely waterproof - using to track swim workouts. I only take it off to charge it quickly, about every 4 days, and even at that point it's only about 50% drained.
 I love this watch! I love it keeping track of sleep, step, calories, exercises, etc. it’s very insightful. It tells me to keep moving or that I’ve done a great job. It tells me when I reach goals.<br/><br/>The weird thing is that it has auto workout recognition which is absolutely wonderful. It will detect when I haven’t actually done an exercise. I’ll have to go and delete that exercise on my log. It said I went swimming and told me I did a great job when in fact I haven’t yet put it in water. That’s more me because I feel paranoid about it. That is my only complaint about it.<br/><br/>I love how long the battery lasts.
 I love my new versa! I highly recommend it. It works well. It lasts a few days without charging. It’s lighter than the Apple Watch and far less expensive. I had an Apple Watch and returned it. I love this more! The only slight negative is the band doesn’t really correlate perfectly with the watch face, but that’s change-able. I would choose this over an Apple Watch any day!!! Ask for one for Christmas and  you won’t regret it.
 Looks nice. Works okay. But after 2 months I barely tapped it against the kitchen counter and the whole screen shattered. Worst part? There is absolutely no way to fix it. Fitbit will give you some jargon about how it's not covered under the warranty and there is NOWHERE to get it fixed yourself even if you wanted to. They recommended I "recycle it" and "acquire a new one". As if I will ever buy another fitbit product ever again.
 I bought this watch for the features of monitoring sleep cycles and heart rate. It does a good job at doing that. Unfortunately,  the battery is said to last 4 or 5 days but I have to charge mine every day. I also dont like the clock faces. There are several to choose from, but when choosing one, you cant see the settings for each clock face until after it is downloaded.  Most of them only have the option to turn the back light on for 20 seconds which is not nurse friendly. Also, the light only kicks on half the time I look at my wrist. The other have the time I have to touch the watch to get the time. I hope in time it proves to be worth the money.
 Comfortable and functional! I love all the things I can do from my Fitbit! So happy with this purchase. Not too big or bulky either.
 I got the Versa for Christmas, and I have loved it since the minute I put it on!<br/>I wanted a smartwatch-style fitness tracker, and the Versa is perfect. The battery life it amazing; I've worn it for 5 days now, and I've only charged it once, during setup. It charges really fast, too!<br/>Both the small and large bands come in the box, which is perfect for me, so I can use the large band to put the versa around my ankle during shopping trips when I'm not swinging my arms.<br/>I love all the different apps, clock faces, and I'm dying to try Versa Coach to help me on my fitness journey.<br/>If you can't decide which watch to buy, choose the Versa! You won't be disappointed.
 I switched from an apple watch because I now have a Samsung and the apple watch isn't compatible. No ability to reply to texts or have phone calls (you can answer but it just picks up your phone so if you're not near your phone the caller just hears whatever is going on in the background). The faces are extremely limited and you can only update them within the Fitbit app. Also very annoying that if you change faces to see what other faces look like, there's no history so if you don't jot down the name of the face you had, you're SOL.<br/><br/>The only good thing about Fitbit (any fitbit) is that there is a much more robust community so you can join challenges and get motivated. Too bad they don't use that to their advantage to provide a quality product and quality software.
 I have used this for a couple of weeks now.  I love it!<br/>Easy to set up.  Easy to learn. Comfortable to wear.  Does exactly what it says.  Couldn’t be happier with my purchase.<br/>Also the charger is awesome, charges fast.  I haven’t waited till it’s super low to charge, I just charge it when I am drinking my coffee first thing in the morning.  If you are wanting a tracker/ watch with notification for your smart phone, this is a great buy!  I love the bonus of have weather at a glance too!
 It’s super cool looking and does a terrific job tracking heart rate and steps. Only downfall is I feel like I have a satellite on my arm. Literally I cannot fall asleep with this watch on my arm. I’m super aware of it and it feels like I’m being radiated. I have tried twice to sleep with it and have fallen asleep for a few hours, but aware of myself sleeping all night. But the sleep feature is super awesome how it tracks the sleep cycles, it’s just the constant tingling on my wrist. Very similar to the tingly feeling you get on your cheek when talking on a smartphone. I love that it tracks my cycle too. If I could turn off the Bluetooth on versa when not needed that would make me much happier.
 Watch 5 stars:  Light weight.  Great performance.  Good battery life.<br/>Fitbit customer service:  0 stars<br/><br/>Bought initial watch via FitBit directly.  Initial watch battery wouldn't hold a full charge for more than 12 hours.  Lots of argument and troubleshooting with FitBit.  Final analysis -- watch is bad.  Solution.  Ship watch back to FitBit and wait for them to replace.  No, I cannot offer my CC number to cover the existing watch if I didn't return.  No, they wouldn't ship a watch before the other returned.  AND the return paperwork listed USPS as the shipper.<br/><br/>Solution.  But a watch from Amazon and return the other for a refund.<br/><br/>I suppose FB no longer really needs to be customer friendly as they've gotten big enough that they can't fail??????
 So first off I will say I love the design of the versa! It is beautiful and stylish. It does take longer to sync than the 30 minutes they tell you to set aside so be ready to spend several hours doing this. Once I got it set up everything seems to be running properly. I had read reviews where some were saying that the heart rate monitor was reading way to high and that it was not counting as many steps as their other fitbit product. I decided to put it to the test with my alta hr on the first day. Everything was the same so I did not have those issues. I like that you can personalize the watch with your own pictures and there are a lot of faces to choose from. That being said there are a few things I did not like, some of the faces will tell you that you have to pay to continue using them after a day. Also you have to have pandora plus which you have to pay a monthly subscription for, call me cheap but if I am paying over $200 for a product I don't want to have to continue to pay more. If I wanted to do that I would have went with an apple product. I haven't checked out all of the apps and features yet so I'm not sure if there are other charges. If it hadn't been for this I would have given it 5 stars.
 Love the watch and its fitness functions and that you can download your music to it however depends on the android phone you have if it will connect. I have a Honor 7x phone and it wont stay synced to my phone at all. Contacted fitbit about this and they said they may never be able to fix this issue. As much as I love the watch may have to return and get brand I had before which I had no problems with staying connected to my phone.However if it isn't important to you to get your text and call notifications on your phone and that you would have to log into the app from a computer or tablet to see your stats then this is the watch for you!!!
 It's one of the best Fitbits to date. true to their word, Versa lasts at least 4 days (depending on usage), UI takes some adjusting to for new users, but getting ready for all your exercises can be done in a snap. Stats are easy to see, and fitbit app allows customization of watch faces for your own preference.<br/><br/>One little thing that I dislike is that it's not as hardy, I dropped it from waist high (I'm 175cm), and was unlucky enough to experience a crack in the top left corner of the watch. However, it's a superficial damage and Versa still works normally (I think). I'm not sure if the heart rate monitor faulty or if I'm just not wearing it right.<br/><br/>Would like a service center in Singapore so that I can get it repaired! other than that. would definitely buy it again for my mother!
 The first 3 months of use went great. Then around December 2018 after a system update completed I started having display issues. Either the screen would not appear or it was covered with several lines.  After some time the screen came back and at that time I shut it down to "reboot".  This seemed to help however, the screen glitches are becoming more frequent and lasting longer.  The buttons seem to still be operating as the unit vibrates but nothing is being displayed or several lines running vertically run through it.  Now I am trying to use the 1 year warranty to get a replacement.
 Reviews are either good or bad. Mine was bad experience. This is my 3rd fitbit watch. The other 2 were good and I would have given them a 5 star rating. The Versa has problems. The crap shoot going from the fitbit communtiy discussions are how bad the problems are and how many of them.  The few nice things are it is lighter than my Charge 3 and the charge is more stable. That doesn't justify the price.
 The Special Edition fitbit pay bank list is misleading. While it says that Wells Fargo is supported, it only supports Visa Wells Fargo cards and Fitbit support says they cannot update their own supported bank list. They told me to go post about this problem on Fitbit's communist forum and low and behold people are complaining about the same problem there for months with no resolution in sight. Bad support.
 Love this watch / fitness tracker. Love that I can swim with it, set different excersize activities and see the clock outside. It's great that I can change the faces of the clock. The excersize is not automatic tho, I have to start/stop the excersize but it does give good stats regarding laps and workouts.
 I am not impressed by this product at all.  I had a charge 2 it was simple and did what it was supposed to. the versa is complicated. I've been setting it up for a week now. it has had syncing issues. I still can't figure out how to add music and even though it's supposed to be able to track elliptical workouts after a minimum of 10 minutes it doesnt always work.  flashy, but it's not better than the charge 2
 Had it for 4 days and so far it is everything that was advertised.  I'll update review in another 30 days.
 The Versa has some nice smartwatch features and is much better at dealing with texts and email than previous Fitbits. Compared to the Ionic it does seem to be more accurate in my step count but I question the heart rate monitor. It always seems to read my heart rate much higher than my Ionic and when I do a manual heart rate check. I continue to have connectivity issues that cause the map my run feature to fail and to not regularly sync my steps. The connectivity issues are almost enough for me to give this a three star but the other features keep it at four.
 Just got it 3 days ago but already in love with it's capabilities ❤. It was easy to setup, light weight and I connected to my Omada so it updates my steps and exercise automatically.
 I love the features of this watch and get a respectable 5 days battery life. I found a great wachface that presents all the info I want, including weather, cleanly on the screen. What I take issue with is the total inaccuracy of the sleep tracker. I go to bed around 10pm but it always claims that I fell asleep around 2-3am and claims I only get 2-4 hrs of sleep a night even though I actually get 6-8 hrs.  Totally inaccurate which makes it useless. I've tried my wife's fitbit (she has either the charge 3 or Alta...I forget) and it's sleep tracking is way more accurate (though supposedly the versa is more advanced).
 Much better than the basic Fitbits. However I found the system either very sensitive or insensitive. It overestimates steps and under recorded sleep. Also connection to my phone was temperamental. Worth a try but you need to work on it.
 Great product to allow me to track my fitness and health habits. I feel like the sleep track and steps are very accurate but you may have to adjust things in the settings. Replying to notifications is limited to preselected stuff and wish there was more options for that. This is a great alternative to the apple watch but I would recommend spending a few more dollars for the upgraded versa.
 BecauseI like to change out my watch bands to fit my outfits this watch is not for me.<br/><br/> I dont think the makers put much effort in what women would like in a watch that you wear daily. This is a daily wear watch so it should be versatile it is NOT. The process is very difficult and time consuming.<br/><br/>  The features dont very much from the ionic. The ionic cost more and is bulkier in size. However ease and versatility may be worth the price.<br/>I'm stuck with this watch that I have had for less than a month because I have scratched up the back trying to remove bands.<br/>  However lesson learned.
 It worked well for a couple of months then it started having problems: the battery life got shorter and shorter. Now I have to recharge it every day. It doesn't sync and I can't update firmware. Amazon doesn't want to refund or replace because it's out of the return window. 200$ down the drain. I should have listened to the bad reviews and not order this.
 I am in love with my versa.  I had a charge 2 for a long time and this is such an upgrade.  Super comfy and user friendly and it looks really pretty.  I love the alarm and all the notifications.  The only con i would say is changing the band.  I still can't get it figured out and i'm pretty savvy if i may say so myself.
 Beautiful and efficient, but may be very difficult to add to your wifi network.  I was unable to connect the first watch I ordered.  I spoke to ATT several times and Fitbit Customer Service for an hour.  Convinced that the product was at fault, I sent it back.  When I encountered the same problem with the next Versa, I surmised the solution was at hand.  But what?  The next call to Fitbit Customer Service yielded the clue I needed.  After about fifteen minutes the Fitbit agent asked for my network password.  It included two ++ and two ==.  The agent said to change the password and the problem would be solved..............and it was!  That stupid password.  If your password looks something like this: h7kp+64?=6+r=D.  Change it!
 I've had a variety of Fitbit watches over the years.  I've loved them all, but the Versa is awesome.  My husband has an Apple Watch and the Versa stacks right up to it for half the cost.  I track everything from sleep to steps.  I love that it reminds me to get up and move.  I can customize the watch face and download different apps to use including Pandora, Weather, Starbucks, etc.  Super useful as an alarm too.
 I aas really excited to get this watch after having a flex for 3 years. I thought it would be great to get notifications when I was not able to have my phone out. It worked great the first week I had it and then it didn't. It would noy sync to my phone or send my notifications. I tried troubleshooting on my own and it was able to sync once still no notifications. Then it started tohe troubles all over the next day. Not sure what to do next I contacted fitbit. They did all the same troubleshooting as I had done the previous day  and had me load the app on a different phone. It worked on the other phone but still not mine. They then told me that my phone compatabiliy was untested with the Versa and that they would not work together but that I could continue to use my husbands phone with it. That is fine and well if I were to carry my husbands phone all the time so I could get the notifications which is the main reason for getting the Versa. I will be sending this product back and buying a different brand of fitness watch.
 I liked the build of the device and it has a good screen.  The step function seems accurate when compared to my phone.  As is the information on my pulse when I take my blood pressure.  I not sure how accurate the sleep information is but it gives me some information.  I do not think the floors climbed function is accurate at all and disregard those readings but that is a minor issue.  The music function for loading your personal music is SLOW and cumberson.  I noted when I tried to add music it delete all the songs I had on device which was annoying to say the least.  I would have given it three stars but for what I want it to do it above average thus I gave it four stars.
 Love it! Super easy to set up, comfortable to wear, &amp; fun to customize! But it isn't very accurate. While driving home one night I got 45 steps in, &amp; its happend on several other occasions. The heart rate monitor cant be correct either, says I have a resting rate of 113 &amp; I'm healthy so i know that cant be correct. But overall im satisfied even if it is basically a cool smart watch!
 I gave the watch a 3 star, but that's mostly based on the quality of the watch bands, which I have had pretty significant problems with. I would give the watch itself a 4 star rating.<br/><br/>THE WATCH<br/>Pros:<br/>1) You can choose from a wide variety of watch faces, which are fairly tailored to your needs.<br/>2) The watch does a nice job of tracking your basic stats - steps, heart rate, calories.<br/>3) It has a decent battery, which lasts me 4-5 days, and recharges fairly quickly (a few hours). It sits in a nice, easy to use cradle.<br/>4) I like the alarm and timer functions - easy to use and please UI.<br/><br/>Suggestions:<br/>1) I'm an open water swimmer and I'd really like to track my swims. Unfortunately, the watch just tracks laps (when you turn around), so it's not useful for people like me. Would be great to track swims like you track runs.<br/>2) Please add some more types of exercise to track. I also row, and would like to be able to track rows, and erg workouts.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) You can't do much management of the interface on the watch - instead you have to go into the phone app or the web, and that makes the experience fairly disconnected.<br/>2) THE BANDS! I bought 2, the plastic one that comes with the watch and a metal one that I got on Amazon. The metal one broke fairly quickly, and when it broke, the fiddly metal piece that attaches the band to the watch was left in the watch. It took some real gymnastics to get it out. Beware the secondary dealer bands - the attachment pieces are not as large as the Fitbit ones and they are difficult to manipulate. I switched to the plastic band from Fitbit, which just broke on me right at the attachment point with the watch (see picture). I bought the watch in May, so that's a 6 month life. Not great.  I asked Fitbit if they'd credit me the cost of the plastic band towards a metal one, theorizing that the plastic one will just break again, but they refused, saying they will only replace the band with the same one. Sooooo... buyer beware. I hope the new metal band will last longer and be better quality, but they are expensive ($86 with tax). If it breaks, I'll be back with an update.
 Update- I'm dropping this down to 3 stars because the sleep tracking is defective and Fitbit has yet to come up with a solution despite advertising that it will track your sleep. I suggest you make your purchase decision as if it doesn't track sleep until they fix it if ever. Google search the problem and you'll find forums that discuss it.<br/>I like this Fitbit best for the most part with it's bright easy to read display from the four activity trackers that I've owned in the past. I like the many watch faces you can get with a huge variety when compared to the Blaze's limited selection. I've not messed around with any apps so I can't comment on that. The down side for me is that it hardly ever gets my sleep correct which is part of the reason I purchased it. It'll show that I went to bed hours after I actually did or there will be a chunk of time missing during the night so the sleep time is wrong by a few hours. Overall, I would recommend the Versa unless you place a high value on sleep tracking in which case you may want to do additional research.
 I'm very happy with my choice of the Versa, its classy looking and functional. As a nurse I wanted a watch that I could use at work and be able to wipe down and sanitize after. But I also watched a watch that I could dress up a bit for everyday wear as well. I feel the bands even with my short nails are easily swappable and there are many third party options to dress the watch up for the occasion. The price is reasonable and the feature set exactly what I need for both work and play. I dont need the millions of features of the apple watch and nothing I own is apple so this was my obvious choice as I was burned by a bad experience with Samsung's Gear line of watches. The Versa is my favorite watch to date and I'm very happy with my choice.
 Stopped syncing to my computer and iphone, then I called to have them help me at fitbit and now it wont even turn on after he made me restart it. I have had small issues since the day i got it but nothing major and now this after 6 months. They will send a replacement of the product that I don't even want anymore. When I went to click the link they sent me to order a replacement, it wont even work! so now I have to call back again to have them resend it and wait 7 business days for this crap product, in the mean time having no watch.
 Generally I love Fitbits, and the Versa is so much sleeker and more attractive than the Blaze. I also prefer the new charger that doesn't require removing the band.<br/>My only complaints are:<br/>1. The purple cloth band that came with this was super comfy but started to smell after a week of wearing it; not a good material for something that is going to be on a person's body all day every day. I've tried washing it but doesn't seem to help much.<br/>2. I have had so much trouble getting the bluetooth to connect and not sure why. This means that I don't always get the watch to buzz/notify me when I get a text on my phone, which is annoying.<br/>3. I don't feel like the features/software have changed in a noticeable way. I would love to see Fitbit do more to compete with the apple watch's features, like responding to messages/calls directly in the watch.
 Meets all my expectations for a smart watch! Light and fashion design with nice apps to be installed, not mentioning sleep tracking and other monitoring functions. Love it!<br/>Few days ago the sleep tracking on the Fitbit app was displaying 0 mins of sleep. They fixed it almost at once! Great work for the service team!
 This is the first fitbit device I have owned. I've never had any issue with them but for some reason the Versa left burn marks on my wrist. I only wore it a few days but the burn mark and peeling skin took weeks to go back to normal. The device itself was very lightweight and comfortable, and fitbit's customer support was very helpful but its disappointing that so many people have had problems with the Versa burning them. My battery would go from 100% to 0% in about 20 hours even when I didn't use any apps or even wear the device. The changeable clock face was nice so I could set it to a dark background and not blind myself at night turning over but the apps were more of a novelty rather than anything useful. I'm back to wearing my old faithful Charge 2.
 I love it. I wish the apps for the watch we better. More like the ones available for cell phones. However it is nice that my watch doesn’t pester me with the constant beeps of Unimportant news articles. I really do enjoy what it does as a sports watch. How it monitors my heart rate, exercise and especially the sleep patterns. As someone who struggles with sleep it’s nice to know what’s going on. I do have to wear it a little tighter at night so it can get proper readings. I think an Apple Watch is cool but I don’t need all the flash and constant distracting it comes with. I do kinda regret not getting the more expensive version with the built in gps. Also it would be nice to do a quick text message reply as I don’t always have my phone on me
 UPDATE PART TWO: Just had it charging for the usual amount of time. Picked it up off the charger and it was burning hot. Cooled off and now won’t turn on. Would not recommend purchasing. Spend the money for an Apple Watch.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several months since I bought this and I'm now noticing a drastic decrease in battery life. Previously, the battery would drop 10-15% per day which is fine, but now it's upwards of 60% per day, having to charge almost every other day. Huge bummer. Will probably use it till I run into the ground, which at this rate may only be another 2-3 months :(<br/><br/>I got mine a few days ago but wanted to wait till I had to charge it to write a review since it seems that battery life is a common complaint.<br/><br/>I received my Versa on Wednesday morning, immediately charged it to full battery and got everything set up. I’ve been wearing it everyday and night since, and now it’s Saturday night and the battery is at 22%. Took it off to charge while I showered and grabbed a bedtime snack (I could have waited till Sunday but would rather start the day with full charge). It’s been about half an hour and the batter is up to 70%!<br/><br/>I was super worried about getting a faulty battery as many others have said, but it’s working fine for me! Description is true in saying 4+ days.<br/><br/>My one and only complaint (which I knew about before buying) is not being able to answer texts. I didn’t buy an Apple Watch because I didn’t want or need all of the features and I especially didn’t want to spend over $100 more just to be able to answer texts. If Fitbit figures out a way to get that feature in an update, I would give this the full 5 stars :)
 Versa is a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 star fitness tracking watch. I like the various workout options, tracking of heart rate and sleep. I love that it’s waterproof and tracks my lap swim. I love that I can start a workout (run, bike, swim, weights, more) in a few seconds. No fussing with a chest strap. The screen is very visible in sunlight. One day of activity (very heavy user) uses up about 35% battery. I spend around 15 minutes at the end of the day looking over my stats in the app. I have small wrists and Versa isn’t too bulky. A few minor complaints: the watch sometimes takes up to 30 seconds to acquire GPS from my iPhone. I can speed this up by manually syncing via the app. Also, I can’t see my BPM in the swimming exercise type but I can see it in the app later in the workout results. Lastly, I don’t get verbal stats every mile like I do when I track my workout with the iPhone app. I miss the queues. Even with these minor issues, the Versa is fantastic for tracking fitness, exercise and health. It’s the best fitness tracker I’ve ever used - I quit an iPhone app with over 8 years of workout data for the Versa.
 The Fitbit Versa arrived earlier than projected when I ordered it. It was easy to transfer from my Charge HR to the Versa. The color is exactly as I expected and the peach band was a nicer shade than it appeared on the internet. I haven't been able to get notifications, e.g. texts and phone calls, to show up on the Versa yet, but I haven't had time to really look into what is the problem. I expect that I have missed turning something on to allow this to work.
 Received this product yesterday and I spent literally 10 freaking hours trying to connect it to my phone and the internet. It would connect for about a minute and then the status of it won't start looping from connected to not connected. When it finally connected it would start updating and then disconnect again. If I cant get it to work today I'm defiantly sending this frustrating piece of crap back.
 ACTUALIZADA: Finalmente opté por usar la app en mi iPad y ahora funciona perfectamente, es la mejor herramienta para hacer ejercicio que he comprado.<br/><br/>Primero, la descripción del producto no es clara en cuál es la versión que trae Fitbit Pay, yo lo compré en gran parte por ello y la versión que me llegó no tiene esa función. Además, llevo casi una semana tratando de sincronizar el reloj con el teléfono, he reiniciado, reconfigurado y 10 mil cosas más, tanto el reloj como el teléfono y ha sido posible, ya me rendí y voy a hacer la devolución del reloj y los accesorios que había comprado para él. Tenía mucha ilusión con este dispositivo, pero no funciona para nada, y por lo tanto no es útil.
 I actually really love my versa. I thought that I wouldn’t because I’ve known so many people with the Apple Watch. But this does everything I need It to. I really love how it’s a fitness watch first and not the other way around
 Bought the Fitbit Versa from Amazon on 08/29/18 and on 03/11/19, it suddenly stopped working despite 100% charge and the screen has been blank since then. Several attempts to reset and factory resets were to no avail.<br/>Trying to get customer support through Fitbit to no avail There is supposed to be a year warranty coverage.<br/>A search online shows that this is a very common problem making the Fitbit VERS a very defective product. So DON'T BUY.
 I bought this fitbit as my first smart watch. As soon as I started setting it up the screen would not work no matter how soft or hard I touched the screen. After I finished the set up it started freezing or moving uncontrollably and there was no way to fix it. I tried taking it off, pressing buttons, turned it off and on (which was extremely hard with the screen acting up) and even doing factory data reset, since I thought I didn't set it up correctly. After trying all of this I decided to give up and I will be returning. The only thing I liked about this smart watch was the size and feel. I really wanted to love this thing but I guess it's not for me.<br/>Ps. I uploaded a video of my screen acting up so you guys can see what I mean.
 I wanted to like this so much. It's a beautiful watch, and the screen is perfect. But it won't stay connected and won't sync. This completely defeats the purpose of having a smart watch. I've tried every trick I've seen and for months I continue to have this problem with my Samsung Galaxy note 8. I bought this shortly after release. I've been a loyal Fitbit customer since 2011/2012, and this is my 4th Fitbit, and likely my last. I kept hoping that the sync issues would resolve after release, but they just haven't. Sorry Fitbit, it's been a good run, but I'm going to get a Samsung watch at some point instead.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa!!!! It's cute, comfortable, battery lasts me about 5-6 days and I use it alot! Tracks my bpm (heart beats per minute) my steps, my burned calories, my sleeping cycle. And for women it has the option to track the femenine cycle as well, which is nice! I can read my texts and emails from my wrist, and reply from the watch  too. Its nice when your phone is all the way  at the bottom of your purse or if your hands are full, you can just look at your wrist. You can also customize it with different brands and screen protectors, I wouldn't trade it for a Apple watch! I love it!
 I just received this yesterday and so far love it! I have tried other brands of smartwatch type of fitness trackers but am drawn back to Fitbit products because of the easy use of the app. Am very excited this new product came out and cannot wait to get started with the added functionality.
 The Versa was great. I loved it for 6 weeks. Then it would no longer be recognized by my phone or ipad. I tried all the suggestions that were on fitbit.com to reset it and it didn't work. Last they said try the factory reset, I did and now the watch is stuck on the welcome screen telling me to download the fitbit app, and the phone with a newly installed fitbit app is stuck searching for the versa. So not only did it not work now the watch is useless because I can't return it right now. Oh well those 200$ were fun for 6 weeks of exercise tracking. I would give the Versa a 5 star review if it weren't for what is going on right now. And if it can be fixed somehow I would still give the watch a 5 star because it was great for tracking runs, weights, swimming, hockey, surfing, and well anything you could think of. But since the watch is slowly dying on the charger looking for the phone and the phone is looking for the watch, I have to give it a 1 since it isn't working.
 I really love my Fitbit!! Does everything I want it to....<br/>Pro (for me): it is slimmer than other models out there and my biggest thing was seeing the whole text message, as I am a nurse and cannot be on my phone during clinic. But I am able to see what is going on when my 15 year old messages me ❤️<br/><br/>Con:  I thought people we exaggerating when they said the band is difficult to get back on... if your not a astrophysicist you may have difficulties getting it on!! It is super frustrating and looks like I am just going to stay with what’s on here.
 I my biggest pro for this watch is that it is water resistant up to 50 m. It's sleek, nice, sits flat on my wrist, and I love the new clock faces to choose from. The battery definitely lasts for 4+ days. My biggest con is that it says I've climbed more floors of stairs than I actually have. The steps seem fairly accurate compared to my old Fitbit Blaze, but the floors isn't accurate. Perhaps that's just mine. Currently it says I've climbed 1 floor, but I haven't even left my apartment yet so there are no stairs for me to climb. Overall, great product that can do a lot.<br/><br/>However, I watched and read a lot of reviews before I bought it and people were complaining it doesn't have integrated GPS. Frankly, that's the point. That's why the price is $100 cheaper than the Ionic. If you want the GPS, go for the Ionic. I'm never without my phone so I wanted the cheaper watch.<br/><br/>Update: after a few weeks of wear I've noticed my previous complaint about the floors climbed counter being inaccurate has fixed itself. It seems it just needed some time I guess. The floors have adjusted and is much more accurate.
 First one the battery only lasted 48 hours and dropped to 24 hours after a firmware update. Fitbit sent me new one (watch face only) And I didn’t have to mail them my first one. The new one works perfectly (battery lasts 4 days) after 96 hours it had 5% charge left<br/>I had originally gotten the charge 2, but decided I wanted the versa so I could swim with it and sold the charge 2 off to a family member. The versa fits and feels better on my wrist. The larger face allows me to see all my states without going through the menu. Only down side now that I got my replacement is 4 day battery vs 5 day battery.
 When it works, I like it.  The manual screen waking function is faulty- so even though I have it on manual, it constantly lights up.  Therefore, I can’t wear it to track my sleep because it’s brightness is distracting.<br/><br/>It doesn’t connect to the app half the time.  It just suddenly stops and then I have to remove the Versa and add it back- a huge pain.  Oftentimes I have to attempt two or three times to even get it to sync with my Versa.<br/><br/>Today, after 4 attempts, I gave up.  It’s such a waste of time and effort.<br/><br/>Save your $200.
 Good:<br/><br/>- beautiful and comfortable. It looks really nice and you don’t feel a thing on your wrist which matters a lot to me<br/>- watchfaces are nice. Many are paid but a lot cool faces are free too.<br/>- awesome tracker as usual with fitbit products<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- for $200+ you’d want something smarter. I don’t mind about just getting notifications, but for some people who want to do some quick replies, only android-supported is a downside.<br/>- apps are super limited, well I can’t expect too much for a smart watch, it’s not a phone anw. We’re not there yet.<br/>- what’s the point of supporting music playing if it’s such a hassle to transfer music to the device. I could never get it work. And for some people who claimed to have been able to do it, they said it took like 45-60 mins to transfer some 30-60 songs ??!! You’re kidding, right?<br/>- and if i have to bring my phone to connect to gps for a run I’d just listen to music from my phone. Some claimed to listen to music from the watch while driving, seriously, why not from your phone? The use case scenario is absurd.<br/>- the software is extremely buggy. Try changing the watchface. You select a watchface, it’s installing, you press going back to ser more watchfaces. If you press too strong, the app brings you right out of the watchface gallery. And sometimes the install process is also interrupted and you end up seeing a distorted clock on your versa. This is just a minor issue though, just reinstall.<br/><br/>In a sum, an awesome fitness tracker disguised as a beautiful watch, but totally not worth $200. I love it a lot but I’m returning. I think they should totally remove the music thing, make it a nicer version of charge 2 and price it around $100.
 02/21/19- UPDATE: So the screen has gone completely out and I was having to charge the battery every day. If I didn't, it would die within a 1.5 days. Usually in the middle of my work day. I called Fitbit directly and they offered me 1. $50 toward the purchase of a different watch or 2. Replace the watch. I chose option 2. I'm not sure if it's being replaced w/ a refurbished or new. I haven't even had the watch 2 months, it would be a unfair to replace with a refurbished, but what can you do . I like that they offered me a replacement, but I think offering only $50 towards the purchase of a different watch is kind of sad. If I would have opted to go with the Ionic (comparable to versa) $269 + $180 I paid for the versa special edition (on sale)- $50 credit (not including tax) $399. 4 stars for Fitbit customer service fro replacing the watch, -1 star for that crappy offer of $50 credit. Rating drops to 1 star for a watch retailing at $230 and it didn't even last 2 months.  I will update after I've  had the replacement a while.<br/><br/>I've been very happy until the past 2 weeks. I've noticed I went from charging the watch every 3 to 3 1/2 days to every 2 days, now it will only last 1 1/2 days. Then today the screen went out came back on, then there were a bunch of lines, it went blank, then the picture came back but it was squished. I couldn't turn it off or do anything. Then the screen just kept switching to different stuff but it was distorted. Eventually I was able to get the s screen to turn off but every time I pressed the left button it was just a distorted view w/ lines. It wouldn't turn on then I turned my wrist, like it usually does. I don't shower with it or get it wet. I honestly only use it for work.  I mainly use the watch/second hand, timer, alarm, and calendar features for work but not on a daily basis. I have a bumper and glass screen protector on it.  The screen eventually turned back to normal and it worked fine without any further incident, however, I feel that this will occur again since I'v read other reviews with the same problem. I've only had this watch for about 6 weeks but, of course, it's passed the return cut off.  :o(
 The Fitbit part of this tracker is good, just like ANY Fitbit, the special features are so far lackluster. The banks that are supported in Fitbit pay are few, so that was 30 bucks wasted (do your research first not like me). The learning curve on it is kind of steep. I have had a fitness tracker since the Jawbone Up was a thing and this is just overly complicated. You can add music to it but only connected to your computer. You can change bands on it but NOWHERE as easy as the Blaze, it is a bit finicky. I would have been better off getting the charge HR 3
 It came on time and in a great reusable box that I keep my bands in. It came with a 60% charge and it connected very quickly to my Note 8. I was worried that it would be too big and manly but it fits perfectly on my wrist, and as I use it I start to not notice it. The bands that came with it feel durable and look great. I brought my phone with me on my first few walks and it learned my stride. If you have issues with your stride not registering like you think it should, bring your phone so it can use GPS and set your stride.<br/><br/>OS:<br/>I love how it works with the app on my phone. It syncs quickly and notifications from my phone are quick most of the time. I don't tend to get notifications if I am more than a room away from my phone. but this is expected because it works off of Bluetooth.<br/><br/>Fitbit needs to address a few app issues and requests from its users, like app updates. But you will have those issues with any Fitbit.<br/><br/>If you like Fitbit you will love this upgrade.
 Just received this yesterday, so far so good. Exactly what I was wanting. I had previously purchased an Apple Watch, but honestly it was more tech than I needed, and more expensive. All I needed was a fitness tracker and social media/text notifications, which is exactly what the Versa does. Plus it’s very light, barely know I’m wearing it. Only gave it four stars due to the difficulty changing out bands, and the cheapness looking of the stock band. Other than that, it’s great! Ordered new bands off Amazon, so should make the difference.
 As a smart watch/fitness tracker, I love it. It works great and has never given me any trouble syncing with my Pixel 2 XL. It's pretty and easy to use and customize. Battery life is great.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>There is no way to protect this thing! Glass screen protectors don't adhere (one side near the bevel is just slightly less than flat), vinyl screen protectors peel off, and you can't charge it with any kind of bumper on it. (AND you can't install/remove the bumper without removing the band, which is almost as difficult as changing the band on any other watch. Those tiny pins, gah!) So I've had mine for about a month... and it now has a huge scratch, which I figured would happen.<br/><br/>I wore a Charge 2 (which has a plastic face) basically 24/7/365 for almost two years, and it never got anything more than just very fine superficial scratches. I hoped that since glass is (theoretically) more scratch resistant than plastic, I would be OK with this one, but no. Gorilla Glass is trash that scratches easier than any other glass I've ever seen in my 40 years of living. My last two phones and now this watch have been scratched despite my always being very gentle with them. I've never had another watch (or phone) end up with these kinds of scratches.<br/><br/>So factor into your purchasing decision the fact that the glass WILL get scratched (or shattered, depending on your life choices). If that's not a big deal, by all means, buy this.
 The company I work for has a way to connect fitbit to track steps and there are prizes if you hit your steps.  So I looked around for awhile to see which fitbit would be best fitted for me and what I'm wanting to do.  So I took the plunge and got the Versa, and I'm in love.<br/>I was worried at first because it isn't technically waterproof, but I work in a hospital and seems to do well with the amount of handwashing I do.  I wouldn't shower with it on or go swimming.<br/>In my opinion I have made an excellent choice.
 So far I enjoy the feel of the band and watch backing as both fade away from thought quickly (something I prefer in all wearables). The weight isn't noticeable and though I do have larger arms and wrists I believe this would be true for smaller individuals as well. The glass smudges from regular use as all glass does, but it isn't easily visible unless you're looking for smudges dead on as they are mostly invisible from other angles.<br/><br/>The sensor suite appears to be accurate, and with some adjustment to the sleep detection works well. I had to change the detected range to match my actual bed time, as it detected only one hour. After adjusting the range I was able to see that it had indeed collected the data but hadn't shown it due to the required adjustment.<br/><br/>NFC has been a mixed bag for me so far. As far as Fitbit-Pay, I'm not happy that my bank card (and it seems most small/medium size banks) isn't supported so that feature is useless. As a developer I may find uses for the NFC otherwise, but that was the major reason for getting the special edition which is, at least for now, moot.<br/><br/>Some watch faces seem to be trials with ransomware-like hostage situations after a number of days, requiring you to enter a code after making payments on some rando website. What is worse is the layout of the store caused me to believe I was installing an official (an official-looking) watch face only to fall victim to one of these until I could change the face with my phone. I'm not terribly entertained by the layout of the store now as one could imagine.<br/><br/>Apps are sparse at the moment, and there is no music player for Spotify which is disappointing. They seem invested in Pandora and Deezer, so if you're not interested in those and using it as a music player while you run is a deal breaker then you may want to avoid it.
 I have had this watch since July, 2018.  After only 3+ months the battery drains within 6-8 hours and shuts off.  I did a factory shut down a few times but the light never goes off until it dies.  I don't see any  warranty information but you would think after paying $200 it would have some kind of warranty.  I did love this watch and bought a few bands and a protective glass for the front.  Spent a lot of money for something that is practically useless.  I don't see anywhere on this website to contact customer service.  Save your money!!!!
 If I could give this watch zero stars I would. I bought this watch since I am a running and wanted a gps running watch. I did my research, this watch had everything I needed and more. I talked to others who had one. To be favor, the person who convinced me did not use it for running. Everything was great at first but then 6 weeks in my watch face would not come on unless I touched multiple times in a row. No problem, I can live with that. A week later all my runs would stop at the 1 mile mark. I called support. They had me do several different things. At one point the lady messed my watch up so much it stopped connecting at all to my phone so we had to do a factory reset. Fine, whatever it takes so I can use my watch again. Still no luck. Watch stopped at 1 mile again. I went on line and found that this is a  dry common problem. I did what others had done. I turned my WiFi off and when I am running I have to have my watch face up and i have to actually see it roll over from .99 miles to 1 mile. This works when I am on a familiar route but when I run a different route and am not sure when I hit the 1 mile mark it will stop at 1 mile. I explained this to their customer service and they told me “great, I’m glad you resolved the problem”. No this is not resolved. I was told that I should just manually put in my runs. Why would I have spent all this money on a watch that I have to manually enter my data, I wanted one that did it for me. Customer service told me today they can not help me any more. No resolution, no new watch, no money back. Nothing, no help at all.
 Bought this in April, it was ok not at all what I expected, hoped for more features, better exercise tracking. Then on Aug 5th it just stopped working, had half a charge, screen went black, wouldn't turn on or factor reset. Contacted fitbit, after some run around they finally told me I could mail it in and I would get a replacement. I mailed it in on Aug 7th, still not back to them yet (Aug 14th), checked in on the process and they said well after we get it we will take a look at it and that can take another 5-7 days (week days)  until we will consider shipping a replacement and then it will take an additional 5-10 days (weekdays) to ship. So I'm in limbo and they are going to waste over a month of my time to possibly get a replacement??? It's there defective product - Looking at the Fitbit site there have been multiple complaints about this same issue I had with my versa.  Very disappointed in the product and the service
 The tracker itself is very nice.  Very comfortable to wear and offers great value.  The sync software is unusable.  I spent HOURS per week trying to sync.  If you put the fitbit app on your phone, it works well, but it eats 20% of your battery in a typical 18-hour day.  If you put it on Windows, it will sync once or twice, then fail completely and you have to remove the device and re-pair, which takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours.  I've tried 3 different Windows machines, so it's a pervasive issue.  The fitbit forums have hundreds of similar complaints.  Take a minute to read them before you purchase.<br/><br/>If fitbit is able to fix the software/firmware down the road to the point it works, I will happily change this review because the tracker itself is very nice.
 The #1 reason I purchased the Versa is to workout without bringing my phone. I use bluetooth Bose headphones and the music is constantly skipping. You would have to walk with your hand at a right angle and look like a robot for this to work properly. Very disappointed. Additionally the app with this version of the phone is not as seamless as the Fitbit Blaze. If you are shopping for smart watches I would look somewhere else.
 I had some problems with this product initially. It gave me weird pain in my wrist but once I turned off the continuous synching with my phone, the pain stopped. Ive also had some issues that it will count steps if Im in a car on a bumpy road (maybe this could be solved with a feature that can turn steps off for some time or the fit bit being able to detect when youre in a car) I really like the sleeping and exercising features. You can download apps onto the watch but there isnt many apps to chose from and the ones I have downloaded I have never used except for “flashlight”. If you are just wanting something to track sleep, exercise , steps you are probably better off to pay less and get the fitbit charge.<br/><br/>Also the period tracking feature I found was worse than period tracking using any app on the iphone, as if I changed when I got my period it would continue to predict I would get my period a week later..... Which I dont obviously.
 I was so disappointed to discover after I bought the Versa that Fitbit has pervasive sync issues with this model.  I don't know if it's with all smart phones, Androids, or just Samsung S8.  I'll be sticking with my Alta HR which works seamlessly.  I'm bummed to not be able to to upgrade, but I'd rather sacrifice functionality for reliability.
 Last month, I started to get serious about working out and tracking my workouts and daily activity. It worked for a while, but it was very hard to do by hand. I started doing research on different types of electric trackers, mainly fitness watches. I reached out to a good friend of mine, who has been training very intensely for the last couple of years, to see how he liked his Fitbit Versa. He said how it helped him throughout his training as much as anything else. I was skeptical that if someone much more serious and intense about working out used it, maybe it wasn’t for me. I ended up going with the Versa and realized something very quickly. This is a fitness tracker for anyone, no matter their exercise experience level. It worked perfectly for me, a relative beginner, and my friend, a very experienced athlete.<br/><br/>Upon getting the device, you are required to download the Fitbit App, which makes the connection between the watch and your smartphone seamless. The watch, which continuously monitors step count, calories burned for the day, and heart rate will send that information to the phone through the phones Bluetooth. Upon starting a workout, you can set the Fitbit into “Workout Mode” which has built in tracking of swimming, running, walking, weight lifting, and elliptical. You can also download other work out types to track really any type of work out being done.<br/><br/>If the Fitbit was just a fitness tracker, it would still be a great piece of equipment. It’s simple but effective use is as good as I’ve seen. However, the device is a lot more than just the fitness tracker though; the Fitbit is also a smart watch. Similar to competing products like the Apple Watch, or OS by Google, the Fitbit Versa gives you notifications such as text messages, phone calls, emails or even Facebook notifications. The versa isn’t as capable as other smart watches, namely the Apple Watches ability to use SIRI or have built in GPS, but the price point, about $150 less, makes the versa a much more affordable option. Recent updates have already closed the gap between the other smart watches. Now you can control music playing apps, such as Spotify through the watch. Uber, the ride sharing service, has also released a Fitbit app.<br/><br/>Overall, the Fitbit Versa is a great fitness tracker for any level of training with constant monitoring, programmable workout tracking, and an easy app to navigate. It’s also a more affordable smart watch with almost all the notifications and abilities of a much more expensive option. I’m very excited to keep using my Fitbit Versa and see what new updates and applications they can come out with!
 I love this fit bit! It keeps track of so many things and gives you reminders to move your ass. :-) I would recommend this to anybody
 I am a dedicated runner so I want to use the Versa for running stats.  The key phrase here is "I want to".  Unfortunately connectivity issues have prevented the Versa from being a reliable fitness device.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>The Versa is a great size and very comfortable.  Coming from Wear OS devices, it took a minute to figure out how to get around the Versa's screens, however, I got comfortable quickly.  I like the use of the hardware buttons as alternatives to screen taps while in exercise mode.  The Versa's price is a pro.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>The first issue I have with the Versa is there is no way to adjust the text size of notifications.  I am able to read them but it would be much easier if I could increase the size just a bit.  Speaking of notifications, when the Versa is able to maintain connectivity to my phone (LG V20), they work great.  Unfortunately, the Versa cannot seem to maintain connectivity.  I have to reboot my phone in order to get notifications working again.  The Versa always loses connectivity following exercise tracking.<br/><br/>Now the most frustrating issue...I am an avid runner and was really eager to use the Versa to track my miles.  Sadly, the Versa has been a complete failure in this regard.  Because it does not have its own GPS, the Versa relies on a phone's GPS sensor.  When I start tracking a run, the Versa connects to my phone's GPS and displays the distance I've completed.  Within 5-10 minutes, the Versa loses the connection and displays "Connecting..." where my distance should be.  It might reconnect for a few minutes during the run, it might not.  During my first marathon (Jan 2019), I  noticed the Versa had not successfully connected to my phone's GPS so I rebooted the phone.  I was happy to see the Versa connected but was disappointed again after about a mile.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The only thing I can think of is the Versa is not fully compatible with the LG V20.  Before buying the Versa, I used FitBit's Charge 2 HR with my V20 with great success.  Believing the Versa to be an upgrade, I had no reason to believe it would have trouble with my phone.  I wish I'd known about and checked Fitbit's compatible device list before purchasing the Versa.  Hopefully this review will prevent others from making the same mistake.
 Bought one of these for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas figuring it would be cool to get a smart watch that looked kinda like an Apple Watch and tracked her fitness. We could not even create a profile/account for her bc Fitbit has taken it upon themselves to make parental judgements. According to Fitbit, you have to be at least 15 years old to have a versa. They only have one band they deem appropriate for kids. Even after we decided to lie about her age to create her account, we could not sync the Fitbit to her iPod. When we looked it up there was a whole message board dedicated to the versa iOS issues.  The whole set up process was a nightmare and we decided it was entirely foo much trouble. We returned it and got her a first gen Apple Watch.
 This watch is ok for just a modern looking watch. It feels alright on the wrist and you can personalize the clock face (and I use the stopwatch on it for intervals)... that's about it for the positives. The second week I had it there was a firmware update and it wouldn't update and left like a loading symbol on the watch to which I had to get it replaced. Then I wore it for a 5k race to help keep my pace - pointless. When I finished the race it said I had only ran 2.6 miles. The amount of calories burnt of you look at a workout is inaccurate. It's really just not good watch if you need to measure any parts of your workout or runs. So overall I'm a little disappointed but at least it functions as a watch and looks kinda cool. Would not reccomend.
 Looks and feels good on my wrist. Functions well and has alot of options to taylor the tracker to your liking. It does receive phone call notifications but I haven't been able to receive texts or calendar notifications?????
 This is my first fitness or smart watch and I would say it doesn't disappoint at all. If you are on the look for a fitness tracker/ text and call notification watch look no further. Note this is not like an apple or samsung watch you cannot makes calls or texts and do all those fancy things on it so keep that in mind. As a simple fitness tracker where your able to see all your data on the watch and see your texts and calls as you receive them it is worth every penny. Nice basic fitness watch!
 Upgraded to the versa from having a blaze for a few years. Lots of fun features, overall totally great.  My only con causing one star lower of a rating is that the alarms and notifications appear to be buggy for now.  I have 3 daily alarms and many times they do not go off at all.  Text notifications and email come through at random as well, missing many.  Happy to up the stars if the issue is ever fixed.
 Great hardware. Great watch. Terrible time trying to transfer music to it. Any song over 5 min in length freezes the desktop app and the overall system is not user friendly at all.
 I'll give this 5 stars one I figure out why it has issues syncing. Having worn a FITBIT One for the past 6 years, it was time to upgrade as my One died peacefully while we slept. So many features that I still have to learn, but I LOVE how you can personalize it to your own style. You can also store up to 300 songs in the watch so you don't have to carry your phone during a workout.
 Definitely worth the investment, I take it swimming, walking, running, biking, you name it. If you wear it semi-loosely, after a few days you will get used to it and never have to take it off. It beats the Apple watch in my opinion, is cheaper, and does everything the same.
 Great screen, fits my wrist comfortably and the same great Fitbit software!
 I've had the Versa for about 4-6 months now.  At first I was so happy with it, however lately the battery drains like a hose.<br/>I charge it to 100% on an afternoon, and the next morning its already at 50%. I really expected better from FITBIT, considering my Blaze lasted me almost a week.
 I am an iWatch convert.  My first generation iWatch fell apart after 3 years.  I was trying to decide whether to get a new one or try a Fitbit.  The Versa has won me over.  I decided on it for a couple reasons.  1) it's way less expensive than the iWatch.  2) It's perfect for someone that wants a watch to basically use as a fitness monitor/calculator/guide and a plain ole watch.  3) It's very customizable and integrates with Loseit! which I use to track my food.  There's no ton of extra fluff like the iWatch.  You can still read text messages (although I don't think I can reply) and still get calendar notifications.  The dashboard is vast and it's easy to track water intake, monitor calorie burn throughout the day, and track steps and heart rate.  The ONLY complaint I have about this watch is it's ability to accurately gather sleep data.  Not that I am super surprised, but it doesn't regularly log my sleep.  It misses hours at a time, so it looks like I took 3 separate naps throughout the night.  The sleep application is interesting to me but certainly not a "must have." I am overall very pleased with my choice to swap from iWatch to Fitbit!
 I was really looking forward to getting this Fitbit but it doesn't work with any of my devices (Chromebook, LG cell phone or Kindle). Now I have to buy a new phone just to be able to use it. I'm not sending it back because I think I will use it but I haven't shopped for phones yet.
 This was a gift for my fiancee as an upgrade from her previous Fitbit. The quality and design makes this a viable alternative to a typical smart watch, while adding versatility for someone craving fitness tracking control. Excellent features include the ability to receive messages and emails and make pre-recorded responses. The ease of changing the look and "feel" of this watch are also available. Some of the downsides to this device are the music control features, such as the difficulty connecting with Spotify.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this device is an excellent addition to a continued fitness routine, while being sleek and sophisticated.
 I purchased this watch to replace my Samsung gear fit. I was so excite about this watch because it is so beautiful.. However there are a few things I didn't like about this watch first, HR reading was way off and since this is a fitness tracker that is a mayor flaw, I compared the fitbit vs samsung and pulse oxymeter, both samsung and Pulse Oxymeter HR read around 55bpm but the Fitbit read 112bpm, Second I can't control my music player with this watch, I tried every single thing and I couldn't figure it out.  And last one that fitbit doesn't have a function to locate your phone. I really wanted to like this watch but to me it doesn't live to its expectations. I'll be waiting for samsung to create a beautiful watch like this one.
 The fit bit versa is a really nice watch by itself but if you try to take off the band and put another band on, what a nightmare!  it is almost impossible to change the bands I do not recommend  this product  I called Fitbit to try to get my money back after owning their fit bit versa for three months and they told me that they will not take it back! how disappointing.  My fingers are sore from trying to put that damn band on.
 It’s awesome. Had the fitbit Alta which broke few days back, so it’s a big jump for me. Didn’t want a smartwatch as I prefer my phone to do the job and not a smartwatch to do the same stuff. It’s  annoying enough to have my phone vibrate most times. Display of Versa is sleek. The battery life is great. Have been using for last 3 days and it’s at 40%. It claims to last for 4 days but I think it will last longer. The feel of the watch in my wrist is great. It’s light, smooth and doesn’t irritate. I like the different exercise modes. Records various activities. Has pandora and dezee for music but you need premium account to play from Versa. Haven’t tried to swim but am sure it works in water. Overall, for $200 it’s a great deal. Does what it needs to with a fantastic display.
 Love the color, the band is amazing you can't even tell you have it on it's so light and soft.  The features are decent, I wish it had a speaker so you could listen to your downloaded music with out Bluetooth headphones. The text feature is ok nothing special at all.
 I had the Charge 2 previously and liked it. When it died I almost got another one, but the Versa’s water resistance and functionality were appealing, so spent a few more $ to get it. Setup takes a while no doubt, but once done I’ve found it to be excellent. It’s comfortable, I downloaded a cool display, it seems to track sleep and count steps and measure heart rate like the Charge, and it has a lot more to play with when I’m ready. I have been a bit ill, so serious workouts will commence again next week. Time will tell, but so far so good. Note: I got a protective cover for it after reading about cracked displays etc. and it doesn’t get in the way at all and gives me good peace of mind for all of $10.
 I've had the watch for a few days now, and I'm hooked! I'm not super into the music/app aspect, so I've not ventured much into that, but the fitness tracking aspect has been great. I'd honestly do 4.5 stars if it was an option.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - HR monitor is extremely accurate (even in water)<br/>  - Water proof thus far (see picture)<br/>  - Sleep schedule can be changed to reflect a night shifter's schedule<br/>  - Very slim fit, doesn't get hung up or caught on things from being bulky<br/>  - Lots of free clock face customizations<br/>  - Big fan of the alarms/timers<br/>  - Easy to use with quick setup<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - Because it uses your phone's GPS, you have to remember to disconnect from WiFi before doing any runs near your local router. The first time I forgot, I missed out on a quarter mile during the phone's attempts to connect to the WiFi.<br/>  - Step counter can be tricked. I wear the watch on my dominant arm because I like to see my tattoos on the non-dominant; added 200 steps while brushing my teeth<br/>  - Hourly prompting to be active is not conducive to night shift schedule. Has to be daytime hours.
 I like the watch it works well. The biggest con is that the crystal chips easily. I put a protector on the face to protect it from scratches but the edges are already chipped in several places. They should provide you with something to protect the edges. I am probably going to order another one that I will not wear for everyday because I do like the watch a lot.
 I finally broke down and bought myself a Fitbit and I love it!<br/>If you find yourself struggling with motivation to get up and get moving, this will definitely be worth spending on.<br/>I have DVD's of all sorts and not to mention equipment hoping it would motivate me, it did, for a while.<br/>Wearing my Fitbit Versa on a daily basis and keeping it charged has definitely been the most recent greatest purchase I've made.  It also helps that I am to begin with a watch person so my Fitbit elimate wearing my watch as well.
 I've been a Fitbit wearer for several years and have never had any problems.  The Fitbit versa got great reviews and it had functions that I wanted. After getting it synced it worked as expected. But everyday I had to logged out of my account log back in, turn off blue tooth and turn off GPS and turn them back on to get it to sync.  Sometimes I had to do this 3 or more times a day.  It turns out this is a known problem and Fitbit isn't doing anything about it. The sync issue is on both android and iPhones.  The warranty doesn't cover software issues. The Fitbit versa is not what it is advertised to be, it is certainly not smart, syncing is the main function of a smart watch. I would not recommend this watch.
 I was hesitant to order the special edition of this watch. But after ordering it and receiving, I've fallen in love! Not only does it have Fitbit pay, but it also has quick responses for text messages! Very satisfied with the coloring and the fit.
 Loving this Fitbit. My last one was a Charge HR 2 and  I decided to upgrade when it broke. I've been looking at different smart watch style fitness trackers, and decided on the Versa. I love it! It looks chic and its easy to use and figure out. I have worn it swimming in a lake and it works! I'm super excited about the waterproof and lap tracking technology.<br/>The Ionic is $100 more than the Versa, and the ONLY difference (besides appearance) is that the Ionic has built in GPS capabilities, but since my phone is on or near me at all times, Id rather save the $100 and use my phone's gps.
 love my Versa...like I can set up different faces on it..I like that it tracks my heart rate....links it to my Starbucks card... and  has weather information...only thing I do not like about it is that it was difficult to set up and should not have been ...there were no real instructions on how to do things...and I have had to dig around to look for information on Ytube and other resources....I was not happy about that...I am sure this watch could do so much more but I have not been able to figure out how to set up the apps and have sort of given up...
 About a year ago, I bought my first Fitbit Versa.  They have made the watch easy to use.  I really do love how they have the screens set up in such a way that it is effortless to get to data I want to see (ie: number of steps, heart rate, etc).  I like the look of the watch and it wears great on my wrist with replacement wrist bands.  That is all the good I can say about the watch itself.<br/><br/>As I said, I love the functionality of the watch, but that is worthless to me if the watch won't stay running for more than 4 months.  I am still in my 1 year warranty period, and on my third replacement watch.  The first two had battery issues (not minor ones, both went less than a day before one gave up all together), and the last one just gave me a dark screen in the end with a hint of gray (nothing readable or usable).  The first I could chalk up to things just happen, but three???<br/><br/>I am not a fitness geek.  I have not exercised regularly like I should.  I have not gone swimming or gotten any of the three watches wet.  I am 55 years old and not doing anything in my life that would stress the watches in any way (web developer by trade).  My impression of them is that they are just cheaply built.<br/><br/>My wife has a Fibit Charge and it had no issues until I accidentally put it in the washer.  My bad.  It no longer works of course.
 I’ve been wearing one for about 2 months now every day and I love it. I love how much info it tracks and how long the battery lasts! Sure, you can’t send texts from it but when you get most every other smartwatch feature you would expect -and- 4 to 5 days of battery life I can’t see a reason for complaint.<br/><br/>Update: Several months in and I still love it.
 Bought for my husband, who was convinced he did not need it. Two weeks in and he was hooked. He loves showing me how many steps he has achieved in his day to day work around our place. He tracks his heart rate and sleep. His step count gives him a sense of accomplishment, especially since he is retired and not as active as he once was. He likes the "reminder to move" that gets him up and off the computer...and the 8000 step "Party on the Arm" is a great motivator. Great product.
 WOW... Fitbit hit it out of the park with the VERSA!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
 Love it - So at first I had issues with completing the firmware update / initial set up it was taking forever and not completing...  I ended up having to place my phone and the versa right next to my wifi hub. As soon as I did the setup was completed quickly and w/ no issues. Otherwise the versa has worked as described. I have changed the clock face with no issues multiple times. I have done several work outs which it tracked just fine very similar to my old charge 2 hr. I love that the vibration has adjustable setting and is stronger than my old fitbit. what else... bands... :-( seriously changing the bands is a pain... luckily i will not be doing that again... but if that is important to you....it is something to consider..
 As a loyal Fitbit user over the last 5 years I've been sure to keep up with the changes.  From the Fitbit Charge to the HR to the Blaze and now the Versa it's been a steady progression of positive improvements.<br/>I do, however,  always get a replacement band upon initial purchase as my skin has had an allergic reaction to whatever Fitbit uses for wristband materials from day one.
 Nice watch. Best looking smartwatch I've encountered.  Reminds me of the Pebble, which I own two, but nicer smoother lines.  Wish it was WearOS, because I like apps better.  Sensors seem really good. Apps are almost all fitness, which is a secondary purpose for me. Hope general apps library grows.  Battery is good though not as many days as my Pebbles have me. 3 or 4 days for Versa.  Fitbit is helping former Pebble owners by helping with Rebbke Which impressed me. So I decided to try the Versa. Good watch. Needs more general apps though. Well made.
 I like the size of the face. I don't like the band it is too stiff. It needs to come with a more flexible band. As for sound there isn't any that I know of. However, mine in less than a month is being replaced by Fitbit. It stopped recording and wasn't staying charged. They said something about it being on a loop whatever that means.  Fitbit is however replacing it free of charge. I was using it to track by blood pressure,  sleep, exercise,  and anything else it could do. I got the replacement and finally got it working. I  am still getting use to it and finding out everything it does.
 Only had it for a day, but I'm loving it. It's not heavy or bulky and does a lot for it's size. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was bacause I wish there were more options in Apps for music; I'm hoping that changes in time. I've also been fighting with syncing it to my phone, either with notifications or bluetooth. Not sure if it's me, my phone, or the Versa but it's been annoying regardless. Again, haven't had it for very long, I still have a lot to learn on it and to play with. Overall though I really like it!
 I bought the Versa thinking that for the price it we would be amazing.  The idea of being able to have music right on it to use with Bluetooth headphones was awesome.  It meant not having to carry around my bulky phone when I went for a walk or to work out. I've given it a week and after it giving me numerous misreads it's going back! I work on the first floor and yet it keeps giving me 10 to 20 floors per day..um no. It gave me 72 floors on a drive yesterday. I put music on it and was off only to find out if I didn't literally hold my arm up by the bluetooth headphones, the music cut in and out and no it's not the headphones they work great with my phone. I only give it 2 stars because it's pretty, light and I could use my Starbucks card right from it. I'm going back to a regular fitbit. The frustration us not worth t by the price.
 First, what I love most about this watch is that you can swim and shower with it.  Second, I love that the charge lasts for days.  And, third the price is great considering all you are getting in this watch.  The only thing you can't do with it is use it in place of your cell phone.  Also, it doesn't have the really cool and colorful watch faces you will find on the iwatch.  But the other pluses are (to me) well worth the trade off.  It works like a charm.  Keeps accurate time.  Very user friendly.  Can take some knocking around.
 I bought this for my husband for Father’s Day and he liked it so much I ended up buying the rose gold one for myself! I love the large touch screen. This watch makes exercising fun and makes me want to get up and move more when I’m at work at the office.
 I bought on May 2018, and now Dec 2018, my versa battery does not last 'day time'.<br/>Now I take 100% charged Versa in the morning, and wear it all day and come home, already dead. sad.<br/><br/>UPDATES: So I totally gave up on this, and not used for 1-2 mon, and one day I charged and turned on 1/21/2019, (since I was going to have fitbit tech support to diagnose), and found the system update, and installed the updates. Now it is much better! I also selected not-to synch all the time for now, and battery lasts days now. I'm back on wearing this, will change some more setting to see how it affects battery. (added back 2 more stars for this)
 I use this watch everyday. The only time I take it off is when I'm in the shower and it charges during that time. I've used it swimming, intervals, walks, weights, cardio.  I love it. Wish I would have got a screen protector right away because I have a huge scratch in the middle now. You don't realize how much your wrist is touching things unto you have a watch on. I never used to wear a watch daily. The female health tracking app isn't that great so I've stored using it. I also haven't had a period in over a year because my baby is 9 months old. That's all it tracks. If it were tracking more in depth fertility symptoms (bbt, cm, and more physical and emotional symptoms) I would use it more regularly. Bbt and cm tells me where I'm at in cycle even without a period. I have had some trouble getting the notifications to work from Samsung s6. Had to switch my messaging app to default instead of message+ which I think is better. For some reason versa doesn't support message + well. There have been a handful of time that sleep want measured accurately. Otherwise I love it. I wish there were more apps for it. Most apps require you to still use your phone which is annoying (like female tracking for example.  It's basically just there to notify you but you can't track symptoms from your wrist.) You can't input water intake from wrist. Overall I love it. Can be better and look forward to updates.
 Ive had a Fitbit Alta for five years  And just upgraded to the versa.  I returned after one day of wear.  According to my new Fitbit I logged 30 flights of stairs in one day and my heart rate fluctuated between 80-140 while watching tv.  I earned 3 Fitbit badges in a few hours?  Defective Fitbit or extremely expensive watch.
 I but things based on their reliability. If a product is not reliable then I do not buy it or if already bought I wont use it.<br/>Bought Versa a month before with high hopes.<br/>Planned a short vacation to Vegas for 2.5 days and charged versa 100% before leaving home. Of course, did not take charger thinking it will last at least for 3 days.<br/>Very next morning, it wont start as battery was already DEAD!!!! Kept Versa in my bag and brought it home dead and then put it on ventilator to infuse life!!!<br/>Nor reliable at all.
 Had been what i was looking for. I gifted myself this for my birthday.<br/>Battery lasts around 4 plus days.<br/>its light weight and sleek.
 So, I wanted to wait a few months before I wrote a review so that I could truly give an honest review. I had the original fit bit charge before purchasing my fit bit versa. I had the charge for several years and wore it religiously. So a few months ago when it died, I knew I had to find something new ASAP. After researching a bit I narrowed my search between the Apple Watch and Fit Bit Versa. I had a few items I knew I needed to have in my next fitness tracker. I wanted it to track my activity, alert me to incoming phone calls, track my heart rate and activity, track my sleep and it had to be water resistant. Affordability was important but not a necessity. After comparing the two watches I finally settled on the versa. It definitely is not perfect and it does have a few flaws like low battery life, missed notification, and the watch bands are genuinely as hard to change as people lead you to believe! All in all in happy with my choice. It does what I need. Maybe not always, but I usually always have my phone, so I can get notifications there.
 I bought this after my Fitbit Blaze got stolen in Las Vegas, and while I was initially upset - I am amazed at this watch! It is a definite upgrade! I have taken this swimming, to the gym, and wear it during everyday life; it is not only more comfortable than the Blaze, but the size makes it easier to wear with any outfit and any activity. The battery life is phenomenal as well, after the initial charge this easily lasts me 4-5 days without needing to be plugged in. I'm impressed!
 I upgraded from the Charge 2 to the Versa. I'm amazed at the much improved screen visibility, my biggest complaint with the Charge 2. Even in bright sun it is easy to read. Functions as advertised with the exception of battery life. I need to recharge after 21/2 days.
 This is my second smartwatch and I am loving it!  I was waiting for Apple to make a lighter, thinner watch with more battery life, but I took the plunge with this one and I couldn't be happier.  It is terrific with exercise encouragement and tracking.  The Fitbit food tracker is not the best I've used, but better than most. Definitely recommended!
 Love this.
 I absolutely LOVE the Versa! I came back to having a FitBit after trying the Samsung S3 smart watch. The Versa dominates it! The battery life is awesome and it's super light weight. Another great feature is the ability to change the watch face design through the app. So cool. I highly recommend it!
 Upgraded from Fitbit Charge HR. Wanted the sleep stages measurement. Got that, and it was totally worth the upgrade cost. In addition delighted by: (1) Versa's stand alone functionality. Recording exercise start/stop directly from the watch is awesome. (2) apps on a watch are just as good as apps on phones ... but, where is the flashlight app ... Doh????? (3) countdown timer/stopwatch is so slick and simple, made me do a backflip, (4) hourly reminders ... caused me to discover that it takes 3 minutes to traverse 4 flights of stairs, nobody knows you are gone, and this burns an extra 500 calories/day. Yes, you knew that, but I'm delighted because Versa made me discover exercise in interstitial slots of my day, (5) I dropped a paid-app's food tracking and moved my food tracking to Fitbit, and I'm delighted at how good the Android app is. Setup was simple and stress free for me. These are my impressions from the first week of daily use of the Fitbit Versa. Shout out to the Fitbit firmware, app, and web teams, you are rocking this. Illegitemi non carborundum!!!
 This watch is terrible. The last straw was when I looked at it to see what time it was, and it couldn’t even tell me that.<br/><br/>I had all of the other problems people mention, including a burned spot, or rash, on my arm that would not go away, even with daily cleaning. Changing the watch face literally takes days. I can’t believe I spent $200 on this stupid thing. Never buying another Fitbit product, hope they go bankrupt.
 I love how this Fitbit is waterproof and acts as a smart watch. All of the different clock faces you can choose from are cool as well.<br/>So the reason for the three star rating is that it was ridiculously hard to change the band on this watch. I spent well over an hour trying to get it to fit. Videos kept saying that you have to get the angle just right to make it fit. I had the correct angle, it seemed that the pin holding in the band just wasn’t clipping in like it is supposed to.<br/>In the end, after almost sending the watch back, I finally got it to snap in. I did so by putting the band in sort of backwards. I put the side with the release pin in first and then the other side of the pin I depressed the plunger with my finger and slid it into the watch and that is how I finally got it to work for me.
 Love! I had the Fitbit Blaze for the last few years and constantly ruined and replaced it due to water damage. This time I decided to go to the Versa since it's waterproof and so glad I did. Like the Blazeworh SO MUCH MORE. Love love love! Tracks my fitness, workout, steps, calories and so much more. Haven't figured out how to download music to it but I see the feature in it. Battery lasts about 5 days too, as the Blaze was only 2-3. So happy with my versa!
 i Am writing an updated review of the fit bit Versa.  Since my purchase in January, I have developed a allergic reaction to the peach band. Also the Versa has stopped monitoring my sleep.  I called the Fit Bit company to inquire if they would send me a different band.  I received a email response from them and their only option was to refund my money.  I have enjoyed the Versa except for these issues. I am disappointed that the only option from the company is to return it.
 I'm sad to have to write this review, but I ordered the Fitbit Versa in October, and by December, the screen had stopped working, and then eventually, it wouldn't sync with the app.  I got a replacement, which I was happy about, it arrived in January, 6-8 weeks later, again, the display broke, this time, however, I am unable to get a replacement.  And returning the item isn't an option.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Versa-Smartwatch-Black-Black-Aluminium-One-Size-S-L-Bands-Included/dp/B07B48SQGT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Versa Smartwatch, Black/Black Aluminium, One Size (S &amp; L Bands Included)</a><br/>I've been using the fitbit versa for over a week now.<br/>Firstly I'd like to say that the fitbit is a really convenient and useful device in tracking your daily fitness routine, its software/platform is really well integrated with the watch and really easy to set up. However, the fitbit falls short of allowing you to track your exact workouts such as lifting weights. That apart a great product at a moderate pricing range as compared to the apple watch. It's really light weight and stylish and hardly feels like you're wearing it. The battery life is as promised. I've had to charge it only twice so far for over 8 days. So I'd say its a good buy but if you want to be able to track your exact workouts, then this might not be your best fit.
 This watch worked great for the first 5 months I had it. Then notifications of text call and other app notifications became intermittent. Then it completely stopped notifying me of anything. After many updates I got it back to intermittent notifications. I spent over 2 hours 2 separate times working with Fitbit “advocates” and at the end I was told they’ll try to fix it through future updates. So now I have a $250 watch that performs only one of the features that it was advertised to. It tells time. Wow thanks a lot Fitbit  My Garmin vivoactive 3 has been hiking at 11k feet, diving in Mexico , and through many structure fires and it still does exactly what it was advertised to do. Save your money and get the Garmin or Apple Watch that you were also looking at.
 My old fitbit died after 2 years of heavy use. I decided to upgrade to the Versa and the call and text noticficatons don't work with iPhone X IOS 11 or 12. After being online with support for quite sometime I was finally told it doesn't work and they are working on a fix. Well I bought this 6 weeks ago! It's never worked! I should have waited for the Charge 3. I gave it 2 stars because it's more comfortable than the charge fitbit. Anyway, I told them if they don't fix it by 10/14 I want a refund and I'm buying an Apple watch instead.<br/><br/>***Update***** It's still broken and they won't give me a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT'S TERRIBLE.
 I was skeptical of any Fitbit but after using this for a while I'm definitely a fan now. The only drawbacks I have are that the automatic turn on when flipping your wrist is a bit sketchy. I also don't feel like the footstep counter is accurate. As well you can't  read text messages on the watch but it will notify you of the message and allow an auto reply.
 I am deliriously happy with how my Versa looks, feels and performs.  The app makes everything very easy. More than satisfied!!!
 I bought this in September of 2018. I loved it. It is April 1, 2019 and it no longer is working. I wore it during the day only and at aqua aerobics, in waist high water not in deep water. I’m so disappointed. Several people have bought it on my recommendation, I feel terrible that I recommended it.
 I order this watch in May in August  the watch fell from the chair onto the floor and the screen cracked.  I called customer support to find a place to send the watch for a screen replacement and was informed there was no repair center in the US and I could not order a replacement screen.  The customer service rep then proceeded to read their canned script on why the cracked screen was not covered by warranty even though I was not asking for warranty coverage.  Too much to pay for a disposable watch.  Look for another brand
 i ordered mine on Nov. 30 it only lasted 3 months before the watch broke, i called and got a replacement sent to me which was easy, the replacement broke 4 months later. i went to sleep everything was ok woke up the next day the watch was dead, called wanted my money back, their policy is NOT to give money back all they can do is send me another watch and after that one brakes i am on my own. for something that is expensive it sure has a short shelf life. i should have bought an Apple watch.
 I replaced my Charge 2 with the Versa and so far love it.  I competitively walk marathons and I was looking for a watch that would keep my pace and distance displayed. I’m still getting used to it, but I think that the Versa will do the job. The display is large enough that I can read it comfortably (I had some difficulty with the charge 2 and it’s small display). The price was reasonable compared to the Apple Watch, and I really like the Fitbit community and platform. It’s surprisingly comfortable and light for the size. I had no trouble getting used to wearing it.  New gadgets are always fun and a motivating tool for me to get my workouts in, and staying fit is what it’s all about.
 Loved what the Versa can do. After 2 weeks the sleep data quit working. I read the internet to try to fix it but... I was so frustrated I was ready to return it. I also had to buy a new, old phone OS wasn't compatible. Thankfully Amazon give the manufacturer's phone number. I'm not the only one to have multiple problems with Versa. After 55 minutes on the phone, 20 minutes on hold Versa worked again. I'm stuck with a phone I don't want &amp; have decided to keep the Versa. Have internet close to look up problems. Frequently must turn off phone, uninstall and reinstall ...
 I order a lot from Amazon and rarely write reviews. I’m writing this one because of how concerned I was with the size of this watch vs. my wrist. I was concerned that it was going to be too big and just look plain stupid. The “can I really pull this off” question.  Well, here are the pictures. It looks and feels great. I had the Alta HR and this watch is lighter than it...plus it doesn’t snag on things because it doesn’t hang over my wrist!! Very happy with this purchase and I wanted other to rest easy about their decision. Do it...you’ll love it!
 The Versa is a great product. Does exactly what I wanted it to do and more. Awesome how it notifies you of your phones txt &amp; calls, just touch to send reply. Very easy to set up, sync, and learn. Walks you through it all via the app you down load onto your phone.<br/>The many different watch faces make it personalized. From very complex info to clock only, the options are endless. Seems frivolous to some but a wonderful feature to me. It give encouragement and reminders to hit your personal goals. Well worth the purchase!!
 I've only had it for about a week but I haven't encountered any issues. It was a day late in shipping but I didn't care much about that. It's very correct w my sleep, my steps, everything. The notifications have worked wonderfully and have really helped me keep up with the important things on my phone. It's worked perfectly and I'm sure it will continue to. Have had some issues with the bluetooth connectivity but that was because of my phone. Very easy to fix. App is super user friendly and the Fitbit itself is just very easy to use. Perfect mix between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker. I honestly cannot find a single thing wrong w it. If you can't stand the texture of rubber, I would recommend getting another band upon buying it, like I did, seeing as the original band has a rubbery texture. Worth it. Love it.
 I love my Fitbit versa. I work out several times a week and I love tracking my workout. I also like tracking my sleep and the fact that this Fitbit app also connects to other apps I use (like my fitness pal). I do have trouble with data from the Fitbit app showing in my fitness pal but I’m not sure what the issue is. Also, I like getting call, calendar, and text notifications. You can’t respond to them or answer the phone on the watch, but those weren’t features I was looking for anyway. I mainly wanted something to track workout, calories, sleep, etc. Overall, happy with the purchase and I love the watch.
 I just got my Versa yesterday and so far I absolutely love it.  It looks great, very lightweight and comfortable on my wrist.  I think the Fitbit app is amazing and love to see all the different information it provides.  The band was a little hard to change but once you get the right angle it fit perfectly and locked in.  I think the next change will go much more smoothly than the first one.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a nice hybrid between a fitness tracker and a smart watch.
 Have has watch less than six months and now won't connect to phone and won't sync.<br/>too many hoops to jump through for warranty. DO NOT BUY.
 I wish I could give it zero!! My husband and I have purchased several fitbit products through the years. In July I purchased the Fitbit Versa Smart Watch as a birthday present. He is cardiac patient and we liked the idea that it has a heart monitor that Fitbit claims is 95% accurate. While in cardiac rehab over the period of 10 weeks several nurses noticed that the fitbit and the actual monitors were wildy different (like by 70 beats a minute off). Although my husband has called Fitbit several times and has tried different solutions that they offered in the end nothing changed its performance. After several calls Fitbit acknowledged that yes, they KNOW that the feature doesn't work (although they haven't changed their advertising)  and it is well under a year old (the warranty is for a year), and that we have a receipt for purchase, in the end we are just out of luck for trusting them. They told my husband, it is a watch not a medical device...so my advice is buy a $10 watch and save yourself $190. Not only does it NOT work, Fitbit knows it does not work and Fitbit refuses to stand behind their product. What an expensive disappointment!! Buyer Beware!!
 Just received my Versa yesterday and so far, so awesome!<br/><br/>I have been a loyal Fitbit user, starting from the Charge, to the Charge 2, the Blaze, the Alta, and now my Versa. So, I'm going to give my honest thoughts because although this product is amazing, they have a ways to go.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The Versa is definitely what I'd consider to be there Blaze 2. The way the UI and interface works and the upgrades remind me so much of the Blaze. It is very easy to use and navigate. This goes for the Fitbit app and the Versa itself. I'm very impressed with the improved clarity and color range of the screen. I've heard a lot of people complain about the size of the bezels...to be honest it doesn't bother me at all. The asthetic of the Versa is clean, sleek, and understated. It's very light!! I would say that it's so light I forget I'm wearing it, but because I keep playing with it every so often, that would be a bit of a white lie. I'm sure in a week or so, once I get over there newness I'll forget it's even there. So that's a plus.<br/><br/>I have also heard people say that band changing system is difficult. As someone who had to do the same with the Blaze, I don't see that as an issue. Matter of fact, the Blaze's design made it a bit more difficult to switch bands than the Versa. That's my experience though.<br/><br/>I love the variety of clock faces! So many to choose from! And there are a bit more things to customize within the app, but that might be due to the app upgrade and not the Versa itself.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>There are only a few apps in the Fitbit app store. Be prepared for this. I'm sure with it's growing popularity, more will be added soon though.<br/><br/>The app itself is a little glitchy. I haven't experienced any issues with the watch however. But I've noticed my app will spaz whenever I had something to the Versa. Again, this might be due to the Fitbit app itself.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on battery life but I will update in a week or so.<br/><br/>My Blaze would last about 6-7 days even though it was advertised as 5. So, even keeping in mind they've advertised 4 days I will still compare the battery life to its predecessor. I will say I've used it for 24 hours and noticed only 15% decrease in batter life. Keeping to that trend, it should last almost a week but we shall see.<br/><br/>I'll update with more as I continue using it.<br/><br/>All around, great move and product from Fitbit. I'm impressed and pleasantly satisfied!
 I really like the Versa. I have previously has the One and the Alta. It comes with a learn curve, of course. I do not get great battery like because I am always checking it. I really like the fact that I do not have to take it off while washing the dishes or showering. For some reason, if I am in a rush, I forget to put it back on.
 So happy! I have had this watch for a week or so and it is prefect! I wanted a watch to have time, track my steps, and sleep. It has a very long battery life I think. I love the different clock faces, wish it showed pricing of the face without having to click on the picture. Clicking on the picture to find the price and it is not what I want to spend, going back to the main screen, starts you back at the top of the clock faces. Which leads to scrolling back down to where you were. Not a complaint, just a comment. Very happy with this purchase!
 I LOVE this Fitbit!!! I am trying to lose a few and was have a hard time tracking food and exercise when  someone suggested FB Versa to assist with those challenges.... super easy to set up and sync with my phone and easy to use..... I do not routinely wear a watch so it was a little different wearing it all day. It within a few days I was completely comfortable with it
 I had to return this product to Amazon for a refund as the screen died after a month despite much love and care rendered. Please improve your quality if you want to beat Apple, Fitbit!
 The device is supposedly a smartwatch that will sync to your phone's GPS and track your exercise and distance. It syncs to the phone, but synced to the GPS only sporadically, and stopped completely after the first software upgrade following my purchase. Some apps never worked correctly. Following the software update, basis Fitbit apps stopped working. Customer "support" confirmed that all of my settings were correct, so they had me restore the factory settings and start over. No go. Tried again. No go. So they want to replace a newly purchased watch with a factory refurbished watch. All of this in the first 42 days of ownership. TERRIBLE service, NO concept of customer care. Worst Fitbit product I have ever owned (and this is my fourth).
 Love my new Fitbit Versa! The look, size, weight, it’s all great. My only complaint is that Pandora only works with a paid account and the apps are limited. For a tracker and waterproof smart watch it is a home Run!
 It’s super light. I forget I’m even wearing it.<br/>Very easy to set up. I took it out of the box and charged it for a few minutes until it was 100% and then chose a few options and I was ready to go. Total time including charging was 45 minutes.<br/>I used to have the Charge 2 so this was an upgrade. I love that this one is swimproof!  It even recognized that I was swimming and recorded that exercise.<br/>I love my Versa and I’m happy to recommend it to others who want to be in touch with their physical fitness/activity.
 My fitbit worked fine for several months until yesterday when I tried to access my week's information in the app. It was no longer registered, and when I contacted customer service, they said that my email had never been registered. Despite sending screenshots of saved emails, they held their scripted lines that can basically be translated into "we're not taking liability for this". I had to re-register my email and reset everything, but lost all my saved data. What's the point of tracking health data if it can just be lost and then they say "But your email was never registered with us" despite me having emails and screenshots to send to them. When I asked what I can do to prevent that from happening again, their response was "it won't happen." But it did. It's cheaper to let go of the 10% of people who might experience a problem like this than actually solve them. Better hope you're not in that 10%. I had read about their terrible customer service before I bought this, but I thought I would risk it. Oops.

After I left it for a good hour to charge I turned it on and It worked after few hours the battery percentage went from 100% to 30% which is unusual, as it usually takes two days for the battery to go from 100% to 30%. I repeated the process again (charging and using it) the next day and the watch worked for less than an hour. and I did the process again for the third time and this time the watch is not giving any sign not even charging after I left it for a few hours to charge.<br/>I am really disappointed that this product could also be used in swimming but actually, it cannot survive a one hour swim on the surface of the water.
 Hubby loves it and all the options for faces.  I have a versa as well and I can’t be without it. I love how it tracks my calorie burn and heart rate through my exercise. The app that you can sync is fantastic for tracking your sleep patterns, tracking macros/calories, and the badges are fun for fitness goals and levels accomplished! The touch screen is very responsive. I haven’t used it for listening to music but someday if o buy some earbuds for workouts then I’ll check it out. I would highly recommend.
 It is missing a lot. Says it works with pandora, but can’t get it downloaded. It won’t link to my phone all of a sudden. I stopped getting notifications. While charging it said the battery was to full to download information.<br/><br/>It gets worse. Today it says I walked 11 flights of stairs. NO.  I walked up a curb once.
 I purchased my Fitbit in August and received  delivery mid September. From the very beginning I have been inundated with problems. The watch itself is beautiful, however the problems are numerous.<br/>1. Unable to sync.<br/>2. Unable to change clock faces.<br/>3. Screen freezes.<br/>4. Does not charge.<br/>5. Now the watch has completely switched off and the screen is blank. I cannot do anything with it.<br/>Please assist with the above problems. I did not have any problems with the Fitbit Surge.<br/>I await your feedback.
 I have the Fitbit Versa for about a week now and love it. I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartwatch for about a year and the battery stopped holding a charge so I thought I would try a Fitbit. I do spin class and work out so wanted to keep track of my steps, calories, and other health info. the battery really does last up to 4 days which is awesome for a smartwatch. I didn't know it monitored sleep when I bought it and it's spot-on with how many hours I sleep and what states of sleep I'm in. This is a really cool watch and half the price of Samsung smart watches or apple smart watches.
 Everything seemed fine until the 6th or 7th week when I woke to a dark screen. Thinking the FitBit had died during the night, I charged it. While on the charger it works, but once removed from the charger it will not turn on at all! It was just past the return window and the extended warranty I purchased I can't reach them to help me. At $225 bucks, I now have a watch sitting unused in a drawer! Not at all happy.
 I've had this watch for 4 days now. It is tracking my steps perfectly, my sleep pattern, my metabolic calorie burn, reminds me to meditate periodically, reminds me to move every hour so I don't stagnate, looks fantastic on my wrist, and is perfect basically. I am so glad Fitbit bought Pebble, because most of all this reminds me of my much beloved Pebble watch. Last, there's a one dollar watch face from STAR TREK that I bought, so the watch looks even more nerdy like me! :)
 Really wanted to like this watch, but it kept dropping connection with my phone even though my phone was approved to function with this device. The band was nice, the screen great, but it just did not function reliably for what I needed it to do. Returned it and will try a watch with more functions, but not likely a FitBit again.
 Worst tracker I have ever owned. Extraordinarily fragile. Cracked a corner of the screen not even knowing how, didn’t drop drop it or wipeout while wearing it. Called Fitbit and was told cosmetic damage not covered by warranty. Not even a month later the software locks up on the Fitbit logo display screen and won’t reset. Called Fitbit again and after a week of waiting to hear back I called them and was told the unrelated crack of the screen corner was the cause of the software problem and was not covered by warranty. So what exactly is this warranty for?  I’ll be purchasing a Garmin.
 Ive had my Fitbit for about month now and I love it. It's easy to understand and does what I need it to do! The only weird thing is it tries to count steps while driving and it's not really good with the sleep thing! Bit whatever it's more for nutrition and weight and time for me. I hope it lasts a long time! Oh and I'm a hairstylist....so far it's been fine in the shampoo bowls. I looked for weeks at reviews of smart watches for someone to give me that advise! I'll report back if that changes!
 I really wanted this!  Once I got it, I realized that is won't sync to my Motorola phone. It also took 3 days to set up.<br/>It is so sensitive that sitting at my desk, moving paper and working on my computer gives me over 500 steps!<br/>The main reason I bought this was the fact that I could download music on it.  Pandora downloads only 3 stations and I can't get any of my personal music downloaded.  I have found that this is a common problem.  I haven't been able to get my heart rate on the watch either.<br/>So, so far, not impressed.  Don't waste your money.  I'm going to try and return it.
 Ok so far so good I love this watch it wakes me up and I love that I can mute it to not get notifications while I’m working out now that’s a plus.UP DATE AS OF TODAY THE HEART MONITOR HAS STOPPED AND AFTER HAVING ONLY 9 months I have done everything to fix the problem I will never buy anything else from this company FITBIT ever again I spent 213.00 on this and now it’s not even worth it at all. Thanks fitnit for the a product that can’t even last a year!!!!
 This was a Birthday present which I received last April. An upgrade from the Alta,  which I never had an issue with. I've had to return the versa twice due to it not being waterproof when it clearly says it is. It even has a part where you can track your swimming. It takes two weeks for a replacement to come. Now months later I'm having an issue where it wont hold a charge. I've done every troubleshooting there is and nothing is working which means I will have to return again. Meaning this will be the 3rd time returning in a 9 month period. It hasn't even been a year and I keep having issues. I do not recommend this watch. And the customer service is the worst. They don't respond to questions in the Fitbit forum and speaking with someone over the phone is pointless. For the amount of money spent it is not worth it.
 Very easy to use. Takes about 30 mins to get it all up to date. The bands are easily able to be changed. Some people say it was hard, but I watched a YouTube video and made it super easy. I looked into getting the Apple Watch, but this made more sense for me. I get calls, texts, email and other notifications from other apps as well. It tracks all my steps and there’s tons of different clock faces to choose from. I highly recommend this!
 I’m really loving the Fitbit versa! It does so much and is perfect for my life style.
 I bought this as a gift for someone. They love it! I think it works great! I have a Apple Watch. This is not as good. It doesn’t allow the full compatibility to the phone like an Apple Watch. For the money it is almost Apple Watch territory. But it does what it says it does and well.
 Two primary reasons I purchased the Versa:  to (1) transfer my music from iTunes and to (2) track my steps/miles while on an elliptical. I confirmed both (I thought) before purchasing.<br/><br/>In fact, you can only transfer music if the source is a Mac or Windows 10 PC on the same WiFi network as the Versa. The manual clearly states it’s compatible with Windows 7/8, but in fact it is not says Fitbit tech support. Also, your outta luck if the PC is cable connected to your internet. It must be WiFi connected.<br/><br/>There’s a manual process for entering in your time on the elliptical but it’s not intuitive and much too cumbersome. The watch is mostly useless for calculating distance while on a machine, it appears.
 I purchased this mostly for the heart rate monitor and because it was waterproof. The battery life is approx 3-4 days with all of the notifications that i have running. Very happy with it.
 Since brand new, my watch does not function well to track bike trainings, with completely wrong distances and time. Just few times it function and most of others, does not. But the worst is the Fitbit support, it is weak, malicius or the wacth is poor quality, I do not know yet, cause I acused that failure at the first time I used and they said was a bug they were trying to fix. The time passed and now has more than 2 months of several conversation with them and the watch still not functin correctly. Since it does not work for the intention I bought, I tried to send it back to refund me, but they did not accepted saying that I did not buy with them (I bought from Amazon). Unfortunately expired the time policy to send it back to Amazon while I was  believing they would fix, but they still asking me to do things that does not matter with the main problem, fooling me around... It seems to be a bad buy! I have never had those problems with Suunto or Garmin.
 I love this Fitbit. I’m so glad I got the one you can pay with. I love all the new features and it’s the perfect size for my small wrist.
 This is a good watch and I love Fitbit. The only problem is I have a Huawei phone which fitbit refuses to support. There is an app though that you can purchase for 5.99 that makes everything sync well.  Otherwise this watch would go back. So just be aware that if you have a Huawei phone you will not be able to use the watch with out buying and downloading the app.  To bad fitbit doesn't care enough to fix the problem themselves.
 I was extremely disappointed in the FitBit Versa. When playing hockey, the touchscreen terminated the workout recording. I saw that many others had similar difficulties with the Versa. The change suggestion to allow a “disable touchscreen” option was marked as “not planned”.  I called FitBit and the tech was very dismissive of my issue. This was the first FitBit product that I have been disappointed in. Unfortunately, with the dismissive attitude of FitBit support, I am questioning whether to buy any further products from them.
 I just got this watch a few days ago. I am in love! I had the charge 2 before this one. I love how I can do a lot more and see a lot more on this watch. The only negative things I have to say about this watch is that switching the bands are annoying. So if your thinking about switching the bands a lot for work and the gym I highly doubt you’ll want to after you try switching it for the first time. Second negative thing is the apps there aren’t a lot of useful apps for the Fitbit. Create more apps please!!!!<br/>Third I think paying more for the limited edition so you can pay with your fitbit and give a short response to a text is kinda of ridiculous. They all should do it but whatever.
 I love my Fitbit Versa more and more everyday. It tracks everything I have wanted. It actually works as a tracker for fitness and tracks your sleep unlike other smart watches. This watch promises and delivers.<br/><br/>I love the options for interchangeable bands. I love to match my accessories and this watch allows that versatility. It feels and looks stylish. It's a great smart watch.
 Simple smart watch $200. However I would get an Apple Watch if I could do it again.  This is sub par. What I like the least is that I have to push that button on the watch half the time to see anything. No adjustment for that. The text is too small.  The fitness app is good enough.  But again.... get the the Apple Watch.  Series 3 is $50 more.  Series 4 is $200 more.  I had a series 1. It’s competitive with this Fitbit Versa.
 Went from an Apple watch to Fitbit! Loving it so far, could use some software updates and a few more features such as calling and texting, but I'm using it for health and fitness, so it's a winner!
 I have had this product for three months and I'm not impressed.  I've never been able to get it to sync with either my computer; a Surface Pro 3, or my phone; a Droid Turbo 2.  For the first month or so it seemed to work fine on my wrist but for the last few weeks there are times during the day when it will not turn on and will not give me any of my fitness data.  While I've been able to use the alarm app which I really like, I haven't been able to set up any of the other features.  I'm beginning to wonder if this Versa isn't defective.  I really couldn't recommend that anyone buy this model.
 The Fitbit Versa is a great fitness watch. Ive used it to track everything from steps, heart rate, miles run (using connected GPS), interval workouts and sleep. Sleep tracking is extremely accurate and detailed. Being on Android this is a great competitor to the Apple watch. If you're looking for a fairly budget friendly fitness tracker that almost checks all the boxes, look no further. The only thing I wish this had was on board GPS but for $200 you can't complain too much. I've had no issues with my Pixel 2 XL and can even respond to messages on the watch using quick replys or emoji! This watch is awesome!!
 I had a Charge 2 and loved it. I wore it for a few years and then decided to trade up for a Versa. That wasn’t a great decision. I wish I had held out for the Charge 3.<br/><br/>What do I like about the Versa?<br/><br/>It is waterproof which is nice when it starts to rain on a run or even just doing housework. No need to worry about water damage.<br/><br/>The automatic identification of exercise seems to be much more on point than the Charge 2.<br/><br/>What do I not like?<br/><br/>Bugs. So many bugs. I feel like I have rebooted the watch more than I should have in the 3 months I have owned it. The watch stops sensing text messages, it has trouble with the Wi-Fi connection at home, and the watch will stop functioning without warning.<br/><br/>There are updates that will take a whole day to finish. Whether using the Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi option, the updates take way too long.
 Great watch. Make sure to get a screen protector for it as the smallest hit will puncture the screen, allthough it still works great. For those of you who are worried about it getting wet, I am a swim teacher and spend 4-8 hours a day in the pool and my watch works perfectly! Pushing the screen in the water is not the easiest but it works as you would expect a wet touch screen to work. It's not the best at counting steps when in the water unless you step down hard (the flex was awesome at step counting in the water) I have had it for a month with no issues from the pool!
 Horrible design. The way the bands connect to the watch is awful. If you are looking to upgrade your Fitbit, I do not recommend this one.
 Loving it! Much lighter comparing to the Apple watch, and battery lasting for over 4 days so far. Fitbit App is simple and efficient, just took me a little to find how to configure its additional app (like weather) but nothing a quick search won’t be able to solve. Small fits great on my tiny wrist.
 I really debated about getting this watch. Glad I did! It is a nice size and easy to read. Set up was smooth using the fitbit download on my phone. I would recommend ordering the hooroor as well for ease of taking watch  off and on. This is a beautiful watch as well as functional.
 I’ve had my Versa for just under a month now and love it.  I upgraded from a Charge 2 and was a little reluctant at first as I was happy with the fitness tracking on the Charge 2, but was looking for some more style.  The Versa fits the bill.  It has all the same great fitness tracking abilities (and some other great features) at a very reasonable price.  I’m happy I made the upgrade.
 I loved this when I first received and then shortly after features stopped working and it became difficult to sync with phone.  It is now 100% unable to sync with my phone and I now own a watch with pedometer feature only--none of the other features work at all.  I called Fitbit support and they walked me through several steps that did not work.  I am now told that they will contact me through email if they come up with any other troubleshooting options.  I received this on August 29 and it is now November 20--my $200 investment did not last long at all.  Should have bought a Garmin!!!  I am so frustrated!
 Fitbit has horrible support. I have not been able to pair with ipods or headsets. Fitbit is going to get back to me for several weeks now. Who has time to spend hours working the bugs out? Sadly, I had similar trouble with a Charge 3.....so I should know better. It's Fitbit overall, not just this watch, that has been a major disappointment and waste of large amount of money.
 I have to say, as someone who is a technologist and product reviewer on the side, this is the worst product I've ever owned in my entire life.<br/><br/>My original Fitbit Versa slowly stopped holding a charge until it completely stopped working, just one month after I received it. Thankfully, I was under their warranty and was sent a new one. I thought that was great, but my spidey sense was tingling.<br/><br/>My replacement watch, which took a week to arrive, was working fine for a few weeks. One day, I noticed the glass was cracked in the upper corner. I figured I must have hit it, but I've never cracked a cell phone, nor 4 of my other smartwatches, in my entire life. The crack is not even a spider crack, just a single line in the upper corner. I did a quick search online and discovered other people with the cracks in the upper corner. One lady said it cracked doing pushups!? I do pushups all the time, isn't this is supposed to be a Fitness watch!? Are you telling me it can't withstand the immense power of a pushup?<br/><br/>Because the replacement Fitbit took over a week to arrive, I was past the 45 day warranty. Fitbit customer support disregarded the links I sent them and suggested I buy a new Fitbit. Thank you for the recommendation customer support, you read my mind, that's exactly what I want to do, spend more money on a new Fitbit.<br/><br/>Fine, I get it. I got hosed, but whatever, that's life. But now I want to get it repaired and am willing to pay for it. Guess what? They also don't have a repair center. It doesn't exist! THERE IS NO REPAIR CENTER.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to have to buy a 3rd party cover for this so the glass won't come off completely. I will also start going to church again and pray the battery doesn't die.<br/><br/>I respect other reviewer's opinions on this watch, as I purchased this because of them, but this was my experience. At this point, I have to find a shady guy at the mall to get this fixed, if it's even possible.
 I started out really happy with this watch! It seemed accurate, loved the display, and the sleek design. However, things quickly went downhill. I bumped it lightly on a post and the bottom cracked a bit. Ok, no big deal.  Then a few weeks later, the battery started draining super fast. I would charge it to 100% and overnight it would be back down to 20%! It ended up on the charger more often than on my wrist. The design for the straps is poor as well - its extremely easy for the metal rods to slip out, causing the watch to fall. That happened this morning and was the final straw as it then fell on the ground and the screen fully shattered.  I'm of course 4 days outside the return window, but will be contacting the seller with hopes of a resolution. In short - you get what you pay for, and it makes sense why Apple watch has been so popular - has to be better quality than this.
 I'll admit I did send it back. For my eyes the screen is too small, don't be fooled into thinking it fills the whole face. It's a good tracker, but getting the software right, especially for messages was a major pain. For $200, no way.
 I like the watch but if you have a Samsung product you may need to read up if Fitbit will mesh well with an Android based phone device. I am having trouble trying to pair the device and I have been on the phone with Fitbit consultants that have a language barrier and it's hard to understand what they are telling me. I still have the Versa and it is beautiful however it is not in use. Hopefully I will be able to fix the issue on my own
 So I find the versa a very useful watch in my daily life. So far ig works preety well, haven’t had any problem with sleep tracking or ant other function. The screen has good colors and good quality, although i feel like they need to improve the sensitivity because sometimes it doesnt light up when i turn my hand. It tracks perfectly my steps and my work out activity. The battery life is awesome, it can last more than 4 days. It is definitely the best smartwatch in terms of benefit/cost.
 I never write reviews but because this watch is expensive and so disfunctional i thought i would write one. The only thing its good for is the watch and MAYBE the heartbeat monitor. It does NOT keep accurate footstep count. Each day (and i make sure its away from a fan like they say) i start off with usually around 5,000 steps and i do not wear it to bed that is after sitting on a shelf. Ive read other peoples reviews ( i wish i wouldve read more before i bought it) and so many people complain about the same thing. I contacted fitbit and the quickly sent another but it does the same thing. My fitbit hr charge never did that. It was way more accurate. Because i bought this to track my steps i was very disappointed. Also, on my first one, it quit notifying me of my text and phone calls. This second one so far is doing ok, we will see. If you want a watch that keeps track of yout steps, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!
 It was ok for a few days then followed by a surprise battery drain - only last for 5-7 hours per charge. Contacted support but not much helpful beside a tons of suggestions to switch off many features (but still not improved). Only now release that how bad this issue among other users from internet, since 7 months back (I should have checked before bought it). Will return this watch after struggles and frustration - wonder why Fitbit cannot fix the issue, while still sale to more people. - Not recommending to buy it until this battery issue gets fixed.
 I bought and used my Versa for several months. I deleted my account and made a new one after a email hack. Now it will not set-up. I get to the point of adding the 4 digit code and then get an error 500 message. I am on a iPhone 7.<br/><br/>I have:<br/><br/>-Updated my iOS<br/><br/>-Deleted and reinstalled the app<br/><br/>-Force quit the app<br/><br/>-Tried on and off Wifi<br/><br/>-Disconnected all other bluetooth and the watch itself as well<br/><br/>-Factory reset the watch.<br/><br/>-Tried the Windows 10 app ("Trouble connecting to FitBit.com)<br/><br/>-Spoke to chat support who told me they know it is an issue but have no timeline for a fix.<br/><br/>I bought the watch, the coach app and the scale. I sunk so much money into this and they refuse to refund and are not resolving the issue.
 My husband got me a fitbit versa for my birthday and has been such a helpful item in my weightloss journey that I got my friend one too. I personally haven't take it off not even 1 day! It keeps me accountable and motivated through reminders and since it has a community feature, I can challenge my friends (5 months invictus title goes to me averaging 12K steps a day).
 I like that the watch is lightweight. I was hoping to be able to respond with quick text replies but I have an iPhone and iPhone will not allow Fitbit to access their closed messing system. Otherwise, overall a nice fitness smart watch.
 I really wanted the Versa to work. I loved the form factor ( very much like my Pebble Steel that I wanted the Versa to replace). After trying to get it to install and reliably sync on 4 phones, I finally got it to work much of the time on an old, Samsung SIII. However, when it did work, there no notifications of course because it didn’t have phone service. And notifications is one of the major must haves with a “smart watch” . It wouldn’t work with the Samsung S5 or a Samsung J7 or my current Huawei Mate. Oh, I did get it to work for one day with my Huawei, it even gave a few notifications. It didn’t like to sync but after a few tries, it finally would. Then I went to bed. Today, I couldn’t get it to talk. And I tried hard. Sorry, the Bluetooth functions of the Fitbit are not very smart, in fact they are a dud. I’m sadly returning the Versa and I’ve gone back to my reliable Pebble Steel. It doesn’t do everything the Versa is supposed to do but it does do everything it said it will, reliably. Going to try the Amazfit Bip. Sorry Fitbit, if you get your act together I may try again.
 Love this fitness tracker it’s not hard to set up and it has everything you need for a fitness tracker what’s so cool is it has sleep 💤 tracker and steps and you don’t need your phone when you are going on a walk and it even shows your text and calls but can’t awnser them or text back which would be cool if it was but I bought this because the screen is better than any smaller one I live this because I can see the screen and it tracks everything as fitness goes
 I’m beyond impressed with this one. After dealing with my charge hr and charge 2 both breaking I was about ready to quit but after getting the Versa I’ll be with Fitbit for life. Wore it during warrior dash Ohio yesterday and other then a good rinse down it worked perfectly. The mud and water obstacles didn’t effect it at all. My only recommendation is a screen protector is a must as well as extra bands.
 I love it! The ability to go for a run without my phone and still listen to music is awesome! Does a great tracking of all my activities. Not having to worry about water is perfect. Getting them for my parents.<br/>The additional apps like Starbucks and maps are a nice touch. It’s fun to change up the face watches.
 This is my 4th Fitbit. This one is the best yet! I compared it to the Apple Watch, and I feel this is a much better value. I love how quickly it charges up and it is easier to connect to the charger than any previous model. The band is much better than other Fitbit models have had. I love being able to customize my display as well.<br/>Super awesome device!
 Got this watch so I could workout more and maintain my weight. I like checking my step and hours of sleep. Just the right product for me.
 Best fit bit by a mile I have an Apple Watch as well but for fitness related this takes the cake!! Interchangeable bands aren’t the easiest to snap in but once I started using it it’s been great and the battery life is amazing!!!
 After owning 2 other Fitbit models, when I saw the Versa released I knew this would have to be mine. Though my bank doesn't support Fitbit Pay, I find the Versa easy to navigate. My only issue is try as I might I can not get my Pandora to sinc. Love the fact it works for swimming
 Super comfortable and light. Love it! I just wish it had the ability to respond to sms notification since it notifies me. Women's health tracking is also not yet available.
 Fantastic watch. I have Android Wear, I have Gear S3 Frontier, but my favorite is this long battery life simple to use Versa. I swim with it all the time and workout.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa but could only give it four stars for two reasons. It came with no real setup instructions. At least a quick start guide would have been useful. If I had not done some web searching on my own I would have been loster than a goose in a snowstorm!<br/>Once I did that, setup was a breeze! It synced quickly and so far no issues.  But the second problem came when I changed the band for the first time. What a chore! Finally got the other band on. Seems they need to improve that a bit.
 Notifications, emails, texts, steps, miles, calendar. I love it.
 So far I love it. It helps me keep track of fitness without being obtrusive. I can sleep with it and I hardly notice it and I love the fact that it tracks my sleep patterns and lets me know how much I actually slept. It is very light and the fact that it is waterproof is a highlight. I haven't had it very long so I can't say how it stands up to the test of time but so far so good.
 Lightweight. Great features. Doesn’t look too large on a woman’s wrist. Quick charge. Bravo fitbit!
 I got this watch to be my "fitness" watch which I wear when sleeping or exercising, while using my Samsung Gear S2 as the "rest of the time" watch. I quickly realized the Versa has all the functionality I need (email/messaging/phone/apps/notifications) + all the fitness tracking functionality + excellent battery life compared to the Gear, so there's no need for 2 watches anymore, switching to the Versa as my daily driver.
 Ok tooo me forever to figure out why I couldnt do an update. Finally read the suggestions that came up on the failed screen and sure enough it was the wifi. It says to make sure you close. I literally put my fitbit on top on the wifi device and boom. It worked! But feels light and seems to be straight forward.
 Love fitbit in general, had the charge 2 and decided to upgrade when this was released and I really love it! Super great watch face and so many options.
 Delivery of this watch took several weeks, and once I received it, it worked for 3-4 days.  After charging the watch for the first time, it failed to turn back on.  Completely dead.  After multiple emails and back and forths with the vendor, I'm working now to get a replacement watch.  My confidence in the quality of this watch is LOW.
 Absolutely love my versa. I was looking for a nicer fitness tracker without all the "smartwatch" features and this is perfect. It does have a few apps for people that want it, I haven't really looked into it. I love the exercise tracking, alarms, women's health feature and the short response text reply feature. Worth the money!
 Love it.  I’m not missing steps like I did with the Charge 2!  I love the face and the apps!  It’s a great value!
 I would like to start by saying the first month I LOVED THIS MORE THAN ANY OTHER I HAD EVER HAD!  Unfortunately since then it has stsrted to have LOTS of glitches. It started counting steps when i was completely still. I over looked this because it wasnt consistent AND  I loved the Versa so much.  I told myself it is just a few off.  Then one morning I woke up took it off the charger and the first notification I recieved was "you reached your goal! 12,498 steps." I hadent even gotten out of bed. Still in denial, telling myself it will reset tonight and be ok. Next morning I wake up and steps are not showing on versa screen. You have to go into the app to see how many steps you have gone.  It is really disapointing. I love the look, the feel, the stated convenience, water proof, honestly everything about the Versa but in the end NONE of those matter it it has glitches that prevent it from working correctly.  Way to much money sent (would have been worth it if it didnt have glitches) on a product that doesnt work like it is supposed to.
 I purchased this item on 8/2/18.  It quit working a week or so again, around 11/18/18.  Fitbit has been no help to me.  They have given me the run around like crazy.  The battery is DEAD, yet they expected me to charge it, which it won't do, and sync it every 2-3 hours.  Absurd.  They won't refund after 45 days.  I could maybe get it replaced, but I am so tired of the run around instead of sincere help with my problem, that I think, "What's the use?"  I think that is what they were hoping for.  This is a fun product when it works, but if you have any problems, watch out!!
 Loved my Fitbit but struggled with the clock face don’t size.  But I loved it!! It was the perfect size for my lifestyle with a Milanese band that made it practically weightless. I forgot u was wearing a watch!  But The Versa is the perfect upgrade with features I love and improved accessibility of apps. It too is practically weightless  I love it. It does everything it says it can and more. I’ll be wearing this for years  excellent product with ifit app on iPhone works seamlessly
 Loved it much more before the screen got scratched.  It has held up for months with nothing so the screen protector I bought for it was forgotten.  It works great though...just buy a screen protector with it!  I love that it has alarms on it so I don't wake my husband with my loud alarm clock.
 Love it!! It is very lightweight. The band is smooth very comfortable. The screen is easy to swipe and crystal clear. I had absolutely no problems selecting my watch face. You can choose from Fitbit watch faces or choose from third party. I chose the one from Fitbit that lets you use your own photo. Super easy to set up and I had no issues with it. There are many  apps available and I had no problems with those either. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend. I’ve previously owned an Alta and a Charge2 and I was afraid this would be too big, but it isn’t too big at all and feels very comfortable. Love it!
 The product has a firmware update process that is flawed. It will not complete successfully, despite numerous attempts/workarounds posted around the internet. The watch worked for 1 month, then stopped syncing after attempting firmware update process, the watch never gets past the getting started screen. I contacted support, went over all of their troubleshooting procedures, was assured that they can RMA it, but at the end they sent some email saying that they cannot do anything about it since I didn't buy it from fitbit.com and was told that I would have to work with the retailer that I bought it from. For sure I will never buy a product from this company again. It is clear from the Internet forums that other users have the EXACT same type of issues, yet the Fitbit refuses to do anything about it. The technician even had the audacity to to tell me to switch and use another phone to resolve the issue, when the Galaxy S8 is clearly listed as one of the supported phone models.
 Upgraded from my garmin vivofit hr, before that I had a Fitbit charge. I loved my Garmin, but wanted something “prettier” and with a little more functionality. I have had the Versa for 3 days now and can already say it’s my favorite of the three I’ve had. It’s very lightweight and comfortable. Haven’t had any issues sleeping with it. It seems to have a great battery life, much better than my husbands Apple Watch. Does great for tracking work outs steps etc.
 When it works it is good however 2 months after having it randomly shut off and would not charge. Fitbit sent me a replacement- 3 months after having the replacement it all of a sudden would not sync and connect with my phone (I even hooked it up to my husbands phone and it wouldn’t work on his either- so not a phone issue) Fitbit is sending me a second replacement. For the price and owning it for 5months and this will be my third one... fingers crossed this one works for longer than a few months.
 Got this for my wife as a gift. She loves it. Wears it to bed also. You can see texts from your phone. The battery seems to last for a long while as well.
 I been trying to pair my phone to my new watch since I recieved it I have a samsung s7. I had several people try I went to verizon they said there is something wrong with your watch.  I was so excited when i recieved it but now it doesn't do anything I really wanted it to do I need some asst on what I should do.  I love my watch just very disappointed that it doesn't work properly.  If there is any way you can contact me here is my email address  msjudi62@cox.net thank you for you time in this matter
 Every time the I have to do an update, the watch completely stops working until I update it. Which isn't so bad but the updates take hours (5-6 hours) and it keeps disconnecting and I have to start all over again.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to use my watch all day (which means I can't take my phone with me anywhere). I will probably have to plug it in over night and hope that the update works. The same thing happened last time and I didn't have a watch for two+ days.<br/><br/>I would consider something else if you always need this to work all the time.
 I honestly would have not bought it if I knew it did not come with nfc, I re-read the part about "special versa models" that sounded to me like the versas came with NFC, now I realized that there's a "different" version that comes with NFC.<br/><br/>But when you buy the one without NFC since they're technically the same product, the reviews made it sound like it had NFC (because they bought the other model).<br/><br/>That was the main reason to buy this watch, so I'm either just going to re-sell it to get some money back or have it collect dust and  never buy from fitbit again :)
 So much to say.... short and sweet... love, love, love this watch.. It needs more apps/ widgets made,.  I have a sit down job and it reminds me I have not walked... gives about 10 min notice so you can meet your goal for the hour.  Usually 250 steps per hour with 12 sessions in a day..
 I have been very disappointed in this watch. I am an owner of three different fitbits and have always been pleased but this one does NOT do the fitbit product line justice. It will not stay connected to my Bluetooth so I get no notifications at all. That is the main reason I wanted this particular watch.
 Def Waterproof. I use it in the shower and pool. The only problem at this point is that the steps takes a moment to update/count. And for some reason it counts steps when I drive. The only way I found to prevent it is to turn off my Bluetooth on my phone, but sometimes I forget..
 Don't let the manufacturers warranty and the fact it's made of gorilla glass make you feel like it's durable, mine cracked within 5 months of use. I do not do manual labor or treat it rough, it's in great condition otherwise. I have no idea how it even broke so it couldn't have been from a hard impact. My old Charge still works til this day, I wore it every day for 2 years at least. I didn't want to believe some of the things I read about Fitbit quality declining but I'm a believer now.
 The versa is great. The way it is set up is very easy to use especially with keeping track of the main 3 right on the watch face. The sleep tracker is also really neat because you get to see when you go in and out of the different sleep cycle.<br/>They do need to work on a couple tho ha though... when you get a text, only android users can respond with a quick reply message. The only music apps you are able to have is Pandora and Deezer but only with a subscription... why not Amazon?!?!  I am hoping they make some much needed improvements to the versa.. it is a smart watch. But for the main things like heart rate, steps, and the typical Fitbit things it is great.
 I absolutely loved my Versa. But after only 6 months the screen fell off while o was simply watching TV on the sofa. When I contacted Fitbit to have it replaced as it was still under the one year warranty they refused and claimed that the screen coming off was not a defect or covered under warranty (even though other users had theirs replaced for the same problem). I am very disappointed in their customer support and even more disappointed that I had this watch for 6 months and it fell apart. That $250 I spent was wasted money.
 Do NOT buy one of these if you have an iphone. I bought one for my wife and it was a pain to get it paired with her phone and took several attempts as the versa does not seem to want to stay paired with the phone. After awhile of her fighting with it syncing, and trying all of the Fitbit suggested fixes, the versa will no longer sync to the phone at all. If I could I would give this 0 stars.
 Love the heart rate tracker, the step counter and reminder. Also the sleep chart is very helpful. And I use the relax feature and excise feature. And I like that your texts show up on the watch.
 I’ve had my Fitbit Versa now for almost 3 weeks, this morning it’s started spazzing out on me and then the screen went blank. It was still tracking my steps and the heart rate monitor was still flashing green and then it stopped and no longer even turns on. What the heck!!! Returning it!!
 I do not care for my Fitbit. It does not accurately count my steps or my flights of stairs. I've watched it's set back to zero at midnight and it was on the charger and when I woke up in the morning I had burned calories and went up and down flights of stairs. I don't always get my notifications Weatherby who's calling or text messages. You can download music but you can't customize a message for a tex? I barely get 4 days out of the battery life. I would not buy this one again but if the charger 2 could do what this one does that would be great!
 This is a great fitness tracker. Compare to Apple watch
 Finally...Fitbit has provided me with the right balance between fitness tracker and watcj.
 I had the blaze previously and loved it but it didn’t have all the glory that I thought an Apple Watch would. When I saw that Fitbit came out with the Versa that looked so much like the Apple Watch but WAY cheaper I knew I had to have it. It is easy to set up and does everything I need. The one and only downfall would be the music, I only use amazon music for streaming and that is not an option right now but hopefully they will come with an update that will have it as an option. Well worth the buy to say the least!
 The right balance between a fitness tracker and smart watch.
 This is my 3rd Fitbit. I loved them so much that I upgrade to latest version often but Versa has been a disappointment. It tracks well but never wants to sync with app. I spend hours trying to get it to sync to wifi but it doesnt. It goes days without syncing then randomly syncs a few times then never again. Im done with it. Back it goes. I will continue to use my Charger 2 version until I find a better brand.
 Very happy with my upgrade from the fitbit hr. This is a great investment in my health
 This is the second fitbit product I've owned, and I am becoming less and less impressed with them as time goes on. They should be making vast improvements, but it feels like the same thing from 2015. Syncing is very slow/glitchy, updates take FOREVER, and the entire thing seems glitchy. Avoid if you can.
 I loved this watch. About a month in, the screen went black and stayed black. Couldn't wake it up. Had to try resetting three or four times before reset even worked, and even then, the watch face lit up for a moment and then the device went unresponsive again. It wasn't a battery issue. On the upside, when I called tech support they told me to send it back--no "try this" or "try that." I really, really, really hope that my second Versa won't have this problem, because when it's working, it's a five-star product: long battery life, measures everything I want measured, terrifically easy/intuitive to use.
 I love this thing! The app works great with my android, and I've not had any issues with it connecting. The step count might not be perfectly exact, but it's close enough. I love that it tracks so many things automatically like stair climbing, walking, sleep, and heartrate. As well as makes tracking my water intake, calories, and cycle rather convenient. It's a great smartwatch too, and I greatly take advantage of message, calendar and email notifications. It took a moment to get use to wearing, especially when I wore it at night the first time. But, taking advantage of the sleep tracker has really helped me to get into a better sleep pattern. Well worth the buy!
 I upgraded from an Alta and it was a large mistake. The activity tracker is fine, but notifications do not work 90% of the time and the fitbit pay is spotty as well.  Can not get music to download.  Do not waste your money.
 I mostly enjoyed being able to see texts on my watch, especially while I was at work. All together I really liked this watch, but last night I woke up half asleep and took it off because it felt weird, and when I woke up this morning I realized my wrist had been burned. This is why I am giving it one star. I really wish this hadn't had happened and I am returning the watch tomorrow. I was about 5 days away from having it for a whole month before I couldnt return it anymore. Buyers beware!
 That is it!!! Finally a good-looking smartwatch combining a fair price point with the features I need the most. All I need in a smartwatch is the ability to track all my health metrics and workouts, while listening good music, and leaving my bulky cell phone in the car.<br/>Versa is very light. I like the size and the style. Set up was very easy. I downloaded some apps from the page. Lots of options.<br/>I like to spent $200 once and be done. I would never sign up for another monthly bill like Apple Watch 3 cellular connectivity for $10 plus tax (that's the same I pay to watch everything I want on Netflix, nonsense).<br/>Fitbit Coach is so nice. The watch shows you the exercise, you start doing it, it vibrates when time is over, and then it shows you the next exercise. I will certainly use it on my business trips.<br/>I went for a 5-mile run this morning using a Garmin GPS on my other wrist. When I checked the data the distance gap between the two was just 0.1 miles. I'm not sure if I will use the connected GPS and carry my cell phone for such a small difference.<br/>I have been heavily using Versa all day and my battery is still at 79%. I had a Apple Watch 2 and battery would not last 1 day.<br/>I'm buying one for my wife for Mother's day.<br/>It is hard to regret buying such an useful device for just $199.
 Often has issues syncing and connecting with Bluetooth.<br/>Also, when you turn your wrist to look at the time (or notification), the screen often doesn't light up, and you have to push a button to see the time or notifications.<br/>Fitbit should have tested this thoroughly before rolling it out. They could have had a great product with some more work, instead they released a subpar product with multiple issues
 I bought this to replace my fitbit HR, which would no longer sync no matter what I did.<br/>I wanted waterproof anyway, so hope that part of it is as good as the rest.<br/><br/>I didn't like the email notifications at first, but now I really do like that feature.
 I'm HOH (hard of hearing) and I needed a wearable device since I keep missing notifications on my phone (can't hear it ring, don't always have it on me to notice it vibrate) and since this is waterproof I don't miss a thing. You can answer calls and reply to texts with a few preset answers.
 I love this. It helps keep me motivated in my health journey. Love all the features.
 Love my Fitbit versa! It came right in two days with prime shipping and I haven’t had an issue with it at all. Battery lasts about 4 days like it says it should and does great in water and tracking swimming laps. I don’t have the GPS feature but I would spend the extra bucks to add that in because it’s great for tracking runs/ bike rides. Lots of cool apps and clockfaces- love that I can use my own pictures as the wallpaper.
 Got my last few steps of my goal while standing chopping vegetables the other day.  I’m not really sure how this thing measure steps but it’s not 100% accurate obviously. Still, it’s a nice too to have to get you moving. Love that you can change the bands to give it a different style (professional, holiday, etc.) Battery really does last up to 4 days but granted I’ve only had it for 4 days so we’ll see. This really is just a fitness watch and that’s what it does. Don’t expect it to be an Apple Watch. You can however receive notifications from your phone and listen to Pandora from Bluetooth headphones.
 I was really excited to get the new fitbit Versa, however it is draining my phone battery. I have tried several things to get it to stop but it seems to be no use. Also the is a 30 bmp difference between the versa and my phone (Samsung galaxy 8) when tracking HR at the same time. The Versa looks great and I really want to like it! But I don't know if I can handle the defects!
 I am a big fan of Fitbit anyway so I may be a little biased but I bought this new special edition Versa for myself for Mother's Day, and I love it!  The best gift I've gotten for myself in a long time.  I love the new watch faces; I am happy with the additional options is has to offer.
 I very much enjoy the Versa and think it's a convenient watch for those who want to focus on overall fitness tracking and wellness. You can get quick overviews of your daily progress, and when viewing on the app you get very in depth information that's nice to see.<br/><br/>However, the biggest weakness I've noticed is that when doing HIIT or interval training in general, the Versa has a very hard time keeping up with the heart rate and is incredibly inaccurate - putting me at 130 BPM when I am actually at 180 BPM. This is very disappointing as it was the main reason I wanted to get the Versa to have an accurate read during my exercises.
 Faceplate glue came undone. Replaced under warranty. Received defective product. can't replace.<br/>good product when it wasn't broken.<br/><br/>pictured is the product I was giving as a replacement after a month and a half.<br/>Left is the screen before going through the factory reset that could fix this error.<br/>Right is the screen after doing the factory reset.
 So far so good! It’s definitely a lot more advanced than my previous Fitbit so trying to figure everything out has taken a little time, but there’s plenty of guides to walk you through the different features. Can’t wait to try out the exercise feature!
 I really liked this watch while I had it. It did everything that I wanted and needed. However after about 3 weeks the touch screen quit working and stopped responding. I tried to reset it but couldn’t even get the watch to turn off all the way. I’m super disappointed. I got my money back and now I am having a hard time deciding whether to try again or go for something different.
 Tracks heart rate and steps. My favorite part is the sleep tracking. I never take the watch off unless it needs charged. I charge it at my desk while I'm working, and it gets done in like an hour. Then I wear it for another 4 days, and charge it again. I wish it was more responsive to the flick of the wrist when I want to see what time it is, but its easy enough to just click the side button to check the time.
 Watch is very small, features are common to any $ 27.00 watch. They charge shipping to return. Not worth the money.  I have purchased other inexpensive watches that look and feel like they were expensive.
 I HAVE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT FITBITS AND  I HAVE LIKED THEM ALL THIS ONE SO FAR IS THE BEST I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
 Only used this New Versa lite for 4 days and it stopped counting my steps while on a long walk. Very disappointed, not surprised though. Just like the normal Versa ....just stops working properly in less than a week! Returning it. Such a comfortable watch but it doesn't work for very long. Man what a disappointment.
 I’ve had it for 3 days, and love it! Recommend!!
 I purchased Fitbit Versa and 3.7 out of 5 stars  523 Reviews<br/>KIMILAR  3-Pack] Screen Protector  11-26-2018. They was delivered 11-29-2018. I set it up that night and applied the Kimilar screen protector. On Yesterday 12-3-2018 I was walking through the kitchen and hit it on the rounded wood kitchen table. The screen is now slightly cracked and the screen protector too. Very Disappointed as I have worn it only 4 days when this happened. Is there a fix for this?
 I've had my fitbit versa for the last five months and have really liked it but for the last month I have started to have a lot of problems with the battery life. As advertised, it used to last up to four days in between charges but for about the last month it only lasts a day to maybe two days if I'm lucky. I'm disappointed with this because the long battery life was one of the things that drew me to this. I don't know if I just got unlucky with this or if it's a normal occurrence.
 Love it. Super functional and easy to use. I have tiny wrists and it takes up all of it. With the plastic bands it was actually hurting my wrist a little. Got a metal replacement which seemed huge but it’s loose enough that it doesn’t hurt my wrist or irritate me while I sleep. Overall great but keep in mind if wrists are little.
 The Fitbit Versa is a great smart watch.<br/>This device tracks my steps accurately for the most part. I find that it’s a little more sensitive than the charge 2 that I previously owned. The watch face is big enough to scroll through and read. The battery life lasts about 3 days before it’s time to charge it. If you are looking for a smart watch, but don’t want to pay an arm and a leg for an Apple Watch, then this is for you. I’ve always been a fan of Fitbit, and it’s still winning me over with the Versa. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a smart watch that counts steps, tracks sleep, tracks heart rate, tracks your workouts, and more.<br/><br/>If the battery life lasted longer, I’d be a bigger fan.
 The watch worked well for two months, then the green sensor light on the back stayed on all the time, wearing down the battery. I called their customer support number. They were terribly rude and unhelpful and wouldn't help.<br/>As a follow-up, I called Fitbit tech support again and got a different customer service rep. She was much more helpful than the first one. Haven't solved the problem yet, but at least this rep tried. Just the difference in representatives I guess.
 Honestly, have had it for less than a week and not happy with how glitchy it is. If you are working out HARD in the gym, it blanks on reading your heart rate which is annoying because you want to know how much you are burning. Also have so many issues with it freezing on steps and not reading my steps even though I am physically walking. Maybe I just got a bad one. I love everything else but for $200, it shouldn’t be this glitchy for not even wearing it an entire week.
 So, I was disappointed from the beginning that it did not have a function to ring back the phone, or provide a notice if the phone was out of range.  However, I decided to just make those suggestions to Fitbit and keep the watch.  Two months later, the display stopped working.  I googled the issue, hoping to fix; but found this to be a common issue with no resolution.  You can restart the watch as many times as you want, it still will not display anything.  It is still connected to the phone and gathering information.  Just nothing displayed on the actual watch, including the logo when rebooting.  I wish, I had done a better google search before purchasing.
 So I ordered my fit bit in May 2018. And aside from the fact that every now and then it won't pick up my heart rate for some reason, now out of the blue the charging dongle has just stopped working. Now I'm stuck with a fitness watch that's useless until I can get a replacement charger..
 I love it!  I have the Fitbit One, and I wanted an upgrade, so I did some research and decided on the Versa.  I love this watch, it's easy to use, easy to read, I love all of the different clock faces you can download and use.  It even tracks my movement when I am not using my arms when I am walking, which I love when I am on the treadmill and holding on.
 I have wanted a new Fitbit tracker for a while now.  Searched for a long time and found the Versa.  I use it all the time.  It syncs like it ought to.  I have had this watch for over 3 months now and am glad I made the purchase.<br/>It is water proof but is not accurate for distance in open water.  I don't mind that as long as it counts my duration and intensity; which it does.  It is accurate in the pool.
 The first few weeks I used my versa it worked wonderfully. However, I started to notice small but frequent glitches. My heart rate and steps stopped showing on my screen after three weeks. Not only would my progress not show on my screen, it would also show me a wrong heart rate and steps for the small time that it actually worked. The only good thing that I noticed was that the life time was miraculously long, but how does matter when it doesn’t even work. I would suggest a cheaper model such the Fit Bit Alta HR for a better experience. This product is way too much for the frequent glitches and wrong information.
 I had been wanting a Fitbit Versa for about a year. I was finally able to get one and a couple hours after I put it started burning my arm. It wasn’t tight at all. I was able to fit two fingers under the band. Even though it burned, I continued to wear it over night. It still burned. It burned even more when I went to the gym.<br/>I was so disappointed. I returned it and got an Apple Watch instead.
 I’ve had a Fitbit for 5 years. When my Blaise started malfunctioning after almost 2 years I decided to upgrade to the versa. Big mistake. After lass than two months the battery began draining fully in 24 hours. I opened help ticket and performed troubleshooting with support over two days before they gave me the “good” news it’s under warranty and they sent me a replacement. The replacement arrived today n Friday and after setup and sync it won’t Maintain a connection with my phone. Spent 20 minutes troubleshooting with tech support and they weee able to connect it and sync. Assured me it would be fine. Surprise- it’s not fine. Continues to drop the connection and can’t get it to sync. Will be fine n touch with support again today to request a refund
 Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Water resistant, she get texts and notifications on it with a heart rate and sleep tracker. She is even able to change the screen and add pictures plus the fitbit store has so many apps and tracking abilities. This is more cost efficient than spending hundreds of dollars on other watches.
 talked to tech support they said Versa lite has not been tested on all android phones so they do not know how they will react with all android phones as far as the notifications specifically phone calls will not show to be able to accept or decline. so until you add to phone you will not know what notifications will work or not.<br/>Very large waste of time. will not buy another fit bit&gt;
 My Versa worked fine in beginning except Bluetooth was a little finicky.  After about two months my Versa completely died and would not recharge or reboot.  Tech rep sent me a replacement charger which took about 10 days to receive.  That did not fix the problem and now they are having me send my Versa back to them and they will get back to me after 5 days of receiving it.  I've been without a functioning Versa for almost 3 weeks.  It looks like it is going to be another week or two without it.
 Very nice. Disappointed I didn't read the fine print to understand only the special edition allows for secure payment.
 Bought this item in late June, by end of October it was almost unusable. There were scratches everywhere because the outside shell in not resistant to wear. It is not an every day watch in my opinion. I was very disappointed especially since I left behind a Apple Watch for this. It does do everything it claims just really poor material
 Product was as expected. Step up from previous Fitbit. Bigger screen. My main purpose was to play Pandora without my phone. Worked well. Would prefer to choose which channels to download rather than let it be chosen for me.
 the watch is great  and working.  I only have one comment about the manufaturer. your instructions are very vigue and operation instructions suck
 Excellent experience. This is my first fitbit and I could not be happier. The versatility is very attractive and I find myself very comfortable using it as motivation to get moving and keeping myself on track! The charger is what I don't like about it, I highly recommend getting an off the fitbit site charger, they're better suited for the versa!
 As a new mom, I track my baby’s sleep on my phone and with this I can track my own sleep to make sure I’m not too sleep deprived! It helps me remember to get in the bed early when I can and also to squeeze in short bursts of exercise. There’s even a new parent clock face that was super handy in the early days with tracking diapers, feedings and naps!
 By far, the most accurate activity tracker in the non-Apple ecosystem. The only negative is that the run tracking is inconsistent with Strava, even though both apps are using the phone's GPS. Also, the Run analysis in the Fitbit  app is fairly basic compared to other fitness apps - definite room for improvement.
 I bought one months ago through REI and at that time would’ve given it 1 star as watch wouldn’t turn on after 1 day. Decided to try again having an Amazon gift card, and I love this watch. Wonderful features, comfortable band. Very happy with the purchase. Has a great battery life and I love receiving messages on it.
 I so loved this Fitbit after my Alta crapped out after less than a year. This model, however, even worse luck. Had less than two weeks and it started restarting itself throughout the day, or would just shut off and would have to be manually restarted. I wasn’t able to use my Pandora, either, after spending so much time setting it up. Notifications wouldn’t sync. After several factory resets, with no luck, it became a $200 piece of worthless junk. I have returned the item and will probably not purchase another Fitbit.
 very good alternative to the apple watch; it works with all phone at least and the battery life is quite amazing
 I want to love this watch but I just cant... too many bugs that make it worthless. Steps either dont count, or you get ghost steps while charging.<br/><br/>I like the waterproof feature which is why I switched from the Blaze, but that isnt enough to give it 5 stars.
 Bought this Fitbit two weeks ago and today in completely broke. Started with the touch screen not working. I swiped all directions nothing. Now as you can see from my picture the screen doesn't work. The white lines are obviously not supposed to be there. When I looked it up this morning multiple people are having the same issues and Fitbit is being unresponsive. I am returning through Amazon for a refund until they fix this bug. Very disappointed this is my 3rd Fitbit and I never had a problem previously.
 Best fitbit
 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!  I'm so happy with my Fitbit Versa. I need to set up all the functions just haven't had the time. But I love that it tracks my workouts and very easy to use. I will buy another one when the time comes hopefully not soon!
 I've had this FitBit for about 10 weeks. I wear it constantly, and haven't had an issue until now. I looked down at my wrist and there's a big chip on the side of the screen. Had I been doing something remotely active today I would be bummed, but not as upset as I am. I contacted FitBit only to learn that cracks or chips are not covered under warranty. For $200 I would expect something to be a bit more durable. If not durable - at least they can fix it. Nope, can't do that either. I believe this is the last time I buy a FitBit product.
 I like the features of this watch, like being able to see heartrate, receive and respond to notifications, yada yada yada. The problem is it seems like the watch constantly disconnects (I have to reset the app and the watch every other day in order to get sleep data to sync). My wife has been flat out unable to get her watch to repair to her phone after she had to reset it. So when it works, it's nice. It's all the other BS that knocks off 2 stars.
 Very pleased with this purchase. I used Fitbit when they first came out but was dissatisfied with their products, bands cracked, trackers were not reliable and battery life was short.<br/>The Versa so far, has proven that products can improve. I love the color, rose gold, the fit and the face of the tracker. I haven’t experimented with any different faces but look forward to trying some.
 This is my second Fitbit and I really like the smartwatch capabilities. There is a lot to offer for less than the Apple Watch. Something to consider is that the watch is "plastic" and the charing is a pain if you have a case on it. A new charger needs to be developed so you can charge with a case. I've taken my watch into the pool, lake, and ocean and it is holding up well. I highly recommend.
 So far seems to be almost the same as an Apple Watch (which I have). The only thing my daughter cannot do that I can is answer texts or phone calls on her watch, but for hundreds cheaper does it really matter! My 17 year old loves it and loves the heathy help great mix of a Fitbit and a smart watch.
 Worked fine for the first 9 months I had it. Now with the recent firmware update in the watch, it doesn't sync with my phone, LG V30.<br/><br/>I've tried to reach out to support and have gotten nowhere, just a run around.
 I had a Fitbit Blaze for a little over two years and it died.  I had some problems with the Blaze but the biggest one was with the inaccuracies measuring my pulse rate.  I tried different positions on my wrist but pulse rates over 90 or so were off drastically compared to a chest heart monitor I also used at times.<br/>I have only had my Versa for about a week but I am very impressed with it - particularly the accuracy of the pulse rates during exercise.  It also is a very attractive watch and I easily synced it with an old inexpensive Android iphone.  Very impressed with this watch.
 I've had my versa for a little less than a month.  It monitors my heart rate and the exercise apps are great!  I couldn't do my workouts without it.<br/>One draw back is that you are limited to the music apps they provide.  I was hoping to be able to use my amazon music app on it.  I am experiencing problems with the charging cradle.  It sporadically quit working and now my versa will not charge.  I have contacted customer support and they are working on resolving the issue.
 I have struggled with this smart watch for months. It just doesn't ever want to sync or give me notifications on texts. Half the time it loses the step and HR info for a few days after I spend an hour repeatedly pressing manual sync on my phone. I've been a fitbit customer for years. It's sad that this product is such garbage. :/
 Great product. You cannot go wrong with any of the Fitbit products. I gave it 3 stars because the box I received only had 1 have of the large bands. I changed my scoring because I received the correct thing. Five stars all the way!
 I had been hoping FitBit would come out with a bit smaller screen and similar design to the Apple Watch...SO glad they did with this watch! I LOVE the design and features. Being able to track intervals and not have to watch the time on my phone is huge for me!
 I love the watch. I love how I can look at the weather, see who calls me, see the time, etc. without having to pull my phone out of my pocket all the time. The only issue I have is that the watch sticks up a little too much. If the face of the watch was more flush to my wrist, that would make the watch even better.
 Be aware that you cannot replace the screen on this watch if it gets cracked.  I learned this the hard way.  If you choose to purchase this watch, spend the extra money and buy a good screen protector.  I had a screen protector on mine and dropped it one time shortly after buying it and now the screen is severely damaged!!!  This is a big disappointment for the investment made.
 Had this Versa for only 5 weeks and when I charge it -it reads more than 20,000 steps and it will not clear until the next day!  Today I tried to sync with app and it won’t sync!!  Very disappointing!  This is my third Fitbit-no problems with charge or other Fitbit. Just upgraded and bought several bands—only to find it doesn’t work right!!! Disappointed customer!!!!
 The watch does not work as well with an iPhone as it does with an Android phone.  I knew that beforehand and that was ok with me.  However, the weather screen does not sync with my phone.  I called customer support, we spent a lot of time resetting the watch, the weather screen synced when I was on the phone but it never did it again.  I can make it sync but it is a very manual process and that is not how it is designed to work.  I basically have given up on this feature.
 I really like my Fitbit Versa, I love the big screen, and the color icons! The one thing I didn’t like was putting on the screen protector! The protector was confusing and I had to go to U Tube to figure out how to apply it! It was a little cumbersome, but I managed to get it on!
 If I could give the Versa zero stars, I would. I’ve had the charge and charge 2 and loved them both. However, the Versa never stays connected, says I have a heart rate 10-15 beats higher than my charges ever did, and doesn’t connect long enough to actually download music. I’m going to an Apple Watch instead.
 I really hadn't planned on buying the fitbit smart watch - but then I also didn't want to wait for the next fitness tracker to come out in October, so I bought the versa instead (last month). Glad to say I've been back on my treadmill for over a month now. This watch keeps working out fun and I love the apps you can download.
 Not worth it. I purchased my watch back in June 2018 and it’s only 5 months old - battery doesn’t even last one day. I fully charge it every morning and it would just die in me early in the evening. The Fitbit team gave me such a hard time when i requested for a new or get my money back but first i had to do all troubleshoots - so i followed their instructions and they still refuse to exchange for a new or give me my money back. Not worth it.
 I purchased this 2 months ago doesnt as always  sync. Stopped syncing completely yesterday and cant get it to pair or  sync with the app. Very frustrated and have tried every trouble shooting suggestion. Not s happy fitbit user..
 I have not been able to use my watch at all. When I first got it I was extremely excited to use it, but when I got to turn on the watch, it was at 0%, so I decided to charge it first. Ever since then, the only thing that appears on the watch is the logo. I've tried pretty much everything, but I have not gotten any results. Overall, I love the design of the watch, but I have not gotten to see it in action, hence my review. If you can help me in anyway possible, I would really appreciate it.
 It’s great not having to take it off when swimming! It was very easy to set up and works well.
 I use the watch to track my heartrate and exercises. I also keep my gym music on it and it plays my selection via Bluetooth while tracking my exercise. I am extremely pleased with it.
 Love this Fitbit, battery lasts me almost a whole week and it charges in about a hour! I can control music on my phone from it and I can download other apps! (I pay snake on it a lot haha) It also shows messages I get or phone calls. the rose gold is a pretty color. Quick and easy to set up and the steps seem accurate. I love how to it records my sleep stages as well!!
 I ordered two Versa SmartWatchs.  The pink-belt one works beautifully; however, the blue-tooth unction of the black-belt one did not work after two days of trying.  Thanks that I received the replaced on on Sunday, June 3, 2018.  This one, again, works beautifully.  I set it up only in few minutes.  Thank you!
 Not happy at all. I purchased this fitbit Versa to count my calories and steps. I replaced the first one because it had me burning 1300 calories just by sitting at my desk. Now I have a replacement and so far within 4 hrs of connecting the new one I've burned 1510 calories. I'm very disappointed, I'll be returning the replacement as well.
 bought this as a supposed upgrade to the Pebble.  Could not respond to txt or receive call notifications.  The fitbit app is ok, but not that great.  Did not automatically record workouts or walking as expected.  Does not allow me to turn off all notifications, and continually wakes me up 30 minutes before my alarm.  Threw it away, pos.
 I have been on a watch hunt- for a few weeks now that my Pebble finally crashed and died. and I loved this one- its very comfortable and too the point. my only concern is the following: one that while my watch was charging it counted 48 steps- and I wanted to reset that. and apparently i should be able to edit that. but it wouldn't work. Second. I understand if I download music on pandora and the other one- i can listen to music. but what if I don't want to download music and just listen to all the music I already have on my spotify? and honestly- for  149 - I at least expect that much. so i will be returning mine.
 It won’t turn on and is a common issue and FitBit does not care. I have to go weeks without my device for them to “replace” their own defect product. I’ve had it for barely two months. In my opinion, a total waste of cash.
 Love this watch! Doesn't feel bulky at all and works great with the Fitbit App. I like how it keeps track of my workouts and shows me much more info on the screen as I do them.<br/>Only cons are that I didn't really like the strap it comes with (that's an easy fix though since straps can be changed), and sometimes I think it logs steps I didn't take (it'll show steps even if I know I've been sitting down for a while).
 I totally love this watch! I had the Blaze for a few years and upgraded to the Versa... love the fit and the look! It also tracks things well...<br/>I would recommend this watch to anyone!
 It fits great, love the screen size and the lightness of it. Definitely the most comfortable Fitbit I’ve had. Easy to use, don’t really care about the apps but it does have that function. Overall it’s my favorite Fitbit and just what I want in a smart watch.
 I wish I could write a more positive review on the fitbit versa watch, its an excellent watch when it is working. I bought my first one a few months ago and suddenly the screen stopped working. They replaced it but the second one broke within a week, again the screen went black and re-starting it didn't fix the problem. I've sent both watches back to the company but they told me "when they receive it they will decide what they will do next." So I'm a little disappointed.
 This product has so many defects!! The screen always glitched out, and now as of 2 days ago, the screen is black. I have tried multiple times to do a reset, and nothing. Contact with Fitbit support is a horrible drawn out process. It is fitbits idea of an expensive crappy smart watch, that can’t even reply to text messages.
 Battery life on this is ridiculous, basically you get 24 hours. I was fully charged in the morning and by 7pm, it's at 54%, this is having done almost nothing with it.  Not using excessively. If this is how it is 5 days orof the box, what will it be like in 6 months? I'll be returning.
 I have been a fitbit costumer for 5 years. I was excited for the Versa and as a smart watch/fitness tracker it works perfectly and is accurate. The problem is the wristband. It is difficult to take on and off. Also I bought the watch 2 months ago the the band smells terribly. I have washed it and done all the recommended care. This is marketed as a fitness watch and this issue with the band smelling should have been addressed before its release. I doubt I'll ever buy another fitbit again which is unfortunate.
 Good smart watch I can see the time during the day in the sunlight does everything my charge to do it and more I recommend it also I like the waterproof feature now I don’t have to worry about it if I go swimming
 This watch was a bit of a pain to set up, but once everything was set up I have no issues. Aesthetically pleasing watch.
 My Versa arrived on time as expected and is performing as I expected it would. The only negative thing I have to say is the very difficult way the bands connect to the watch. It took me a total of an hour and a half to change the small band to the large band. It was very frustrating and I was almost on the verge of just sending it back when somehow, some way, it just clicked. I probably won't be buying any different color or style bands due to this issue. Perhaps in the future Fitbit will rethink how their bands attach.
 I am really impressed with how light this feels on my wrist. It is almost an Apple Watch with battery life.<br/>GPS inbuilt would have been perfect
 I love it 😍. The face size let’s me easily read the time without glasses. It’s cool that you can use your own pictures as a background. It’s sleek and light. Here are the buts: band is very hard to change, only one face let’s you review your steps, heart ♥️ rate and such.
 I’m so disappointed in this product. I loved it for the two months it worked, now I hate it and feel like I wasted my money. Of course the time has run out to return it, so at this point I’m not sure where to turn for help
 I bought this because I wanted to track my running while listening to music without having to carry my phone to play songs. This worked well by letting me pre-load my Pandora stations to listen to away from my phone via Bluetooth headphones. FYI you have to have Pandora plus to do this. Battery lasts 4-5 days which I love. Overall great buy.
 Just as described. I started getting an irritation on my wrist so had to return. Otherwise I loved it. It wasn’t until after I sent it back my brain kicked in and I thought I should’ve ordered a different wrist band.
 I like the bright display and the battery life. The watch is very easy to set up but I don’t like the band attachment process, at all. It is very cumbersome as you have to have the band it a very precise position to detach and reattach the band. I had to replace the small band with the large one and I ended up with a bent pin on one of the connectors.
 My mom bought 3. One for herself, myself, and my husband. We LOVE them! They are easy to use, the Fitbit iPhone app is also very easy to use and understand. The Fitbit Verse is incredibly detailed. I can keep track of everything from my steps to my sleep. Water intake, exercise, calories burned, heart rate and so much more. I had no idea how much it could do. We love them. Well worth the price!
 Very disappointed in the Versa. I loved my charge 2 but this Versa is a piece of crap. It won't update and because it won't update I'm stuck with a screen that only shows the time. When I'm working out, I can't see my heart rate which is why I have the watch. Don't waste your money. Also, customer support has been totally unhelpful. They gave me every troubleshooting option and when none of their methods worked, they've refused to replace it because I've owned it 60 days instead of 45 days. Apparently, their products are only good and guaranteed to work for the first 45 days. Wow. DO NOT BUY.
 A great tracker, but on my wrist it tracks things like when I move my hand too much. My last Fitbit tracker was kept in my pocket or on a belt loop, so non-walking steps hardly were counted. This one makes it look like I walk more than I actually do, but I suppose it isn't a huge exaggeration.  Otherwise, very nice, especially the sync with strava for my bike rides.
 Worked properly for about 2-3 months. Now it won't stay charged longer than 24 hours, and that's with all notifications turned off. I've contacted Fitbit twice about this, and have been walked through trouble shooting. Will try to contact them again, but at this point I wish I had just spent a little more for an actual smart watch.
 Love my new versa.  Workouts, swims, and runs, food log, sleep monitor....this does it all
 successful mother’s day gift and works great so far! also looks beautiful. fairly easy set up and connection with the phone app.
 This fitbit watch is accurate, pretty and has pretty much all of the same extras as the apple watch. I had two Garmin's before this. One worked well (I used a heartrate chest strap for it), the other had a heartrate monitor on the wrist watch and it was extremely inaccurate. So glad I got this one instead.
 Pros: easy to use app, lots of watch faces, very customizable, keeps track of literally everything.<br/><br/>Cons: BATTERY LIFE. Fitbit Pay only works with like 10 banks, so right now it's a useless feature. No microphone.  Preselected text responses are horrible and unchangeable. Should have more features for the price point.
 I've not yet tried ALL the features (I'm especially looking forward to swimming with it) so that's the only reason I've not given it a 5. I loved my HR2, but am already appreciating some of the many enhancements in even what it offered. So far-very happy!
 I was looking for something that tracked my steps, heart rate, calories, and exercises. I also wanted something that was easy, trendy, and light weight for my workouts. This was perfect for me. I have only had it for two weeks but I love it.  I haven't figured out the pandora feature yet, but I'm working slowly through the features and learning my watch.  I feel like it's very accurate while monitoring my daily activities. I love the look as well. I also love how it came with the small and large band because I was not sure which would work for me and couldn't find a place that would allow me to try them on.
 An awesome upgrade to the last version of FitBit. I highly recommend upgrading to this product! The face options are a really neat addition along with weather, quick messaging replies, music control and more!
 I purchased this watch to replace my Pebble Time Round when it stopped vibrating reliably.  I am really liking the Versa, though I will say that it took a few hours and lots of patience to get it set up correctly. I ended up having to read through a bunch of message boards to figure out how to get text messages and notifications to display properly. I am using it with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Android phone.  While there aren't as many apps yet as Pebble had, there are plenty to get back functionality that my Pebble Time Round had by default. Some of the best third party apps include My Agenda (to see calendar appointments), Tips, Calculator, Currencies and Barcodes. Fitbit also has some great apps including Starbucks.<br/><br/>I opted for the rose gold version to have NFC payment functionality. One of the first things I did was purchase a rose gold metal mesh band from a third party seller to replace the woven band. The metal mesh band is great and was very reasonably priced. I have very small wrists, and the Fitbit Versa fits me fine and is very lightweight and comfortable to wear.<br/><br/>The absolute best things about this watch are battery life (on day three and still above 30%), great visibility even outdoors, waterproof capabilities, and ease of use (once you get all the functionality working and apps loaded). The only thing I'm still working on is getting music controls to work properly when playing music from my phone. That's definitely buggy based on the message boards, but I haven't spent a lot of time troubleshooting it yet.<br/><br/>It's a Fitbit, so the exercise tracking is top notch. As a smartwatch, it isn't perfect but it meets my needs. I thought I would miss dictating texts into the watch, which was a great Pebble feature, but it turns out that the five stock replies I have access to (and can customize in the phone app) are sufficient most of the time.<br/><br/>I am very happy with the Versa as a replacement for my Pebble Time Round so far. I think the pros far outweigh the cons and would recommend this to any Android phone user who wants excellent fitness tracking with decent smartwatch capabilities.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've now had the watch for a few weeks and still love it. I did get music controls working. The trick is to do a double bluetooth connection (the music specific one is called Versa Classic) and then the music controls work when I have my phone connected to a bluetooth headset. Since I mainly use this while exercising, this meets my needs. The only two features I miss from my Pebble Time Round are the ability to initiate calls from my wrist and the ability to send texts (not just reply to incoming ones), but otherwise, this watch is an improvement in every way from the Pebble Time Round. Hopefully third party apps will help fill these two gaps as the Versa gains in popularity.
 I wore a fitbit blaze for two years and decided to purchase fitbit versa due to it being waterproof and I liked the look better. I am very happy with the watch. Feels lighter and has great new features.
 There are so many features on this watch!  The color is beautiful, I did replace the band with a rose gold one because the band was a different color than the face.  Other than that, it works great and holds a charge forore than two days (I haven't tried longer, as I charge it almost every day).
 If you're using this as a general fitness tracker, then you're probably fine. However, I decided to try a FitBit as a more affordable alternative to a Garmin watch. As a runner, I need the GPS-based paces and distances to be accurate for different distance and speed workouts. The GPS for the Versa FitBit never connected; my paces were reading slow by a few minutes per mile; and the distances were recording shorter than the actual distance run. Per a few forum entries, this is not an uncommon issue for the Versa - but it's a significant one that has me returning this item and going back to a more expensive but more reliable Garmin device.
 Very awesome so far! Very light weight, barely notice it's there until it buzzes.
 Personally, I really like this product. It is a large step up from my Charge HR and my husband's Alta, and I really like the touchscreen interface. It has a similar look to an Apple Watch, but it isn't and I don't think it's trying to be. It does exactly what I need and doesn't overwhelm me with all the extras.
 Looks and feels great.  The sleep tracking is very helpful and much better than past items I have used.
 Nice looking, but battery life is weak, sync always had problems, notification worked only 20 percent of the time, it's a good looking watch looks expensive but terrible pice of tech
 After having a terrible experience with the original Charge HR I upgraded to the Versa. Similar to the Charge HR, the Versa doesn’t hold a charge for more tha 48 hours. The Fitbit free app doesn’t sync correctly with Android or iOS 12.0. along with the most recent Fitbit app update on October 1, 2018
 I have had nothing but trouble with this watch. I had to call customer service (who didn't help) because the watch stopped synching. I got it to synch finally, but my text messages won't come to the watch at (why have the watch then) Pandora won't connect. It's the biggest waste of money ($180) I have spent. Never again will I buy a Fitbit. Now someone has hacked my Fitbit account which I have had for a while and all of a sudden it's been hacked. Never again
 Received watch yesterday afternoon. Worked great right out of the box. Paired with iPhone 8 Plus with no problems. Connected it with a 2.4ghz wireless router and it took about 15 minutes to download update and another 15 minutes to initialize. Mostly use it for measuring distance while walking around walking track but incorporating other features into lifestyle. Such as the sleep monitor and reminders to get up and move. Have only had it for 1 day but so far very impressed. The first activity tracker I’ve owned that you can actually read in full sunlight. Notifications work great when I receive texts and I’m not having to fumble with getting my phone out of my pocket while struggling with that last half mile.
 So far love it - have had it about 4 months or so. Works well!  Water resistant which I love and it holds a good charge! Definitely better quality than my Fitbit HR charge I had in the past. It’s a quality touch screen smart watch but much better quality than previous models!
 I bought this to help track weight loss, etc. and I was in need of a new watch anyways. Downside has been that any movement of my arm, and it counts it as a step. I only wear this to work/during the day and for 5 days, maybe 6. Clean it as directed and never get it wet. I never wear it (or any jewelry; bracelets, watches, rings or necklaces) to bed. Tonight my wrist itched, so I took it off and I see it has left a red mark/burned me. The placement of it is where the flashing monitor thing is. I've only had it since October and now I'm outside the replacement window. Beware of buying *any* watch like this. They're not worth it if they burn your skin!
 I loved my Charge HR, but when it broke recently I was so excited to get the Versa for all of the extra apps it came with on the watch itself.  I mainly used the Charge HR for steps, tracking calories burned and sleep.  The Versa isn't tracking sleep at all, can't find the wifi network, and won't sync to my iPhone app no matter if I am at work or at home.<br/>I have restarted the Versa, uninstalled/reinstalled the app a bunch, disconnected/reconnected Bluetooth, disconnected my car and headphones from Bluetooth......nothing works!  I don't know what else to do, but at this point the Versa isn't living up to all the hype.
 I’m a Fitbit enthusiast for five years now, I’ve had several in that time, but like the Versa the best, by far!  Really like the woven band and being able to change the face to suit my mood!  Haven’t mastered transferring the music, but hopefully I will.
 If you are looking for a good fitness watch, this one is the one you want.  Does everything the "big boys" do except let you respond to texts if you have a non-compatible phone.  I've had mine for a few months.  Bands are relatively easy to change once you get the hang of it.
 the screen just blacked out after two months of normal use. That was the 2nd one I had purchased through amazon.  The first one was direct from fitbit and it did the same thing.  they are sending a third and promise it wont happen three times...<br/>UPDATE:<br/>Third one died for heart rate after literally three weeks. They told me to factory reset it and it now will not connect to the WiFi so I cannot set it up again. So it is now junk. Thinking of moving to Garmon vivoactive instead. This is ridiculous.
 First pros. I like how it is user friendly and love the rose color! With it coming with small band and large one id assume it would fit most people! App is nice for even monitoring womens monthly cycle so i was able to delete a different app<br/>A con for this is that after wearing for a while the rubber watch band gets annoying and makes you sweat! Overall im satisfied and bought a silver for my husband
 Man I wanted to love this watch so much. I previously owned two Pebbles, and this was looking like a really nice replacement. I wrote some apps for the Pebbles that I was really excited to port to this watch. Unfortunately, their setup process is totally broken. I have spent the past hour simply trying to connect the watch to my phone, without success. Huge fail. I've never experienced a more frustrating setup process, and it makes me think the engineers at Fitbit are just a bunch of amateurs. Guys, this is like 101 level stuff here, you need to make your setup process FLAWLESS. I was shocked that there were so many posts on the web about people having the exact same problem I'm having, as far back as 2015! It's crazy! I'll update my review at some point if I get things going, but so far this has been a total disaster. And yes, I've done every variation of disconnecting/reconnecting bluetooth on my phone, power cycling the watch, etc. At one point it said it was connected and even synced (!). Great! Ohhh, just kidding, update failure. Back to square one...
 Love my versa!!! The only downside is no gps without phone. But I’m not a runner anymore (bad knees) so that’s fine with me!
 I absolutely love my versa! Wasn’t so sure about putting it in water but went in a lake and a pool and it did great. Haven’t had any glitches with it yet. Automatically updates to the app on my phone. Reminds me to keep it moving and to meet my daily goals. Definitely recommend it.
 Love this watch!!!!! I struggled with choosing between this versus the Apple Watch. Definitely made the right decision. One watch with one app that does everything. I lift weights and do cardio. It easily tracks this and gives me notifications of texts, appts, emails, etc. I love the sleep tracker too. All in all, this watch is fabulous. Battery lasts 4 days and charges in the time you take a shower. Best purchase. Awesome price.
 pésimo este producto, me sirvió una semana de ahí en adelante nunca más sirvió. solo muestra la hora y el soporte técnico es malo también, no han podido dar ninguna solución. Lo peor es que ahora leyendo en foros y en el mismo sitio de soporte de fitbit esta versión en general siempre se daña.<br/><br/>terrible this product, just  worked a week thereafter never served again. it only shows the time and the technical support is bad too, they have not been able to give any solution. The worst thing is that now reading in forums and on the same site fitbit support this version in general is always damaged.
 I got the Versa Tuesday the 17th and have enjoyed it so much! The battery life is amazing, I haven’t had to charge it once yet and that’s with me using it a lot. I love the design, small but not to small. Easy to use and is just all around a good Fitbit!
 BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM FOR CHRISTMAS BECAUSE HER OLD FITBIT STOPPED UPDATING AND STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER:(. WASNT SURE IF SHE WOULD LIKE THIS, BUT SHE LOVED IT AND WEARS IT EVERYDAY. ONLY DOWNFALL i WOULD SAY IS THAT IT CAN ONLY RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES WITH SIMPLE YES OR NO REPLIES (that are preset) as well as can also respond with emojis or smiley face. Wish you could type your own text response as well as WISH IT WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE/PLACE/RECIEVE CALLS. BUT IT SADLY DOESNT, WHICH SUCKS. BUT OTHERWISE MOM LOVES THIS WATCH.
 I wanted a fitness watch that had some apps but wouldn't become a second phone. I love this thing! It keeps me up to date on the time, tells me when I need to get up to make my steps each hour, and gives me notifications for text messages. There are so many features I haven't used yet, and I can't wait to figure them out!
 This is by far my favorite fitbit that I have ever owned it feels comfortable on my wrist and I love the sleep tracking.  I would give it a 5 but I have small wrist and the face is a bit large on me, but otherwise it does what is suppose to do.
 Initially this Versa watch worked exactly how Fitbit said that it would. Since I'm still one of the few Windows 10 phone users I'm sure that a lot of the sync problems and notification consistency problems were due to this. I however am giving this only 4 stars because it died while I was taking a shower and it's supposed to be water resistant and rated for 50 meters. If you're reading this and thinking about purchasing, this is a nice wearable, but please put it though its paces before you can't return.
 lots of glitches and malfunctions. looks pretty good. now it doesn't work (had it for less than 2 months) and amazon will not let me return?
 I have no way to use the music feature of this watch. I am very disappointed to find out that my Windows 7 laptop can not be used to download music to the watch. Only Windows 10 will work because Microsoft wrote the only app that can be used for that feature. The watch does connect to the laptop over USB so you would think you could use that to download music but no. Apple also has an app but you can't use that app with a Windows PC. An android phone also CAN NOT be used to download music to the watch. Every other feature of the watch will work with either an Android phone or a Windows 7 PC but not the music downloading.
 To date, not one problem, issue or cause for worry. FYI: when I'm not using my watch, I turn it off. I'm sure that helps. Battery life has remained 4 to 5 days on one charge with all settings on... since I purchased the watch (3 weeks to nearly a month ago). Highly recommended if you do not want too much of an extremely "smart" watch. For me, looks and works as advertised!
 This thing is awesome. Holds a charge for a few days and has a great sleep tracking feature. Only thing is that it is often difficult to wake. If i try to check the time, I usually need to tap it a few times to activate the screen. I compared this to a friends apple watch and theirs woke right up every time.
 I’ve had my Versa for over a month now and I wasn’t sure to get it or not because some of the reviews on how the Versa had a lot problems. I haven’t had any problems with mine, it has worked great, the battery lasts 4 days like it says. I really like the sleep tracker, it is more in depth than other fit bits. Only thing is for people looking to get a smart watch, this might not be for you. The Versa is still more fitness tracker than smart watch with its functionalities. Overall great product
 I have a Charge 2 for a year now but the notification is very limited and was eyeing Versa for quite a while. Fortunately, there was a big $50 discount during the Black Friday sale and I couldn't be more happier. I lived on the other side of US and was very happy with Amazon Global - affordable shipping fee, accurate real-time tracking &amp; was delivered 4 days after I placed my order.  Really, really happy with my purchase :)
 Love this watch. It has been great for counting my steps and providing workouts. It notifies me when nbn I haven't taken the minimum 250 steps for the day, which is great at keeping me active. It is water proof and does well while in the shower or playing in the water. I love the color of the band and the style is great!
 I am really enjoying my fit bit and knowing when I need to get my butt in gear. It's helped me be a lot more aware of what I need to do to be in better shape.
 Awesome product and great seller!  Bought as a gift and was perfect for health concious son!
 I wish it had better app sync. I like to log water consumption and the app for the watch can’t sync to my iPhone. Not to mention the Versa’s inability to log into my locked phone to con’t sync.  When it is synced, it’s a great little gadget. But no mind blowing ‘Dick Tracey” stuff here. I was hoping the cheaper alternative to an iwatch was something by Fitbit. But you get what you pay for. No notable frills despite smartwatch interface. Not worth the money. But passable enough to pacify me.
 I can't get this watch to work.  Fitbit sent a second watch to replace the first. And then I wait for a sync to happen for 4 hours and it fails.  Again. I've spent hours trying to get the upset software to finish just to be able to use it! Still nothing.  Will be returning.
 I've only had it since May and suddenly stopped working in September. I'm highly disappointed. This was an investment for me and I can't believe it died on me. Worked great when it worked.
 I had the Fitbit ionic for about a week until i saw Fitbit was releasing the new Fitbit Versa. The Ionic was just too big for a woman’s wrist (bulky), I returned it and preordered the Versa. Best decision I ever made! Much sleeker and looks feminine! Reminds me of the Apple Watch! It even has Snapchat, ring, and Facebook notifications. Love love love my new Fitbit Versa. Another plus if you can make a photo your background!
 Great difficulty connecting to Bluetooth or Wifi. Try 4-5 times and it finally connects for a few minutes. HR function does not work even though sais it is turned on. Can't change the birthdate from default. When I do the program crashes. Just a short list of issues.
 Ordered as a gift and realized afterwards there was a known defect that caused the step count to register even if not being worn.  Steps would register if it was sitting near any electrical appliance (my refrigerator for instance) Fitbit support knew of the issue but of course kept selling the item.  I only noticed this after the 30 return policy but Amazon allowed the return.  Not at all impressed with the fact that Fitbit continued to sell the item knowing there was a glaring issue.
 Bought the Versa for my daughter- in- law for her b.d.  She does fitness training every day and teaches first grade.  She really liked her Versa, said she felt very happy like a young girl getting her first watch.  She wears it everyday and has it synced to her fitness app.  Excellent product.
 This is my first smart/fitness watch.  I love the features and the tons of clock face options. It's great to keep track of workouts, steps, etc.  Sometimes raising your arm to look at the time doesn't always show the time, so that's a little unpredictable and annoying.  Otherwise, it's a great watch and a nice fitness tracker.
 Great watch, does what expected and then some! Love the clock face option.
 While it was working, it was great. I liked that even though it looked bulky and big, it didn’t feel like it. It did everything it was stated it would do. Battery life was excellent. I pretty much charged it once every 6-7 days.<br/>All of a sudden I noticed that the battery life was extremely low. This lasted for two days, I had to charge it about every 12 hours and I wasn’t able to swipe anything. then it died and now won’t come back to life. It has some weird lines across the screen and that’s it. Thankfully I still have my HR2 that I now reconnected. Won’t be buying the Versa again and I don’t recommend it.
 Great value for money. Still getting the hang of the full capabilities, but so far so good
 I've had this watch now for about 4 months. I really like the watch it does everything it says it will do. I change the ban on the watch because the band is not breathable but you can receive phone calls on the watch reply to text messages with quick responses it's a great watch over all.
 I just wish it had better and more faces. The ones that are available are Mickey Mouse quality and you have to pay for others. I would pay for a watch face but it should be excellent and easily read able. Some of the letters are so small i can see them.
 I’ve really enjoyed the Fitbit Versa so far, I really like having the option to see the time, steps, minutes of exercise, calories burned &amp; heart rate all on one screen.
 Received the Versa as a Mother's Day gift in May 2018. I wear it constantly, and through the trouble-shooting with text and call notifications (there was a software issue and notifications didn't work for a month +), I really liked the interface and feel of the watch. That is until I woke up after charging my watch last night to it being incredibly hot, almost too hot to handle, and now it will no longer power on. Really disappointed that it failed inside of four months!
 Works very well and battery life is great. I accidentally scrapped mine against a concert wall and it only suffered on minor chip. Love that it's completely health focused and with the current update you can view even more stats from your watch, and enter your water intake. Also, the connected gps works great! As a runner, this works so much better than the Ionic gps. Only thing I will say is it's a lot more pink than the picture shows. I wouldn't call it a 'rose gold' necessarily.
 Love the look and how it works. I have showered and been in the pool with it and still works. The Battery on my watch usually lasts from Monday morning to Friday afternoon. The only down side is that my notifications (texts and calls) works once In a while, when I had the Blaze it worked all the time. But that's my watch I dont know about others. But so far I Love the new features.
 Was debating if I should get a Fitbit or an Apple Watch.  I was fortunate enough to have a friend lend me her Apple Watch.  Hands down, I am glad I got the Fitbit.  As much as I love Apple products, the watch was a thumbs down for me.
 Loved this watch but it started breaking out my wrist so I had to switch back to Apple
 I am sure this is a fine watch for tracking your heart rate and basic fitness data, but if you are a Mac user and hoping to transfer your iTunes library, BEWARE.  The watch is not set up for this.  When you download the Fitbit Connect software, which is required to manage your music, you strangely see that Versa is not listed. After many hours of frustration and checking the online users, customer support finally acknowledged that you need to Manage your music with a PC.  I suspect that some day, one day, the watch will work.  But not today.
 I love every Fitbit I’ve had so far. I like how the Versa looks on my arm. It’s not big and it’s not small. It’s incredibly light weighted and I think it’s a great option if you don’t want to overpay for an Apple Watch. The only differences I’ve noticed from the Apple Watch that would be cool to have are the possibility of pinging the phone and answering calls without a headphone.
 Not worth the price. Syncing unreliable. Lousy algorithm underestimates stair counts - especially if you live in a house with short staircases like a split level home or a landing where the stairs turn. I go up and down stairs all day and end up with a count of 2 stair levels.  Useless.<br/>Sleep tracking worked well at first but now skips long segments in the middle of the sleep cycle.<br/>Don't buy.
 Second time we have tried this watch. Absolutely horrible product, won't sync, won't get on wifi. Ruined Christmas for my wife.
 Have had it a few days but am liking it so far.  The wide face is great and the feature to change it is wonderful.  At a glance I can tell where I stand at that point in time.
 counting steps are wrong it’s counting every movement of hand, while driving while working on some thing also it’s counting means it’s inaccurate steps which is very bad.
 The watch is amazing! It preformes best as a fitnes tracker but also has some great apps and features that would compare to the best smart watches. The only issue I had was swapping out the bands and installing a case on the watch. Both of these tasks are difficult and it feels like you would possibly break the watch every time you do it. However, the watch is very durable and has had no issues so far. Definitely a must have for an active person!
 Feel comfortable, Meets all Fitness Purpose and Excellent Analytics. In spite giving one * less because outer shell / body seems delicate, Can be improved in Guage n Strength.
 I wear my Fitbit Versa all the time - all day and all night. I finally trusted it to swim and it still works fine. Tracking calories in and calories out is helpful. Can’t say enough good about this Fitbit. Many exercise tracking features - run, walk, hike, swim, treadmill, bike, etc.
 I LOVE this version of the Fitbit Versa.  Too bad that it was almost impossible to locate on then Amazon Website.  Typing in "Fitbit Versa" does not produce all of the types and colors of the Versa that are available.  You are shown one black Versa (which I originally purchased) with lots of cases (that I  bought, but personally didn't care for) and lots of replacement  bands, that I also bought a few of at the same time.  I then went to the official Fitbit site and was shown the full array of watches available.  Returned to Amazon and typed in the full description as seen above, to finally have more than one choice.  It could at least show, on the black watch page, the other color options on first perusal, not making one, nearly or completely check out ,before seeing that there are other color options, or as in my case, not seeing it at all.  The primary differences in this and the regular Versa:  In settings then about you can return to factory settings.  That is because, it has smart pay on the watch.  There are also a few other differences that are all good upgrades to my "Blaze"  that I lost when one of the pretty metal replacement bands came loose while I was going about town. I hadn't planned on buying this, but I'm glad that I did.
 Best investment ever!!!! Love the ease of the set up....the style....so far the battery life is AWESOME.  I used the Blaze until I literally wore it out (used for 2 years)  Decided to bump up to the Versa....NO REGRETS!!!!
 Works great. When worn in the shower the water does activate the gesture features.
 Looks great but now it dosen't work at all. Stick with your flex 2 if you have one.
 Love the watch! It does, however, send you multiple reminders for the same texts.
 Only been using a week but so far its awesome. Everything works as intended and the various functions are very accurate as compared to a pulse oximeter and pedometer separately.
 Great watch for the price, does exactly what I hoped it would do. Track HR and a variety of exercises. Love the app and I wear it every day, it can even get wet! Worth the money and I can't wait to purchase the interchangeable bands that go with it as well.
 Nice size easy, to navigate, light and not bulky....just disappointed it does not support IPhone call answering or text quick reply... hopefully these functions will be integrated with the IPhone ....This is why I’ve given this a 4 star rating
 I was a little scared because I have a small wrist.. but I love it! It doesn’t look/feel to big! I love that you can change the clock face! It took a bit to get everything going but it does say it could take 30 mins. I love it!
 So far it’s working out pretty good, no complaints.
 I love my Versa. It’s comfortable and fits my wrist perfectly. I also am amazed at the many watch faces I can choose from. If you are looking for a Fitbit to buy, this is the one!
 It's only been a day, but I'm tickled by what an improvement this is over my experience with the Charge 2.<br/>The more traditional watch shape is much more comfortable on my wrist, than the narrow Charge 2.<br/>It stays in place and doesn't tilt and blast me with green lights in the night (my scar hurts with flashbacks to the Charge 2 attacking me).<br/>The watch face options let me pick a face that isn't as alerting when it ignores the Manual Screen Wake setting in the night.  (The Charge 2 was practically a flashlight and would set my alertness level to fully woke with worry that it will wake my wife as well.)<br/><br/>Add in the water resistance and the ability to switch bands (I'm 6' 7", but can go with the small or large band), and this is definitely the Fitbit for me!
 Loving my fitbit versa,,,,its easy to use and easy to read ....goes four days without needing to be charged...i was going to get the iphone watch ,,but this one does just about everything the phone watch does and it was cheaper..ery happy with my purchase
 I received my versa for Christmas and was instantly in love. I wanted to upgrade from the fitbit charge(zero problems for a year) and it was exactly what I expected. Only having it for 3 weeks my screen started acting up, then my battery would drain SO fast. I didn't even bother calling fitbit as I've read their customer service just causes even more frustration. I love the watch and all it does, so I decided to just replace it through Amazon. Only going this three stars in hopes that the second one works like a charm...if not, I'll definitely be changing it!
 I picked this over the apple watch. Didnt need all the functions and bs the apple watch has. This is also 100% water proof. I soak it in water every day. Never take it off besides when I go to sleep. Also a long distance runner and have found the GPS is 95% of the time dead on as far as accuracy goes. You wont regret this purchase. Also just dropped the price!
 Like it more than I thought I would.  Tracking of my weight training is pretty good but it misses half of my swim.  Unless your arms are moving it does not count the laps.
 I'm in love with my Fitbit Versa. It does so many amazing things. I am constantly on my feet at work all day, I was tracking my steps on my phone but then I realized It wasnt accurate because I didnt always have my phone on me. So I wanted to get this to get a more accurate step count. I usually never wear watches, but this one is so cute and stylish and practically goes with any outfit! I also love how it tracks my sleep, I can read my texts, answer phone calls, change my music, has an alarm, tells me when to take a break and relax with deep breaths.
 This model of the fitbit was wonderful until the watch face separated from the watch 5 months after I brought it. Purchased the warranty. 65 minutes on the phone with Amazon to figure out how to utilize my warranty. The customer rep told me eventually that my watch was still under manufacturer's warranty. Call the manufacturer 5 times. Still have not  received a rep lacement watch. Loved the product but feel cheated.
 Such a great watch! I’ve noticed having this watch I try taking more time to get more steps (exercise) in. It feels and looks great and very well made! I love that there are so many features and you have options to change out the wristbands.
 Great battery life, lots of apps and functionality as well as being more responsive and reliable than my 1st gen Apple Watch!
 I love the exercise tracking, especially the ability to customize when the watch informs me of progress. I hike a lot, do I like being notified every half mile of distance covered.<br/><br/>Being able to have a few set answers to texts is super handy when I'm at work or hiking.<br/><br/>The best feature is being able to store and access my music straight from the watch.
 Love the Versa! So easy to use, and does so much. Reminds me to get my steps, keeps track of my calories and water intake. Helped me set my fitness goals.
 Best fitbit ever!!! but the battery runs out very quickly especially if you have all the apps on there (ie uber, 2048, united and many others). I recommend this as an everyday watch and it is very very easy to attach different bands and accessory’s like the protective case and screen protector.
 My earlier review of this watch was negative since the heart beat monitor was not working correctly by reporting too high a rate (at least 20bpm fast).  That issue was resolved easily by calling customer service.  They requested I turn the watch off and on and synch it a number of times etc. etc. and it now works perfectly as advertised.  Very happy with this purchase!
 This is my first experience with a smart watch. I was concerned at first that the watch would be bulky and stuck out from my wrist, but that is not the case. It is flush with my wrist and it is very low profile. Set up and installation was very easy. It links up with my Strava account and automatically posts my runs.  I highly recommend this watch.
 It completely stops tracking steps. I've walked for two or three minutes without it moving. I am going to try for some tech support but am not hopeful because of other reviews. Wish I had read them before I purchased.
 After 7 months they update it. And the update messed everything Up. The battery lasts 1 day only with luck
 It has everything I want on it, and its helping me take my fitness to the next level.
 I couldn't decide between the Versa or the Ionic. I went with the versa because I don't need a GPS on my watch, when I have one on my phone. I'm not a runner so I don't need to track and map my runs.<br/>I love the versa.
 I love this watch. I had an older version fitbit watch and this one is way better and i would not go back. I dont have any problems with it, ive had it for over a month now. I love the purple band and love that it is lightweight.
 I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and out of the box it worked fine. Found out today that it no longer turns on or responds to any actions. This is the most expensive paper weight i have ever owned. I thought I was buying a quality brand yet here we are. 10/10 Would not recommend
 I have about two weeks, give or take a couple days and It looks awesome and all that, but didnt the charge was suposed to last 4 days? And it counts steps while im sitting....I dont remember having that issue with my previous Charge 2...is that normal or my Versa is defective? Thinking to return it.
 This thing is amazing. Battery life is long. I only have to charge it every 3 or 4 days. And then it doesn't take long to charge it at all. I usually do it as I'm getting ready and having my shower in the morning. I like how I can have all of my information all on one screen and I don't have to scroll through like older models of Fitbit.
 My battery life SUCKS. Don’t even get a full day out of it. Minimal usage. I miss my Blaze this is awful.
 Ordered the first one in July of 2018. It went blank screen and never worked again in February 2019. It was replaced under warranty and the new one was working properly until March 31st when the heart rate monitor started to not work. After 2 factory resets it was working fine then  at around 6pm April first it went blank screen and will not come back on.
 I researched Fitbit’s various devices and kept coming back to the versa and finally chose it over the others. Some of the particular reasons were due to it’s waterproof aspect, the cycle prediction, and it’s overall stylish and comfortable aspects. And it simply has a lot of apps that come in handy, especially in helping one achieve any exercise goals and endeavors in living a more healthier lifestyle.
 Overheated and stopped working two months after activation.  Fitbit customer service was not very helpful.  I had to send it back, and have been waiting to receive a replacement.<br/><br/>This is my 9th Fitbit in 2 years.  I received a credit from my employer and our health insurance provider, or I would not have purchased another Fitbit.  Going to switch to another fitness tracker to get a more dependable device.
 I asked my husband for one of these and then he saw how cool they were so he wanted one too. So I bought this one for him. Mine is black and his silver. We love the way we can get messages, see who is calling, and how it tracks our walking activity.
 I'm no techno geek, so for whatever it's worth, this watch is pretty cool. I can get it wet and it keeps on working. I took off one star because I'm never sure what to use to track my elliptical use and it would be nice if the battery life was longer. Otherwise, fairly easy to use.
 I love it! It tells me everything I need to know (heart rate, calories in, calories out, minutes active...etc). The most motivating piece of equipment I’ve ever owned!
 I’ve had my Versa for a few days now and I love it! It’s easy to use, the battery life is great and it’s really helping me to get on track with my health and fitness. The food tracker has such a large database which makes it so simple to look up any type or brand of food I’m really impressed. It has been interesting to see my sleep patterns also I have never tracked my sleep before. If your thinking about buying the Versa it’s definitely worth it!
 I love this watch! I never thought Id want or enjoy a smart / fitness watch but I am so happy to have this watch in my life. Tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, cals burned, has workouts for you to follow along with, so cool! Also you can set it up to show notifications from your phone as well as vibrate when someone is calling. Very pleased.
 Love this watch! The Apple watch is way too expensive and I didn't need all of its' features. This is the perfect activity tracker and very accurate. I'm so glad that I receive notifications from iMessage! I was anticipating that I wouldn't be able to because Apple is so awful about having their stuff work on anything OTHER THAN APPLE!
 I've had it for a week and so far, so good.  The only thing I wish is that it would download my music from Spotify instead of Pandora.
 I have been using Versa for a couple of days now.  After, 4 or 5 others fitbit (I still miss my One!), I must say this is a great improvement. I am not fully confident on it, as there are many new options to explore.  But, I am very happy I upgrated.
 Love the Versa! It motivates me to be more active. The peach color is gorgeous and the bands stay put.  I really like all the features the Versa has compared to an older Fitbit I had a few years ago.
 I am not too happy that I am not able to view my text msg , it will alert me I have a msg, when I click on the envelope I get no text, but it shows me  (Nothing new here) you're all caught up. I have tried chatting with someone on the fitbit site and they were not able to correct my problem. I get everything else. This is not making me a happy person.
 I've been very happy with Fitbit products in the past. Unfortunately with the Versa, I've been having lots of syncing issues to my mobile device. Usually requires a reset on the watch and phone, and a force sync to get the steps, heartrate, and distance data onto the app. Never had this problem with other Fitbit devices. Until this problem is rectified, I would actually not recommend this product if you like analyzing realtime or near-realtime data from the watch. Overall: the watch itself functions great, but getting the data from the watch to the app is a painful process.
 So far so good. Still trying to figure it all out
 I like the Fitbit so far. Didn’t think I’d be paying attention to all the activity data but it does make a difference. I find myself walking or taking extra steps; especially when I am close to my daily goal.<br/><br/>The current and most annoying issue I have is that the steps do not always reset. One day it will reset to 0 and the next day I’ll have 6200 steps logged. One day I had 32000 steps logged. I’ve been trying to research the issue, turning Fitbit on/off, resetting, etc but still have the issue. I want this to work but not having the ability to reset steps is annoying
 I had crazy high hopes for my first Fitbit...but the Versa didn’t,eat them. The battery life is ok (3-5 days depending on use). I don’t like that it doesn’t activate every time (or even half the time) I bring my wrist up. It only does that maybe 1/4 the time...very annoying. Also, the step counter is a bit wonky, I don’t feel like it’s accurate at all. I haven’t been able to use it for running yet, but will update when I do since that was my main purpose in buying it.
 Very fast shipping. A lot more features then the Fitbit blaze. Easy to setup and pair to phone
 I love this! It fits well and isn't bulky like other smart watches. It holds so much useful information that I actually enjoy working out!
 Everything i ever wanted in a Fitbit. Love that you can choose which notifications come through and change the background of the watch face. It has everything I need in one!
 Constantly a disappointment. I've only had my watch for a little over a month. I am having to restart bluetooth to get it to sync regularly.  It also seems to lose my heart rate and therefore, doesn't track my sleep about once a week.  It is very disappointing relative to the Alta.  I bought it primarily because of the reasonable price and the size. Most other Android smartwatches are too big for my wrist.
 So the Fitbit Versa is my 3rd style of Fitbit.  I just have to share I am very unhappy with the style of band . It is woven and if you get it wet weather you are washing your hands or if your wrist sweats the band starts to smell. It came with 2 bands so you have a plain black one too. But it does not match well. I like the features it has too but kinda mad at myself for spending that much money when my fitbit charge 2 was just as good.
 I love it. I’m not an Apple Watch kinda girl but it’s real close to it. I love all the clock fave options and the fact that I have an alarm in it puts it over the top. Thanks Fitbit for making this less bulky than the Surge.
 I’m in love with this Fitbit. It was really easy to setup, and use. I have the “reminder” on my watch to remind me to get up and move. Which was a big seller in this style for me.
 Buyer Beware!  When you search for Fitbit Versa Special Edition you get this item.  And in the description it even mentions that the Special Edition handles NFC payments, which leads you to believe that is what you are getting.  But the Versa arrived without that feature. Very poor job by Amazon not describing the product accurately and not providing a way to purchase the NFC payment version.
 I love it. Only issue I have with it is the pins to change the bands are so difficult.
 I absolutely LOVED this watch for the first 2 months that I had it. It kept me motivated, allowed me to keep track of my text and meeting notifications, and was overall a wonderful present to myself.<br/>Unfortunately now it will no longer stay charged for longer than 4 hours. 4 hours--for a product that is supposed to keep a charge for 4 DAYS. I've searched numerous websites for solutions, and it seems like this may be a common occurrence.<br/>2 stars because it's still pretty to look at, and will work for a least half of my work day.
 This product wouldn't work with my phone and none of the trouble shooting worked. After reading reviews I can see that this is a common problem with this product and has been for a while. I was really looking forward to using my new fitbit but I was extremely disappointed.<br/>Would have given it a zero but I had to put at least one star for the review.
 The learning curve on the fitbit required a lot of patience and I was lucky to have a friend who had already broken hers in so she could help me.  But, I have enjoyed the journey and am learning new thing all of the time.
 First smart watch I've owned and I am loving it.  I get all my notifications super quickly and have had no connectivity issues.  The battery lasts a long time, I do not have it set to all day sync, and I don't use it for sleep tracker so I turn it off at night.  I was super on the fence about purchasing this because of some negative reviews, but I'm loving it!
 My wife switched from Apple to Android and sold her iPhone and watch. She absolutely loves the Fitbit and says she has no regrets making the change. She feels that the fitness tracker on this is much more accurate.
 This was a lot more comfortable then I thought it would be...not at all bulky feeling.  Love all the features of the Fitbit Versa.
 The Versa watch and FitBit app have helped me get back in shape. It pretty accurately tracks workout times, distance, floors climbed, and heart rate. I prefer this over my old Apple Watch (series 2), which was double the price and broke within a year.
 I’ve had it for a week now and it’s been nothing but amazing. I’m a runner, used it for exercise and played with it a lot, and battery life is great. Stats seem true to what I’ve experienced with other products. It’s super lightweight, was concerned that it will feel bulky and too big for a small female wrist, but I often forget I have it on. Fitbit Pay works well too, tons of clock faces to choose from and enough apps to make you happy too. I hear people say it’s hard to change bands, I did it multiple times in the past week and didn’t have a problem at all. When buying I was going mostly for a fitness component, and picked Versa over Apple Watch and I couldn’t be happier with my choice.
 Boy have this 1 day but early impression: Looks great, innovative strap design (more than what you see) and material feels good on wrist. Recommended.
 I am on my 2nd Versa and it too is having battery issues after about a month. This one is a replacement as the first one quit working with the same issue. Fitbit will NOT provide a refund so I guess I will have an arm full of useless Fitbit Versas as I will make sure I keep getting replacements until I get one that works or they do the right thing and give me a full refund!
 I upgraded from an Alta hr model. The Versa is great. I like that it is waterproof, has full view of text messages and other alerts (rather than just a preview like on the Alta hr). There are limited apps available for the Versa, but I bet Fitbit is working to improve that and launch more. Overall, it does everything I need it to.
 Really LOVE the look and the feel of the strap.  Customized the home screen with a personal photo/memory.  Could choose style of watch font/size/design.
 Looked at purchasing the Samsung smart watch but for the price Fitbit is perfect. Get many of the same features as the Samsung but wanted the step and exercise tracker also. Good value. This is my fourth Fitbit - they just  keep improving their product.
 I’m liking it, not happy that it’s not letting me know what that my Iphone is messaging or calls are coming... would have sent it back just fir this but not sure I can ... we shall see... tracking walks and sleep is nice, I can’t feel it in bed so comfortable to wear
 Frankly, it is simply too complex for me to operate and the screen while bright, is too small to be convenient.  I am returning it for the simpler Charge 3.
 I’ve never written a review before but just have to say: I love everything about this thing! Combined with the Fitbit app and community, it’s amazing.
 I love it! My husband got it for me as a bday gift and I just love it. I have had the charge 2 for the past two years and it has been faithful, bit I love the versa. There is so much more you can do on the app and with the watch itself.
 I am rather pleased with overall experience; from the moment I placed order to the moment I recieved. Amazon kept me informed. Is the could shorten the overall shipment time, it would be more satisfying.  About the watch, I am happy with its light weight, the user interface is rather simple, nothing fancy.  One small issue - I can’t change click face, may be I am running iOS12 beta. Anyway, no big deal.  I will keep shopping with Amazon. Great job.
 It's very sleek and I love that you can truly pick customized faces now, not just the preset options supplied by fitbit. I also like that small and large bands are both included in the box. It was like finding a needle in a haystack when I wanted a small for my last fitbit, and I ended up with a large that I just wore on one of the smaller settings. A real small fits me much better and actually keeps contact with my skin; so I'm looking forward to more accurate readings. I'm  also excited about trying this in the pool since it's waterproof!
 Love my Versa! Such a great watch to track all your activity.
 Awesome watch. A lot more comfortable and sleeker looking than the blaze. Love the apps you can put on it, clear screen display, and ease of use.
 Omg thing missing is quick replies for iPhone.
 My 5th different fitbit and the BEST. ONE. YET!<br/>Do yourself a favor and get the new Fitbit Versa if you have any wants in a fitness tracker. Amazing, sleek design. GREAT app features.
 I traded in my Apple Watch (too gadgety) for the Fitbit Versa and I couldn't be happier. I like how the Versa is a really great fitness watch that will let you view texts but not too far by keeping my email on my wrist. It seems to do a very good job of tracking my steps, heart rate, and exercise, and syncs flawlessly with MyFitnessPal. The battery life is exceptional - 4 days solid - and it charges while I'm getting ready for work in the mornings.<br/><br/>It took me a minute to figure out how to get the band on and off. Otherwise, this has been a great product experience.
 This Fitbit is garbage. I've had it for 2 months and in that time its had several problems. I've had to do the hard "restart" 4 times because the screen goes either solid black or solid blue. It's an easy fix but not something you should need to do for a brand new watch. If your going to spend several hundred on a smart watch might as well get one that has a microphone so you can have call and text options on the phone. I will not buy a fitbit again.
 I loved my Versa for the first month and a half that it worked. Once it stopped working I was told by Fitbit customer support that they could replace my watch. However, I would need to send them my watch and once they receive it, they would send me a replacement. They estimated the process could take 2 to 3 weeks!! I don't think that is acceptable, I am returning it and changing fitness watch brands.<br/><br/>As always, Amazon is making it easy for me to make a return and order something new I will have in 2 days! Thank you, Amazon!
 The Versa worked great for what I wanted for the first 6 months (bought in April), then the stats were not being shown on the face of the watch (they did show on the phone app) but the time was working. Now (2 1/2 months more) I have to tap the watch to wake it for the reading time, the wrist turning does not wake it any more.<br/>For the amount of money this cost I would think it could last at least 2 years. Very disappointed as I hope to find a devise that would do what I needed without all the many extras that would run the price up too high to consider purchasing.
 Can’t go wrong with this watch. Great for workouts and very comfortable.
 Looks great, is light and was easy to setup. An it Also works with my Windows 10 Mobile phone.
 I like FitBits: they are capable fitness trackers. The Versa can do "apps" as well. Like all such wearables, the apps are poor approximations to the apps on your phone. Is give it 5 stars if it worked with Spotify or Google play music or you tube music.
 I purchased this a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love it.  Haven't taken it off once.  Great to keep you motivated!! I also love that you can change the face of the watch when you download the app. You can even put your own personal picture on it if you want. My preference is to keep it simple. But love that option. Overall great buy :)
 DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!  I’ve had it less than a month and while home sick in bed, it cracked even with a screen protector on. They will not replace and there is no way to fix a cracked screen. It’s a design flaw and a complete waste of $200.
 I really love this watch. It does everything I hoped for and a little bit more. I wanted to track steps, heart rate and sleep and figured out I can also track my water intake, and get the local weather. I am so pleased with my purchase. The Fitbit app works really well and if I couldn’t figure something out, somebody on a Fitbit forum (just google a question and it pops up) had the solution. Looking forward to using Fitbit!
 I bought this as a gift. She loves it and wears it all the time
 Love love love this!!  Light weight, app is perfection, face is large enough for me see without my reading glasses.  Very happy with my purchase.  Btw, I bought the Apple Watch 3 and hated it.  Went to versa instead and so very thrilled!
 We did not even get to use this product. We tried 2 different versa fitbits. We could not get it to do anything. My husband's phone said it was paired but the versa never would do nothing. Could not even get the screen to change. We finally sent both back and just gave up. Did not order anything.
 Love my watch - works great, battery lasts pretty long and fits what I needed. Would be nice to be able to respond to text messages that come up - but that’s another couple hundred dollars to have an iPhone- wasn’t that important. It’s juat nice I can see who is calling and the text that was sent

 Got this for the wife she got a Samsung Smartwatch from me for Christmas and the steps were completely inaccurate. Returned that to the store and got this for her she loves it it works great way better for Fitness then the other smart watches.
 I love how detailed the information is.
 Although it is pretty and light, the heart rate function is wildly off when exercising. The fitbit website is full of complaints about this but the company has not responded. When I called the company for support the customer service person hung up as soon as she heard my question. Also there appears to be very limited ways to regulate how long the display stays on.
 Amazing. It works great and battery lasts days. Only reason for 4 stars is the band is a little to grippy and pulls at the hairs on my arm
 Watch works well but it unsyncs itself fairly often and stops downloading my emails and texts etc.  It works great for tracking steps but it doesn't do a good job as tracking my floors.  Overall I like it but it does have a few small issues
 It took forever to setup but after the it's great.
 I loved it at first, but within the first month it stopped syncing to my phone, which was the reason I got it. Not I have a expensive pedometer that I can only look at on my wrist. Unfortunately it is outside of the return window so I can't even get my money back. Save your money and get a different smart watch or wait until they work the bugs out of this new one.
 Love this smart watch! Wearing it for about 4 months with no issues. Charge it about every 4 days. Used swimming mode a number of times. Use workout mode 5 days a week. Walk every day and watch senses I am walking. Had charger 2 for about three years before this water resistant version came out. Recommend both.
 Love it ... way lighter than the Blaze.
 STOPPED WORKING. Wont turn on or charge!
 This product would be great if it was just a fitness tracker, as a smart watch it's awful. Notifications are flaky, music controls don't work, getting the display to light up is a huge pain and it doesn't light up when you get notifications. It has been a horrible experience coming from a pebble
 Realmente el reloj no esta mal, el software de comunicacion es el problema, es malisimo, no actualiza, trae mal los datos, salta otros, se debe esperar mucho tiempo y muchas veces debo resetear el reloj porque si no simplemente no se puede, realmente no lo recomiendo.
 Previous I purchased a fitbit Blaze, I used for 1.5 year, suddenly stop charging.. I tried many ways without success, even change the charger.... I purchased the Versa, to give a second opportunity to the brand, but looks like I waste my money, I cant sync my watch with my mobile, I tried many ways until finally, I installed with my mobile, Now I am trying to sync to update it, but same problem, I cant update the data from my tracker and mobile.... What a waste
 Muy útil y práctico.Me fascina los programas de ejercicios y la toma de ritmo cardíaco . Lo único es que lo compré en agosto y podía sincronizar ahora ya en septiembre no he podido sincronizar se pone lento...
 Where to begin:<br/><br/>This product is garbage. For one, it doesn’t come charged... two, it doesn’t come with the most recent update already installed so you have to wait 45 minutes for it to install. Three, IT DOESNT SHOW NOTIFICATIONS LIKE IT SHOULD. Four, it doesn’t stay connected to the iPhone XR’s Bluetooth and everything “solution” online does not work.<br/><br/>In short, if you want something that works, get literally ANYTHING else besides this product.
 For 200 usd it is very good. If you have enough funds to afford apple watch go for apple watch
 I was excited about the features offered by the Versa, that my previous Fitbit models did not.  The main one being that the Versa allows me to swim while wearing it. I also like that the price was affordable. I have owned two other Fitbit models. So far I am very pleased with my purchase and and highly recommend the Versa.
 I am very pleased with this product. The battery lasts very long and it recharges quickly so that you don't miss a beat... Literally.... The screen is great and easily visible. I am able to see my sleep schedule and share with others to compare. Best of all, the Device is slim and does not bother to sleep with
 I switched from qn alta to this i really like it so far holding up well.  Seems to sync better tham my alta did
 This is a great upgrade from the Blaze. I love all the features this offers. I am just a little concerned with the battery life. I will monitor this closely being this was the main reason my Blaze had to be returned.  This is a beautiful watch.  I hope to be able to enjoy this for a long time.
 Overall a decent watch when used as a fitness tracker.  When you try to use it as a smart watch you will get mixed results mainly due to the fact that the connection to your device is spotty at best.  Some days will be great and other days it won't connect at all.  I'm hopeful that Fitbit will come up with some updates to make the watch more functional.  If they don't, I'll be looking to move on from them and it would be a shame considering that they have had good products that I've used over the last 4 years.
 Purchased for my wife’s birthday.  Did not know the return date had passed when she opened it on her birthday.  She does not like it because there were no instructions telling her how to use it in the box.  It is way to complicated for her to use. She would like to return it but amazon will not take it back because I purchased it too far ahead of her birthday.  Will not make that mistake again with Amazon.
 way better than the fit bit charge 2, does not hit against the bone of my arm but is much more comfortable and sleek. resembles apple watch
 I love the look of the Versa, but the ability to change the band is just plain awful!!!  The ionic is super easy to change (but a little uglier), but the Versa band changing is a step in the wrong direction!
 I love this watch but had I known that it would scratch so easy I would have bought protectors for it. When you spend $200 on something and it basically gets ruined in one day it's frustrating. So if you buy this please buy the glass protection just like you would for your phone. Its an easy watch to use.
 I loved this watch but it has not worked well. It quit receiving texts after two months. I have talked endlessly to FITBIT support and they just have me reset it up, then when that doesn't work they say they are working on the problem and and to check back. Also, I had to replace the band because the clip broke.
 Great smart watch does everything you could want and the battery life is amazing. I am alittle sad they still haven’t set up the pulse oximetry since that was the main reason I bought it.
 The Versa is a so comfortable that you'll forget that you have it on. It's tracking features gives you great motivation to be active. I use the exercise feature quite frequently and also enjoy having the weather easily available. Sleep tracker is interesting as well. Text, call, and instagram notifications are convenient while not being too obtrusive.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a true smartwatch like an apple watch I would say this is NOT what you're looking for. But if you want a great piece of technology and your main motivation is getting fit with a couple key features, this would be for you.
 Not a lot of apps available to download. I also thought I would be able to respond to notifications, but that is not an option. Overall a very nice watch tracking wise, but the selection of apps and the lack of responding to texts made me return it.
 The fitbit versa is a pretty nice fitness watch. The biggest downfall I have found is that this watch has a issue with syncing with a lot of phones. I have a LG v20 and its not syncing. I had to use my iPad just to set up the watch. I actually had to get another watch because the 1st one did not work at all. There are some glitches, but over all I like the watch. It motivates me to keep moving through out the day.
 This watch keeps me honest.  No matter how many times I justify my calories, the watch tells all. Love my purchase. Should have done this a long time ago.
 I bought Versa so I did not have to carry iPhone at the gym.  It turns out to be a big mistake.  The app UI is not intuitive.  Bluetooth connection is very spotty - the connection was good when the watch was near my wireless headset.  Once the watch is in the exercise mode, you cannot control music app.  Also transferring songs to the watch is a big production and take a long time (1 hr 15 minutes to transfer 8 hours of music.)<br/>If you want to get for a fitness watch, Versa works well.  If you want to get it for its music player, stay away.
 I've had continual issues with this watch syncing with my LG phone for text messages and emails. I've followed instructions and troubleshooting recommendations and still won't work for more than one day. Watch is too thick compared to Iwatch. Second best and not worth the money.
 love this and exactly what I needed to track my steps, see the burn of Kcal through the day. Love that it logs my sleep. You have options track run workouts , spin etc... which is super cool as your HR intervals will be different averages. Has come in handy that my texts come across my watch as if there is an emergency I will know. Overall great watch if you are looking for simple and convenient. It rocks!
 I upgraded from a Charge 2 to the Versa. I love the bigger, colorful font. Plus more options to add. I wish the battery lasted longer like the Charge 2 but overall I like it! Very comfy on my wrist.
 I love the versa. The swimming, Tracking and everything. You can change the clock into other clocks, their are many options. You can add apps like games or faculties, and can also delete apps. The only thing I dislike so far is that you can’t call or reply to texts, and can’t receive any notifications without your phone.
 Love my Fitbit versa!  It’s fairly accurate in tracking my steps and gym activities.  I can go about 4 days on a single charge.  I bought a case for my Fitbit and it’s worked great on protecting the screen.
 Amazing watch! Fits my very small wrist way better than the charge 3 and is very readable and comfortable. I wish it was as compatible with Apple phones as is it with androids, but love this versa
 Great look. Lightweight. Still learning all it can do and what I don't but it is so far the best unit I've had from Fitbit.
 Bought as grad gift for my daughter. She loves it! It reminds her to move and when she needs to get more steps in! . Super practical as all notifications go directly to her wrist instead of holding the darn cell phone as a permanent accessory 😀
 I've had this product 90 days (1 year warranty in effect). The battery started to die after one day and it showed my resting heart rate at 189. I contacted customer support and they acknowledged the heart rate problem but refused to replace the watch. Not happy with the customer service.  This is my 3rd Fitbit but it will be my last.
 Horrible. It has problems with sync up. Did live chat with their customer service. Was told to do everything that I had been doing for the last 2 hours. Was told that Fitbit has not tested on all Android's and that there might be some issues. Why would I want a watch that has issues to begin with.
 heart rate quit working .  Also you have to have your phone close by you for the stats to be accurate.  Really wish I did not buy this watch.
 Would be 5 but charger is odd, doesn’t lay right when charging, sometimes it’s not charging while on charger due to that. Other than that it’s awesome.
 The app fails to update and 99% of the time it will not sync to my android phone at all. I have the new LG V35 ThinQ and can not connect at all. I never would have thought that with this "great" piece of technology I would have so many issues. Waste of money and is now a dust collector...
 Love, love! Works great, long battery life but haven’t dunked it in water nor will I.
 Love my new Fitbit (husband bought for Christmas) it works lovely. Banged it against wall/table and glass is not scratched! Had to turn off all day syncing to make the battery last longer
 Battery life avg of 4 days. Does everything it advertised as. Poor syncing with phone most times. But still a great product.
 Very pretty and love the size and weight. Has good functions but could be better as compared to the pebble, Garmin, and iWatch.
 This is such a wonderful smart watch &amp; fitness watch. Such a beautiful style for men and women. Really gets you motivated. I've swam with it many times and have not had a problem. The price is a little high but it's something you wear every day and I believe is worth it.
 I love this watch. I was hesitant about buying it at first because I already had a Fitbit Charge HR 2 which I liked. I'm so glad I did buy the Versa cause it's definitely a major upgrade. I cant imagine not having it now.
 Disappointed. I did a lot of research prior to buying the versa and was really excited about my purchase. First few days it worked great. Then it started acting up, tracking steps. I would be walking around for 2 hours and have over 18,000 steps, I left the versa home one day (not next to a fan) after putting it back on, I had over 4500 steps. I had only walked into the next room.  Luckily I purchased through amazon and was able to return it with no problems. I wish that it worked out since it was everything I was looking for in a fitness tracker.
 I have been wearing my new Fitbit but Versa for a month now and I love it!!’ This Ian my first time using a Fitbit and the App is so easy to navigate. It is super lightweight. And I shower in it daily with no issues! I can’t say enough wonderful things about this!
 This product looks great and worked basically well. Part of the reason I paid more for the special edition was for mobile pay and compatibility with the Starbucks app. Neither of which worked for me. So in addition to those things as well the super putzy band removal/replacement (all versas) and the lack of built in GPS (all versas), I decided to return this item.
 As this is my first smartwatch, I cannot say for sure how this compares to others. However, I currently love this watch. It measures my heart rate and fitness information, as well as lets me know when I get a text or notification from my phone. The bluetooth setup was very simple, and the overall setup took about 30 minutes. My watch was at about 60% when I received it, which I found nice for the setup process. I like how easy I can change the bands, as well. So far I find this watch to fit my needs perfectly.
 Have had the Versa for two weeks. Pros - steps count motivates you to keep moving.<br/>Cons - 1) takes 3 or 4 wrist twists for clock face to come on. If I leave it on battery runs down in a day. Very annoying. 2) heart beat monitoring inaccurate. Close when at rest but when running is 10-25 beats too high as measured by two other heart beat monitors. 3) Sleep monitor inaccurate. Shows being asleep when awake. Overall shows about 2 hours more sleep than actual.
 Purchased this for my mother and she absolutely loves it and has praised it so much that I bought myself one.<br/>I couldn't be more pleased with my watch however I have noticed that it counts me patting my babies back when burping him as a step. Which means my step count isn't always accurate but regardless of that small hiccup, I love this watch!
 This is an update/revise of a previous review.  It appears the pedometer has a range of error and must be counted in steps of each foot not every time your right foot hits the ground.  Once educated on how it works, I can now adjust expectations. I will update again when I test the other features.
 Amazing
 Versa is what I have been waiting for.  I really like how it feels on my wrist as it is very light weight.
 UPDATED 1/12/19: my Versa has stopped working. I woke up this morning and it wouldn’t turn on. I put it on the charger (even though I knew the battery wasn’t dead) and it eventually turned on but the time was 45minutes off. I restarted it and all was fine. 2 hours later, the same thing happened again. I contacted support and was given the stock answer of doing a factory reset. That didn’t work. I got stuck on the pairing stage. Finally it worked and It finished the reset. I clicked through all the welcome screens and tried to change my clock face. Turns out, my tracker died again and my app could not find it. No matter what I do this time, I can’t get the tracker to power up. I already spent 15 minutes on hold with supper before switching to an online chat which provided no help. Thanks for a $200 bracelet, Fitbit. At this point, that’s all my tracker is. Ok currently searching for a new Garmin watch to use for my runs.<br/><br/>I was looking for a new watch to replace my 8yo Garmin Forerunner and came upon the Versa. I was excited about all of the features but mostly about the running feature. I quickly found that it’s wildly unreliable. It rarely connects to my phones GPS. If I’m REALLY lucky on one of my runs it will just frequently disconnect from my GPS and provide me with inaccurate distances and pace. However, a majority of the time, the app flat out crashes and doesn’t record anything. I contacted support and they told me to do a factory reset. Ok, I humored them and did a reset. To my surprise, it worked! For about 10 runs. Now it’s worse than ever. I will run the same route 4 days a week and get different distances measured. (If I’m lucky enough to have to tracker actually record my run that is). I really, really, really wish I had bought a garmin. I would happily give up my daily step counts and move reminders in order to have a running watch. Shame on you Fitbit for advertising a feature that doesn’t worked. You sure duped me into buying your watch!
 Bought for my mom 74 yrs old.  Simple enough for her to use without getting frustrated.  Bought for her to monitor heart rate during water aerobics.  Works great and is water proof!
 When the Fitbit first arrived the box was tampered with. It appeared that the watch had already been opened and messed with. When I tried to connect it to my Fitbit app, it wouldn’t sync with my phone so I returned it. However the second Fitbit I received was brand new and synced quickly with my phone. So far I love it but I was very frustrated with receiving a used item when I paid for a new one.
 I really love the idea behind this Fitbit. I love the design and sleek-ness.<br/><br/>But pandora won’t sync.<br/>And what’s worse is it keeps turning off on me. I’m probably going to return it and maybe try a new one. It’s just a hassle. It’s charged and supposed to last 4-5 days, and yet second day it just turns off. And I put it on the charger and it turns on to 83%. So why is it turning off?<br/><br/>I love Fitbit, just bought one for my mom and my dad took my older one. So this is disappointing and frustrating:/
 I love the periwinkle color with the rose gold. I also like the choices of watch faces available in the app. It tracks so many things and I love the battery life. I set alarms and timers on it, check the weather, use the relax app, and track exercise and steps.
 The reading is ALL the way off. Totally inaccurate. When I first put on the Fitbit it said I burned 1900 calories - mind you I had just put it on. Total waste of money. I will be returning and will buy a Samsung watch instead.
 I was disappointed to have my Fitbit for only 4 months before it completely died. Fitbit does advertise that you are able to wear in the water (while swimming) but I had it in the pool only once and it never worked again. I thought it was the charger that wasn't charging, and purchased a new charger, not working.

Looks like a used watch. If I wanted used garbage I could’ve gone to eBay and paid $89. Returning.
 I have owned two pebble watches and 2 fitbits. I thought that since pebble was bought out by fitbit that this might be just as good as the pebble watches I miss so much. Boy was I wrong! Its a standard fitbit with a few more options, all good options, but it misses out on a lot of the things I miss from my pebble. The battery does not last even 24 hours for me. I reached out to fitbit support about this and they had me run a battery test a few days ago, they still have not got back to me.<br/><br/>bottom line, I think it needed some more work.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Fitbit got back to me after writing this review. They agree that there is something wrong with mine and they are sending me a new one. I have had this fitbit for a month. I have heard of several others who have had to get fitbit to send a replacement as well. So, if you buy this fitbit, you may also have to exchange for a new one as the battery capacity may not be great, even right out of the box.
 The versa is my third Fitbit. I started with the flex then went to the Alta and now I upgraded to the versa which is amazing!! Tracks all of my weight lifting and running. I love the heart rate tracker!! The reason I took one star off is the fact that it doesn’t support Spotify in the music app or have podcasts and also I cannot rely to text messages with an iPhone.
 Would give this product no stars if I could.  This will not sync to my android or iPhone for longer than a couple of days.  Now it is past the return date, so I am stuck with an overpriced fitness tracker.
 Disappointed. I ordered this in June, but the end of August it was unusable(Of course it stopped working shortly after the return window ended). It loses all battery charge; from 100% battery to completely dead, in about 3 hours. I have done all of the things that Fitbit recommends on their websites, but nothing works. It was a fantastic product while it worked. :(
 It's been great. Keeps accurate information!
 Working well so far, only been a few weeks
 I really liked this product at first.  However, I have only had it about 6 months and my battery lasts about 4 hours now when it used to last about 3 to 4 days.  Very frustrating since it is still less than a year old.
 So far, I am very pleased.Battery life is excellent and it’s a good thing because it takes a long time to charge.I bought two of these.One for my wife and one for myself.Mine was a breeze to set up however,because she had a earlier model,I had to set up another e-mail account for her because, the fitbit account would not allow me to upgrade the device.
 When it arrived I directly open the box and charge it.. but it doesn’t work!!<br/>I feel so disappointed.. so I return it 💔
 Terrible customer service who only would swap it with a refurbished unit......I want a refund
 This is my third fitbit and first smart watch. I like fitbit’s activity tracker better than any other brands I have tried. I am also loving the versa for its lightweight and comfortable fit. Sometimes I forget that I am wearing it. I was worried about it looking too big on my tiny wrists, but it doesn’t look too big at all. It is easy to use and easy to wear. I’m very happy with it!
 I have only had it a week but love the large easy to read screen and many more features compared to my old Charge HR.
 I really like my fitbit! I had a charger 2 and up graded. Sometimes I have to double check my wrist because I feel like I don't even have my fitbit on! I recommend the Versa! :)
 Purchased this for my Wife's birthday.  She has had to factory reset it 2-3 times over the 60 days. It finally stopped responding.  2nd star is for fitbit customer service.  Amazon return closed out 60 days after purchase excluding holidays and fitbit was able to issue a return or discount on a different model.  We chose the discount on a different model.  Based on others reviews, the Versa is not ready and is terribly over priced.
 My first Fitbit.  Stylish and though I don’t use a lot of apps I love the sleep tracker and getting my text messages as I don’t take my phone with me everywhere.  Called customer service for help with buttons and they were pleasant and helpful.
 My Fitbit screen cracked after only a few months of use, once I contacted the company to find out what I could do they informed me that warranty wouldn’t cover it and also that they had no way to fix my screen for me, so basically just throw it away and get a new one! No thanks I’m taking my business elsewhere and I advise anyone else to do the same!
 Love the price and like the watch. Would give it 5 stars but I’m not getting all of my text notifications on the watch, which is ridiculous.  I have an IPhone and got this as a gift.
 Love this Fitbit. It’s stylish, functional and just a great motivater to a healthier lifestyle! It’s motivation ranges from healthier eating as is connects to my weight watchers app, getting better sleep keeping me informed of my quality of sleeping and staying fit with steps, movement and excerscise. I could say more but overall I just love this functional trendy devise!!
 I like it a lot more than I thought I wood.<br/>Had I known, would have paid a little more<br/>for the special features such as ability to<br/>pay wirelessly from Versa watch.
 I love this watch. It is very user friendly and helps a non athletic/healthy person like myself want to watch what I eat, how much I sleep, walk/exercise more, and track my weight. I love the notifications as well and quick replies are my favorite part. I haven't had any other brands of smart watches so I can't compare but I think I would still pick this one. I love the Fitbit Coach, the apps, and activity tracking.
 This is a great fit smart watch.  The watch is every bit as capable as the apple watch and a fourth the price.  My wife loves it and counts her steps daily.  Cool watch!
 Literally I only take this watch off to charge it once every 4 days or so, I can even wear it in the shower since it’s water proof! Best motivation I’ve gottwn for getting back to the gym too! 10/10 would recommend
 I’ve only had my Versa a few days.  I was wearing a Blaze since April 2016.<br/>This by far a better Fitbit, more accurate, easy to read. You can go from one exercise to another much easier. Right now I would give it 5 stars.  We will see as time goes on.
 Not a smart watch.  It doesn’t sync with iPhone for calls or messages.  It did at one point but doesn’t anymore.  It’s a good fitness tracker and sleep tracker, but if you want text, phone call, or email/calendar syncs with other apps, get an Apple Watch.
 Does what it's supposed to do. Tracks steps, monitors heart rate, etc. The recipient likes the gift very much.
 My new Versa smart watch is a nice upgrade from my previous Fitbit. The large clock face and numbers are much easier to read and the additional programs are a great motivator to move. The standard watch band is ok, but I would upgrade to a nicer version. Easy to use and set up and it tracks water activities too
 Crappy. Wish i had never gotten the versa. Features such as sleep tracking, hr monitor and step tracker doesnt work and customer service not helpful
 Loving my Versa! The apps you can use are a nice addition to the watch's fitness and time function.
 Amazing battery life!
 Love the Bersa but hate the battery. The battery life dropped from having to charge it every 4 days to having to charge it everyday. Fitbit needs to work out the bugs on the battery. Will be a great watch when the battery gets sorted out.
 Versa has a serious issue with constantly dropping Bluetooth connection to my phone's GPS, resulting in inaccurate biking distance (for example, I biked for 5 miles but the app shows only 2 miles). Running distance is OK because they use your stride length to complement the missing GPS data.<br/><br/>There are many frustrated users on the Fitbit community board, but as of October 2018 the issue is still not fixed.<br/><br/>It's too late for me to return this product so I'm stuck with this product.
 Nice piece just not like an Apple Watch bands are very difficult to change
 Having recently survived a heart attack, I wanted to track my heart and monitor progress. The goal setting, target reminders, and coaching are just what I need. It's supposed to have a blood O2 sensor also, but wasn't until l bought it did l learn the software wasn't avalable, hence 4 stars instead of 5.
 Functions and features are great but it’s not water resistant. One week old and my wife wore it in the shower and it dogged up.
 Love my versa - love the style doesn’t look like fit bit but a watch .. light not heavy just received today so I still need time to use
 I really like this watch. It’s fun to use, links to my iPhone so I can see who is calling or texting so I know if I need to rush over to my phone. Tracks my sleep, time of the month, food and water in take. Easy to use and very simple to setup.
 Upgraded from an Alta, very happy. Love that it tracks different sleep stages, also love the apps. It's just like Apple Watch but $200 less! Awesome watch, very pleased!
 I was waiting for my Versa so exciting but after less that a week of using it have to say that I am quite disappointed. It is hard to sincronize and always have to be uninstalling FITBIT  APP and install it again in order to sincronize work. Today I was doing my morning cardio routine and the versa just went off.l, I though maybe the battery was gone but tried to charge it and does not worked. Nothing. I had to reboot it following some instruction I found on internet. Really I do not recommend it. Quite disappointed.
 So happy with this purchase! It absolutely changed my life and help with some personal goals!
 Great device! Many useful functions and you can wear it in the pool!<br/><br/>Highly recommend!
 So far I really enjoy my Fitbit Versa. It syncs seamlessly through my phone and tracks as I expected it would.<br/><br/>It's the perfect size and I enjoy all of the different customizations you can have, like the customized clock face you see in the picture.<br/><br/>I love the vibration notifications and the quick reply feature for Android.
 After going swimming with this watch for the first time, it started acting strangely then completely died.  I contacted Fitbit customer service, they confirmed it should not have done this but still made me try to reset the completely dead watch.  When I told them that didn't work, they told me I had to send them a video with my case number *handwritten* in the background to prove I tried to reset it.  The video was too big to email or upload via their chat request, so I had to upload it to google drive and send them the link.  They told me unless they had that video they could not proceed to the next step.  So once I waited for them to review that, they said I could send it back to them to look at.  IF they determined it was defective after looking at it, then they would send me a replacement.  At the fastest, it would take 2-3 weeks to get a replacement.  This whole interaction with fitbit took over an hour of my time.<br/><br/>So instead I contacted Amazon and they took care of me right away, offering a refund or replacement.  I opted for a refund, because I no longer want anything to do with the Fitbit brand after this!  There are so many other great fitness smart watches available, and will pick a different brand, and definitely purchase it from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for the wonderful customer service.  So glad I purchased through them!
 My wife really enjoys her watch. She uses it for social media and primarily WHATSAPP. Its an impressive Fitbit. I bought her some accessories for it.
 I have purchased and returned many "look alikes" and none did what their descriptions said they did, or had defects right out of the box.  I finally asked my son for advice and this is what he suggested.  He included a video.  It has all of the features I asked for and I am excited to get started on my fitness journey!
 The watch worked fine for 2 months. It was a holiday gift. Yesterday the screen went black and it won't turn on, I can't reset it. The return date has passed. What a piece of expensive junk. On the website, it's very confusing, if there is a warranty, I can't find it.
 Had the Fitbit blaze passed it on to a friend and bought the versa.  So far I love it.  Everyday I find new features.  It's very interactive with the many different clock faces.  Lots of bands you can get on amazon and can change out and they're easy to change
 Easy to use, comfortable and slim. Wish it had reply to text option, more app capability, and a more customizable front display
 I’ve had the beauty of the Blaze, the brains of the Surge, and now, all in one with the Versa. Totally in love!
 I LOVE my Fitbit Versa. It’s everything I wanted, and I absolutely love that it’s waterproof. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
 Worked for a month and I loved it but it stopped working when I went swimming, even though it’s labelled as waterproof. I could see the water damage under the screen so I called the customer service and they gave me the directions to send it in. It took them over a month to even confirm they had received my Fitbit, now they are just getting to replacing it. I was told it would be 5-10 days after they receive it, which seemed reasonable until it took them a month to find it in their warehouse. Save yourself the headache.
 Really nice band.  Very sporty looking.  Fitbit Versa is a great device.  Very user friendly.
 I love this fitbit. It has so many clockface options and monitors everything.
 I upgraded to this from the Alta. I've been using it for 4 days and it's already elevated my workouts. It's really convienent to have all the stats I want (HR, calories, time, distance) all clearly visible on my watch.<br/><br/>It's really comfortable as well, I have small wrists and thought the width would bother me. Honestly, it's more comfortable than my Alta.
 In love! 😍😍😍 Perfect size, Perfect fit, good price. The Rose Gold strapp fit exactly with the color.
 I received this today and perhaps I will still learn something about it that will change my mind, but I had a Fitbit Alta which I loved, but I have to admit I like gadgets. I did not realized that this Versa did not have the Fitbit Pay chip (I would've paid the extra $30 if I had known for that feature). There doesn't seem to be as much selection for watch faces as I thought (for free or even for a charge). Those two things are a disappointment, but the coaching feature which shows on the screen should be nice...but my Alta was only 6 months old so it was not worth the $200 expenditure.<br/>Still it's nice.<br/>One day later: it does have a Starbucks app which I can use to pay after loading a Starbucks card. I also love the "Relax" feature which directions deep breathing for either a two or five minute session. (I may use that in the fall when school starts lol)<br/>As I understand after watching some videos on the Versa, the other difference between this and the "Special Edition" is the band.<br/>It would help if this page noted  near the name which watches do not have the chip. They are all listed together and I originally thought that the only difference was the band (and thought "huh, not worth $30 extra for the band" but the more expensive one has the chip).<br/>By the way, the band that this one comes with could be a bit uncomfortable in this heat, so you might want to order another type of band also.<br/>There are also some rebates offered through some of the Youtube videos. not sure if they are still valid (one is an Ebate- but you have to buy through Fitbit.com. Amazon's prices are not cheaper than fitbit.com, but maybe shipping and return might impact your decision on where to buy.
 It's nice, clear, easy to set up, motivate me to move more. Have to learn more how to add apps
 Exceeds my expectations.
 Love the watch but the band is cheap looking for the price tag.
 I love it. I only wish the watch automatically went into sports mode. And for a longer battery life.
 The watch is very nice and its features are very good, I've been using the watch for 2 months and  unfortunately the button drop off without doing nothing. When I noticed it was not there. As I saw on fitbit communit it is very common to happen this. I'm from Brazil and my warranty is not valid here, so now a I have a new watch without a button because they can't send me a button. Next time I'll buy a garmin, their warranty is worldwide.
 Bought it for my girlfriend; she says it's fantastic. She's techy, so the geekiness isn't lost on her; she's impressed by the moderate "femininity" combined with decent tech specs.
 Bought in April, worked fine until large update at end of June. Now won't fully power up nor sink. Already exhausted all known customer fixes, Fitbit Inc is reviewing my case, them seem supportive, time will tell.
 Much needed upgrade from the Alta. Comfortable and love the choices of clock faces.
 I love the versa.  I previously owned the fitbit alta. Love it also. I have noticed the the  versa does not sync well. And it bothers me because i look forward to tracking my steps daily.
 When purchasing this product, I was under the impression I would be able to access any features that were available to the Fitbit Versa. However, it turns out that you will miss out on some key and frankly attractive features if you do not buy the Special Edition. I bought a versa thinking it would be a good and affordable purchase, but I realize that in America you either pay to be Special or you miss out overall. Product is great but it is basically an empty shell of a smartwatch.
 I REALLY wish it had the find-my-phone function, and I REALLY wish it would connect to Prime music, but other than that, I love it!  Kinda big on my tiny wrist.  Love playing with the custom faces and settings.
 This was a Christmas gift so I haven't used it much yet. I bought it primarily to track my sleeping, but will also use it for tracking my daily activity.
 I ordered a replacement one since the one i ordered was defective. It’s annoying because this watch is new and they shouldn’t have rolled it out with so many issues. Ten calls two emails and two days of hassle to learn the watch needs to be replaced. So we’ll see when the new one comes in today. Maybe they will update and fix the bugs in the future.
 Bought as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it!
 I absolutely love it, it fits nice and the battery really does last a long time. One thing that I was a little upset on was that there isn’t speakers on the actual watch, or an earphone jack. But that is my fault for not reading up on that in the first place. Now it just gives me an excuse to buy wireless headphones. But overall the watch is amazing for my needs.
 Long battery life. Love the heart rate monitor and VO2 measurement.
 Love my new Fitbit
 This watch is amazing and so accurate!! I was debating whether I should get an Apple Watch or the Versa and I’m so glad I chose the Versa. Exactly what I needed without overspending
 I've enjoyed fitbit products in the past and have heard some excellent things about the Fitbit Versa, but once I received the device I realized that I, like many others, had connectivity issues between the watch and my phone. I couldn't get either the first watch or the replacement I ordered to steadily hold a wifi or Bluetooth connection. As such, I am returning the device. I've rarely been more disappointed with a piece of tech.
 No more checking my phone! All on my wrist.  I'm on track with my steps, reminded to move and have so many more features. not to mention my text messages  arrive with a quick glance of my wrist. Great watch/tracker!!
 My Fitbit Blaze took on a lot of water, so I needed a replacement. Picked the Versa and glad I did. Beside that it’s waterproof, it has a lot of watch faces and has a great display. Tough time changing bands but that was the only negative
 This version of Fitbit has too many bugs. Won’t setup. Apparently al lot of people have had the same problem. Don’t waste your time
 Still learning how to use it and take advantage of all the features, but so far it is great. Really helps with my motivation. The workout partner that is always with me!
 I am disappointed in this item . I spent 200.00 for this new released item. I have COPD STAGE 3. I thought this would be good to help track many things with my health and maybe get me some more exercises to. After I read community board and support couldn’t clear issues, I was really disappointed 😔.
 I have had this watch for less than  a year and the battery does not even last an entire day. I would not recommend this product. I called customer service after finding many people have the same issue. I am currently trying to get my watch replaced. Not at all what I expect after paying 200 for a watch.
 Love it and use it everyday. Love how long the battery life is and it’s so easy to clean/take care of. Only thing that I might be somewhat annoyed about is that i have to do a factory reset every now and then, just because it freezes/gets ahead of itself. But my absolute favorite feature is being able to pair my Bluetooth headphones with it so that I can listen to music without having to carry my phone around. Not sure how Fitbit can get any better because I love it so much.
 I upgraded from the Alta HR which I’ve worn for over a year - this upgrade was SO worth it! Easy to keep track of my HR during workouts, notifications can be viewed in full unlike on the Alta, and it looks sleek on my wrist. If you have enjoyed previous Fitbits you will LOVE this one!
 The watch faces are amazing! Total upgrade from the blaze that i had for 2 years. The bands are nice glad it came with two. Easy to learn, easy to set up.. only question o have is about the battery since I’ve charged it twice since I got it 3 days ago and I’m still testing the 4 day life battery. Not sure that it can really last more than 1-2 days with a charge.
 I got this yesterday. Started using it and so far I like it. Barely notice it’s there and very light.<br/>I did see that it over counts steps and floors climbed. I had 6 floors by 9 am and I had only gone upstairs twice. Its not a deal breaker yet but I had a Fitbit flex and I thought it was really accurate so I figured this was the same, disappointed about this. Thinking of sending it back and getting a different one.<br/>The water log app doesn’t work. I have restarted the watch twice but didn’t fix it.
 I have had this watch for exactly 6 months. All of a sudden the battery dies in less than 24 hours. I'm not happy with this watch.
 Fitbit Versa fits my active lifestyle. It’s waterproof and you can go swimming with it on. I am always on the go it’s nice to be able to keep it on while I’m washing dishes or taking a shower. Love all the new apps that you can install in your Fitbit. Biggest issue is either the app or Bluetooth it’s always kicking me off and not logging my steps. Sometimes I have to reset my versa up other then that problem I really love my Fitbit.
 I work out 6-7 days per week, having an accurate fitness tracker is extremely important to me. This is my 4th Fitbit!! I've had problems with every one of them, the first one lasted 6 months, all others have lasted no more than 3 months. I'm very careful with them, never taking showers while wearing them and charging them appropriately!  Very disappointing!<br/>I've called customer service several times only to have "the experts" tell me they don't know what's wrong.
 Really like how this fits my wrist and love how easy it is to use. Seems to pretty accurately catch my steps. I do wish they had more apps for it but I love that hey have the Starbucks app. Let’s me go for a run and grab and iced coffee without needing to bring cash along.
 I paid extra to get the lavender Woven band  with my fit bit versa.  The band is beautiful but it smells.  I have only had it since December.  Being a nurse I wash my hands a lot, I also use it to work out so I sweat with it on.  The smell is awful, there is nothing I can do to get the smell to go away.  I just had to buy another band for this that is plastic, I have never had a plastic band that smells like this.  Otherwise I like the versa.
 This is my second try with this product, the glass broke diving into the pool, Amazon graciously sent me a new one, now I am over the 30-day window on the second one and can’t get it replaced. Who designed this product to be worn daily as a watch, fitness tracker etc when the glass is so fragile it cracks at the slightest touch, I have worn my real watch for 17 years and have dropped it, bashed it and abused it regularly but guess what they use toughened glass, so it won’t break.
 The Versa is my third product from Fitbit and it is a complete disappointment. It will not connect to my phone when I use it for fitness tracking, which after all is what it's for. The heart rate monitor flakes out and the face( using a Fitbit watch face) glitches out and goes to all zeros. It's so not worth the hassle or the $200.
 Arrived today. Unboxed it and noticed it was chipped or scratched, as you can see it’s missing some of the black on the bottom right corner, very upset about it. I still set up the watch, it has nice features like many clock faces to choose from and a custom one with a personal photo. You can stream pandora from it, however only works if you have a premium pandora account which was disappointing. The only other way to listen to music would be to add songs specifically from your laptop. The size of the watch is reasonable. It’s super lightweight.
 It's a smart watch, its wonderful. It makes life feel easier, and it make me more aware of my health habits throughout the day.
 Got it for my girlfriend, she wears it nearly every day and absolutely adores it.
 This watch fits well and tracks very well except for on the treadmill. It looks really nice and I really love it. My only issue has been with the fitbit app, it doesn't always work well or sync like it should
 The product came in a timely manner, was as described and has been working great since with no issues. The price was also comparable if not slightly better compared to other sellers!
 Besides that o bought the watch  on Friday  2/1 and 2/2 Saturday the watch dropped 30 dollars really made me mad!!!<br/>especially when i was debating on apple watch or this one... but i have being using so far is good... yesterday i  used at the gym and seems recorded pretty good as mine Polar watch.
 I bought these watches for all my friends Xmas. They all love keeping track of their activities and keep thanking by me for their gifts!
 Had a fit bit blaze,and loved it. Husband wanted one, so I gave it to him, and he loves it. Now I have a fit bit versa, and I love it. One of the best ways to motivate, and keep track of our health. Great tool!
 I really wanted to like this, but it is just too inaccurate. It counts steps and burns calories while it was on the charger all night.  Also GPS had a hard time finding a signal a couple of times. My three year old Garmin never had a signal issue.  You are better off spending another $100 and 'stepping up' to a more advanced smart watch with fitness capabilities.
 Fantastic fitness tracker and smartwatch that made me fall in love with fitness!
 Great fitbit. Big enough but not over bearing in size for a woman. Great features. Don't like that they require you to pay for a Pandora subscription to use it though. I'm not paying Pandora.
 This is so amazing I love my Versa. I had the Blaze and it was pretty great too but this one is just better. I love how fast it connects to my phone for GPS and the way it sits is a lot more comfortable.
 Love it so far! Has everything I need without having to get aother wireless account for it. That’s why I have a phone! Will be trying the Coach app very soon!!
 Overall, I'd give it a positive review as it does what I purchased it for; which is tracking my miles when I run.  In addition, it tracks my exercises like biking and working out. The one major issue that I have with the Versa is the inability to download music. I am a Pandora customer; however, you need to upgrade to Premium if you want to download music. I don't want to upgrade or pay additional fees; therefore, am unable to get any music on the Fitbit. It was a major disappointment!
 It has constant synching issues with my Android and takes forever to charge in the awkward charging clamp.  Regretting this purchase.  Unpaired it and there is no bluetooth signal found.  Interesting return policy is only 45 days.  It lasted only 60
 Really like my Fitbit.  This is my first Fitbit and I enjoy counting my steps.  The Fitbit app is great and easy to use.  The battery life is nice.
 I fall in love with tjis watch every day. The calculations are awesome, the app and how you can customized at your preferences makes the Versa a daily companion. I have almost 3 weeks to have it and I haven't had any issues.
 Excellent.  Much smaller and more comfortable than previous versions.
 Loving it so far! I like the convenience of being able to see the time, date, weather, outside temp, steps, etc. at a glance!
 I was a little disappointed upgrading my Charge 2 to versa.  The clock faces, and larger face are nice but the heart rate monitor is still very inaccurate and this was important for me.  For the price I was hoping to get an accurate read on my HR for my workouts.
 I usually am a fan of the fitbit products and was excited for an option close to the apple watch. Looking at the reviews I saw others who had technical issues but didn't let it denture me. After a couple months the step tracker was way off, then things like the heart rate and sleep tracker were quick behind. Tried trouble shooting it but nothing worked. Fitbit support was super helpful in helping me get a replacement for free.
 So disappointed in the Versa. Half the time it doesn't sync with my phone app. Then the emails, calendar and text messages never show up. The apps. associated with the Versa are poorly designed and using them is a chore. When I see my friends with their Apple watches I wish I had just spent the money and bought the better product. I spend half the time trying to reset the Versa instead of using the features. Basically you are spending a lot of money for a pedometer. Don't waste your money.
 Upgraded from a charge and love it. The tracking of steps, calories, etc. is more accurate compared to similar products. The interface is easy to use and stylish. Have used it during intense workouts and swimming with absolutely no issues. I would reccomend it!
 My 4th Fitbit. Each one is better than the last. The most signed from can’t upgrade for the Versa from the Blaze is the ability to swim in it and have it track the swim. That is a major improvement as I swim a lot during the summer.
 Not the most accurate fit bit ever...  I apparently "Float" up flights of stairs since this never picks up my stair climbing.  I counted the flights of stairs that I climbed yesterday in  my house --12  Versa said 2 -- Step count isn't the most accurate either --  On the positive side -- this is easy to wear and syncs nicely with my Iphone
 Watch faces need some improvements. I also did not know I would have to pay for the good watch faces..
 Upgraded from the HR2 and am very happy. It has a lower profile than the HR2 so it doesn’t get caught on my shirt. It is lighter than it looks and the screen is really nice. Could use more apps but I’m sure those are on the way. A very good watch for the money!
 Easy to set up
 Love my new fit bit and I would've given it 5 stars but the band (which I paid more for ) is unraveling and stained after only a week of use . Save the extra money and just purchase the Rose Gold peach and buy whatever band you want beyond that .
 These watches are just amazing. Great gifts. I got one for my hubs and one for my dad.
 I originally bought a tic watch for 150$ which was 50$ more than I wanted to spend. I used it for a week but everything on it was difficult. The best thing I did was send it back and get a Versa. It’s easy to use, set up and is very accurate. Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars it’s worth it.
 Love My New Watch!  I like that there are so many faces to pick from!
 This watch really has helped me to stay on track with my goals, and I've gotten many compliments on it. I don't like the band it came with, but I ordered a softer rubber wristband, and much better feeling. Really love this product, and will continue buying Fitbit products. Thanks again for the fast delivery to me, too.
 So far so good. I just got and set this up yesterday and I do like it. I am using mine for step tracking, exercise tracking and sleep tracking although it can do so much more.
 I am really loving the versa so far. I first put it on my non-dominate wrist, which happens to be covered with a tattoo and  noticed that the heart rate monitor was not registering the heart beat.  I switched it to my other wrist that is not tattooed, and it works.
 I used this product for its step count feature and to receive notifications. The Versa doesn’t connect well to my Bluetooth and often have to re-connect it daily to my iPhone X. I contacted Fitbit customer service and received no assistance as they assumed I don’t understand how Bluetooth works. Am frustrated and would not purchase a Fitbit product again!
 Love this Fitbit! Keeps track of so much. Love the heart rate and water resistant features. Makes life so much easier with music and messages also.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
 Got it for the wife.  She loves everything about it.  And can swim with it on, no problem.
 the part I Disliked: It took a long, long time to download the apps to this watch!  (and several failed attempts before the download was successful!)<br/>the part I love:  Now that the Versa is up and running I am in love with the watch!...It is very user friendly!
 I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it! It even tells him when he has a text or phone call.  I'm getting one for myself!
 I've had this watch for a couple months now and I've been underwhelmed. I spend more time trying to get it to sync than actually using the features. This causes a lot of frustration because I constantly have to manually re-sync with my phone.<br/><br/>I wish I would have returned it during window of time allowed for returns, but I didn't... now I'm stuck with it.
 My versa stop working today..  it's not even 3 months old. Purchased July 22,2018. The battery is completely charged.. sending email to customers support.
 The fitbit app will NOT work with my phone and no it is not a flip phone. It is a Samsung Galaxy. Having the customer support guy tell me to get another phone was neither helpful nor at all reasonable.
 I love this watch! It does everything I need it to plus has a great battery life. I also love the price point. Between this and the regular versa its $40 difference and the only things really missing are floors climbed and can't add music to it. Honestly if those 2 things dont bother you, I'd buy this version and save money! Plus I'm in love with the blue color! ♡
 I love the watch face and the apps. It’s a little hard to switch the bands. So far that’s all, I’ve only had it 3 days
 My mother loves watches and has become fascinated with the touch screen faces. She recently got into fitness and I came across this perfect birthday present. Needless to say it had everything that I wanted for her.
 Pros:<br/>Accurate tracking details<br/>Long battery life<br/>Affordable smartwatch with adequate features<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Horrible sync issues with ios 12.1. Tried all sorts of tricks mentton Internet but still have issues syncing.<br/>Band material that cones default is not great. But given the price, I would not consider this a drawback.<br/><br/>Overall, if Fitbit improves its ios app, then definitely worth it!
 I've seen bad reviews, from my experience it's amazing, works as intended, not sure why people are saying it won't work after a month or two.
 It only worked for 4 weeks. I bought it for my sons birthday March  1st and it has already quit working and they won’t let me return it. So I’m out a bunch of money!!!  I am so upset about giving my son a special gift and then it quits working after a few weeks!
 I am very happy with my new Versa, the rose peach color is very flattering. I love having all the information, notifications right on my wrist.
 Even thought I returned this I thought it was a great watch.  My only issue was I waish they made it in a bigger size with a few more watchfaces.  The functionality of this watch is on the level of some of the best smart watches on the market.
 My sons watch band clip on watch broke it fell of his wrist and the screen broke. Company won’t repair. Only had it for 2 months! Said it was accidental and warranty doesn’t cover it!  Never will buy Fitbit products again!!!
 Sometimes it glitches and connectivity to your phone doesn’t happen, but I think if you are a whiz at gadgets, it comes naturally at figuring out how to solve the problem of why. Otherwise such a great product to track health and fitness with!
 Love it.  Stylish and easy to use.  Took a while to get it to pair up and get all my settings I wanted.  Still working with that.  I like the ability to answer calls and reply to texts with preloaded replies.  Not sure if you can customize own replies.  Would be nice.  Battery life is great.  Lasts about 4 days with normal notifications running.  Have used stop watch, timer, and alarm.  Changing time faces seems to take a bit of time to pair up.  Did purchase covers for face and they work great.
 It’s awes and the most comfortable Fitbit I’ve owned
 It's not very accurate with counting steps, and takes a while to get setup, but I like having it, and once i figure out how to calibrate it correctly I'll hopefully get more use out of it.<br/><br/>It also "auto guessed" that i was riding an exercise bike, and i was just sitting in a chair at a show.
 2nd Fitbit and I’m glad I bought the Versa. Sleeker than my Blaze, great battery life, improved display and graphics. I also like that I CANT respond to texts. That way I’m not tempted to interact with texts while driving.
 After about a month of using it every day, the device kept running for shorter and shorter time after each full charge. It would sometimes die right after it charged. I would recommend looking for a product with a better battery.
 Overall is very good. The battery can last for 6 days with activities tracking on. The vibration notification won't create any noise 👍. The down side is that it takes long time for software update, the fitbit app could not configure all settings (e.g. 12hr/24hr format) and payment feature is not yet available in my country.
 nice fit,  much more comfortable than the older models
 Save your money. Had this for less than 3 months and it started freezing up yesterday and now it won't charge. Tried all the tips on the site, nothing worked. Waste of $200
 I just bought the Fitbit Versa to replace my Fitbit Charger 2. What a difference! The Versa is beautiful, bigger but thinner (looks like an Apple watch). Very happy with this purchase. Thank you!
 Started having glitches after 3 months - not holding a charge, heart rate monitor no longer working, consistently freezing. Fitbit replaced it promptly for a brand new one. Two weeks later - glitches again! This time dying unexplainably while charging and no longer working.. at all! Very disheartened &amp; sad as I did a lot of research into this Fitbit before purchasing, but I guess as a new product there are clearly unresolved hardware issues that need to be given more attention.
 I love this little light weight smart watch. It is a must have!
 Purchased for wife. Works great. Only had one problem and contacted Fitbit customer help line and resolved the issue immediately. Been wearing daily for four months with no problems.
 My screen cracked while charging. Apparently Fitbit considers this watch disposable. They will not replace or let me buy another screen. I'm so disappointed in Fitbit for making a faulty product not worthy of it's intended use. Shame on Fitbit!
 Absolutely love it for half the price of an Apple Watch being an iPhone carrier. May not be able to reply to text but I’m okay with that other than that it does everything they promised. No problems so far had it 2 weeks
 Contemplated buying the Apple Watch but prefer more of a fitness than a smart watch. Upgraded from Charge HR. Pros: Price, auto dimmer (not so bright at night), interactive color touch screen, weather and calendar apps, clock face options, on screen exercise options. Cons: pin on watch band takes some getting used to, and falls out on some bands. The Fitbit App seals the deal for me, better than apple. Overall - love it!
 Este artefacto no configura con su aplicación,, llevamos 1 día y no se sincróniza entre el reloj y el teléfono, y sin la sincronización no funciona,,, hemos tratado de contactar a la página y aún no tenemos respuesta.. les aconsejo no comprarlo!! Cómo puedo hacer para devolverlo??
 This is my second smartwatch from Fitbit. And I like it as I unpacked from the box. The tracking is perfect and the connection with the smartphone improve from the Charge HR. After reading the reviews and other customers feedback about the water resistance, I am still not sure whether I should use the Fitbit in shower/bath or for swimming.
 I really like the ease of use and the amount of information for my workout.  I had a Samsung Gear2Neo and<br/>had to retire it.  A new one was too costly.  This is a great product for a great price.
 An early Christmas gift for my wife. She loves all of the features. It does everything she needs it to do fitness wide and text message and calendar notifications. The battery life is the same as the charge HR2 which is a plus!!
 Big improvement in features for this lifelong Fitbit addict. Highly recommend!
 The watch is perfect. Gives me my messages, sleep pattern everything it says it does it does. It is the perfect size for a woman's wrist.
 It’s a great upgrade from my Charge 2, it’s so smooth and comfortable. It also seems to track everything a little bit more precisely than all my previous FitBit products. Only downfall for being a smart watch is that there isn’t that many apps for it yet, but there’s always hope for future updates.
 This watch links you to "community groups" that have narcissists that post risqué selfie pics... Tinder for muscle heads?
 I bought this for my son who is an athlete and wants to keep track of his offseason activity. He loves the look, the feel and all the features this watch offers, without the high price of a smartphone watch.  It is a good investment and I am considering purchasing one for myself. No hesitation about it. Get it.
 Love it. The battery life is amazing. Easy to use. Syncs well with my pixle3xl. Had Micheal Kors smart watch before. This one is so much better and less expensive.
 Love it 4 day battery life swim w it lightweight comfy
 Love this! Worth it over an Apple Watch!
 It's an okay watch a lot of apps you have to purchase not too many good faces to choose from and the battery life does not last for days like the video shows it only last 2 days tops.
 Update:  The band gave me a rash.  Replaced it with my aftermarket Blaze band.  Don't know why it gave me a rash but I will try wearing it again after washing and air drying it.  The watch itself is still perfect though!<br/><br/>What I thought the ionic would be.  I love it so far and find it very accurate I always carry my phone for safety so connected gps is just fine.  The blaze connected gps would do some crazy stuff when road cycling but the Versa has been accurate and Bluetooth stays paired.  Love it
 Absolutely love this! I've lost lbs and inches by young more active thanks to this watch!
 I wouldn’t recommend this product to anybody. It doesn’t even deserve the one star I had too put in order to write this review. It says you can navigate through 7 modes, only 3 would work. Several problems with sinking to the app. Fitbit sent a new one and with same results. Piece of junk. My son bought a knock-off brand for $50 and it works just fine. I would never buy this product again.
 I used to love my Versa and I still do but I was on vacation 2 weeks ago and the Fitbit fell apart! Out of nowhere the glass portion came out of the holder that touches your wrist! I superglued it back in but ever since the battery sucks! It used to hold a full charge for about a week but now I have to charge it every 2-3 days. I haven’t even had it for a year and it’s already falling apart. Almost regretting this Versa
 Overall I am satisfied with my Versa. The heart rate monitor is more sensitive to position than the Charge 2.
 Beautiful display with lots of choices.  If you had earlier gen Fitbit, easy to upgrade app and pull over preferences.
 My wife is a Fitbit fan for years. I finally got the Versa and love it. Simple to set up, good watch. easy to navigate thru options and apps.  Totally and 100% satisfied!
 DO NOT BY A FITBIT. I’ve had 2 different models of the Fitbit. They’re both very inconsistent with how they track everything. It’ll go sometimes more than a week without tracking my sleep, the randomly it only tracks my naps, and then randomly back to normal. It doesn’t track my steps half the time and it takes a ridiculous amount of time to update. Point is-DON’T BUY A FITBIT!!
 Every since I got this watch, I've been wearing it everyday, with the recent update, it tracks automatically if i'm running, walking, on the treadmill or on the elliptical.<br/>The only thing I don't like is the notifications, i would get it for a good few weeks and then it doesn't work for a couple of days..  i'm not sure why that is.
 Great smartwatch does what they said it would do. Do wish had more text options. But with that said it's a great smartwatch.
 I love my new Versa!  The rose gold color is gorgeous! I am still exploring the features, but what I have found out so far, it is very user friendly and intuitive to use. Great buy!!!
 I couldn't get this watch program and talk to any of my cellphones (I tried 3 different phones, just to see if the problem was the cellphones).  Bad product, do not buy it.  It looks like FITBIT just put this product out but the product itself was not ready yet to be in the market.  This product still has bugs and issues.
 I just love my watch . The only bad thing about the watch is , after using it for a couple of months the battery needs to be charged every 2 to 3 days
 This is my third Fitbit &amp;; it is the only one I had trouble with. The heart rate stopped working &amp;; Fitbit sent me a replacement.  Happy with the seller who gave me a refund &amp;; was very kind.
 Love my Fitbit. Sleek and beautiful design.
 My husband and I have been wearing our Versa watches for several weeks now.  I've had lots of different fitbits but this is by far the best.
 I love this thing.
 It's been hit against alot of stuff still working.
 Amazing design, 5 day battery life and great price.
 Love it! Great for tracking my steps and monitor my fitness stats. Love that i can personalize my screen saver also
 Love screen size &amp; so far battery life in much better than Blaze
 Great smart watch!!  I had no problems with it.  Nice watch face features.  But in the end I am an Apple gal...
 Great watch! Really love how it looks, operates and the battery life.<br/>This is a first watch I actually like since my Pebble stopped receiving updates.
 I love this watch it’s really sleek and nice would of gave it 5 Stars but  there’s not many apps and some of the face screens you have to pay for.  They are not that good and ur unable to customize them. If fit bit could fix this It would make the watch 10 times better.
 I really wanted to like the Versa. I like the display, it is easy to read. It is comfortable to wear. The ongoing sync problem was too frustrating. Nothing from Fitbit solved the problem. I tried all the steps that were recommended from turning on and off Bluetooth, removing the Versa and resetting up. I finally got fed up with daily restarting the Versa. I went back to my Charge 2.
 This is a high quality fitness watch. It has very in depth sleep tracking, a good heart monitor and can connect to your phone’s gps for route tracking
 Versa is cool and sleek. Look nice on my husbands arm but it totally gives the wrong reading. Steps n calorie count. So upset with it. I have the charge 2 and absolutely love it! So I thought the versa would be just as great. I thought wrong.. I’ll be returning it n getting him a charge 2/3
 I love my versa. The special edition band is so cool. It's not rubber so it doesn't make my arm sweat.  I love the 4 day battery life, the fact that it charges super fast, and that I can get notifications on it. The only thing I'm not a fan of is that i can't spell out a written message like on a Samsung smart watch or apple watch. But, I still love it
 I had a Fitbit and upgraded to this! It’s wonderful! I like that you can set it on dim lighting at night.
 Piece of junk. Had my original one replaced 1 month after purchase and now the replacement quit also. Would never buy another one. Just die and wont take a charge or turn on.
 I definitely recommend this Fitbit above all. I’ve previously used the Flex 2 and Charge 2 and both had nothing compared to this. I use it every time I workout, it tracks literally everything (accurately), you can get apps including fitness related stuff, games, music, etc. The battery life is the only downside, but then again, I’m always putting it to use. I charge it every 3-4 days. Overall, great product!
 I really like this item but in order to sync with pandora you have to have the upgrade or it doesn't work. You can change the clock faces with ease, but you have to pay for some of them. When away from home sometimes it doesn't sync your steps like it should.  Over all I would recommend it and probably buy it again .
 I love it. It does everything I need it to, and very well! However it cracked a month after purchase, my own fault. However there is no way to fix a cracked screen except to buy a new watch altogether.
 Very upset with this product. The fact that I have to keep restarting both the watch and phone is rediciulous. The apps will not load. Sending this back ASAP.
 I love this watch. it's the perfect gym buddy. the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have on board gps.
 This is an amazing product! Durable, fashionable and my friends are asking about it. The display is clear and the watch is extremely responsive.
 Product always had problems syncing to my galaxy s8 and now 6 months in the watch doesn't work. For its price I would not recommend which is a shame because when it work it was nice
 I’ve only had it for a few days but so far I’m LOVING it!  I had the Charge 2 before and and happy about the upgrade.
 If this watched worked as advertised it would be perfect! I've been a fitbit customer for a few years now and this is probably my 4th item I have purchased. I specifically upgraded to the Versa from the Blaze for the swimming function. I have a bad knee and I'm incorporating more swimming into my routine. I've had this for less than a month and after swimming in it, it completely died! In years past I have had great customer service from Fitbit but not this time. This was such a pain in the rear to get a replacement. It seems that Fitbit now outsources their customer service to another country. This was challenging because the reps I spoke with followed a script so if I tried to ask a question about the product or  why it died after swimming in it they couldn't answer they just kept following the script. It was so annoying. My mother also ordered the same watch and hers died after swimming in it the first time too. They are finally sending me a new watch but I have no idea if it will work in the pool or not. I'll update this after I swim in it but I'm so disappointed in Fitbit's lack of customer service or knowledge on their product!
 Easy setup but the band was a little difficult to change. Once my phone picked it the Bluetooth connection it was great.
 I had purchased the product after a lot of wait. The performance was good for first 7 months but it is not working since last 15 days, heart rate sensor and other sensors are malfunctioning.<br/>I am in India as of now, There is no helpline numbers in India in case of FITBIT./Avialable numbers are not reachable<br/>-Email says that they will take 2 days to reply<br/>-There are no service centres listed on company website<br/>-
 I heard too much about it and I expected too much out of it. But the Fitbit Versa, did not reach my expectations. It won't sync, it won't track your exercises, unable to track the heart rate and not even sleep. I can't change the weight goal. It won't track hourly steps that it suggests to do. What it can do is simply log the steps. That's all it can do. For a product of $199, hmm it doesn't worth that much.
 The worst EVER! My first one stopped working for no reason within 2 weeks of purchase. The scene went black and no reset would work.  I was sent a replacement (by amazon) and my replacement has now stopped working. I’ve had it for 2 months. Fitbit will replace it (amazon return window has closed) but it will take a minimum of 3 WEEKS to get a replacement. A quick google search shows that this is a common issue with the Versa. Steer clear!!
 So far, so good... The set up was easy, however it took a little longer to set up compared to my other Fitbit devices.  That was really no big deal... I really like the displays on the Versa.. much easier to read.  You really couldn’t go wrong with purchasing this device.
 It was a gift I bought for someone special. They love the watch so far it’s worked like it says . Any questions on the watch feel free to ask .
 Love that it tells me how many more steps I need to take each hour if I haven't achieved the needed steps. I still have a lot to learn about the watch. I just haven't had time.
 Nice design and I appreciate all the choices for the clock display. I’m on day 4 of the first battery cycle and still have 50%! Well done, Fitbit!
 My first fitbit and it's been a great experience
 I wear my Fitbit everyday and occasionally go 4 days without charging it. The battery is simply unreal.
 So far it’s great!  Love the pandora and music feature.  I can do anything and leave my phone and still listen to music.  It’s lightweight and very comfortable.  I have been a Fitbit fan for many years, and they hav not let me down with the Versa.
 Got it for my grandmother for a present. She loves it. She can see texts while shes at work and can track certain health things she wants to keep track of.
 Awesome watch, perfect fitness tracker. Best Fitbit yet!
 Cannot quick text respond yet ... supposed to be an update with Apple ?? Other than that, very happy.
 Love it and it's keeping me accountable!! 🙂
 I wanted a smart watch for running, but knew I would use less than half the features of an Apple Watch. I have worn this for a few months now and love it. The updates, the ease of use, the battery life, all of it. So worth the money!
 Great Birthday Presamt.  Big hit.
 Love this watch!!! I had the original Fitbit. Then switched to I watch 2 but found the I watch did not motivate me nor keep my steps like it should have. This is an amazing watch and honestly love it!!!
 Great watch, i got it mainly for running, so i can listen to sounds (using pandora) without carrying my big phone. Noticed few software issues, but guess they are being fixed. Provided this is Fitbit only 2nd smart watch the quality is Great.
 So far I'm really loving it! I was worried because a few bad reviews saying they couldn't get texts from their galaxy Note 8 but that was not a problem for me at all. It's definitely a nice feature being able to check texts while working out. I was not able to get it to connect to wifi so it did take about 2 hours to update. Other than that I don't have any complaints l.
 Tracking steps, calories and heart rate is beneficial to knowing activity level for the day. It’s multifunctional. It’s a watch among other things.
 I absolutely love my new FitBit Versa. I have had many "smart" watches in the past. I had an Apple Watch 3 w/cellular and wasn't the biggest fan of the health aspects, however I did like how it looked. I then switched to a FitBit Charge HR2, which I liked the functionality, however it was rather ugly. Then the FitBit Versa arrived. This solved all my problems.<br/><br/>It has great style, and looks very similar to the Apple Watch. The difference however, is that the FitBit app is significantly more intuitive for health tracking than the Apple Health app. The heart rate tracking is more constant and accurate as well, which I love. The only downside is that you can't reply to texts from the watch, and you can't talk through it. You can read your texts though, and you can answer or reject calls, but if you answer you'll have to pick up your phone and talk through it rather than the watch. My favorite two features though have to be the water resistance, and the multiple day battery life.<br/><br/>There are a variety of clock face options, which is great for customizing if you want to match your attire. I was also surprised by the amount of different bands for the Versa that were available on Amazon.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a stylish smart watch with advanced health tracking abilities, look no further. It's also much less money than purchasing an apple watch, and it looks/does nearly the same things!
 Due to software updates it was difficult to connect with.  After 2 attempts 3rd was the charm. Works great and account set up was a breeze...
 I purchased this Smart watch for my wife and she loves it. She’s able to track her steps to measure her progress daily.
 I was rock climbing and cracked my versa. When I called fitbit to see if there was a repair process that I could pay for to have it fixed they said there's nothing they can do. Very disappointed that they do not offer repairs, I will be getting an Apple Watch, who will gladly repair their watches, for my replacement
 I had the charge 2 and wanted something that would provide better notifications as well as notifications from other apps. However, I didn’t want to have to charge my watch every day.  The versa is perfect for this.  Plus the development environment is open and easy to get into if you have coding experience so you can customize watch faces and create your own apps.
 I love that it it has all the perks that my charge 2 Fitbit has plus it is stylish.<br/>It is more comfortable to wear on my wrist.<br/>It’s light weight unlike the Apple Watch<br/>I’m very happy!
 Incredible battery life and great settings choices. First rate, best fittness tracker and smartwatch for the money. Highly recommended.
 A near perfect replacement for my Asus ZenWatch 2. The battery life is far superior and I don't mind the remote control feature for my phone. I just wish the screen was a bit bigger.
 Disappointed in it.i thought it had phone and other things to it but it doesn't. So I am really really really Disappointed on the watch. I could have gotten a cheaper one with what I was looking for. I can't call or use Facebook on my watch not Happy at all.i have it paired to my phone but it won't connect to it don't know what to do.
 I updated from a fitbit charge 2. I love this one. 4 days in and I still have 35%. I haven't went swimming with it yet but so far I love it.
 I got my Versa 3 months ago and am replacing it for the second time. They will not give me a refund or a different product. My only option is another Versa. My advice is stay away from the Versa. If Fitbit was a decent company they would recall the Versa and replace it with something that works. Instead I will just keep getting it replaced as long as they keep breaking. Very frustrating. I’m very disappointed with this company
 Love that it is the perfect size and not to big.  It is very light weight so I forget I am wearing it sometimes.  Only had it a few days, but so far it is everything I was hoping for.
 So many good features on this heath tracker. Tracks your activities, reminds you  to move, plays music, reads your texts and incoming calls, has multiple apps, and it's a watch too! Downside the app only allows 1 smart tracker, no switching devices for work or play!
 Love it! Upgraded from the Alta. I haven't had any problems with syncing as others have reported.
 Absolutely love it!  Everything I wanted and more.
 My fifth Fitbit and this one is my favorite so far. Easy to use and lightweight, it has the most versatility of the Fitbit’s I have had so far.
 I love black band. it looks great with anything. I love that this one has a better battery life then my other one. p
 My wife and I each have a new Versa.  It's our third Fitbit for each of us.  The ability to sync to the phone or tablet is still in the beta stage.  Sometimes they will sync in less then 60 seconds.  Or, days can pass without any syncing after multiple tries so we could see our sleep stages etc.  These will be our last Fitbits.
 Took spin class. Heartbeat on chest moniter 165, burned 670 calories. Did 21 miles.  Consistent with everyone else in class.  Stupid Versa said we rode .6/10 of a mile.  Heart beat 125 and burned 300 calories.
 Love it. Fits like a glove. Love the color
 Love the display, reminders, link to apps.
 Use for tracking workouts. Love it’s convenience, accuracy and comfort. I did purchase the extended warranty due to some reviews stating that this product sometimes has issues down the road.
 Like the size of it, the Bluetooth features and the way it reminds me to move.
 I've been more since since I got it! Love the reminders to move and sleep insights. Not to mention all the clock face options.  Love!
 Great smart watch, I love it! It easy to use, charges quickly and the battery life seems to be holding up well. The unique problem is that it doesn't synchronize with my Samsung health app so I had to download Fitbit app.
 She loves it although she was a bit hesitant.  We set it up with her phone and she loves it
 Don't really know as it is a gift and I have not received feedback yet from the person I gave it to.
 Replacing an Apple Watch, and so far a great choice. Super helpful as a fitness trainer and overall health monitor. Keeps me motivated to stay fit and be healthy. Especially like the sleep monitor.
 You guys!  This thing conked out after 4 weeks.  I was so excited to use this, but in the end it was a cheap piece of junk.
 I am so impressed with this ...I am so happy I took the step to get it ...worth it !!!
 Love this Fitbit! It tracks so much and all the apps are amazing. Pandora is my fav! And you can set up other apps to notify you so, my baby monitor will notify me when an alert is triggered.
 Love it!!!
 For some reason i thought i purchased the Fitbit Blaze until the Versa arrived. The watch is awesome. Great size cute look, perfect for my small wrist. I hate to have to take it off so luckily the battery is long lasting and when it gets to 60% i put it on the charger and in an hour it’s back to 100% battery you certainly get what you pay for and it is well worth it!
 I've had my watch for almost a week now and so far I love it! All the features on it are nice and it has such good screen quality. Purchasing this watch wasn't a disappointment! I love how it looks on my wrist.
 This is the best Fitbit yet! I love that it looks more like a smart watch face, instead of the old bulky Fitbit. The battery lasts almost an entire week too!
 I owned a Fitbit surge since 2015 and the only challenge that I had was with the watch band.  After the fourth replacement I made the decision to purchase the Versa. After seeing how the bands were attached to the Versa I was satisfied that replacing the band should no longer be an issue. The setup was simple and performs as I expected
 Mom loves it. Very nice colors.
 So far it is working well.  The only thing I miss is being able to customize the frame around the Fitbit like the Blaze.  Overall the new features on the Versa are nice.  I like having more settings to expand the longevity for the battery.
 Love the new Versa
 So far I like everything about it.  I wish that there were free interactive watch faces though.  I haven't found any yet.
 I love the watch and the user friendly apps and fitness tools. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I do feel that the set up instructions were where very vague and almost non existent.  I did a lot of guessing and got lucky, but to someone not tech savvy or that needs more information on their product and what it can do it might be very difficult.
 Love the watch itself. Changing band is almost impossible. If I would have realized this, I would have purchased a different product.
 Fits nice &amp; works well. I am enjoying having this to track my steps more accurately since I do not carry my phone all the time.
 Larger display is much easier for me to read during exercise.  Even through it’s larger it’s very comfortable
 I still have not got it wet for fear of breaking it but I must say over all I am very pleased.
 Great product just wish I could answer calls and return text messages on it. Love the color and the size
 Battery life is not 5 days and it got stuck and was not tracking my steps but it is still a good quality a bit confusing to set up but I am working on it.
 I’m not in love to be perfectly honest.  Texts are almost impossible to read, I have to really pound on it to make the time appear and it’s really difficult to change out the bands.  I moved from a Charge HR so may be a bit spoiled.  I’m committed to keep trying it— really hoping I don’t regret moving on...
 Used it once in the pool then I stopped receiving notifications. I couldn’t end the swim activity, but It did not track the swim anyway. The user manual is quite perfunctory. Returned it to Fitbit.
 I've only had this for a few days and so far I have been please with it. My only complaint is that it will not sync with my Samsung Galaxy S8. I followed all the troubleshooting tips and nothing works. Fortunately, I have an iPad, and it syncs well with that. If I didn't have the iPad I would probably have to return it.
 I love this Fitbit. Best model yet. Water Proof, light, great design.
 Works great. Battery life is as described. Uses about 20 to 25 percent of battery each day. Let's you choose what notifications you want.
 Great
 Delivered on time and works perfectly! Love it.
 I absolutely loved this watch! It has helped me lose weight since it helps me keep track of my excersice, water and calorie intake.  Best investment I’ve made toward my weight loss journey!
 Great watch!  Stylish and sleek, and the features are top notch.  But the band replacement is torture and will do a number on your fingers and nails.  Very very bad design flaw.  Do NOT get this watch if you plan to change the band frequently.  If it weren’t for the band, I’d give this a 5+ rating.
 I thought it would feel very large on my wrist but it fits very well and is very comfortable. There are so many things to customize on the watch once you have it.
 We have been very happy with this purchase.  Good battery life, lots of interesting data.
 It's so much better than the blaze, I love this watch, it looks like it should be more expensive them it is.
 I love my fitbit versa. The only down side that I have found at this point is the fabric band gets dirty easily and due to the flexibility it can be hard to remove and attach to the watch face.
 I love how you can pick the screen and see all you need like the time, your steps , calories and BPM all on front screen. Love how light it is, the look of it and that it is waterproof.
 Excellent for the item and better for the apple watch . But for the strap is fitbit small for my size. If possible to change it. I have the size small/large but not comfortable.
 Nice, easy to use!
 Love this watch! So many different watch face options, customizable app selection, very easy to use, comfortable, not too bulky on the wrist, keeps me accountable and motivated. I purchased the Fitbit coach upgrade and there are so many more options to keep exercise and fitness new and exciting.
 Looks nice  but I hate it. I could never get the notifications to work even after restarting it and removing the device and readding it. The notifications ort is important to me.
 Enjoying my first ever fitbit so far.<br/>Had a few kinks installing some apps during the first week, but given that I got it right at the launch, I expected that a bit.<br/><br/>Other than that, I love that this one came with a "dressier" strap and the everyday black strap that allows me to use this daily.
 Love it and easy to setup!!! Maybe an update may happen and I can reply txts with my iPhone ... other then that love it
 Purchased as gift for the wife. She loves the look, light weight, comfortable band, variety of clock faces and of course health/fitness tracking features.
 Awesome, much better than fitbit 2
 I have only had it a couple days but so far so good! Pros- more durable, water proof, apps, more comfortable, and longer battery life<br/><br/>Cons- not for sure if it is because of the apps and th battery was at 40% but it froze and the screen shut off for about twenty minutes today<br/><br/>Wristbands that it comes with isn’t comfortable<br/><br/>Overall so far it’s been Awesome though and worth the money!!!!
 Great display and looks good
 The Versa has all the features a health enthusiast should need to track daily progress. I have only used it for a short time but so far I love it!
 Arrived and wouldn't sync, tech support sent a new one that synced just fine.  I was without a Fitbit for 2 weeks.  Versa is a nice tracker.  I would recommend.
 I am still learning how to use it. It needs a how to guide. It's a nice size on wrist. I'm not very big still not huge. Receiving texts and calls thru watch is great. I had trouble with syncing at first. get the updates. Have had no more trouble. Nice fitness tracker with some extras!!  Haven't had a swim with it yet....???
 And if you buy it from Amazon, Fitbit won't provide a refund or exchange.  Amazon refers you to the manufacturer.  What a scam!
 I bought this for a gift and just gave it to them.  Watch will not hold a charge for even 24 hours and I am unable to return as had to do that by yesterday and didn't know it didn't work until today!
 Wristband keeps popping off. Not sure why! Watch works fine but keeps falling off wristband.
 Nice size and very light. Quick and easy to install and easy to handle. Love it!
 Best Ever! Tracks my sleep and steps! I love my watch face Titan! He makes me move every hour!!!!
 order rose gold special edition, received charcoal grey SE 😓😓
 It’s beautiful and lightweight 💜
 Not worth the money, unless you really need a cheerleader.  I wanted it to monitor my sleep stages, this Versa will not give a full report.  My wife has a charge II and it works fine.  This Versa is to sensitive about where it is placed on which arm and how tight it is on your arm.  Can't wear the thing like a regular watch.
 Beautiful watch with many great features but not as accurate as I would like at counting steps. I got 250 steps driving my car on my way home from work.  Needs improvement.
 I've had this for a year now and I love it. I would definitely buy another one :)
 does not stay synced with my dashboard. too pricey to not take advantage of all features, no longer getting notifications. probably would not buy it again
 Very comparable to the Apple Watch but WAY cheaper. My husband loves it. He says it was the best gift I ever gave him!
 Really good smartwatch, I've used other smartwaches before and found that they offer way too much, sometimes having too many options causes confusion.  Fitbit has done a great job balancing fitness and smartwatch features, the watch itself is easy to use and provides great feature such as being able to control hue smart lights as well as the nest thermostat.  In addition to that the notifications are very useful although it sucks that you can't reply to them yet.<br/><br/>The watch is super light and I have barely noticed having it on!<br/><br/>I also really enjoy not having to charge the watch every night, I got tired of having to charge other smartwaches  on a daily basis. This watch has a 4+ days battery life.<br/><br/>Also the woven band looks great!
 Purchased this for my girlfriend to replace an old one she purchased 4-5 years ago. She couldn't be happier!
 I really like this watch! It helps me keep track of my health like BPM, steps, and my daily water intake. The battery last a really long time.  I also love I can see whos messaging or calling me from the watch.
 I love my fitbit Versa. I wear it all the time. Great in the pool.
 Great fitness watch. It does everything I expected. I wish they would add more apps. Wish it had Amazon music.
 I like that it is waterproof, looks like a watch, battery life of 4-5 days. Alarm buzz wakes me up, and weather app is helpful.
 I think affordable and looks great.  It was hard to change the band to the black band.  Once I got the black one on, I probably will never take that band off.  Once charged it lasts up to about 6 days if you wear it each day
 Great battery life. Only complaint is that you can only reply with quick texts.
 My husband and I wanted a cheaper version of an iwatch. The Fitbit Versa was exactly what we needed!
 When it works it is nice. Problem is we’re on a replacement one and that needs to be replaced. Fitbit tried hard but the quality just isn’t what it should be for the price.
 Product was delivered on time and works great.  Not an apple watch but I have a droid phone and it works well.  Love the fact I can track different activities and monitor heart rate when working out.
 I've only had the Versa for 5 months and now it doesn't work. It will only show the time. It will not show steps, calories or heart rate. I've tried to restart/reset but it didn't work. Technical support was no help. Very disappointed in this product!
 Nice watch, great fitness tracker.  Haven't been able to sync to phone to download music.
 My husband got me this for Christmas and I really like it. I have been using it every day since and not had any issues with it.
 Very light weight and easy to navigate!
 This has been the worst Fitbit I have EVER owned and I bought one for myself and my daughter.  Out over $400 don’t buy
 I love my new Versa!  It really motivates me to move.  I had the Fit One, but lost it.  It didn’t have the same motivational reminders.  The Versa gives me a little vibration every hour between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to remind me if I haven’t walked 250 steps that hour.  I’ve started averaging over 10,000 steps a day. I like the look and so many features.
 We have had a few fitbit products but this is the best we ever had. Looks nice, Easy to use and read.
 love it
 I had an Alta I was happy with. When I bought the versa I absolutely fell in love! I am so pleased with this product.  It has so many great features. I especially love the walking step tracking and the exercise tracking. I use it every day. I can’t say anything but great things about it!
 This is my 3rd Fitbit so far and this model is my new favorite! I was afraid it would feel bulky on my arm compared to my previous devices but it is lightweight and comfortable. Doesn’t even bother me to wear while sleeping. I love that it is water proof and so many screen face options!!
 Nice looking watch, but they give you a lot of clock faces, most of which you have to pay more.
 Needs more apps!!
 I'm absolutely in love with my fit bit watch I was terrified for a while about wearing it in the shower and the pool but I have now swam with it twice and it's still in perfect condition
 I have been a fitbit fan. Ive had the charger2  for few yrs and i loved it. I think fitbit are great for basic tracking. It was time to upgrade so i decided to go with versa. Im very happy with purchase. I got package and delivered within two day of ordering. I think if u are looking for a nice watch without splurging too much money then this is a good watch to get.
 I am so frustrated with this purchase. I was torn between the Versa and the Charge3 and decided to try the Versa for the larger screen. Turns out a screen protector voids any issues covered hy the warranty, and people are complaining of very easily scratched screens. Seems Fitbit doesn't want to be helpful with the issue either. No thank you.
 Deeply disappointed. Bought for valentines present and won’t turn on! I later find out that this is a common issue! I bought it for my fiancé because it is supposed to be a better fitness tracker than the Apple Watch but if it won’t even turn on what use is it!?<br/><br/>If the issue isn’t resolved soon, I will be returning the verse for an Apple Watch.
 I purchased my Fitbit Versa on Dec. 5, 2018.  I had saved for while, I did research that surveyed apple watch and several Fitbit models.  It my gift to myself.<br/><br/>For the first two months it worked.  Then it started NOT tracking my HB, even though nothing had changed in the way I wore, or what I do with it.
 My wife loved the fitbit versa for our anniversary! Has great options and tracks her steps consitantly and not her arm swings!
 Awesome. Amazing.
 Does not come with a power brick to charge. And does not make clear in product description that a laptop is the recommended charging device.
 The style and battery life Is phenomenal. But the packing got first was defective , because the charging dock had some issue. Other than that I don't see any issue and I'm using it for more than a month. It's super for rough use.
 As advertised, good product and well packaged, very easy to use and sink with other bluetooth products
 I love my watch but some features that worked before does not work now and I only had my watch for 3 months. I keep getting a no comparison response error and I don't know why. I have restarted my watch and still nothing. Also, I'm having a hard time adding music to my watch. So until I can successfully figure this out I have to give it 3 stars.
 Watch fits well, like most of the features, like sleep tracking. Don’t like that you have to by a subscription to get more of the workout apps.
 have had two problems with this watch..  Don't know if it is the watch or not the right connection to the pixel xl  Have to send back.
 I like it and it works well.  The home screen keeps changing on me and would like to lock it once I have it set!
 I love my versa so much!
 The only thing I wish I did differently was bought the black band. Other then that I love it. Highly recommend it if your serious about being health
 Good watch with some great options for the look of the watch face (some cost $1-2) and several different style bands that are available for it. So it can look like a dressy or casual watch or anything in between that you want. Haven’t tested out the water resistance yet.
 Best Fitbit so far. So many functions it's dizzying.
 This fitbit is absolute garbage. It does not sync to my phone and was certainly not worth the money I spent on it. I'm so incredibly disappointed in it. Do not buy it.
 So far so good
 Spend the extra money and get this one instead of the Charge 2. It has a nice color screen and dozens of clock faces to choose from. Also you can install calculators, Uber, and other handy utilities on this device. You can download the free developer app for Windows / Mac and write your own apps and create custom clock faces.
 gave it to my mom for Christmas and it didn’t work, sent it back worked good until about 90 days later. Now I’m fighting to get it replaced because it burns up while charging and doesn’t turn on!!!!
 Just as expected. It was given as a gift.
 Exceeds expectations. Thank you!
 I love it!!! Awesome to track steps, calories burned throughout the day, also gives your heart rate, and love that it’s swim proof 😊❤️❤️
 So much features and great quality! I got in on sale for Black Friday but worth the price!
 I like mine but can't figure out some of the applications it is supposed to run. Frustrating.
 Perfect size, good for people who don’t want an Apple Watch but still want to see more on what they can keep track with their fitness!
 Light based heart rate monitors work for some people but not for me. I should have known better. I'm writing this just to encourage prospective buyers to check the accuracy of your Fitbit in time to return it if it isn't accurate.
 For charging $200, the Fitbit Versa does not do enough. It is dependant on a phone to use features. The messages are not being sent to it. Only the notification. Not happy.
 I really like this watch, it provides more than a platform for the basic watch features. It provides a really good platform for individuals who desire a smart watch but really only wants and needs a smart fitness watch that provides functionality to help you become fit and stay fit.  If you want to focus on fitness this is the smart watch you need.
 Really love this thing.
 Perfect!  Exactly what I needed and it's super easy to switch the bands out.
 Bought it as a present for the hubs and he loves it. It replaced his broken charge 2.
 Feels great and functions well only thing I didn’t like that after you recent a call a couple of times my watch stop reviewing my calls. I have to shut it down in order for it to work again. The syncing of music I and loading to the phone is not great. Keeps skipping connection.
 Happy with the product. I don’t have to worry about getting it wet and it has decent battery life.
 This is the Fitbit I've been waiting for, only a few features that are unneeded, all the features I love from my three prior Fitbits. The best part is going everywhere, pool, snorkeling, scuba diving, class, shopping, the works! Clear display, great display options, configured in the way most useful to me.
 I love the Fitbit but it has already broken. The screen will not display anything. Only half the screen lights up with a white screen . I have only worn it a few times and it has never been wet.
 Love it! Getting used to it still and learning how to use it... Have been using it for 3 days and im loving it.
 Great product but it is obvious they still have some bugs to fix. Screen flickering from time to time and brightness options dont work.
 Perfect fitness tracker.
 I am a HUGE fitbit fan- and was so excited when I was able to wear it while swimming laps.  Unfortunately after trying to swim with this twice, it died.  I tried drying it out.... nothing.  It's dead.  Other than it being dead it worked great for the first two months.
 This is the best FitBit I’ve ever owned.  I love that it not only tracks my steps and sleep...I get my phone app alerts too.  It’s very helpful!  And it’s nice that it’s water resistant to track swimming.  Well worth the money since it’s a couple hundred dollars cheaper than an Apple Watch and does quite a few of the same features.
 Love my Versa. Has great battery life. I work with horses and it's been durable. Haven't used many of the apps on it. But the watch faces are fantastic!
 Very nice, simple to use, plenty of clockface designs, good battery life, works well. Well worth the money and much better than any Apple Watches.
 The versa is great but watch what device (phone or PC) before buying! It will not do notifications or music with my Pixel 2 or Windows 8! I got this as a gift so I had no idea what it was compatible with.<br/><br/>Just watch before buying! Check their site for compatibility options.
 I love the versa so much! The sleeping feature is awesome! I’m still learning more and more about it. It’s definitely helped in my workouts and pushed me to work a little harder!
 I really enjoy this watch. The only complaint I have is that not all banks are connected/work with it. And Spotify app that you can download on the watch doesn’t work well.
 Still finding my way around it but love it so far. Just wish it synced faster without WiFi.
 Have not had a chance to use all the features. Besides that everything works perfectly. Definitely a good upgrade from my Fitbit flex.
 I bought this for my girlfriend as an upgrade for her birthday. She loves it and wears it daily. Haven't caught her without it unless it dies. She swears it's the best fit bit she's had so far.
 One month it my screen died. Delivered on 6/2 and died today 7/1.  I am so upset and disappointed.  I want my money back.
 I love it... I had had a couple Fitbit One's over the last few years... and this Smart watch is amazing... Smiles!
 Great product I like the heart rate monitor it’s a good tool to have for people with Afib who check there rate on a daily basis and the other features are awesome a well !!
 I actually enjoyed using this thing. It helped me lose weight by being a remeinder when I haven't moved in over an hour, tracks my sleep so I am able to see if this week I hit my numbers, and gives a rough estimate to he number of calories burned today, so I can justify that chocolate chip cookie that is calling my name. Great product!
 First of all the order is delayed stating that it is out stock. The order was delivered after two days. After i get it, the strap of fitbit versa worn out within a week. I'm not sure if it a old stock or this is quality of fitbit versa.<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed with this purchase.
 So far it is an upgrade.  I was not going to buy another Fitbit because my last 3 broke. CS was nice enough to replace one. This was with no strenuous activity. I’ve only had the versa a few days so perhaps I will change my rating later but for now I can not seem to exit out of something to return to the home screen. Seems like a basic essential.
 I’ve only had this for a few days but so far I think this watch is a great tool for monitoring your wellness. It measures heart rate continuously so it can measure the calories burned through out the day. U can track your food directly through the app vs though a 3rd party. Does a great job of monitoring sleep as well.
 Tons of connectivity issues. Overall good but this is a big problem. Always comes unsyncd which is very frustrating.
 Product does exactly as it says. No problems thus far with my screen
 Good purchase I was so happy when I tried it while swimming and could tell the times. The only thing it makes me worry that it gets switch off then restart by itself a lot not sure why!!
 Good product. My wife had some trouble but manufacture helped her resolve it.
 I have always loved Fitbit but the Versa is just very cool.  It fits perfectly and I love the apps I can download.
 I bought this Fitbit in 2018 as a Christmas present for my Husband. It worked great just long enough to get past the return window of 45 days, and then the buttons stopped working.  It’s too late to get a replacement.  My advice is to spend your money on a more reliable product with a better support system.
 Great fitness watch! Battery lasts several days, and the face is easy to see under water.
 Loving it so far! Day 4 and still rocking on the original charge.<br/><br/>For me its better than the apple watch which was my other option to get. Love the fitbit interface.<br/><br/>Cons: quick reply features still not available for iOS. Notifications are not consistent.<br/><br/>Will ipdate if anything changes.
 This item is legit. It came with everything it said it would. I highly recommend (this is my 3rd Fitbit and by far my favorite).
 I love this watch! The heart rate tracker is on point. It does everything it’s supposed to. Great smart watch for the price. I’ve had this watch several months now and never had a problem with it. The battery will last at least 5 days depending how much I work out while wearing it.
 LOVE my Christmas gift.  I am happy with this.  You can have cute face screens too.  There are interactive kitties and puppies. &lt;3
 I got this watch for my wife birthday, she was amazing by the quality and technology..
 I love this watch/fitbit. You can also use to pay for items with NFC and synch with bluetooth to listen to music.
 Updates too often, gets unsynched from my phone. Faces are glitchy. Wish I didn't buy. Tracks stuff well, but so could have a much cheaper one.
 Love the Fitbit but hated the band. Obviously just ordered a new band😜
 Only had this watch for 2 months and it's already not working. The clock is off by hours with no way to reset it, it won't sync to my phone anymore and no one seems to know how to help. Waste of money. So disappointed! If I could give it 0 stars, I would.
 Love my Versa but I wish it was more acxurate with sleep tracking.  I got grey and it looks great with everything.
 I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!
 LOVE this watch!<br/><br/>Does the same as an apple pretty much for half the price - would recommend!
 The battery life is very short the blood pressure pot does not show
 Great product. Keeps you motivated to keep moving
 I will be returning my Fitbit unfortunately it burned me on both wrists. I really liked it first but after 2 weeks of wear and testing on opposite wrist I have the same results. Return to sender. Sorry Fitbit. This is clearly a recourrence with your customers because I researched it and found out that others too have had the same problem.
 I really like the look of the Versa. I have been using a Fitbit charge for a couple of years and love wearing these as a watch and motivator to keep moving as I get older. I wear it all the time! Love it!
 so glad I can do water aerobics with this watch always loss those exter steps
 I have had synching issues with this watch since I purchased it and it suddenly just stopped working today. I have had this watch for only 3 months. I have owned other Fitbit products that lasted for years. Very disappointed in this watch
 Light weight smartwatch that helps you keep track of fitness goals and give you notifications for text messages, e-mails, and more. Easy to use interface.
 I really am so happy with my purchase. Got a great deal. I love the versa.
 I love this watch. It took me a few days to figure out how to use it but once I did it has been great. It charges quickly and lasts me days.
 It counts steps as I'm driving, I tried wearing it tighter and it still counts from the vibrations of my car.
 Great battery life and I like being able to read the entire text message on the watch screen versus the Alta
 Good for what i needed it, although fitbit should expand their analysis withn the app it needs to provide more info especially when youre into fitness.
 I love my Fitbit Versa! It’s very comfortable on my wrist.  Setting it up is very easy! Tracks everything you need all in one app!
 A week with it and it's great! I a have a problem with apple, they update their software and make older items slow so you will buy the next model. So it's great to find a smart watch that does just what I want it to do.
 Would be fantastic, but it constantly un syncs the text messages and is a pain to get working again.. if you are lucky enough to get it working again at all.
 Stopped working within 5 months. I tried multiple times to trouble shoot and restart and it still is wildly inaccurate. Super disappointing for the price of the product.
 Easy to use.  Links to apps easy.  Looks stylish.
 Love this watch!  I love that it’s waterproof and very easy to operate.  I wish I would have got this watch sooner!
 I like the size, shape, feel and some of the apps but a couple major problems:<br/><br/>1) The HR count seems to be faked / inaccurate. If you go into coach mode while sitting down it will pretend that your HR goes up from 70 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 130.<br/>2) The BT is unreliable. I can't get it to work anymore.<br/>3) The clock face selection is really limited. Many of them require $ to buy.<br/>4) Fitbit support is completely unresponsive. Their community doesn't respond to your questions.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Update: dropping to two stars. fitbit support has literally buried any questions on the coaching app, and accuracy of the heartrate measurements. BT connectivity issues persist. Seem to have to reset clock face frequently to get any of this to work. Was hoping an update would fix this but if support IGNORES the issues there will never be an update.
 I love it!! There’s so many watch faces to choose from and I love that there’s options so the face displays everything. The waterproof feature is great too. I went swimming with it and it hasn’t given me any problems. Definitely a great choice!
 Burned my wrist until a blister formed. Very painful. Very dissatisfied.
 I love it so far!!! Best Fitbit yet
 Love it.<br/>Perfect for me.<br/>Couldn’t be without it.
 The Versa does NOT track distance accurately. After researching I see that several other people have the same issue. Very disappointed in this product
 I like every thing this tracker does. Alerts for phone calls and text, tracks steps and monitors heartbeat! HOWEVER when riding my Harley it picks up vibrating as actual steps taken and they are WRONG when I ride.
 This item lasted only about a month. It ended up permanently dying when I took it into water for less than 5 minutes and then the two replacements that Fitbit has sent me have both had issues connecting to my phone. I don't believe I will buy another fitbit after this experience. I did however love my Charge HR 2
 Easy to follow set up instructions! Works great!
 This was a gift for my husband. It was an upgrade for the Fitbit.
 Fit wonderfully. It did get dirty quickly and was not able to get it cleaned up.
 Really enjoy the versa. Easier to use than Ionic and more accurate than Blaze.
 I absolutely love the fact that I can swim with the Fitbit Versa.  This is my fourth fitbit and I am very pleased with the product.
 Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it! I usually purchase electronics from target because I’m always sceptical about if they are the real deal on amazon but it’s perfect. Came with same day shipping! Overall I recommend this product.
 HR, steps, period tracker, great fitness community...works great!
 Heart rate was erratic and step counter about 40% lower  than should be.
 The touch screen stopped working after a couple of months. And not all features can be accessed through the app. This is my second fitbit and both have failed.
 It does not track sleep or monitor heart rate as well as my old Charge 2.<br/>Fitbit help is useless to talk to and refuses to address whether the unit needs replaced.  They say that as a problem is not enough to warrant replacement
 This was a Birthday Gift for my girlfriend.  She is extremely happy with it.  Speedy delivery as always from Amazon.
 love it, works well and my phone is very compatible with fitbit.
 I wish I had known the new watch (versa) I was about to buy was not comparable with the older version of my phone (LG G5)! I also don't like how much the face sticks out. Without the scene protectors I bought my watch would be destroyed. &gt;:(
 Like it almost more than my Apple Watch in some aspects.
 Love my versa! Easy to use and fits well.
 So far so good
 I switched over from the Charge 2 Fitbit. I love that I can now use it for swimming and the added music feature is great
 Best of the fitbit watches so far. MEGA battery life (5+ days) makes it the only practical smart watch. Very durable. I never take it off unless to charge. Charging for one long shower gives  another 5 days life. Hard to beat the looks, value and performance.
 This is my third Fitbit &amp; is my favorite yet!!
 I got this from Amazon on 1st week of Jan 2019. It worked great till yesterday. This morning I synced, I observed that it is not measuring my heart rate and the green light on the back side of the versa is not lit. So practically, I was unable to measure my heart rate and sleep. Never thought such a new product would be bad very quickly.
 May it’s because it is still very new version, So it is kind of buggy, I had problems uploading MP3 into the player and after I did, the quality of the MP3s through Bluetooth were very bad. Battery last 5 days as stated.
 my screen broke after just two months, with a screen protector on it, and fitbit doesnt have any way to repair it. they said i'm screwed and have to buy a new one. so unless amazon is willing to help me repair it, i will be buying something different, which sucks because i did like it other than that.
 I have been a Fitbit fan for awhile, but quality has become horrible. At 67 years of age, I just want to keep track of steps, and sleep. So I don't abuse the tracker in any way. Previous Fitbit products have had a short life span, but this Versa only lasted 5 days. Fitbit is not making a quality product anymore. Product Returned, not Replaced.
 Great packing, thanks.
 Great watch, had the Fitbit blazer got this for a friend
 Love it. Believe it or not it helps to motivate me to get moving!
 I love that you can connect it with you phone to get text alerts and notifications. You can sync your music too. It’s pretty accurate on the steps and it will automatically know when your working out too! If you download the Fitbit app it also lets you track your food intake
 Just like an Apple Watch for half the price. Love how many features this new Fitbit has, and how easy it is to use.
 This is my first Fitbit.  Couldn’t be more happier with this product!
 I am actually sending this back after 2 days. It won't sync my information to my phone. The clocks won't update! The notifications won't clear like they are supposed too. Very disappointed
 Lightweight, good looking and perfect for everyday wear.  This is my fourth Fitbit and certainly not my last.  I’ve been a big Apple user for years but the Fitbit fits my active lifestyle.  I also have a new Fitbit Alta HR.
 Very happy I decided to purchase this Fitbit. I went with the rose gold but just a disclaimer the actually rubber band that comes w it is more of a pink and totally doesn’t match. But I already knew I wasn’t gna like the bulkiness of the actually band it comes with so I bought a metal magnetic band and it matches better.
 As a swim instructor I love that it’s water resistant, it’s really good for keeping track of my swim laps.
 So far I love this watch. I debated for a long time between this and and an Apple Watch. I think I made the right decision!  I was usd to the Fitbit app from my Charge HR.  This gives more/better data and has lots of fun bells and whistles.
 I have received many compliments and I am happy I bought it
 Tell me, please, why you’re band change on this watch is not like Charge 2? Otherwise, I like the watch.
 I love it!! Light weight and super easy to use.
 Bought this in April and it just broke. Will not charge and the display acted up. The fitbit people wont accept return and amazon closed its return window.  Now, I am trying to figure out how to return this while on deployment because both companies won’t help.  Buy a Garmin or an Apple watch really. Anything but fitbit.
 Great product well built very happy wife
 Great accessory. The small fits perfectly.  Easy to use.  Not overly large like some other fitness/smart watches.  Battery doesn't last as long as advertised.
 Bought for my wife. Is it supposed to be a major ordeal to upload music? Couldn't use our Cox 300Mbps because apparently it's too sophisticated or fast for a brand new state of the art watch?  She also has frequent sync issues. I would expect a tool to do as advertised and in 2018 be easy and intuitive to load. Not so much.
 If you're looking for something to count your steps and monitor your sleep, this works, but there are less expensive, more streamlined options to do so.  If you're looking for a fitness tracker that doubles as an entry level smartwatch, I recommend skipping the Versa.<br/><br/>Mine receives notifications about 15% of the time.  Notifications are enabled, but they just don't actually get sent to the watch most of the time.  There's nothing I can do to change that.  I can disable and then re-enable but the watch refuses to respond.  Sometimes when I charge they start working, sometimes when I charge they stop working, and the rest of the time charging has no impact whatsoever.  Quite often, the watch just vibrates for no reason.  When the battery starts to run low, it vibrates for each percentage point lost (that helps something?) but that aside, the battery can be &gt;90% with over 1k steps in a given hour and the watch will vibrate with no notification.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth disconnects randomly from my Bose headphones, my car, or my bath fan/light speaker combo.  As a fitness tracker and sleep tracker, I believe it does a reasonable job (especially sleep whereas the step count seem a bit too generous)<br/>The alarms work when they want to and are completely unreliable.  Need to take your heart medication?  Do not rely on this heap.<br/><br/>My first attempt at using a smartwatch.  Not impressed.  Vibrations are just a source of frustration now. Also, the watch has stopped turning on automatically when I rotate my wrist.  Yes, it's enabled.  There are very few functions this device advertised it would do that it actually does.  Oh...and they never turned on the SpO2 sensor.<br/><br/>The battery life is good, but you basically don't care because looking at the watch is a pain in the ass.  You have to double, triple, or repeatedly machine gun tap the thing to get it to turn on, or just push buttons.  Argh.<br/><br/>12 hours after I were this review and my versa now refuses to synch with my phone.
 That I can wear it swimming or playing softball
 Would 250 steps notifications to be more powerful
 I love all the new features,  especially that I can wear it for swimming!
 Have had this for a while now and couldn't be any happier! I definitely recommend!!!
 This is the best fitbit yet I have had two others but this is the best one so far works great
 I like that you can actually see the little apps on the watch.  I have the music but I need to order another gadget so I can download the music into the Versa Smart Watch, since my computer doesn't have bluetooth.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in doing some swimming and some hardcore exercises.  It's very fun to use.
 My wife loves it bought for her for christmas
 This watch is jam packed with features and functions. I love it! I can even get into the steam sauna with it on. Fantastic device!
 I loved this product for the first few months. About 4 weeks ago, the battery started dying in less than a day. I have turned off the heart rate monitor, do not use the features for workouts and have completely reset it and it still does not last. It is very frustrating to have to charge it so much, when it is supposed to have up to 4 days worth of battery life.
 Love this watch. The only thing I have had a problem with is loading music onto it, I don't like that a computer is needed to do so, when all of my music is on my phone.
 This is an amazing watch hands down! I used to have the fitbit alta and if you are looking to up your fitness game, get this watch.
 Its a little buggy as far as downloading apps I'm sure it'll get fixed with a software update<br/>Otherwise I love all the features especially the fit bit coach mini workouts and the guided breathing
 Great little time piece/ fitness tracker. Love it!
 Great
 Wife loves it! We both like it more than the Apple watch and we've both had one.
 Live this fitbit. Upgraded from the charge 2 and very happy!  Everday wear.
 I bought this watch for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. Great quality watch and does everything she needs it to do.
 ******Update7/27/18****<br/><br/>My Fitbit has vertical lines (see attached pic). I reached out to Fitbit and after speaking to them, I provided evidence of the display. I have to return the versa display, then 5-10 business days after they receive it....they’ll replace it. So annoying, I’ve only had my versa for a little over 3 months. I hope after receiving the replacement there will be no further issues.<br/><br/>I’ve been using a Fitbit Baze since November, but decided to upgrade to the Versa. I love that this tracker is water resistant, in fact I love ALMOST everything about it. What I dislike: I had only walked a few hundred steps this morning, then while driving my Versa indicated that I had walked over 4,500 steps and climbed 35 floors and have 23 active minutes. While driving?? It’s disappointing, because this is linked to my weight watchers and that gives me inaccurate extra points. The Blaze was incorrect with the stair climbing, but at least it didn’t give me thousands of extra steps while driving. Fitbit needs to fix this glitch!!
 Great product my wife loves it but we are on the third one they last a couple of weeks then stop working were giving it one more try then back to previous version
 Works better than expected.  Wife loves it
 Still learning it but the features and functions are great. I do wish it had a Spotify app but hey I can still see the music on the versa. Great product that does the job it’s intended to do.!
 I have loved my fitbit versa for 6 months and all of a sudden the battery went dead after about 5 hours one day and will not ever charge again.  This is a very expensive item for it to not last longer than it has.  Fitbit only has a 45 day warranty on this product so I am out my $200.00.
 It tells time but thatis about it. I believe there is something wrong in the motherboard. I called fit bit and they just told me to turn it off and then turn it back on and if that doesn't work reset it. Nada
 This is the best Fitbit so far. This watch appears to be better at step tracking and measuring heart rate than my charge HR. Limited options in the App Store at this time, but I’m optimistic that it will grow. Also, more stylish than I was expecteing.
 Love it<br/>I have had them all and everyone of them worked GREAT!!<br/>This one is top of the line 👏👏
 Any music software on the versa itself costs extra money to use. Since I do not own a computer I cannot download music to the device. I’d hoped since I paid so much that I’d at least be able to use the music feature. Not surprised these big company’s  try to squeeze every last penny out of you.
 Love the Versa look and feel!  There are several apps and different watch faces to choose from!  My only complaint is the band and getting it off and on is difficult.  I ordered different colored bands because I like to switch it up depending on my outfit but the pins broke off right away and it was extremely difficult to change.
 It is the best. It helps you record everything related to your health and allows you to take your fitness to another level. You receive more than you imagine for the price you have. I'm in love with my Fitbit Versa. You can also change the bracelets so you have a variety of styles.
 I love it. Easy to use. Looks great. You have different opinions to personalize or. Works great.
 As a previous Fitbit owner, it met my expectations, but if you are more focused on smart watch apps and features, maybe it is not the best option in the market (although is not bad, either!)
 Bought for my wife and she LOVES it! Wears in in the pool and hot tub without issue!
 I just bought it and just 2 months after was damaged... or less than 2 months! And it goes crazy when i go for a swim , and i just bought this because of the swimproof featured... which apparently doesnt work ...
 What I like most is that t<br/>He clock face can show steps, heart rate &amp; battery % just by looking at it.  What I absolutely hate is that at least 5 times a day I have to sync &amp; reset in order to get notifications.
 Love it. Wear it all the time.
 Awesome. Need like I say more
 Great new addition to the Fitbit family. Quick, easy and hassle free purchase.
 I love this watch. I debated between this and an Apple Watch. There are things about the Apple Watch I would prefer to have, but overall for the price the versa is very comprable. The battery also lasts for a couple days verses having to charge every day. I would highly recommend.
 The Fitbit versa stopped wanting to come on without touching a button with in 2 weeks of owning it. I returned it 10 days ago and still waiting on a refund...
 Best Fitbit yet!
 Received this in August 2018  as a gift from my son; won’t charge. Unbelievable at the price tag of $200!
 This was easy to set up and I love the look and feel of it.
 I first FitBit wristband broke so I’ve been on the market looking for the perfect watch. I chose the versa over the Apple Watch simply because it allows me the freedom to be me while monitoring my movement and pushing me to move every hour.
 It's beautiful and lightweight...no more getting stuck on short sleeves or cluncked NY treadmill. Love it.
 Love it! Kinda wish i would've just went ahead and got the special edition.
 Actualmente tengo Apple watch y pebble time y este tiene un mejor control de exactitud en tracking de sueño pasos y tiempo.
 Love , very light to wear . The lavender strap is nice and comfortable. The watch has all my needs ..wish it had more free clock faces .the reason for 4 stars .. The ones that  are free are not that nice . Don’t want to pay anymore for a design when you pay the hard earn bucks for the watch ..
 I am pleasently surprised by this product. I have always been a skeptic of activity trackers, but Fitbit has produced a great product. It is the perfect mix between an activity tracker and a smartwatch. The only downside I have noticed is that the software is sometimes a little slow.
 I debated about buying a Fitbit. Finally decided to and love it.  The bands look great and are comfortable.
 Nice fitness watch. Only wish battery level was displayed on watch face.
 Love the lower profile then my fitbit charge2. Love that its water resistant.  Kinda confusing trying to figure out how to use all the functions.
 Very close  competitor to the Apple Watch love how it feels while wearing it. It’s easy and simple to use and for the price you can’t beat it
 I bought this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it.
 I love it!  It takes some getting used to.
 I was so excited to get this fitbit.  It arrived with no directions how to use it.  I got app and it was worthless.  SO, I sent it back.  I expected more!
 Love it! Make sure to play around w the app on your phone so you can get the most out of your versa or just YouTube tips/tricks I didn't know I was able to give short preloaded responses to text I even get email notifications which is awesome for work. I bought a cover for my versa too
 Love everything about this watch except it cannot track heart rate during exercise which means it also doesn’t give you credit for it either. Gave them benefit of doubt and exchanged first one for different versa; same problem. Been using Fitbit watches for 3 yrs with no significant problems but this one is not ready for market.
 Has everything I wanted in a smart watch.  Easy to use, very user friendly.  Would of given it 5 stars but it sometime take two or three trays to sync.
 I am very happy with this Fitbit. Everything I was expecting and more.
 I love this watch! After lots of research between this and the Apple Watch I am happy with choosing this one!
 The watch tracks everything I need and with very good accuracy.
 I like the motivation it gives me to meet my goals in my steps, my sleep and my calorie intake.
 Could have kept using my VERSA.  A pain to set up, even for this computer nerd.
 WOW! This is the best electronic device I have bought since the first iphone. Bold statement. I said I would never enter the smartwatch scene until they acknowledged women's health. My period IS my health some months. This watch is perfect. It is beautiful, functional, idiot-proof, and accurate. Look, getting texts messages to work was a pain (some update issue) but I just downloaded a different messaging app and blam-o it synced. I even managed to sync texts with 2 different cell phones. I have told all my friends to buy this watch to help them monitor their headaches and periods. Even predicts ovulation! Finally!!! Well done fitbit.
 it is products like this, that don't work when I receive them, that have caused me to cancel my subscription.
 I really like this device. Overall great alternative to the Apple Watch, and very customizable.
 Really love how comfortable and sleek it is compared the the surge I’ve had for years.  Has all the apps and love the breathing and relaxation app.  Also like that you can change the clock face
 I love it! Much better than Fitbits other products I have had. By a long shot!
 I love it! Wear it everyday! Don’t leave the house without it!
 Wear it everyday. Love it! Quick delivery!
 Well lit screen, big font.
 Quality you expect from fitbit, set up direction's are vague
 Doing what it is supposed to for now.
 The Versa is great for keeping track of exercise activities and heart rate, along with the other features. The only downer is replacing the watch band . I had the Fitbit Charge 2 before getting the Versa, and it was much easier to change bands. It’s rather awkward for the Versa.
 Absolutely love it! Been wearing it for a week and still has plenty of battery life! It's just as good as a smartwatch without the extra billing cost! It helps to motivate me more because it reminds you to get up and move!
 Had to replace 1st one but replacement is great.
 I have pretty much had every Fitbit  that has come out and tried them all, this is by far my favorite.
 It does everything you want it to and more. It’s almost like an Apple Watch but it’s a lot cheaper
 Perfect and I like his better than my Blaze
 My son loves this and it is waterproof as him swims in our pool with it
 Great as a sport tracker, but average as a watch
 Okay sure it does not have all the smart features you’ll find on your smart phone or even one of the more high end smart watches out there. But for the price?? And it’s a Fitbit??<br/><br/>What I love about it:<br/>It looks gorgeous (in my opinion). It is so light and comfortable. It’s waterproof. SO MANY WATCH FACES TO CHOOSE AND MANY ARE CUSTOMIZABLE. Many clock faces are animated. It tracks your heart rate. It encourages you to move. It helps make fitness (even more) fun. It is a watch that tells you the time and date with a simple glance at the wrist. It helps calculate how many calories you’ve burned. It tracks your sleep patterns. ANY notification that comes through on your phone, you can have come through on your watch as well. For iPhone users, you can decline or accept calls (love that one lol). There are more apps than I personally was expecting to be available for the Fitbit OS. Battery life is great. Charger is much more secure and fool proof than the later Fitbit models. You can switch out the bands. (Touch!)Screen is made of gorilla glass.<br/><br/>If you’re having problems:<br/>Fitbit is working on the problems that are arising in the early stages of the Versa having been released. I feel very badly for anyone that has received a DOA or a lemon. My advice (like many others have said) is to make sure you are connected to good wifi, keep phone close, and charge and setup the Versa using the Fitbit app as soon as you open the box. And yes be prepared for it to take a measly 30 minutes(??). Don’t tell it when you’re going to sleep- just let it auto detect it as apparently users are having greater success at it tracking sleep stages when they don’t manually start a sleep log. Fitbit is working on fixing this issue but for now this seems to be the solution that is having the most success. Changing the bands out isn’t as easy as it was for my Charge 2, but I don’t see it as a big deal? Yeah not all banks are set up for Fitbit Pay yet, but I’m sure more will get on board in no time. And if not, to me, it’s not a big deal. I bought the special edition because I wanted the regular black bands and the special woven bands, not because I cared about paying for things using my watch instead of with my card or phone. The steps don’t show up right away. Just because you don’t see the number going up with every step doesn’t necessarily mean it isn’t detecting them. I’d say it can take up to a minute to update. If they’re not showing up at all, and if resetting the device doesn’t work, then maybe you’re walking too softly or on too soft of a surface. Another thing I would recommend is making sure your old Fitbit device (if you have one) is no longer connected to your phone via Bluetooth. Also, Fitbit devices detect actual flights of stairs climbed- they don’t detect flights climbed when you’re stepping on a stair stepper because your altitude isn’t actually changing (at least it’s not changing enough for it to track it). My Versa so far has not been tracking all my active minutes. I sweat a lot and I move a lot when I’m working out. My Charge 2 would stop tracking my heart rate altogether while I was working out whereas the Versa so far just doesn’t detect how high my heart rate actually is when I’m that sweaty. So what I do, is I manually log my workouts to ensure I’m recording my active minutes for the day. And when you do this it also will give an estimate for how many calories you burned based on that manual log.<br/><br/>I will update if any of my opinions change! For now I will leave multiple screenshots showing all the apps currently available on the Versa, as well as some (not even all!) of the clock faces available, as well as any other pictures I think of that are relevant to the Versa :)<br/><br/>It’s an amazing fitness smart watch for the price and I am SO glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews that were getting left earlier this week! And believe me, I came close to not buying one because of how many bad reviews immediately after the Versa’s release!
 I love my Fitbit versa! Great app selections. Comfortable and so many different workout options. Tracks all my actions great! I love it.
 So far meeting expectations. Does all the exercise tracking features I wanted.  Nice to have step &amp; heart rate. Overall a great sports watch! Got for swim feature and highly recommend!
 My wife loves it. Her previous version was a Garmin which did not give her credit for biking or stair climbing. This one does those things and lets her buy Starbucks with an app also!
 Seems to work pretty well overall. May pick up extra steps here or there but that’s to be expected wearing it on my wrist. My only real complaint is all of the apps need to upgraded to “premium” to get most the content which is frustrating when you already pay a decent amount for the product. Also there still aren’t very many apps available.
 Great for people who want to focus on their fitness
 I love how it has a stopwatch/timer of its own. It also has the pandora app preinstalled so you can listen to music, time your workouts all with this awsome smart watch.
 I purchased my Fitbit purely for the motivation to increase my activity to lose some weight and improve cardio.  It’s great!  Nothing ever comes from not having a goal to reach.  Fitbit keeps me on track.
 I had a Fitbit charge2 before I bought the Versa.  Loved the Charge2 love the Versa.
 Stopped working after 2weeks<br/>Screen constantly had white lines across it<br/>Had a red light that wouldn’t shut off and burned my skin<br/>Get a different smart watch
 My wife love it great product.
 It looks nicer than apple watch its better than all smart watches in fitness and health tracking
 Bought this for my daughter’s Christmas present.
 I think that the fitbit versa is a great tool to help stay in shape and it is stylish as well. Many different options and tools. Great motivator.
 I love literally everything about it EXCEPT the way the bands are inserted and taken out. I chip or break a nail every time I want to change it. Other than that, love it!! Love that it’s lightweight and that the screen is big.
 Brand new and less expensive than purchasing it on the Fitbit website
 Will not stay connected to the Bluetooth on my phone (Galaxy S9+). I don't have any problems with my Fitbit Blaze or Galaxy Watch.
 encourages my wife exercise<br/>big and bright and also reminds my wife to rest
 Unfortunately this band did not fit my versa at all!  The metal part that attaches to the face was too large. This side would not attach at all and the other side attached but did not fit like it should either. Poor quality control! If this band was made for the versa it should fit perfectly. Really disappointed!
 i Was really concerned at first about the clam of being waterproof. After swimming all day I had no problem. There are so many features I love, vibrates every hour to remind be to get up and walk and it tells me how many hours I sleep a night.
 I love my versa! However I've been having issues with it shutting off, the time resetting itself and stalling issues. I have read reviews that this happens to others. Though I love my versa I won't recommend it to others.... Way too many issues.
 Overall this purchase is disappointing. The Versa is good looking. I like being able to choose my watch face. I like the alarm feature. I like the rose gold. I like being able to track my heart rate, steps and sleep. However the Versa falls short in many areas. The app is glitchy and syncing or looking at your data is often an exercise in frustration as it frequently freezes or crashes several times. I am typing this review while I am waiting for data to update, process I started after 10 minutes and three crashes convinced me it was time to post a review. I liked the idea of having my Starbucks card on my Fitbit, unfortunately the app has never allowed me to open up that feature and enter the info. My notifications have only worked twice in the months that I have owned it. I am fairly tech savvy, but I can't get them to consistently work and going by online forums, I am not alone. The most amusing/frustrating part of all this is that when I bought this, I also ordered a $29 knock off for my husband to try a similar alarm. His $29 pedometer has more features and works all the time. He can even use his as a remote to take pictures with his phone. I spent $199 and mine has issues all the time. The only advantage I can see to the Versa is it's prettier, but for the money I wish I had sent this back and bought the $29 one for me too.
 I love the new versa!
 Awesome
 Would like an easier way to pay for different watch faces.  Like one click thru Amazon.
 Love how much customization this watch has. Had the blaze before this and really didn't like it. The charger and not being water proof at all plus it didn't really keep track of my notifications. That has really changed since getting the versa.<br/><br/>Long story short versa has a better charger and is water proof and actually keeps track of notifications.
 Extremely happy with this product.  It was easy to set up and sink with the fitbit information I already had.  It has the convenience of a watch and calendar along with a lot more!  I absolutely love the heart rate monitor.  Important especially for someone my age.  More choices in bands would be nice.
 My 10 yo loves her fitBit
 Great product with fast shipping.
 Love my watch for work and gym.  Let's me know my steps and heart rate at a glance.<br/>Im not giving 5 stars because battery died after 2/3 days and had to recharge before going to gym.  Def need to improve on battery life!
 Easy to customize,  easy to charge,  long lasting battery,  great motivation!
 Great data tracker! Love it!
 I had the Fitbit blaze and was looking to upgrade. Decided to go for the Versa since it looks more girly and I’m so glad i did. I’m obsessed. Really cool features. Use it everyday!
 Great item.
 Gift for a relative. They like it.
 Since August when I shelled out the money for the Versa, I have had to COMPLETELY uninstall the app.  It won't stay connected to Bluetooth or SYNC.  I had to go to settings on Versa FIT BIT, then to the "ABOUT" and do a FACTORY RESET!  This issue is RIDICULOUS and getting very OLD!
 Fast and new
 So far I love this Fitbit. It’s sleek and no one even knows it’s a Fitbit.
 I've had several fitbit products over the years 2 flex, 2 Altas, 1 Alta hr, and the dreaded charge that fell apart completely within a year.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm usually very happy with my fitbit and the app, but I've got to say that I'm contemplating sending this one back and getting another brand. I've had it less than 24 he's and I've had to set up my versa 3 times, restart my phone at least ten times, and search through the Internet to figure out why it won't do what it is supposed to do right out of the box: sync, change watch faces, connect to wifi... Really, it's currently a very expensive, large, not very pretty watch that sometimes shows my heart rate.<br/><br/>It did manage to track my sleep overnight and sync that to my phone, but nothing else will sync.<br/><br/>After my Alta Hr died a few months ago, I decided to wait until this one had come out. I read reviews, everything seemed positive with only a few complaints about not containing an on board GPS, which I don't need. It all seemed great. Now when I'm searching for a way to fix the sync issue, I'm finding ask the problems people are having.<br/><br/>This is fitbit's last chance to keep me as a customer, I decided that when my Alta died. At this point, I'm ready to just give up on smart watches/trackers all together, except for the fact that I gained 10lbs since I stopped wearing my Alta.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a few more days, but I'm not holding out for much at this point.
 Once I figured out how to download the app, I’ve loved my Fitbit. I’m not tech savvy so figuring it out was challenging for me but I’m learning more and more. It’s definitely helped me be more active which was one of my goals.
 I’m am soooooo happy with this purchase! Fitbit is amazing! It keeps me motivated all day long!
 Daughter wears it all the time
 I love that i can see who texted me and what they said. Being able to deny a call from my watch is so helpful at work if I need to shut it down quick. I wish you could text from it but that ok. Over all such a great watch so happy I finally bought it. Super hard to change the bands tho....
 This is the best smartwatch out there , love it!
 Love ❤️ it and I ordered new band which are fabulous
 I’ve had trouble with fitbits lasting just beyond their warranties, then dying.  Hopefully, this one will be better. So far the functionality is pretty good.  The HR monitor still doesn’t work near tattoos.
 at least once a day I have to reconnect with bluetooth, I have called and they refused to send me another one.
 My husband and I got a matching set. We both have no issues.
 This was a great gift for me
 I like the size, easy to read. Easy to use.wish the the charge lasted a bit longer. All in all, good purchase!
 I was so excited when I saw they were coming out with the Versa.  My only options prior to this were the Apple Watch or Fitbit Ionic.  The Fitbit Ionic was so bulky and ugly looking and the Apple Watch just can’t compete with Fitbit for fitness tracking in my opinion.  The Versa has the sleekness I was looking for in the Apple Watch and almost all the tracking capabilities I was looking for in the Ionic (wish it had built in GPS but not a deal breaker).  The Versa is so lightweight I barely notice it on my wrist.  Very happy with it so far!
 Super cute color, I love the different workout settings and guided meditation, it is super similar to the ionic minus the gps, but for 199 it is a pretty awesome tracker. My only drawback is there is currently no spotify option but hopefully thatll change in the future!
 Wife wanted one, got her one for valentines day... She loves it... Likes tracking her sleep, checking her heart rate, counting her steps etc.
 Upgraded from fitbit charge 2. Great improvement.  Love the apps.
 The fit was good and I preferred the overall shape in comparison to the apple watch however, you can't respond to texts unless you have a Samsung/Android phone and that was one of the major factors for getting so returned. But otherwise everything seemed great.
 Loving my new watch especially the fabric band
 Love it !!!
 I love the various features, especially the fact that it's waterproof, plus the changeability of the face.  It looks more like a watch than a fitness tracker, but it's a great fitness tracker!
 I have been wearing this 3 days straight since I have received it. I love it! Super easy to set up and user friendly. I love the big screen and how girly it is! It’s all and more that I wanted and needed in a Fitbit. Love!
 Arrived on time and great quality watch in daily wear.
 I've only had it for 4 days but so far I love it. Still learning about the functions of it.
 This is the most frustrating product I have ever purchased. When it works it is amazing. Unfortunately, it only works about 35% of the time. random sync errors and very slow to discover after many restarts reinstalls and restores. I have a Samsung Galaxy S7. My wife has the same phone but a Fitbit charge 2 and hers Works flawlessly. Very disappointed.
 It was exactly what my daughter wanted, works great.
 Great price and product
 Much better then my old blaze that I got wet and the heart rate monitor stopped working. Prolly around twice as many features and much sleeker design. First thing I did was put a screen protector on this little investment.
 Amo el diseño y cumplió con mis expectativas, tal vez falta mejorar un poco el conteo de pasos, pero está muy bien
 My daughter had been asking for one for years, so I got her one for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. Works as described.
 Its great. Only thing i don't really like is the little lever for removing the bands. Very unnecessary in my opinion. The charge 2 had a very efficient removal system.
 My husband loves it, the battery lasted 7 days.
 Couldn’t get it to play pandora or pair easily with my iPhone
 Stopped working less than 2 months after purchasing it
 Like the charging  Wish time was all bold numbers instead of just two
 I was worried the peach band vs the woven would be uncomfortable, but it looks and feels great! I love this watch!!
 Came in a sealed package brand new, perfect!
 Does everything it suppose to do
 Love the look, feel and function. No disappointment so far.
 Performs as promised, wish it made calls &amp; texts, but I’m enjoying the features i have.
 I bought this because my older Fitbit Blaze stopped holding a charge after a few years of use.  Super disappointed that I barely get 1.5 days out of the Versa which is nowhere near the 4 day claim.
 Really love the fit and all the features! Same great fitbit with bonuses!
 Love the watch
 Great watch. Was kinda a pain to get and keep connected with my phone. But overall works great. Batter life is at least 2 days with average use.
 Ordered it for my husband’s birthday when his Fitbit died- he loves it!
 Easy to read, love the additional apps, unlike the surge, the strap can be swapped out. I’m not a small or a large. So it’s great that I can swap bands. Love the weather app, the sleep monitor’s sensitivity, and the nap.
 Christmas present for my wife. I bought a d different colored band as well.<br/>I have one too .<br/>Easy to use<br/>Easy to learn
 Started my Fitbit journey with the blaze watch and I would have to say I really like this better. The only thing that bothers me is the limited amount of watch faces that are free from Fitbit. It seems like a cash grab just because they can.
 Good product, but with Android 6.0 and later, the Fitbit software required that GPS remain on in order to sync. I utterly despise the idea of having GPS on all the time to remain synced. Go with a Garmin instead. Not "smart" enough to cost this much. Returned the same day.
 Birthday gift for granddaughter. She loves it
 I simply LOVE my Fitbit watch that I purchased my mom the Fitbit Alta HR.  This watch has helped me walk more than I initially planned &amp; started out. I also find that I only need to charge it once a week so it does hold its charge well
 The first one I ordered the touchscreen stopped working, but fitbit sent me a new one. No issues since.
 I wish it was a chip I would have it inserted in my arm. I love this device!
 I upgraded from a blaze and I am so far very disappointed, the versa will not vibrate when I get incoming text messages or phone calls, but it vibrates for alarms and step notifications. I’ve set with Fitbit support and they have done nothing but request a video of the problem which frankly not sure how that is going to fix it.
 Love.
 Fitbit Versa Smart Watch
 Bought this in November 2018, 3 months later it started acting up and now it won’t work at all. Very disappointed.
 It’s almost perfect. The only thing is you can’t respond to texts if you have an iPhone. That option is only available for andriod. They are supposed to come out with an update for the iPhone but they haven’t released when...
 I love my versa! Having such a small App Store (or gallery as it’s called) is the only major drawback.
 This was a gift for my 12 year old and she loves it! Very comparable to more expensive smart watch. You’re able to receive texts, listen to music, follow along to work outs, play games and sync Starbucks gift card to it. The rose gold is very pretty!
 Very helpful when working out
 Band turns wrist black in hot weather and you need a medium size.
 Love it, works great. Awesome upgrade from my alta. Good job fitbit, no complaints here!
 Soooo disappointing! I bought this as a Christmas present and soon found out it was unable to make calls and texts as advertised with an android phone. I understand things get misinterpreted but it clearly says in the description and on the product box that calls and texts can be placed. Very misleading.
 Obsessed. Got it as a birthday gift and I love it. Only complaint is that I have to take the case I bought off every time I charge it, but I chose to get a case bc I got a few scratches on my last Fitbit (charge hr). Case isn’t necessary though.
 Fantastic watch for the active person. Stays charged for days and works great.
 This Fitbit is supposed to have a longer lasting battery, it does not.  I charge it on Sunday night and by Tuesday the battery is low again.  Very disappointed,  and would happily return, however, as it worked great for the first weeks,  so I threw the box away.
 This was a good device, but my expectations were too high.  As a previous Pebble owner, I thought it was going to be more similar than it was.
 It  is very good for what i use it for. It does take time to set up, but other than that its great!
 I have only had my Versa a few days but I already love it! I work around water, so the fact that it can get wet is a real plus! I also love that you can personalize it.
 I was looking forward to enjoying this product but since I have had it the screen turns white or glitches out of the blue.  Contacted Fitbit and was advised to let it die then charge it or reset it. Been there done that.  So this is not something I would recommend to purchase.
 Have had it for two months.  It has never recorded sleep accurately like my Charge HR did and it has stopped automatically recording some exercises.  I wanted to upgrade to Versa bc hoping it would calculate calories burned while at the gym but it does as poorly as the charge did.  Terrible at calorie counting.
 My daughter loves this watch I gave her for Christmas
 Pros: many customizable options, long battery life<br/>Cons: sleep tracking doesn't work after less than a week of use.
 Notification options, floor count, apps
 So far a very nice watch. I am surprise at how long the battery life is and how quickly it charges back up.
 Very helpful if you are truly willing to track your fitness. also has other functions as well... very useful and goodlookig
 Ordered for her for her birthday.  She's very happy with it. Uses it daily
 Excellent
 It's like having a GUI for life
 Needs improvement it's a pain in the butt to download music on the watch and not a lot of free wallpapers and watch displays
 I love this watch. I upgraded to this one from the charge 2. It has more of an accurate count of your steps, many watch faces, and looks more like a regular or smart watch.
 I have only had it for 3 days but so far I love it
 Absolutely loved the Versa until it stopped tracking my BPM after having it for less than two months. Everything else still works but to have something so important go out so quickly is really disappointing. Definitely be careful when weighing your options for a fitness tracker.
 My husband has enjoyed using all of the features
 I love the look and the ability to change bands so easy. But I had a Samsung Galaxy 8, worked great with the Fitbit Versa. Changed to iPhone 8+ not doing as much with it as before. I know it’s probably Apple vs android... just not right in my opinion, would like it if the Versa worked the same with both types of phones.
 Love it. Great for working out
 Was a gift and her love it. She never leaves the watch.
 I really like the color of the watch and I have been looking for a good fit-bit watch to help with my activities and daily life. I am glad I purchased this watch it has made my life easier and helps me out a lot if I forget to do something it will alarm me and let me know.
 Personal use
 Tracking of my steps my water intake, my food intake and my sleeping. I also like the fact that it reminds me to move and get my steps in per hour.
 Love my watch cutest ever works great
 I have really liked my Fitbit so far. The only dislike is that some of the face options ask for a credit card. Why should I have to pay for more?
 would not track my sleep.
 only had it about 24 hours but it was easy to set up and im figuring it out quickly. I really like it
 Love it use it 5 times a week need to take weekend off but so far pushing for 10,000 steps a day lost about 7 LB so far thank you.
 This is a gift for my fiance on our wedding day which is on June 17th.  I hope he loves it!  He already has a fitbit but I want'ed to get him a better one.  This has features he will love
 Love my new Fitbit
 This is the first time i write a review, but after not even 7 months the screen died. I purchased one fitbit for myself and one for my mom, as a gift. her is still working, while mine died when i was at the gym. The screen just stopped working... I am evry disapointed with the product.
 I love the  Fitbit Versa...however,  I have had it for only 6 months and it will not hold the charge.  I am returning it.
 Christmas gift for my wife which she has enjoyed very much from the fitness/health tracker and great battery life.
 I've read lots of complaints about the issues with notifications, but my fitbit has worked well from day 1. Tracks everything I want and provides comprehensive stats on a weekly basis. Add the cherry on top is the battery life - five days, can't be beat.
 Absolutely love this Fitbit, it has everything you need to track your activity.  Comfortable band that doesn't bother me when I'm working out.
 As described
 Fitbit
 I'm glad I made the leap in this watch!
 I love this fitbit. I've been thinking about getting one for a long time and I'm glad I finally did. It really helps me keep track of my sleep and workouts is wonderful.
 This watch cannot connect to N or AC class WIFI network, it takes few hours to download and update the watch O/S.<br/>Poor value for the price.
 Works great I love this thing
 Very convenient, useful
 I'm not quite sure how this can be used to it's potential when the battery lasts a max of 7 hours! Piece of junk! It's worthless to me!
 I love my fit bit Versa! Its great. Its not only a fitness tracker but a smart watch. I see my messages and emails its great! I love the reminders. It literally makes me get up move.
 what else can I say other then the headline
 I bought this for my mother for mother’s day. She had never been able to connect to Bluetooth, and during exercises the buttons get hit &amp; no longer records the exercise. She thought it was a glitch &amp; took a while to inform me that it needs to be returned. Please advise how to return this item.. My mother &amp; myself are Prime members.
 Perfect
 Works great, I love it
 I bought this watch for my husband who has heart problems. It lets us know his heart rate and how much quality sleep he gets every night.  I would definitely recommend !
 Was a anniversary gift to wife. She loved it..
 I wrote an earlier review and want to change it.  It was hard getting it downloaded but it finally did after turning off my phone and resetting it.  Love the Versa fitbit.
 As advertised, love the multiple watch face options.
 I have had issues with the watch constantly. I have spoken with FITBIT a couple times to rectify the situation but to no avail. IT is dead now and it has been a frustrating experience. I did not have the same issues with my Alta. It was great! I would like a replacement.
 I had an Alta which gave up the ghost a few weeks ago, so I thought I would upgrade to the Versa. I am glad I did, although it is a little Intimidating at first.
 Love it but still working to get the sleep stats right
 Love it. I had a garmin and enjoyed the find my phone feature. The Fitbit does not have this. I do like my sleep monitored and my heart rate.
 My fave watch ever
 I am having difficulty syncing my item with my phone.  I never had this problem with the fitbit hr or the fitbit charge 2.  It's been trying to sync for an hour now.
 Another gift for my husband and he loves it!
 I love how I can see text and phone calls, but don’t have to answer.
 Very clean and ready to be used. The package wasn’t original box and could tell it was repackaged but the mateirals are brand new looks like. Seems work well and got it good price. Would give 4.5 stars and they also arrived on time (a day early I believe)
 The best watch ever
 Gift for me dad and he loves it !
 Greatest
 I like that I get my text messages and emails on the watch.
 Best fitness band to track your daily fitness routine and weight control .
 I have no cons for this Fitbit! Absolutely love it!
 No good
 Linked right to my iPhone XR. Works exactly as expected!
 Love my fit bit a lot wear it everyday just love it so much
 The watch was working perfect until suddenly it stop working, only had it for 3 months, please let me know how I can get a replacement.  Thank you!
 I love this tracker.  I had the Blaze and Alta previously but this one is so much more user friendly.  I simply love it!!!!
 I've had this product for 3 weeks and I am thoroughly disappointed. Yesterday my battery died and I set it on the charger for an hour. I came back to see that not only it hadn't charged at all, but also was burning hot. This was the third time I've charged it total. This is unacceptable.
 Wonderful purchase!  My husband loves it.
 have it on all day every day
 This thing is amazing. The step counter and heart rate monitor are pretty accurate. It also breaks down your sleep cycles with was really interesting to see. Definitely recommend
 Works great! Had a Charge 2 for a year and decided I wanted to do some aquatic activities. The Versa has been my first and favorite smart watch.
 Love the features
 Love this Fitbit. My favorite to date.
 I went from HR 2, like the extra that come with this.
 Bought it for my son. He loved it. A little hard to figure out need more direction.
 Great phone app UI. Tracks my workouts and sleep very well.
 I had it for a week now and all is good.  It is motivating and easily synced to my android phone.  I plan on buying additional bands.
 Been using Fitbit for years!  By far, the Versa is amazing!!
 I love it
 So far it works fantastic. Takes a while to set up but no biggie. Super comfortable to wear around once you’re used to it. Highly recommend buying black because it doesn’t get as dirty.
 Love it!  Does exactly what was advertised.
 I like the many options for the clock face. It is comfortable.  Unfortunately, I still cannot get the weather to sync.  I have researched online and others have had the same issue.
 Love my Fitbit Versa, keeping me on track with exercise and the many other wonderful things it does.
 So far, I love the Versa. I have only had it for two days, but I love how much it does! I have had an Alta for the past two years, but the Versa has so many more capabilities.
 Battery truly last 4 days
 Altohugh I’m using the Versa with an Ipad, and the watch is designed to work with an smart phone, I LOVE the experience. It is a great samrtwatch, nbo doubt superior to other Fitbit trackers, and in some aspects even better than Apple’s watch 3
 Love it
 After a couple of days of messing around getting the versa to update its firmware,  finally success! 😉  Very happy with my purchase. Don't give up, it's well worth it.
 Love it works great keeps track of everything I wanted it to thanks
 You can’t download any app you want. Its only what they allow. So you have to pay to listen to there music apps &amp; Pandora only allows you to have 3 stations. Other than that its not bad
 Still getting use to it, but thus far I am not disappointed.
 I love this watch. Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he decided it wasn’t for him, so I kept it for myself!
 Great watch<br/>Not happy with changing band
 This is the cheapest I could find this fitbit. I am really pleased with it.
 Very versatile.  All information available right away
 love it
 I love it. It's comfortable. The water resistance was so important for work and it keeps me motivated yo stay active. Also I live how it tracks my sleep patterns and breaks everything down
 Got this for my fiance. I've been wanting to get her an Apple Watch but she loved her last fitbit because it has a built-in sleep tracker which she uses daily. That with the addition of a long battery life and water resistance made it a total win.
 All good
 I’ve only had it a few days and still learning but I love it! I’ve swam, ran and biked with it and it Tracks your distance great! Battery life is great! I’m very happy
 So far, so good.
 I love my Fitbit Versa. It came carefully packaged and is just what I wanted.
 Got this for mother's day. LOVE IT. Its super sleek. I took the pink band off and replaced it with a black band. Sooo cute.
 I couldn't not recieve text messages, returned this product.
 I genuinely love this smartwatch. I upgraded from the Charge 2 to this and it’s a world apart, so many added features it’s awesome. I would definitely recommend.
 Love my new Versa. My old Fitbit died and had to upgrade. I am completely happy with my choice.
 I like the watch when it actually works. Apparently it's not compatible with my Pixel 2 XL. I spoke with customer service about my syncing issues and I was told to try another device. I don't want to use it on another device. I'm pretty disappointed.
 Great product. Paired easily to iPhone
 Super easy to setup and operate !
 Love the look. Easy to read outdoors
 Love this watch. I'm a lifelong fitbit fan.
 Eventually my wife has great looking hand watch and
 So far, so GREAT! Very inspirational!
 I got this for my dad for Christmas! He loves it.
 The shipping was spot on ! The VERSA is living up to my expectations! I recommend the product to anyone that is looking to start out with a Fitbit or wants to upgrade.
 Ok
 I LOVE this Versa!! Super clear display &amp; easy to read from any angle. I replaced my Alta HR fitbit after I drowned it in my brothers pool on July 3. I needed waterproof &amp; this is it!
 Love the FitBit Versa and especially love the rose gold with pink band.  Comes with 2 size bands which are easy to change if needed.  Love all of the different function it has, specifically sleep tracking and steps.
 I am getting more sleep because of this thing.  I love it.
 Color was beautiful. Very comfortable and lightweight but wasnt very functional. Didn't like how you couldn't respond to text. The pandora only allowed three stations and weren't allowed to pick stations I liked.
 After buying and using a Pebble 2 and an Amazfit Bip, I finally found a good smartwatch in the Versa. My only suggestion is to come up with a month long or longer battery.
 Love my old one.  This one is cool but the battery life sucks!  I’m luck to get through an entire day.
 I like everything because Ed I don’t have my phone with me I can see who’s calling me or texting me and I do not miss any phone calls love it
 I love the fitbit versa, my only issue was I ordered the peach rose and I got the black.
 I get compliments on this all the time. It’s cute, it’s lightweight, and the functionality is great!! I’m glad I caved in a bought one.
 Love it
 I have had a really hard time getting the watch to sync with my phone - liked the Blaze better and may go back to the Blaze
 It’s ok just doesn’t work well with apple you can only see who is calling and txting, you can’t answer the calls or txt back
 Works great, easy to set up and sync to my iPhone 8, battery life is great. Love that you can change to an actual leather band, I have never like the rubber/silicone bands on other trackers. I wear it every day to keep me motivated to move. I love the ability to change the watch face and personalize it.
 Love it
 My Versa lasts days without a charge. Keeps track o fly schedule and activities better than any other fitness band I have tried.
 I don’t like the looks of it but it does seem to monitor well
 Quick battery usage
 Bought as a gift for my girlfriend and she LOVES it! Loves all the features and when I helped setting it up it was super easy. The FitBit app is really nice compared to others.
 Excellent product, my son loved it .
 Excellent smart watch.
 So functional! Great value!
 I got this for my girl and she is in love with it and takes it everywhere and can confirm its very useful
 I want to like this watch, but the simple fact that I cannot get it to sync makes it useless to me. Yes, I have tried every trouble shooting suggestion offered in fitbits website. Ive read every forum with suggestions from other fitbit owners and nothing has worked.
 Watch worked great for about 3 weeks then the screen started going haywire. Apparently this is a common issue. Will be exchanging for a new one
 ❤️
 Easy to use and very useful
 Has a nice slim design.  I love that it's swim proof! I think this will be a nice upgrade from my charge2.
 Battery life, simplicity, sharp, health reporting. All you need in a smart watch
 My daughter loves this watch.  Big numbers and many features
 Good
 I like the look of the Versa but having hard time syncing my text messages to phone. Email and calls go thru fine, but text messages do not even after allowing permission.
 I got this Fitbit watch for my mom as a Mother's Day gift and it was exactly what I expected and my mom fell in love with it I recommend this
 Wife loves her Versa. If she loves it I love it.
 I’m new to smart watches and so far I’ve really enjoyed this. I mainly want it for fitness and training and have enjoyed that. Some of the apps haven’t been helpful or never load.
 No gps, it does not sink correctly with other apps, heart rate is not accurate, during bike ride still keeps counting the steps.
 This is a great product , Fitbit lives upto the quality of an ace fitness tracker . Only challenge is to sync easily with my iPhone . It’s really annoying.<br/>I will still give it a thumbs up 👍👍
 Constant problems. You spend more time trying to fix it than using it. Won’t sync any longer. Tech supports fix-all response is just factory reset it. In turn loose all the data you’re trying to track which is why you bought it in the first place. Prevent the headache, find a better product. Huge let down.
 Loved it but it doesn't work with android 4.0
 I really like the Fitbit Versa. I was a bit nervous about the size of the face as I have smaller wrist, but it looks great. It fits perfectly, and is light weight. It was short of being 5 stars as the charging cable I received out of the box was faulty. I had to buy a new charger in order to use the watch.
 I love that it tells me the time. Hated that it always has a negative opinion of my life choices
 I can not get my Fit bit Versa to connect to WiFi. I have a Samsung 7 Edge can anyone help me out?
 Something it doesn't measure my steps right
 The Versa watch is okay. There is a huge disconnect between the software for the app and the software for the Versa. I've owned fitbits for nearly three years and never had any issues with my charge 2 or alta. My only dealings with customer service were great, back then. Since getting the Versa it has been a nonstop nightmare. I've had to chat with and call customer service at least six times. The app won't properly sync my data from the watch. Every single rep gives me a different story. First they said there was a glitch in the versa software.  Well actually, the first rep said my synced steps for a step challenge were inaccurate because of a time zone difference between myself and the user who created the challenge; I spent at least an hour painfully explaining the math that made this explanation impossible (my cumulative totals from day today were adding incorrectly and the sync was shortchanging me an arbitrary number of steps every day, making my total step count more inaccurate each day; if the issue had been caused by the timezone, there would have been a finite number of missing steps based on the difference between my midnight and midnight in the time zone wherein the challenge originated. That discrepancy would have been a one time loss of steps toward my total, my versa sync was dropping off random steps each day and they were adding up). Then they said its because I have a Samsung galaxy s9 and there isn't an updated version of the app available for my phone becauae it's too new. Then another rep said that it's a Bluetooth error. Regardless of the cause, the hassle of getting this thing to sync and store my data as it should, is maddening. The fun of being in a step challenge has been totally killed by the forty seven hoops I have to jump through to get a sync. Every time I sync I have to disconnect my versa and delete it off my app, I have to unpair it from my Bluetooth, and I have to restart my phone and the versa. Then rediscover the versa and set it up like a new device all over again. Every. Single. Time. Otherwise it just wont sync. And even with all the unpairing and restarts, it still misses data. I don't have sleep data from June 19- July 8. No idea why.<br/><br/>I miss having a fitbit that would just work and make it fun to track my steps. This thing stresses me out so much it's basically a super expensive watch with a terrible battery life.<br/><br/>Oh PS, the versa charger is so clunky and awkward. Ugh. Another terrible design feature.
 I love this fitbit
 Love my Versa!
 Great gift for health conscious people. So many wonderful features to keep you on track. A must for everyone.
 I'm enjoying the Fitbit all the day. I checked sleep analysis and automated activity tracking.<br/>I have even wore it while swimming and swimming tracking is also working up to some point.<br/>Packaging and delivery was great and totally happy about that.
 Very fast shipping and nice product
 Love it
 Great watch! Worked well. Great battery.
 screen cracked putting it in the charger fit bit said so SAD for you
 An awesome upgrade from the Alta! Used it for the first time today at the gym, it was incredible. Definitely worth the money!!
 Bought for my wife for Christmas.  She loves it. Does everything thing she wanted it too and really, I like it better thsn my blaze.
 Best purchase of the year!!! Love it
 Product is everything it promises to be but after about a months use the screen went out. Everything continued to work except the screen. Contacted Fitbit and was sent a replacement easily.
 Not bad price
 Works great, and very well-featured compared to past Fitbit watches. It's light, and people have commented on its design a few times. I also love the fabric band.
 Love this new Fitbit!
 Wears very well great for swimming and display is designed well. The battery life is shorter then other product but to tels you when it needs charged so you have time to plan.  Con be easily programmed to track what is important to each person.
 Great fitness tool. Accurate. Easy to set up.
 Mother day gift.  Wife loves it.
 So far I love this watch and keeping track of my activities.  It’s a bit overwhelming with all that it does but in time I’m sure I have it all down.
 It’s a great watch for the price.
 Most apps and feature require your phone to be the conduit to get info.  Also, the interface was clunky and limited. Not what I expected.
 Awesome product!!! Would definitely purchase again!!
 I loved it at first but then I realized how many features I was missing out on with the Apple Watch, really did not want to switch over but it offers a lot more to me since I’ve always been using apple, Apple Music Apple Pay. But it’s a great device
 Very good quality
 I love the Versa, I upgraded from the Alta.
 Attaching the band was a nightmare.
 I loved that I could change things on it n I got text messages... music. The down side is it didnt recored my steps. I only did half if them. That's the whole reason I bought it.
 I love my new FitBit Versa.  I am addicted with getting my steps and workouts.
 Fitbit tech support could not solve the common problem.I will never buy a fitbit product again.
 I love the smooth lines of the watch. Tracks steps, floors, calories and more. I like that I can receive my text and notifications on my watch.
 Wife loves it
 Very light weight. Love that I can change the clock face at any given time.
 I had a charge 2 and decided to upgrade to the versa and I’m glad I did! I absolutely love this watch!
 It has helped me keep myself accountable for my workouts, it’s nice when I meet all my daily goals and get a party on my wrist (and the app).<br/><br/>But would be nice if it was more consistent with notifications.
 Bought this for my son in December 2028 for my sons Christmas gift.  It has stopped working in the last week and has been very well taken care of, we are trying to get help and I will post an update.
 I love everything about this watch, so far nothing to dislike!
 Very fun and awesome to see stats
 Very satisfied. This is my first smart watch and I am very happy with it. The only "issue" I had was while setting up the Versa, it took FOREVER...like an hour to load. I guess this has been an issue with a lot of people but just give it time.
 I  like the  size of the watch face and the flexible watch band.
 Life changing.
 Love the features. Took forever to set up initially. Still have problems syncing to fitbit app sometimes. But overall, it’s a great watch.
 So far I really like the watch.  The wrist band is a lot more comfortable than that of my previous fitbit.  Can't wait to test it during swimming.
 Great battery life
 The most liked feature is it encourages me to walk more.  The least liked is that it counts me riding my Harley as steps.  Lol. Could be goood or bad I guess.  Up to you.  😂
 Love this watch!
 Long battery life, good info, multiple free watch faces to choose from!
 I really enjoy this watch and any Fitbit product is easy to use. My only issue is that the notification feature does not work with messenger +
 It was extremely hard to attach the band to the watch.
 I’m returning mine just because it won’t stay connected to my iPhone 8. Not on Bluetooth or WiFi it always looses connection and it doesn’t record good the walking and sleep.
 Love that I can see my texts, emails, etc. at a glance, all while tracking my steps!
 Love it. Exceeds all my expectations.
 This is my third Fitbit watch, this time the Versa. I love it. I love that I can track almost anything. It is such a great motivator to move and keep active. I would recommend Fitbit to anyone!
 It have everything I need
 Liked the large face of the watch, easy setup, but takes awhile about 30 minutes. From day/night #1, fully charged and setup for my husband since important to monitor his sleep as he is on CPAP machine. Not recorded his sleep. We tried changing position on his dominant left hand.  Even tried having the watch face position on his inner wrist. Still NO accurate reading of his sleep. Then I wore the Versa on my left non-dominant wrist after changing to the smaller band and set up a new Versa Fitbit on my smartphone. The overnight sleep was correct.  So now I know it is not broken, but for some reason the sleep mode does not work. The other tracking eg. Steps taken, heart rate are  working. Is the problem because he is on  a CPAP machine, or the watch on his dominant wrist, or the wrist band not loose enough?  We have spent past 2 weeks trying to get the sleep tracker to record his sleep pattern at least once.
 very nice, I love it
 Over all this is a activity tracker and smart watch. I love that it is waterproof.
 Doesnt have flight Mode
 I have had to return two of these.  They didn't last more than 60 days.  Very cheaply made
 The wife loves it.
 Easy set up with cell phone...fits comfortable on my hand.
 I totally love the fact I can put a picture of my grandsons on my watch.
 My houseband love this watch
 I have only had this since August - had trouble with syncing the first day, that was fixed and it was fine. Now for the past at least 2 weeks, it will not stay synced. Really need to know how to get this replaced or refunded, very annoying.
 Absolutely love this watch! Went from an Apple Watch to this Fitbit and it was an easy transaction. Highly recommend!
 Great
 I bought the Fitbit versa as an upgrade from the Fitbit charge 2 for the bigger screen while I bike and run. Pretty much the same watch. I was going to buy the apple series 3 but stayed with Fitbit for excerse apps. Should have probably bought Apple Watch.
 My gf loves the look and color. But we returned it because it was hard to use.
 Love my new Versa. It's comfortable,  nice looking and easy to view my daily progress. I haven't had time to figure out all the features but so far I'm very happy with it.
 Love it! I’m not sure how accurate it is on calorie count but it keeps me aware or calorie intake.
 Love all the features!
 Great fitness tracker and smart watch. My biggest motivation for upgrading to this from the Fitbit Blaze was the ability to swim with it. The versa looks pretty sleek too, and is very solidly built. Beats everything in its price range and is a good amount cheaper than the Apple Watch.
 Perfect and easy to use. Only downer is the requirement for a subscription for music or old school download from a computer.
 Love it!
 Worth the buy ! I love my versa. It stays charged for 4 full days, and if you’re looking for a fitness watch this is a great one !
 It's perfect. Just like the pictures. Syncing was easy peasy.
 Love my fitbit
 Bought as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves it!
 Really love my Fitbit Versa! Would absolutely recommend it to anyone whether they enjoy fitness or not. Way cheaper than an Apple Watch, but does everything I need it for-notifications, heart rate, sleep, miles, etc! Only issue I have had was changing the band which took about 3 people and 2 hours to do.
 The watch itself is quite good. Fitbit does have an issue with updating water consumption and giving a current total. Once they can fix that and some syncing issues I will cionaider 5 stars
 Love it!
 Easy to set up and use. Glad I made the purchase
 The screen wake setting is *not smart* at all. Even in manual mode, the screen wakes occasionally. There's no way to make it sleep, maybe we need a 'do not disturb' mode.
 I went through 2 off brand trackers and returned them after a week. This baby just keeps on working like a charm. I cant get over it!!!
 I like it, wish it did a bit more but it’s fine
 I love this.
 I absolutely love it and for the price it’s amazing. You of course have limitations with it in comparison to something like an Apple Watch but it also isn’t costing you a small fortune.
 More than I expected
 If you’re looking for accuracy this watch isn’t for you. I am frustrated and at times very angry at the lack of quality of this product.
 I ordered one of the first Fitbit Versa watches and it broke after 4 months and is not longer under warranty.
 I really love this watch. I bought it to help me not miss notifications and to help me be more active. Works great with my note 8.
 Loved the strap for the first week. After about the second week it began to smell funny. I only worked out in it and never showered with it. Glad it came with a rubber strap as well. Might wanna save the cloth like one for out on the town.
 Great watch .  Came with two extra bands.  Also the fit bit blaze bands fit great on this watch.
 So easy to wear, very light and comfortable.
 Love the decent price. Really lasts 4 days. Has cool workouts! Even works with my one plus 6t.
 Just got mine Saturday, after having an Alta for years! Love the HR tracking, sleep tracking, and customizable clock screens! Impressive fit, not too bulky like I was afraid! *strap separately purchased on amazon*
 Fast<br/>Delivery!!! New in the box!
 Love it
 Still figuring it out
 Love it!
 I have only had my Versa for a few days but love it so far
 Love it 🥰 great battery 🔋  tracks your heath realy well.
 Excelent sport and casual watch
 Works well! Although I’ve been wearing it for the past 2 months and I have yet to see a 6 pack.
 Love this! I wear it everyday and change out the bands as needed. Have noticed the fabric band is getting dirty after a couple of months.
 I wanted a watch not just a fit bit this was just what I was looking for
 Great for working out! Accurate steps and calories and able to change my music without having to sinc my watch through a computer
 Great overall product.  The battery life is amazing, run tracking seems accurate. No negatives so far.
 Item was a gift
 I bought it for my girlfriend, and she loves it. She is currently pregnant, so I like the fact that it monitors her viral and I can assist her as well in case of an emergency through her Fitbit smart. Great investment!
 Ordered the rose gold got black watch
 Only had my Versa for a couple of days but I’m impressed. Love it.
 So far so good. It’s convenient and all you do is put it on and go.
 I ended up returning it.  I liked the fitbit app and layout of the watch, but had way too many problems with the watch. It never stayed synced to my phone, couldn’t keep appropriate time, and the band felt cheap.
 Doesn't count steps actually. Counts steps while I'm driving!
 This is my fourth Fitbit and the best one yet.
 Love this Fitbit!! I wear it everyday. I love that it tracks your sleep patterns. It was one of the main reasons for purchasing this model. Giving it 4 stars because it doesn’t last for 4 days. But even with that it does last at least 2 full days!
 Love it!  Works well.  Only issue is with connecting via Bluetooth...some days it works, some days it doesn't.
 Love the product - would’ve gave a 5 star if I could use quick replies with iPhone and if I was able to ping my phone using the watch when I can’t find my phone
 Love this watch. I am not an apple person.  This does everything I need
 Easy to use, intuitive and love the watch face choices.
 Does a lot
 The heart rate monitor does not work- it’s shows a HR of over 200 all day long.<br/><br/>What is the return policy?
 it will not stay connected to my blue tooth and I have to find it several times a day. I love everything about this watch but this is a huge headache. I have only had it 1 week
 Really motivates me! Like that I can see text and phone calls coming in.
 I purchased a FitBut Versa as a Mother's Day gift for my wife (who's not technical).  After pairing it with her iPhone 8, it worked well for the first month before it started losing time.  The time was off by random hours and minutes -- which is completely unacceptable for a watch.  After multiple factory resets and re-pairing with her iPhone and local wifi, the Versa continued to lose time and finally refused to sync with her iPhone.  Each cycle required a couple hours of time and ended up the same way.  Fitbit Chat support was a waste of time; requiring me to tie up her phone and versa to repeat the same steps again, then wait for a few hours to call back, report the issue and probably go through the same steps again.  I've owned multiple Fitbit's, since my first Pebble on Kickstarter,  including an Ionic; which has been trouble free so far.  After this experience with the Versa and FitBit support,  I won't be purchasing any more Fitbit products.
 I had my Fitbit charge hr and I loved it for three years. I didn’t like it wasn’t waterproof but i made it work.  I got the versa for a mother’s day present. I love that it is waterproof and I can go swimming with it. Nice size and we will see.
 Awesome
 Would be a 5 if you could guick resond to text and silence a phone call.  Other than that I really like the Versa.
 I am really happy with my silver Fitbit. I started to stay more active and feel energetic. I got many compliments.
 It was exactly what I wanted.  I had a Charge 2 but wanted the Versa since it’s larger.
 Battery life is great! The ability to track all of your workout and count your calories is everything I needed, and I got so much more. Great purchase
 makes me pay attention to keep moving
 Love it...when it works. First one, screen went blank after 3 weeks. Got a replacement from Fitbit (which took a month). Replacement is now acting up.  Constantly glitching. Screen flickering, heartrate no longer works. I want my money back!!
 Looks really cool 👍🏽😍
 I love it!  I’ve only had my Versa for a couple of days and haven’t had a chance to wear it in the pool. I did wear it in the shower with no problem. We’re going to the beach in a few weeks so I am excited that I get to keep up with my steps/Laps.
 I upgraded from a Fitbit Blaze to the Versa and I love it 😊
 Just got this and I love it.
 Long battery life, sleek, and had some cool apps. I took a quick shower with it and it bricked. It restarted itself then refused to turn back on. It then grew very hot and I thought it was gonna explode. Now I have to use the warranty. Be careful with your "water resistant" watch.
 Love this watch. It’s extremely light weight and comfortable. Coming from using the Fitbit charge 2, this is a welcomed upgrade!
 I’ve had the fitbit 2 this is sooo deferent .. got a classy look .. comfortable .. big screen size
 Does everything I need!
 If you're looking for an accurate fitness tracker look elsewhere
 This is a sharp watch, don’t get me writing no there. I love the way it fits and is very light weight. What I am upset about is the tech side of the watch. Received yesterday and had to do 4 factory resets while in the phone with support. After the 4th time they decided that the one I received was defective. Had to fedx back today and it will take them 10-15 to ship me a new one back. Now I have to wait... I sold my Apple Watch to by this watch because I love Fitbit products, but this is disappointing. I have upgraded watches and this is my 3rd Fitbit. They should get the kinks out before releasing product
 I like it better than the Apple Watch
 I would like to be able to use my amazon music with the Versa.  I do love the watch
 wristband changing is terrible.  FitBit has terrible customer service.  Very rude and do not care.
 A gift for my wife,she loves it ,tracks everything even her sleep habits
 I gave this to my husband for Christmas to keep up with our health. I do believe it is going to save our lives!!! It keeps up with vitals, exercise, sleep quality just for starters.
 I brought this Fitbit for my wife and she loves it. She doesn’t store music on it but she loves everything about it. From the color, to the last feature. It tracks her sleep pattern very well.
 If you looking for smartwatch but you are not a professional this is a good watch the fits you
 Light, slender, efficient, versatile, battery life good, still learning how to exploit it properly.  Good value.
 I absolutely love it!!!
 I have not been able to use it since I got it. All downloads fail. Amazon won't help in exchanging it. Very frustrated. My last fitbit worked great.
 My wife loves it
 sleek and feminine. Exactly what i had expected. Excited to wear it more!
 I have had my versa for a week and love the features. Especially being able to do my water aerobics class with it on.
 My girlfriend loves it. I might have tip buy one soon.  A wise investment for anyone who works out.
 love love it i wish i brought the special edition one
 I really did like the Fitbit versa and I hope you figure what the glitches were. If so I will order another one. Thanks Jamie
 Not East to configure te first time use
 Watch keeping losing time, takes forever to download the software. Would not purchase again.
 Fabulous watch that provides all the information I need to know every day, all the time.  It is the perfect size, lightweight, easy to use, and very well made.
 
 Bought Versa smartwatch in October, lasted 2 months ,then the battery went dead. Fitbit sent a replacement Versa. That one lasted 1 week. Poor quality product.
 Got this for my wife as an upgrade to her Fitbit Alta HR (bonus, I got her HR). She loves the readily available health information as well as notifications, weather and paying for her Starbucks with a flick of the wrist.
 Shows me everything I need to know in order to stay motivated during exercise. It also shows me everything I don't want to know when I'm not exercising.
 I just love this watch, easy to read, waterproof up to about 135 feet deep, easy to charge
 I’ve had my Fitbit versa for not even two months. When taking it off inside it fell not even 4 feet into a wooden floor and got a sliver crack. It no longer works at all flying through apps and setting its own alarms.<br/>I CONTACTED FITBIT AND THEY SAID THEY CANT DO ANYTHING BUT THEY HAVE SALES ON NEW ONES OCCASIONALLY! Are you kidding me? A watch made for workouts, adventures, and swimming, but can’t take a 4 foot fall on wood and “we have sales occasionally” is all I get on my investment!!!<br/>Never buy their “Apple Watch” imitation that will take your $200 and burn it quicker than lighting your match!
 Perfect for work, can see who calls/texts without touching my phone. Haven’t been able to figure out how to do a one touch response for text but other than that the product does what it states
 Great watch and fantastic customer service. Built in Music Storage, can go phone free! Watch would be perfect if it had GPS
 Would like to have had instructions
 I like all the features, it’s the best gift I ever received.
 Love it!!! Amazing brand new product.  Arrived on time.
 Got this product for my wife as a christmas gift and she lovered it. It came well packaged and arrived on time right to my door. It came with two bands for two different size wrists and they are east to remove and replace.
 I use it all day all night. Sometimes it doesn't count well the steps, it depends on where are you and how's working your internet connection. I like the shape of fitbit
 Very comfortable
 love it
 I upgraded to the Versa special edition (with NFC chip) from the Charge HR, which I had for 2.5 years (and had been holding it together with superglue...). I'm not a workout freak - I do work out, but I'm mostly interested in heart-rate and sleep monitoring.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Love the detailed sleep monitoring, especially the benchmarks for my gender and age group. I think as a society we flip out about our sleep, and the benchmarks are kind of calming - it's really normal to wake up a lot during the night.<br/><br/>- Like being able to get notifications from my phone.<br/><br/>- Love that I can choose a watch face - especially since the time display you see on promotional photos is dumb - overlapping numbers are NOT helpful.<br/><br/>- Love the interchangeable bands. That was the Achille's heel on my Charge HR.<br/><br/>- Love that there's a lot you can do on the watch itself without having to use and then sync the app (e.g., setting alarms, using the timer, etc.)<br/><br/>- I downloaded a flashlight app for the watch which is GREAT for early morning darkness or digging through a purse or backpack.<br/><br/>- Holds a charge for DAYS.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- The alarm SUCKS. I LOVED the alarm on my Charge HR - there was no way you could sleep through that alarm because the vibration was really strong. Not only is the vibration weak on the Versa, but you can cut off the alarm literally by bumping the watch against your pillow, which is really easy to do before the vibration has actually woken you up. Ask me how I know. I can't count on this alarm, which is a huge drag. Fitbit, you REALLY screwed this up.<br/><br/>- Notifications from my phone are sporadic - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I would prefer being able to count on it, because it's nice to be able to quickly review a text message or email without digging your phone out of your purse, especially if you're waiting for something important.<br/><br/>- This watch is TERRIBLE about detecting naps, which the Charge HR was really good at. It's done it automatically once in the six weeks I've had it; most of the time I have to manually add a nap, which is a PITA, and glitchy.<br/><br/>- In my experience so far, I've found less than half of the merchants who allow NFC payment accept FitbitPay, including (sadly) my grocery store. If they don't display the universal NFC symbol, you're hosed. (And merchants can be really bad about displaying the symbol, or knowing whether they accept all NFC payments.) Hopefully this will improve.<br/><br/>- When you use the NFC function the watch forces you to use a PIN to open it, which is good for protecting you from theft. It's only supposed to require the PIN when the watch has been off, but mine randomly requires the pin throughout the day (and night, so sometimes I have to use my PIN just to see what time it is in the middle of the night). That's a little irritating, but better to err on the side of protecting me against theft, I suppose.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'm glad I got it. I can even deal with the aspects that are glitchy. It's just a bummer when features that were really good on an older model aren't as good anymore on a new model. Backward is the WRONG direction.
 Love this! Not uncomfortable at all (like I found the older versions of fitbits to be). Wears good and is simple to use. Love it so much better than the Apple Watch!
 Looks good, basic functions work ok but it’s been almost a week and the music still will not download.  Some issues getting stats to update on certain watch faces too.  Again, basic functions work just fine.
 In love.
 Love it!!!!!
 This is a nice watch feels comfortable and good look. However you can not hear music ( sounds distorted) have been advised by the Fitbit tech support that it is not compatible with the LG phones. it will have sync issues as well.
 Great product. I wish it had an internal gps then I would be completely satisfied.
 Love this Fitbit.
 Small complaint on transferring music, you have to use a computer and can’t do it off your phone
 Had the fitbit Versa for almost 2 months now.. Owned a lot of regular watches before this one and 2 smart ones, and the day i received this one it seemed like a true winner! i hate bulky large watches, so how thin and light the Versa turned out to be was just amazing.. design-wise its just a 5-star product with no Cons on my book<br/>When it comes to apps and functions, its a pretty complete smart watch too.. you can receive the phone notifications you decide (not reply any like the apple watch) but i really didn't buy it for that specific characteristics.. sleep tracking is quite accurate and kinda cool how it tells you exactly how's your sleeping hours divided.. Calories burned and heart rate seem on point too.. Overall, the Versa could be the perfect fitness smart watch; it truly motivates you to go the extra mile, get those daily steps, floors, calories, active minutes..<br/>But i had to give it 3 stars for one big flaw: it counts steps as you are driving. Excuse me if you disagree, but I think a 200$ smart watch should have the tech needed to distinguish jogging or running from driving (even if you are on the bumpiest road ever).. This flaw adds like 1500 steps a day to my count, and i've tried to solve it using every method suggested by the fitbit team: setting dominant wrist even though its not on the dominant one; downloading the drivebit app that takes off the steps (the app worked the first 3 times, then it just crashes when transferring the data to the fitbit app and won't do anything at all), etc Another small but annoying Con is that its not waterproof, this one can't be fixed but I really do hope they get an update or fix for the extra steps counted while driving.. if the Fitbit team gets this solved, i'll gladly switch my review to a 5-star one
 Love this Fitbit...my third one.  I gave 2 as gifts.
 Light weight and long battery life
 Awesome helpful and fun . Very simple to use too
 Fitbit does not count steps accurately. I called them and they told they had some glitches that they would be updating. So far, nothing from them. I just stopped using it.
 My wife said "this is prettier in person, i love it"
 Perfect! Better than I could have imagined!
 Love everything about this Fitbit!!
 Love my new FitBit Versa Smartwatch! Finally a product that is "waterproof!" And the peach/rose gold color is perfect!!
 I love this... hope it last a long time
 I love that I can set it up my way!  And have an analog clock. Maybe old fashioned but I can better judge time when I see a numbered clock face
 Not as expensive as an Apple Watch.  Wife loves it!  She was previously in a Fitbit charge. Nice upgrade!
 I love
 Only had for some days but I live this smart watch. Stylish, holds music, great tracking.
 Stylish and works great
 I like all the functions it has especially the music. Found it difficult to get music on the Versa though.
 it keeps me walking....i love it
 I was so excited to get my Fitbit Versace but when I got it I couldn’t get it to sync and I had 3 other people try. Nothing. I sent that one back and got another one. That Fitbit worked for about 2-3 weeks then just stop working. Very disappointed.
 Everything I hope it would be. I highly recommend this watch!
 It's the best watch that I ever bought
 I purchased it for my wife she loves it .
 Love the Fitbit versa.  Fits great and love that the battery lasts four days .  I have a small wrist and it fits perfect.  Would highly recommend it
 Complete garbage. Ordered as a birthday gift for my wife and she noticed within a couple hours of having it that it counted steps she had not taken. Charged overnight and woke up with several thousand steps counted while she slept and was not wearing it. Read support forums online to learn that this is a common problem and Fitbit is doing nothing to solve it. Customer support told me and most of the reviewers to reset the device (which doesn't work) or to make sure it's not near a fan or other device that could cause vibration. It's obviously a software problem or a problem with the device itself and not because there is a fan blowing on it or if it is because of a fan it's a terrible product to start with. Tried to press customer support rep on a potential fix, but they continued with the script of "try resetting the watch" or "make sure it's not near a fan" Absolutely ridiculous.
 Ease of use for most function is what I like best. Downloading Pandora takes very long and is what I like least.
 Nice options and easy to read screen
 Loving all the options.  The sleep analysis information is amazing.
 I bought this for my grandaughter. She never takes it off. Very comfortible.
 Sad to see my first fit bit go but happy about my replacement
 Its meh, just kind of old outdated technology. Better off spending more for a better product. I tried to cheap my way out of spending a lot of money on a smart watch and I regret buying this thing.
 Great fitness tracker!
 Battery life is great! The only issue I have had is syncing my text messages but was able to resolve myself
 light and long battery life. few apps to use now but ok for checking daily activity.
 Easy to use, Accurate.  Love It!
 One of the best watches in Fitbit family. Trendy, efficient and light weight.
 Love fitbit.got a scratch on the first day. But other then that I love this product
 Love this Fitbit! Not too bulky and has a long lasting battery. The only problem was that when it had low battery, sometimes it would glitch. I haven’t tested if it’s water proof, but after reading other reviews I probably won’t risk it.
 Really cool
 Lots of features and very configurable to your own personal style of activity.  More free watchfaces would nice. If GPS built in, it will be a 10!
 That it’s a watch and also shows me important facts about myself!!
 Not pleased with product at all returning does not hold charge. Charge battery 100% remove place on wrist wear for 3 hours battery completely dead. Only track steps and heart rate nothing else.
 I've had the Versa a little over a month now  and love it. Very accurate and great battery life. Great job Fitbit!
 If you look forward to syncing your iTunes, I would get a different watch. Absolutely worthless.
 like
 I can not get it to sync with my phone or my laptop.  Very disappointed.  Nowhere do i seem to be able to find help.
 Pretty happy with it beside that as I charged it last time my screen was cracked after. I did not drop it or anything. So pretty upset about that.
 después de dos semanas no funciono.<br/>NO LO COMPREN!!!
 I wear this produce every day. I love all of the data it provides.
 Awesome! I use this much more than I expected I would. I researched smart watches and narrowed my choices down to this and the Apple Watch. I’m very glad I decided on this one!
 I love it!
 Nice product
 Not enough for the price. I love the app more than anything.
 This watch works great. It was brand new in box. I wear it every day. Exactly as advertised.
 I had it for one month and it will not link with my Bluetooth! We have tried everything.
 Like Fitbit keeps everything like it supposed to only thing don’t like is music part you download music try listen to  it’s  got choppy sound to it
 Love it! I had also ordered a set of different watch bands and screen protectors so it looks like I have a new watch on every day! Best thing I didn’t realize is all the steps I take in a day.
 This is an amazing device!! Love it more than my Apple Watch for fitness
 Love this watch! It is everything I want it to be with the exception of sleep monitoring. I wear it all but one night a week and it tracks my sleep maybe 3 nights if I’m lucky. I always love their products!!
 Love it
 Fitbit Versa has been a disaster. Awful customer support. Bluetooth will often not connect with Versa and trying to reset is next to impossible.
 I love that I can swim with it and that it tracks my laps!
 I paid for a Versa and wrapped the box for my daughter’s 10th birthday. When she opened it this morning we were all surprised when the watch inside was NOT A VERSA. Very disappointed.
 My Fitbit journey began with the HR. I am pleased with the functionality of the Versa. The only flaw is the look of the band.
 Size makes clock easy to see.
 I switched from an Apple Watch to a Fitbit &amp; love it!  The battery holds for at least 4 days &amp; doesn't take long to charge.  Very user friendly!
 Doctor said I need to exercise. It’s amazing how easy it is to do in small increments using my Fitbit. Love it!
 Enjoying my new gadget. I’ve owned several Fitbit products/trackers and this one is awesome so far!
 Nice fitbit
 My Fitbit has been wonderful. I love that I can swim laps or teach swim lessons with it on. It does everything I hoped it would.
 Best purchase ever!!
 My first smart watch, I really like it so far. It was delivered as promised and quickly. It is very light and I barely notice I have it on. So far no complaints.
 It works perfectly. Great features. I wore it at a water park and it had no issues. So happy with this purchase.
 Love the look, easy to use
 I was very excited about ordering a Fitbit I got it and the downloading process was a nightmare I may have downloaded four times now and the Fitbit is still not operational and it's my second Fitbit in 4 days it's crazy
 Love it
 Wanted a bigger screen than my Charger2 and it does not disappoint. Still getting used to it and will write more detailed review in the near future.
 It stopped syncing with phone within one week. Performed factory reset and that time it stopped syncing after a day. After second factory reset attempt it will not finish the initial sync to phone. So it is just a paperweight now,
 Muy buen reloj!<br/>Me gusta mucho esta marca
 Screen is easy to read in sunlight which is exactly what I wanted.
 Love. Excellent product. It does have a frew glitches when you are downloading the application. Overall, i am pleased with the product
 Great tool for tracking your progress!
 Many great features and a good step up from the Charge
 Love it
 CHARGER DID NOT WORK
 Love this Fitbit!!!
 Seriously? This watch shut off, came back on, started flashing and vibrating, then completely shut down for good. I'm super disappointed, and it is no longer eligible for return.
 Some of the watch faces there’s a spot for the date but not showing
 this is the second watch we got from the company and in less than 5 hrs the battery is dead. it did not have a chance to wear it. all the time it was updating.
 Better than I expected.  I love all the information that it provides about my fitness. It motivates me to take more steps.
 LOVE my watch! So many customizations available and just overall love it. Wear it every day!
 like that you can change the design of the watch face. They have a ton, not just Fitbit ones. Nice watch.
 Love it, only thing I wish it had is the ability to at least see calls and texts when I am away from my phone and not have to have so close
 I love them versa so much. I use pandora with it for running and don’t have to take my phone anymore which I LOVE! I love how light it feels on my wrist and how I can choose really neat faces for it. I am so glad I got it for myself!
 Good quality product!
 I love my versa. I use it mainly to help me sleep better. Now I miss the reply to text option.
 I have not used this fitbit versa yet.  I am waiting for the glass protector to arrive first.  Just looking at it, its really attractive, it a nice fit.  The face is not to big, which was a big concern for me.
 Doesn't power on
 I love my new fit bit versa it was a gift from my bf and i got the rose gold love it matches my iPhone and headset it's everything i expected thank you...
 I like how it tracks your physical activity and sleep cycles. The only thing is that the notifications from other apps are not constant, it doesn’t show them but maybe 50% of the times.
 The watch does exactly what it's supposed to do. It would be awesome if you could text and answer calls on it.
 I purchased this as a gift for Christmas. It’s February 10th and the screen went completely dark and is unusable. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone
 I absolutely love this watch!! I upgraded from the original fit bit and I couldn’t be more happy!
 In depth health tracker
 It’s looks good and far better than Apple Watch which has most of the features for cheaper price.<br/>It was recommended by my friend and it’s working good.
 Good in the things that it does but does not have everything that I would like.
 Such a cute color! I love it.
 Does everything I need it to do. The App Store isn’t great but I only use it for exercising so it doesn’t bother me. Nice, functional watch
 Love my Fitbit
 Excelente producto
 Works great fits well
 Great for tracking workouts, sleep, weight, etc!
 comfortable,easy to use,battery life for me 2-3 days. like the clock face choices.get a screen protector.
 My Fitbit Versa is light and comfortable.  Really great sleep app.
 Design is beautiful,but price is high for this device. Not easy maintain through app,because of synchronize button on and it  uses battery on my phone so fast.
 This was a gift to my daughter. It stopped working within one week. After Troubleshooting and still not getting it to work we sent it back. As of 10 days we have not been refunded.
 Love it! So much better than the Charge 2 I had.. so many more functions and tracking.
 love this and bought 3 more for family
 Have had the Versa for almost 4 months and it won’t go off the Fitbit logo no matter what I do.  Worst purchase I have made from amazon.  Very disappointed in this item.
 Really like it.
 It has so many different features to it, which is great, but I don’t know how to use them all!!  No directions we’re sent..,
 Needed second one
 The ability to change the fave to picture to make more personal.
 Easy Setup &amp; Use ,  wear , like  charge 2, continusly  comfort , tacking is better, still  evaluating, battery life
 Touch screen isn't very responsive, so sometimes touch to wake isn't fully functional. App store isn't great but fitness and looks are good. The irregular touchscreen is a big quality issue
 The verse is perfect has all the features I needed to help me keep track of my daily steps, sleep, and even my monthly cycle
 I had a fit bit Charge 2 and I enjoyed it, but really wanted to try this one and I enjoy it a lot! So glad I upgraded! no complaints-battery life does go about 4 days, so it's pretty accurate
 I loved my fitbit!! 4 stars because I had to return it because it reset itself constantly!  3 times alone in one half marathon I did!
 My daughter loved the Fitbit versa.
 Love this smartwatch. Great features for a great price!
 I'm very much happy with this fitbit Versa! Everybody should buy this.. There's tons of clock faces customization.. and you can track everything your moves.. 😊😚so what are you waiting for order now!
 Love the sleep tracking, waterproof, music, and Fitbit pay features. This is a great watch for motivation and fitness tracking. Would highly recommend it.
 Love the lower profile on my wrist over previous models. Watch face options are a welcome feature. That it is waterproof so I don’t have to worry about what happens when I jump off my kayak for a swim is great.
 Love the Versa great fitness watch and the sleep info is awesome. Only down can’t get Wi-Fi to connect to my home internet.
 Best Fitbit to date!!
 This device is not compatible with a Moto Z2 Force.. They don't mention that. I tried to get it to work. Calls to non-native English speakers was hopeless.<br/><br/>It took 2 weeks to get this review posted.  I tried to reply to the manufacturer's comments and that wouldn't post at all. There is something fishy going on with these reviews.
 I was so excited to get this but after 2 days I am still unable to get this watch to setup. I have tried resetting my bluetooth, wifi, uninstalling my apps, unpairing the device and still nothing. Waste of time!
 It got burned after 5 months and burned my hand with it
 Works wonderfully
 Pros: Tracks several measurements, allows you to select and change your watch face, ability to set personal goals. Cons: battery like is only 2 days.
 I like the watch gestures including weather and music. However , the band came loose and it was very hard to attach. Also the battery lasts about the same as my Blaze . I charge every 2.5 days.
 Love it!!
 It don’t work and I just got it! Called Fitbit service and they are sending me another one. I just ordered this for my birthday and already calling Fitbit service for help. Hopefully this next one work. Ugggh!!!!
 Having the music without the phone is great
 This was a gift.  It was much appreciated.
 A good fitbit
 Watch was great... until it all of the sudden stopped working and not syncing to my phone. Now that it’s past the 30 day return policy all I have is a Fitbit paperweight. Won’t buy a Fitbit again
 I hardly take it off all day .need charge after three or four days after fully charged and it  take 30-40 mins to fully charged
 I have one of these that works but this one DOES NOT, despite the troubleshooting directions.
 Love it.  Battery lasts for days. No problems with app connection on my phone.
 Got it for my wife. She loves it! The charge time is great last almost a week for her. She loves the sleep tracking capability. Love how much cheaper it is than the Apple Watch.
 Good basic smart watch
 Not only is it comfortable and easy to use, you can go days at a time on a charge.
 It's a good fashion statement and a true asset for my personal health.
 Easy to set up! Great motivation to get out and walk.
 Works great. Feels good on.
 Liked
 Nice size and weight.
 I love my Versa!
 I love it!! I’ve been wanting a smart watch for a while and this has all the features I have been looking for !!
 I have missed my Fitbit One for years and finally decided to replace it. The Versa is perfect, I love the gentle reminders to move.
 I’ve had my Fitbit Versa for just under a week now and I am loving it. I am not that tech saavy and it was really easy to set up and use.
 Will not stay synced to phone
 Love my device. You can download music but takes patience. Would be nice to have access to more music apps.
 Gift for my wife. She loves the features and apps. She only wishes she could respond to texts. It’s very convenient for reading them at work
 If you're looking for a smartwatch to use for swimming, this is the one to get.  Even took it in salt water snorkeling on our cruise.
 Product stopped holding a charge and then quit charging altogether.  I had it for just under 2 months when it stopped working. Sent it back to Fitbit to have it replaced.
 The best
 Great Watch! Love it!! It works so well! No complaints!
 I’m super happy with this watch.
 My main reason for buy this was I felt I wasn’t sleeping well. Now that I see I am I can relax!!!!<br/>I am still working on all the other features.
 I like how it fits on my wrist. Bigger the. The one I had but less bulky.
 Ordered for my wife for her to track calories lost during water exercises. She loves that it’s waterproof and she is satisfied with watch.
 Wanted it for the Fitbit pay and love it! Wouldn't recommend any other Fitbit! Perfect at work for text messages and fast pay without having my cards on me physically.
 ❤️
 The battery is so week .... i have to charge it every day ... battery life is not lasting for 48 hours .... worst watch I used ever ... I highly recommend not to buy this watch ...
 I've had the Versa now for about 2 months and I wanted to wait till I had some time to fully try it out before writing a review.<br/>In general, I like the device.  It was really easy to set up and I love being able to see the time, my steps, calories burned and heart rate on one screen.<br/>Now, for the not so good part.  Six months later, I am still having trouble with syncing.  This is supposed to be fairly automatic and it's not.  At this point, I haven't been able to since for about 10 days and I am fed up with deleting and reloading the app, turning bluetooth on and off, and restarting my restarting my phone, etc.<br/>Overall, Fitbit has an OK product but I wish I had waited till they got the bugs out.
 Love my versa! It keeps me accountable for my fitness and health 24/7. Best purchase I’ve made on amazon.
 Great battery life, lightweight, and simple OS. I'm a fan of the versa after three years with a Charge HR
 Returned and got a replacement due to poor battery life. My second watch had the same thing happen and no longer works! Do not waste your time and money on this poor product.
 At first I was in love with this watch, but after getting the new firmware update to be able to have the quick replies option, I find out I can not use that function. It was my understanding any android phone version 4 or higher would work (with only some of the watches features), well that is not the case! To be able to use QUICK REPLIES your android phone has to be at least a 7...my phone is a 6 with no updates available at this time. Fitbit is shady people!  This watch is very limited to who can use it.<br/>I can not return this watch due to it being pass the return time..I should of bought this after the firmware update was available then I would of known the quick reply feature wouldn't work, and would of had time to return!  I will not recommend Fitbit nor will I buy a product that sells something with updates in the future!
 I really like the purple cloth band, more unique looking.
 My wife absolutely loved this.  She had an original Fit bit  and she liked it but this one is the bomb!
 Better looking. Easier to use. More features. More comfortable band!
 Love my watch but I’ve had trouble occasionally syncing with phone. Each time I’ve had a problem I’ve called Fitbit customer service. They were able to resolve the problem.
 Me encantó, es algo que se hace indispensable en tus entrenamientos
 Excellent
 Love my Versa! I upgraded from a charge 2 and I am very happy with it. Its more like a smart watch than a fitness tracker.
 I loved this Fitbit. I have another and bought this as a Christmas gift for someone else. It was love at first sight. Makes fitness so easy and so much fun
 Never want to try any other fitness watch rather than Fitbit. Buying this after 2 years with Charge 2. Good decision ever if you're a Fitbit fan and are not demanding much of those multi-functions stuff.
 This is by far the best health tracker out there. I new to the fitbit versa community and I highly recommend having one if you already don't!
 I’m in love! It’s amazing. The only thing I could complain about is when I’m in the shower the water sometimes changes the settings but nothing major.
 Its a really nice watch but it was always disconnecting my phone. Not worth the money i spent if i constantly have to restart the watch in order for it to connect.
 The Versa was very easy to set up.  There are many choices for watch faces which makes it feel more personal.  It is also thinner than the Blaze I upgraded from.
 I started wearing Fitbit products in 2014. Started with a charge. Moved on to a charge HR. Then the Blaze. And now the Versa. I have loved all these products. They have continually got better.
 Like this product because I use it to keep track of how many steps I take.
 Great so far!
 I love my Fitbit versa!  It does MORE than I expected
 My husband loves this Fitbit, but after a little over a month it has completely stopped working.  We are very disappointed with it!
 I used the blaze  Fitbit for the past few year till it stopped working as well as it used to. Bought the Versa and really like the shape of it, weight and overall function.
 Love this watch. Does everything. Very easy to set up. Love that it comes with a small and large band
 Inaccurate. Too many bugs that still need to be worked out. Received my first Fitbit Versa and it tracked activity while in charger, the first night was 42,000 steps, while in the charging cradle! Can't reset. Tried deleting app and starting over, this did not work, as well. I called Fitbit tech support, they determined that it was defective, so they sent another. Tech support was very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately, the replacement arrived defective as well, with the same problem, tracking steps when in charging cradle.  I called customer service again, they said that they were sending yet another watch/tracker, they did not want the defective devices back. Three days later I received a watch BAND via FedEx, not a new working product. I can't explain how that happened. Irregardless, I really did not want a third defective product, I just wanted my money back. I have had 4 Fitbit products over the past 5 years and really like the product. I have concluded that the Fitbit Versa has some bugs that need to be worked out. I really regret that this watch was not accurate as it was very nice and loved the fact that I could swim with it.
 I was looking for one that would notify me of my calendar events.  Returned it.
 I love that I can change the face. I bought (very reasonable) faces.
 Returned this item.  I bought this to replace my Fitbit Blaze.  I could not get the wrist band attached.  It was a bad design with a small pin to wiggle into place.  Very disappointing design
 Love it! Does exactly what I want.
 I wish it would allow quick responses on IPhone.
 I really enjoy the watch; however, seems like I'm charging it more than I wear it! My charge 2 had a much longer battery life. Not sure how people can go 4+ days without charging.
 Still waiting on fit bit to update the messaging part of the watch app. Only get notifications that you have a message but cant read it.
 I have had nothing but problems getting it to stay synced or re syncing it .
 A gift for my boyfriend. Now he's on it all the time so I guess he loves it. Tracks his sleep and everything.
 Good product, it is now my everyday use watch
 As advertised although I had to perform a factory reset because it failed to sync with my phone.
 Long battery life<br/>Very good sleep tracker<br/>Easy to set up and use
 Very happy with my new Versa
 1st two days &amp; I luv it. Next week I’ll add my biking.<br/>Haven’t had a chance to add music. Fun
 Bought it for my mom for Christmas. She loves it! She’s not tech savvy and this is easy to use! Totally recommend!
 Like the watch and the possibilities, but the connection with my iPhone is very unreliable.
 Heart rate monitor doesn't work!
 Super light! Forms to my wrist so much better than the blaze did! Overall 10/10
 I bought this watch Feb 3rd and have had to reset it up twice through the while process to get it to stay connected to my phone. Not sure if this is normal or not.
 Big fan of fitbit products. Looks and works well. Easy interface to smart phone.
 Good
 Love the design and the fact it is water resistant
 Awesome
 Great watch, however I would suggest a screen-protector considering I've already scratched mine and the scratches are thick on screen
 I thought it would work itself out, but there are multiple glitches with this new Fitbit. The stair functionality records me walking stairs when I haven't and doesn't when I have. It also improperly records my sleep hours. If I sleep from midnight to 7:00 AM the watch will state I got 6 hours instead of the 7. The activity tracker does not work properly either. I get my activity time every week, but the tracker does not state that I do. I had an Alta before this and only had periodic issues with the activity tracker. This new Fitbit leaves much to be desired.
 It was a gift for my lady
 my daughter is so happy with the watch and all its functions.<br/>not being a tech. person myself, i can only say that she wears it everyday for everything.
 Good fit, looks sharp. Good tracking of basic exercises and step count.
 I love it, it helps me monitor my sleeping patterns, it let's me know how active I am, &amp; encourages me at the same time.
 So far so great! Super easy to sync, band comfy, easy to get others to customize and coordinate with outfits, and of course the functions of the Fitbit are superlative.
 Too small for big men hands
 
 Love my new fitbit. Went from an Alta to the Versa. Love all the features. Not complicated to use. No issues so far.
 It's comfortable, looks nice and wearing it makes me more health conscious.
 Very, very disappointing. It won't sync for days, have to recharge the battery every day. More glitches than I can count and finding more every day.
 Wife loves this.
 Apple watch has a lot more features and works better. For almost same price
 It was kinda hard to get set up and get my messages syncing properly and I wish you could reply to messages other than the 5 preset messages. Works good and very nice looking!
 :)
 do not buy this smartwatch, it only works for 3 months.and it started to work badly, it did not synchronize and it restarted every moment, ask in Fitbit and there is no guarantee😔😡🤬
 laggy, but physically good quality
 Looks and feels amazing, so light on my hand and perfect size for my small wrest, it helped me a great deal with monitoring my healthy life style.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit versa.
 My favorite fitbit so far! I love that its waterproof and has a touchscreen!
 Stopped working after two months. Won't track my heart rate. This company makes defective products and should be banned from Amazon. Had similar issues with a Surge.
 Too difficult to set up.  Needed paid help
 Amazing product, does it all. Smart watch, sleep tracker, exercise tracker, step tracker, bpm tracker. Worth every penny.
 Love the coach app and different clock face options. Got this as an upgrade to the Charge HR.
 Easy to use, only downfall I wish I could link my Spotify. Looks like I can only use Pandora and their Deezer app. I’d anyone knows how I can use my Spotify with this watch I’d greatly appreciate it!
 So many nice features, long lasting battery, many clock faces to choose from, haven’t tested the water proof quality yet!
 Minor functions stopped working 2 weeks in. Now I can no longer track any exercise except steps, via what's on the main watch face. Waste of money.
 Easy to use, i like wearing it, nice and thin.
 Not as accurate as older model. Harder to figure out. Nicer looking
 Good life battery, but very slow working and notifications sometimes are showing. Waterproof is another plus.
 I love it. It had trouble syncing the second day and anytime it completely loses battery, but I removed and re-added the device within the Fitbit app and no more issues!
 F Fitbit customer service. Very unhelpful. Wasted 1 1/2 hrs on the phone with them for them to tell me they can’t help me and won’t replace their defective faulty product. Get an Apple Watch.
 I had my Versa for 4 months and it quit reading my HR. I’ve contacted Fitbit and nothing. And I can’t return it to amazon. It’s not even a year old.
 This Fitbit won't sync.
 It doesn’t track steps walked accurately and there isn’t a way to adjust it. Moving my hands sitting at the computer I’m reaching my step goal?? Smh
 I've never heard of a smartwatch that loses all functionality without location services being constantly on. I can't receive text messages, phone calls, ANYTHING unless I have location services on at least the battery saving setting.<br/><br/>On top of that, even though it shows as a paired device it never shows that I'm connected to it but apparently it is because I receive notifications. Even then, sometimes the notifications will be inconsistent and won't work again until I've toggled just about every setting and had to unpair and then pair the device again.<br/><br/>The mandatory app has wreaked havoc with my battery life even when closed in addition to eating data like crazy.  Support offers basic troubleshooting that most of the time doesn't solve the issues and not much else.<br/><br/>I have an android phone and no one I know with an iPhone has these issues.
 Liked the information available during workouts and having the ability to better your workouts based upon the numbers provided to you through the fitbit and it’s apps
 Loved it at first but 6 months later it wont turn on or charge. Save your money and buy an Apple watch.
 We need mobile to operate.very good battery life.fast recharge.very good accuracy for walking counts.
 Fitness.  I bought this one because of the water resistant feature. Being about to change the clock's face is awesome. So far I love the versa, but ask me again after 2 years.
 Bought this for my 12 year old son, he loves it! Very easy to set up and easy to use! Wish I bought one for me too!
 Really like this Fitbit! My spouse swears that I can read text messages on it but I've yet to get this feature to work (works on his)...that's my only complaint.
 No problems .. came fast
 Love it....
 Love my watch even better than the I watch.<br/>Makes tracking fitness fun
 Absolutely worth the buy. I love it!
 I'm very disappointed...I love the watch. So many options for clock faces, cool apps too! But it is unable to receive text messages from my Android phone. It also gets really confused if you try to use both your phone and iPad to access the watch. I have tried countless troubleshooting procedures both from the web and with a Fitbit agent to no avail. I was told this is a known bug and they are working on it, but no resolution date. Also, it is possible that my car's Bluetooth interferes. Do I really need to choose? Fitbit opened a ticket for me, but said they would not notify me if/when it is addressed. I was told just to keep trying. I will be returning this tracker and going back to my Charge 2.
 It’s so good. It’s like i have my own personal trainer every time and everywhere  !!! Love it and it’s worthy to buy it. It encourages you to watch every thing you do in your day. Highly recommended !
 Love
 The charge of FITBIT VERSA runs out quickly, it lasts a maximum of a day and a half. other than that I would recommend a nice product I like.
 Got this in June. Losing time, won't connect to Bluetooth any more. Tried 2 different phones. Nice while it lasted but for price expected more than 5 months of use. Waste of money
 Works well, syncs with my phone easy and the tracking is good.
 Easy to use. Lacks  GPS
 Love this Fitbit...but I hate changing the bands.
 The smartwstch it's excelente, there was only one issue with one of the bands.<br/><br/>When I opened the box I observed that the extra band was broken.
 Great watch. Love the battery life and the price
 Bought this product for my husband. He enjoyed that the device can play music and that it displayed alerts from his iPhone. He was disappointed by the limited apps that are available and that it didn't integrate with more iOS apps like Map My Fitness and Amazon Music.<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect of the watch is the heart rate monitor. It worked great for two months, but for the last three weeks, it has been way off. We placed his Versa on my wrist next to my charge 2 and the versa heart rate was reporting nearly double what my heart rate actually was. When we contacted Fitbit, they acknowledged the issue, but they haven't fixed it.
 Not as good as Android smartwatch, apps don't help us much ,we need to pay for using most of them
 I loved this watch and everything about it when I first received it.The functionality is fantastic and it looks great. My issues only started yesterday.<br/><br/>While the Versa says that it's water resistant, I STRONGLY disagree with that statement. I just got mine a little wet (splashed and in less than 1 ft of water) while floating on the water yesterday and it stopped working. When charging today (because I assumed it was dead since it wouldn't turn on), it wouldn't even start to charge then it started getting REALLY hot to the touch.<br/><br/>The' water resistant to 50 meters' statement is a joke. Now I have to wait 5-10 days just to ship my watch back before they'll even send me my replacement "options". It's not worth the $200 if you're going to use this anywhere near water. Splurge on the nicer, better quality waterproof options.
 I am only giving it a low review because it is not rose gold, it is straight up pink. Pictures are very misleading. I plan to exchange it for a different color.
 Like the look of the versa. I had difficulties updating the firmware but managed to update after several tries by clearing cache and data and reinstalling the fitbit app.
 This is worse sports watch ever, fist sync issues and not coming on. Came with a 1 month warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE THOS WATCH.
 I love it!!
 Unreliable heart rate monitor, I would not purchase or recommend this product. I use it for workouts and it does not work as well as my previous Polar. Would love to get a refund.
 I love how you can personalize the clock face!
 Worked for a few minutes during setup and then just went dead forever. Was shocked when I looked at the reviews and so many people had the same problem.
 I love it! I love that it tracks everything you want to and that it’s just super handy!
 I like everything about the Versa!!!
 Better than iwatch
 I have been trying unsuccessfully to set up my device. I have tried via Bluetooth and WiFi. I never had any of these issues with set up with my Charge 2.
 Got it for my wife for christmas.  She has small wrists and it fits her well.  She seems to be happy with it
 Perfect for my needs
 I don’t like how it takes a while for the time to come up and show when I turn my wrist... Lexi I’ve had some software problems with the app on my phone
 I love it! Helps me be accountable with calories in and out and my weight loss has been steady.
 Have not had any problems, I’m really happy with my Fitbit. While worth it. 😁
 Nice product!!
 So far, completely satisfied!
 Good
 Product description says you can respond to texts but doesnt mention you can only respond with preset messages or emojis. No option to manually type a reply.
 Bluetooth issues at first but good overall
 I love the the versa
 Fitbit versa does not sync to the IPhone app, which makes the watch almost unusable, or at least not worth the price tag. Look for another brand (garmin, apple) if you want to purchase a tracker.
 I bought this fitbit, and loved it at first.  Now it won't hold a charge and it's only been 4.5 months.  What a waste of $200.00.
 Still cant get it hooked to my phone. I  taking it to Verizon for help.
 I haven’t had it for long, nor do I know all that it does yet but I’m loving it so far. I’ve had it less than a week but it has improved my day to day activities so much.
 The best watch
 100% satisfecho
 I seriously love this device. I'm a firm believer in counting steps and this device doesn't disappoint!
 So far so good. Only had it a week, but I love it!
 The watch stop working . I just got it for Christmas. How do I return it for another one.
 I like that I get notifications from my phone and that I can also get fitness info
 Besides being a great price the associated app is very nice, good graphics, helpful hints and suggestions too.
 Exactly what I wanted.
 Awesome addition to Fitbit! Easy to use and notifications are bigger!
 Love my watch!!! Love that it is waterproof and the charging time is super fast and last for atleast 4 days. I still need to figure out how to do quick texts.
 Very good watch
 It was a great replacement for my charge HR and I’ve had no problems with it. Absolutely love it!
 Not much of an improvement over the blaze
 Best smartwatch in this price range. Great activity and sleep tracking. Growing selection of apps and watch faces.<br/>Fitbit app is excellent for displaying health data and the community aspect is fun.
 Wish you could answer and make calls from the versa. Otherwise it's good.
 Sent it back to amazon because I could not get it to work. Will not order a new one. I did not get credit back to my account when I sent it back either.
 I’ve had just about every flipped it going. For the price, this is the best product yet. It’s lightweight and more accurate. I do prefer the look of the ionic over this versa but I think  versa will be a hit at this price point.  Are use Fitbit pay at both everywhere I go. You will be surprised at how many merchants take it!!!
 I love it!!! Light weight and I finally have a Fitbit I don't have to worry about getting wet!
 The worst experience with customer service.  One week after the replacement date on Amazon my Versa stops working.  I try my charger, then my wife's who also has a Versa.  Still not power.<br/><br/>So I contact customer service and the nightmare begins.  It is like they don't even know their own products.<br/><br/>I am a very tech savvy person and have been back and forth testing, recording videos, decompressing videos so they can watch, and they keep asking for more videos, and still no RMA number.<br/><br/>It is broken and won't turn on.  Seach around, they are having issues customer serive is a nightmare.
 Great
 Prob setting up
 My wife says she loves it.
 Love the versa. I had the charge 2 and it doesnt even compare.
 Came quickly! Perfect Versa! No problems at all! I love my Versa!
 Love the versatility of the Versa and the battery life.  I especially like the custom exercise settings for more accurate information.
 description for Versa says it has NFC chip and that is the only reason i bought it.  I got it and it is not inabled with NFC chip I am pissed.
 Really loved this product. My wife loved this as i gave it as her birthday gift
 Best product ever! I dont Have to charge it until it’s almost 5 days. I love how it tracks my sleep and I can Use it in the water!
 My wife had the ionic and didn't like its size I got her the versa and she loves it our family all has fitbit's and love challenging each other.
 I love the sleek, professional look of this Fitbit,  I'm more conscious of my activities and sleep.
 The functionality of the Versa looks great. But not if you can’t get it to work.<br/><br/>Never connected to WiFi, despite many other items (including prior fitbits) connecting without problem. Ok, WiFi connection isn’t absolutely necessary, although the device required a software upgrade before it would do anything. It will ll take that upgrade over Bluetooth, but it took FOREVER. As in, an afternoon of effort on multiple different phones before I could even get the upgrade process to begin, and then literally 5+ hours to download and install the new software on the Versa.<br/><br/>The upgraded Versa looked like it was functioning, so I tried to change the watch face to something less ghastly than the default. Nope, didn’t want to download the new watch face (seriously, how much data could that possibly bej.<br/><br/>The Versa was intended for my 90 year old mother, who cannot possibly tolerate such flakiness. I will return this item and get her another Alta, which has the huge benefit of actually functioning. (She likes the Alta.)<br/><br/>To the device developers of the world: reliability counts 10x more than functionality.
 I love my fit bit versa
 Awesome! Love how it looks and came quick and all together they were very careful to make sure it didn’t break
 Love Fitbit. Works awesome!
 Okay... at first the watch was super awesome. I love it. But then I wore it ONCE in the bathtub and now it only flickers, turnes on an off and starts apps on its own... and the buttons do not work anymore either. Really crazy. And this watch is supposed to be WATERPROOFED... my A**! So Now I have to return it, and re-order it. Besides the Water part it is Amazing. But I will not wear it again when I come even close in contact with water. Really sad. Especially if I was a regular swimmer this would suck. And on the refund they just knocked off like 20.- that they keep, so much for 2 year garantie. Oh well. It was fun while it lasted. Here to the new watch.
 It was my Christmas gift, works perfectly fine, all the functions are what I was expecting.
 Ok performance  considering price. The “automatic“ display does not reliably light up when you raise your wrist. So, frequently, you have to raise and lower your wrist several times.
 Love!!!!!!!! Love the customizable faces
 Walking and sleeping app I love it
 Great sports watch batter life is amazing.
 love it
 The great smartwatch I use it every day
 Love my versa. I really like this version of Fitbit.
 Edit: 07-21<br/>Shipping back for refund.  Lack of GPS and poor data mgt makes it nearly useless.  I will continue to use map my walk until I find a better app/device combo.  Sorry FB.<br/><br/>Edit: 07-17-18<br/>Had to set up a guest 2.4GHZ network at home to connect this, and once I did, setup went smoothly.<br/><br/>Pros:  great styling smooth functioning touch screen, lot's of face options.  Great battery life, getting 5-6 days, but I don't use GPS too often...yet.<br/><br/>Cons:  Really poor integration between FitBit and Map My Fitness (under Armour) app(s).  Very common workouts are not included, including Elliptical (treadmill doesn't work well as substitute) and water sports like canoeing, kayak, or paddle board.  Very disappointing.<br/><br/>This whole "must have a 2.4GHZ wifi network" to complete setup should embarras FitBit.  Spend $200, it should work out of the box. Will update if I can get this thing rolling
 Love it! Accurate and lightweight!
 I really like the Versa. Fitbit needs to update the firmware to work out some bugs.
 Thought I would not use many features but I am!! Love it
 Love all the features !!! The steps are not accurate...wish they could improve this feature
 Works like a charm, and no problem with sleep tracking. Looks great too!
 Love it. Long battery life and great fitness and step tracking
 Love it, will love it more once the women’s health tracker is available.
 The wife loved her Christmas gift and uses it constantly!  I don’t like it lights up at 3 am but happy wife happy life!
 este es el mejor reloj para hacer ejercicio mide pasos , frecuencia cardiaca etc
 So glad I upgraded!
 Bought it for my father and he loves it !!!!
 Love it! Like sleep data, hands free music so I don't have to carry my phone while running, and much more.  Great Smartwatch alternative for Android folks!
 Not ready for release yet. Several firmware issues (battery life, HR sensor, weather won't update, Nest doesn't work, notifications break, etc) , or maybe hardware is not good enough. Had to return it.
 I love everything about this watch
 I love my new Versa!!!
 It has problems syncing and won't connect to myfitnesspal.
 Definitely a step up from the HR
 I have had all of the Fitbit devices and I like this one the best.
 Nice upgrade from a charge 2.  I haven’t used the music part yet but I do like the workout summary  and being able to have a personal photo as the face.
 Once the Versa was set up worked until needed syncing then would never work again.Called customer service did hard reset still won't sync waste of money and very frustrating
 I’m a loyal Fitbit customer. I pretty much owned every model. This is by far my favorite.
 I absolutely love this watch! I keep track of my steps and heart rate. I love the alarm clock feature.
 Comfortable, easy to use, brilliant display, well designed. Love it
 I like the hands free heart rate monitoring and the pedometer. 10K a day!
 won't keep heart rate. when it does its not accurate. when fitbit sends a new one its refurbished. wish I had gotten an apple watch instead
 Love the fact that I only recharge it every 4-5 days. I dont use all the apps, maybe thats why. The the clock face and its thin size.
 Love it the most
 Broke within a few weeks.
 Its okay. Its taking a bit of getting used to after using the Charge 2.
 Great product so far. Long battery life, sleek design, and great touch scree
 This product's battery life is great. I'm still trying to figure out how to sync my Pandora etc but I'll get there.
 The display is taking some time to get used to and I’m a little skeptical on how accurate the steps are but other than that I love it!
 I love my watch , I had a fitbit Blaze so I'm familiar with the brand. I go to the gym 5 days a week and I keep up with my activities.
 Love it!! Tracking my sleep is my favorite thing! I previously had the charge HR. loving the big screen on this one
 Love it!
 I would like to thanks to the mananger who redirect my problem w my item and  he’s professionalism was  essential to solve that mater
 I enjoy the options I have, and by that I mean the different faces I can use and the multiple things I can track.
 I simply love my watch. Birthday gift to myself.
 not working
 I have only had it for a few days, but so far I am very happy with it.
 Arrived quick, easy to setup and great tracker of daily activities.
 I absolute love my versa, easy to use,
 Perfect! Love it and super fast shipping
 Love it
 I use it for work. It's an awesome watch
 Super comfortable, easy set up and super easy to use.
 Have had the versa for little over 60 days. Watch is already malfunctioning. Screen has occasional lines flickering across it and has frequent trouble sycing with my phone app.  Called customer support they were nice but overall the process of getting problem fixed is time consuming and the ausure protection plan does not start coverage until fitbit's one year manufacture warranty has run out. Liked the watch but now wish I had bought it at bestbuy for hassle free service just don't have the time for taking pictures, describing problems, writing emails and being on hold for next available service person.
 I use it to track my steps
 Love the display.  Easy to use
 It’s everything I was hoping it would be
 This product looks good enough to wear to the gym to work and to play  The  more time that is on your wrist the more information you will get and the more results you can target .
 I love this watch! It meets all of my expectations.
 Love it.
 I love this watch!!
 Very nice
 Decided to upgrade my fitbit so went with the versa, it is a nice product but will not stay synced. Customer support is no help.
 Love it
 I love love love love love love love it
 Not too happy it’s not compatiable with my iPhone and I have to sign up with pandora in order to listen when I already have Spotify
 Wife loves it.
 Love this watch
 Perfecto para mi por todas sus funciones
 The watch works OK the rest is marginal at best. I have reset my account twice trying to get it clock face changed and get to the app store to no avail. I'm about to send Ithe back.
 Does it need to do
 This is a gift and is not open yet until Christmas.  I know is an excellent product.  The shipping was fast.
 Just as described and works great!
 Above and beyond
 I love everything about the Fitbit versa
 I love that I can see the numbers. I did like the band!
 she became addicted to it
 I love how much information it provides! My only dislike is how big it is but the apps and tracking make up for it.
 It didn't sync with my Android phone or windows 10 laptop. Spent a long time with customer service with no success.
 It has kept me motivated.
 Not happy! Verse will not stay charged and the heart rate monitor is not even close to accurate.
 You cannot go wrong!!! If you haven't purchased it yet... Do it right now!!! Inlove!!
 It does not do what was promoted. A lot of the apps don't work and it always disconnects from the phone.
 I love the design but battery did not last 4 days and I’m stuck on the same screen that says Big Weather and a code to use this app that I did not download
 made a good present, very nice
 I love the versa.
 Love that the battery last 4-5 days. Use it mostly for tracking activity
 Battery last just over two days.  Tried turning off auto sync and still have the same battery life.  Contacted customer service and was recommended only using fitbit clock faces which I don't care for them but I'll give it a try.  I wouldn't recommend this fitbit watch unless you don't care about battery life.  When I purchased the watch it said battery lasts 4 plus days which is false advertising. Every other feature for this watch is great, above expectations.  I gave it a 2 star because of the battery issue.  Read online a lot of people are having the same problem as I or worse.
 The best Smartwatch in the market, does what it is intended and does NOT have cluttering OS and Applications you can't use.
 Like this watch a lot, perfect for timing track workouts and steps/calories, Apple users can’t reply to texts yet though
 Dislike I can’t reply to text through the watch because I have a iPhone. Other than that it’s really easy to use and is very light.
 The fitbit versa has all the features that I need
 Love all that it does
 Bought this for my husband.. He loves it
 Love, love , oh did I say love my versa
 Works well. Wish I could text back more than just the set messages with it though.
 Great tracker for someone who’s looking for a hybrid smart watch/tracker for the price u can’t go wrong
 Both the watch and software are excellent
 It is definitely worth buying. It’s amazing to see what exactly I burn, how my heart is working, and how I sleep during the night.
 Love it so far! I've been waiting for Fitbit to come out with a smaller activity tracker/smartwatch and this is it! I tried Ionic a few months ago and sent it back right away because it was too bulky. I have really small wrists and this watch is perfect!
 Doesn't count correctly, my steps are outrageous, and it says I've burned 1400 calories in 1/2 a day when I haven't done much...
 The readings are not updated and there is a lag with the heart rate. I am planning to switch back to Fit bit Charge
 It's been a few days now. I really like how slim it is. Not big and bulky. Very user friendly.
 My daughter loves her Fitbit!
 It has only been a week but I love my Fitbit Versa! It keeps me motivated to keep moving, and even reminds me how many steps I need in an hour. I love that it tracks my sleep as well!
 Incompatible with most Huawei phones. It did not work with my Huawei nova 3e. I would not recommend it at all for Huawei users.
 I pre-ordered a black Fitbit Versa and have had it less that 2 months.  I had a Charge HR that died after approximately 3 good years so I was a Fitbit fan.  My new Black Versa is losing its finish and the silver is showing through. It looks like I've had it for years rather than 2 months.  I called to report this defect and get a replacement and was told this was normal wear and tear and there is no help for me.<br/>  I asked for a manager and he  told  me I could  get free shipping on a new versa  with a 12 month warranty. I asked him why he thought I would want  to spend $200 for a new versa when I had one for less than two months and the warranty isn't helping me with the one I have.<br/>Very disappointed.
 Love
 Works well
 My husband loves it
 It’s okay, I wish I could respond to texts or answer calls.
 Lightweight, excellent heart monitor. I really like the apps associated with it, with several monitoring options, such as exercises, sleep, steps, etc.
 I  love the features on this fitbit, which is why I purchased it.  I had previously been using the Charge 2 and thought this would be a nice upgrade from that.  I love the additional features and the fact that it is more waterproof, not as bulky on my wrist and the band is more stylish.  As for the 4 day battery life, I'm not sure what universe that is working in.  I can get a day out of it at most.  I do not use any extra apps, (I'm almost afraid of what using Pandora would do to it) mostly I'm just counting steps and getting text notifications, and I receive maybe 5 texts per day at the most .  I've tried all of the suggestions I've read about as in turning off this and that, rebooting it, making sure I charge it for two hours etc.  Hasn't helped.  I've even left it at home, fully charged for a day with it just sitting there not doing anything and when I put it on the next morning it was dead.  I guess I'm ok with having to charge it daily....still deciding on that and I may end up returning it.  It just bothers me that they advertise this feature and it's a bit of a fairy tale in my opinion.
 Was great until it just stopped working. The screen went black and then it would not turn on. Not a reliable product.
 She loves it. No problems.
 Went from a blaze to the versa and love it!
 Love it! It’s doing what I need it to..
 Works perfectly
 All same features as iconic minus GPS but I like the slimmer more of a watch design.
 Love it but sadly if you have a iPhone you can’t text back on the watch 😭
 this smartwatch is very precise counting the calories you've burn
 I loved my Fitbit Alta but I was wanting something a little more. This one has all the bells and  whistles. I am still trying to figure some of it out but so far I really like it!
 Set up was easy. Feels great on wrist.
 I love it... And I can use it to order my morning Starbucks
 The Fitbit versa is great, everything you need when working out at your fingertips. The exercise setting help track progress and keep heart rate zones.
 I like the look but do not like that it only lasts about 2days wirh rhe battery and not 4 days luke the advertising says.
 It is well worth the $$$.
 Love everything about it!
 I love it
 Does exactly wat it says it does
 Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Only downfall is for music and such.. you need to pay monthly for on a app..
 Does everything I thought it would!
 I like the sleep tracking, basically all the tracking but have only had it for 4 days but communicating with 3 family members who also have them
 Perfect watch for fitness consciousness.
 Really happy with purchase!
 Easy to use. Big screen, amazing battery life and charges quickly!
 Love it. Very useful and comfortable.
 I love my versa! It is great for my workouts and giving me a nudge when I am idle to long.
 Did not worked the way it was described.
 I wear it all the time, even to sleep. It’s amazing and celebrates the milestones you reach with fireworks.
 Does everything I want and more. I had a Charge 2 and it was great. The Versa is worth the money.
 Cool watch. Lighter than a Charge 2.
 I love this watch!
 Love this!
 Replaced my TomTom running watch! It has overall made me more conscious of making healthy choices and trying to be up and active more throughout the day.
 Just amazing! I got it yesterday and i already love it!!
 Love it fits good easy to keep track of daily activities
 worked perfect
 Great!
 Great product for a great price.
 Cool upgrade from my charge 2
 It's really cool . Has loads of functionalities
 Recibido OK, funcoona adecuadamente, está muy bueno el reloj
 Me encanta, llego Perfecto y funciona muy bien.
 Sister inlaw loves it
 I use it every day.
 Good product
 Bought it for my daughter, she loves the Fitbit!
 Works great and has a long-lasting battery
 Extremely satisfied!! Item as described.
 Doesn't hold a charge for 4 days...1 day only...can't connect Pandora either.
 Just what my father wanted. He loves it. Easy to read and use.
 Love the small form factor, works well, good solid charge lasts about 4-5 days.
 Works excellent
 Screen went black after 5 days never to turn on again.  Sent back
 Love it!
 Works Great. Really trying to get healthy
 Meets my expectations. Looks pretty
 I bought this watch for my wife and she loves it
 Great product. Looks good on the wrist also.
 For the price this does the job.
 Love the look and very easy to use.
 It’s light on your wrist. Doesn’t look to big for a small wrist . Has plenty of watch faces to choose from at no charge . It just take longer to charge than my blaze did
 Love it. Only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it doesn’t have a smart sleep alarm. I want it to wake me up only in light sleep.
 Ez to set up
 Works perfectly for what I intended
 The facewatch apps did not work. Kept having errors so I returned it.
 When it was new, I liked the Versa a lot. It's very light, nearly 5 days battery life, works great as a fitness tracker. But after the first firmware update, I don't even get 24 hr of battery life. It's borderline useless as a fitness tracker when I have it charge it twice a day. If Fitbit can't even bother to test the battery life before they send out firmware updates, you shouldn't spend your money on their products.<br/><br/>Now it won't sync and notifications don't work anymore. I can confirm that Fitbit customer service is worthless. And no word on when or even if a fix is coming in. They trashed the device with a bad firmware update and won't even acknowledge the issues that a lot of people are having.
 Works great -band is pretty.
 Great at everything but counting steps. If you are looking for a counting steps watch go with a Garmin. Other than that it’s great at everything else
 Amazing very good
 Great Fitbit.  Tracks everything for me.
 It’s great!
 I had the Fitbit Alta before but the versa is so much better. I like that it is light weight, has more features, and its easier to use.
 Love my fit bit, bought one for my mom
 Mi mejor compra
 Tracking me steps
 My spouse loves the fitbit versa.
 Still learning how to get the most out of it.
 Love it!
 very nice product , original one , shipping time was very fast
 Nice watch, thank you!
 Takes a long time to set up. App has gotten harder to navigate. More features but I liked my hr charge better.
 Absolutely love my versa. Has really helped step up my fitness goals and seeing emails and calendar on the go.
 This is a replacement watch for one I lost. I have become completely dependent on my versa.
 So easy to use!!
 The BPM just quit working in less than two months not even worth a star but it was my lowest option.
 This is a must buy for anyone in the market for a new smartwatch / fitness tracker. This is a great looking watch
 It is amazing everything I expected and more great product
 Very disappointed with the product. My hand started getting pain that increase over a week all over to my shoulders.
 I like everything about it.
 Waterproof
 A great deal! The best smartwatch for healthy/ sport purposes
 Great all around smart watch
 Good value and easy to use Fitbit..especially helpful with fitness and sleep tracking.
 Love this watch, it does exactly what I need it to.
 It is working properly these 2 days.
 Love the screen and very responsive
 It's sleek, stylish and amazing. Didn't check it completely but tracking is great.
 Great product
 So, I just received it in the mail yesterday (4.16.18) - 4pm EST. I so far have noticed a couple things... First, the bands are a bit tough to remove and since it requires you to remove them for charging it becomes a necessary art to master. Second, the initial set up I believe was thwarted by some strange connection issue between my LG V20 and the Versa. However, I was getting frustrated because I could not set up any new clock faces on my device. After persistence of about 20-30 minutes of trying/fooling around with it the connections seems to be better with my phone. I recommend giving the watch at least 30 minutes even after it says it is done setting up to be sure you have a good connection and all required updating/processes are completed. So far, I am loving it!
 It works wonderfully
 Very satisfied:)
 It has proven its worth. Been very handy to the recipient. Uses it every day.
 The watch works fine but the band and the case seems very fragile
 Gorgeous and so happy with it, sad that I can go swimming in the sea with it, but happy nonetheless
 Love it!!
 Love this Fitbit! Pretty accurate for steps and great for swimming!!
 Muy bueno y fácil de usar
 Very sleek and stylish gadget with a great price. Now my all time companion in gym
 Great! Still thrilled with things I can monitor! Steps is number 1!
 Purchased Fitbit for my granddaughter she lives it
 Great watch Best Fitbit yet! I love the waterproof the music on the watch everything!!!
 I just received the new Fitbit Versa a few days ago, and absolutely love it!!i had no idea all the functions it offered, and for only $200.00!
 Exactly as described.
 A+++++
 I really enjoy my Versa
 Band pin too short and falls off; won't connect to blue tooth; won't set up or be recognized by app
 Track walking
 Love my new watch. Tracks my sleep, exercise, notifies me of text messages &amp; ph calls &amp; many more things.
 I like the clockface but not the wristband<br/>need exppanation of the range of apps thst show up. what is normal or goal?<br/>how to hear voicemail?
 Will not charge unable to get help with Fitbit customer service
 I Have had a Fitbit since they first came out.  Last one was the Alta HR.  THE versa is by far the best!
 Amazing product love it!!!!
 It works really well with my android phone! I really like it and use it alot.
 I am loving the Versa Fitbit. After trying an Apple Watch, I am so happy to be back in the Fitbit world.
 Love it
 The Versa was defective-touch screen unresponsive, could not swipe. I had the versa replaced by Fitbit within two weeks of purchase.
 I absolutely love it!!
 like the step counter
 I love this new Fitbit. I have had many of the previous versions of the Fitbit.
 Great
 Exactly what i ordered.. no issues
 Great watch. Love it.
 I can’t download my music on my Fitbit
 Love it! I'm now more conscious of getting my steps in...Love the text, calls and email notifications!!!
 So far so good! Charged it Sunday and it is now weds- battery is at 46%. It’s comfortable and easy to use
 The exercise program is great!
 Did not accurately track mileage and pace. Difficult to sync Pandora. Big step down from the Surge.
 After about 2 and a half months of owning this device. The battery stopped lasting even a day
 Love it
 No complaints 🙂
 Love my Versa, phone notifications are a big plus!
 The Fitbit Versa is a good entry level fitness smartwatch.  If you want to count steps-great watch; count swim laps-great watch but if your fingers are wet, and why wouldn't they be, when you are finished swimming and tap the screen it doesn't stop timing; ride a bicycle-watchout, Fitbit doesn't tell you that in Bike mode it also adds steps. (I rode 15 miles then ran 2.5mi&gt;Versa said my steps were 11,000! Yikes. 2.5 mi is approx 4000 steps. Rather inaccurate too many bugs.  I kept getting all these rewards and medals etc for mega-steps. Bicycling kept overloading the step count. Way too much inaccuracy.  Sent it back.  PS: you can get GPS tracking, step counting, fitness watches for much less than $200.  If you chose this watch good luck. The face is nicely organized with many choices. The intricacies of operation are not.
 Great Fitbit. Love the swimproof feature. Screen is bright and clear and conveys much more info than my old charge 2
 Love this watch
 The user interface needs a lot of improvement... sleep, heartbeat, and exercise reports are not very good.
 Love my Fitbit. I don't leave home without it!
 Easily swapped out the silicon bands with leather ones. Product works as expected. My wife loves it.
 It is pretty great except for lacking diversity of apps and wished the battery life lasted longer
 It was a birthday present from my wife, it was a perfect pick I use it everyday.
 Love the watch but would like more options for the band.
 Helping me a lot to stay more active e to take care of my health!
 The heart rate sensor stopped working 2 days after I got it. No workable solutions available. Product is not ready for the market yet.
 Love it but still learning how to sync my iPhone music, hopefully I will get it synced
 The watch stopped tracking my steps, i can only see my steps on my phone and the fitbit app.
 Love it!
 Like the new sleep pattern accuracy, battery life, automatic activity recognition, receipt of text on watch and waterproof
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa!
 I have chemical burn from the band
 No issues- perfect
 Great to track my steps
 Needed an upgrade and this one is great.
 I love the easiness to use and how the screen is large. The only thing I don’t like is the battery isn’t displayed on screen. Only on the app in phone.
 Vino sellado y nuevo, lo recomiendo!
 Christmas present
 Excellent Fitbit
 Bought this for my wife to replace an old Garmin that was not "smart"
 The price and features for only $90.
 I really like it.. only complaint is iPhone users can’t send a text.. only android users
 The watch is so so ,long life of battery........But.....It's just a glass surface,very very very easy to scratched ,not recommend
 My preteen used giftcards from her birthday to purchase this watch and she LOVES it
 Love love love this watch!!! I love to easiness to use and the different apps within!
 It tells me so much information!
 Disappointed because I thought it would be able to answering texts like I was told
 The Fitbit tracker was not present in the box. No contents found in the box received.. very disappointing.
 Beautiful looks and works great, perfect gift for mothers!
 My mom is very satisfied about it!
 Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't sync correctly. Wish I would of just kept my blaze.
 Watch face options many, some still in beta, love it, keep testing.
 It performs exactly as advertised. I swin with it. I enjoy this product.
 I loved everything about my versa
 Returned it b
 I love this watch!!! Use it every day for so many things.
 Perfect
 So far so good !
 Can’t hold a pair w my phone app.  Too much $ to just track steps
 It’s awesome. Love the capabilities of it. I think Fitbit needs to expand the amount of apps but other than that it’s great.
 Great for keeping track of steps, or checking the time; absolute garbage for monitoring heart rate or tracking exercise.<br/><br/>I used a fitbit charge 2 for over year, and was really looking forward to upgrading to the versa. The changeable faces, and new features made this the perfect choice for someone who didn't want to pick a smartwatch based on the type of smartphone I had. After a week I am returning it due to the heart rate monitor being completely inaccurate. When sitting at home it would bounce between 58 and 78 in seconds, when driving I would get random spikes to 130, and on runs it would show a rate of 192 as soon as I hit the trail. Twice when working out at the gym, I manually set an exercise timer only to look down and see that the device was restarting and there was no track of my current workout. Just do a quick search online, and you'll see that this problem is widespread. Wait for Versa 2.0, or spend your money on something with better quality control.
 Love it!
 it’s great!
 Love it!!!
 It came quickly. It was package nice and easy to set up.
 Love it
 Great, my daughter loves hers.
 Screen is super fragile. Definitely not made of gorrila glass. No repair options.
 Absolutely love it!
 Great watch! No issues and quick delivery.
 Felt ok for price
 Love it. Just wish it could answer and speak on device.
 I’m a Fitbit person, but this was NOT for me.  I had to contact Fitbit 2 times to try to get this fitness tracker to sync to iPhone.  After a week, I gave up.  I could not get messages, I could not see missed called.  I sent it back for a full refund. Thank you, Amazon for the easy return.<br/><br/>I have been using my old Fitbit One, in conjunction with my new Apple Watch series 1 to see how steps compare per device.  So far so good.<br/><br/>What I did like about it, it keeps a charge way longer than current watch/device.
 I love my Fitbit
 Fits the screen perfectly. My wife loves it.
 Bought this watch as a gift for my mom. She loves it. The lavender band looks great.
 Counts steps well. Get all notifications from phone. Very happy with the watch so far.
 Absolutely worthless; quality is terrible inside and out.  Save your money.
 Delivery outstanding- Vera is an expensive watch. My cheap Fitbit worked better. Can’t get it to sync and Fitbit.app is useless
 It would be better if you could tap it and it would wake up and show the screen
 A little hard to get set uo
 I love all the data that this watch gives you. I also love how lightweight it is and the fact that it has changeable bands!
 Purchases for a gift. She loves it!
 screen went out and it made my entire wrist red twice.Looked burned!!
 Quit working after 2 months but Fitbit did send a replacement. Overall good. Make sure to purchase a screen protector with it.
 Great product
 I love it. Easy to use lots of features and costs a lot less than an Apple Watch.
 Perfect gift .. will be used everyday.
 Great product - battery life is incredible at 4 days, easy to use, and well made.
 This device died when I went swimming with it. I've had it less than 2 months, but it's too late to return it.  I had several issues prior:  on several occasions, it accumulated steps overnight (thousands) while it was on a charger.  I tried different charging locations not near a vibrating object and it still happened on occasion.  It wasn't syncing to my I-phone the week that it died.  I had to shut all devices down and restart to get it syncing again.  I didn't care for it's large size, the band has to be worn pretty tight to keep the face from twisting around your wrist and facing the wrong way.  I like that it records heartbeat, but it doesn't factor it into the calorie burn.  (The steps on flat roads are equal to the steps burned walking hills).  I've gone back to the Alta, I'm sorry we wasted money on this product.<br/><br/>Update:  I went on a live chat with Fitbit support (contact.fitbit.com)  and followed the instructions for cleaning my contacts for charging with alcohol and a toothbrush.  It's now charging!  The person helping me also gave me tips on syncing and charging without accumulating steps... we'll see how it goes.  If the Versa does well for a decent amount of  time, I will change my rating to a better one... it's better than the 1 star I gave  after the original review!
 Love it!  I go in the water with it every day. I love their tech support.
 OS was incredibly buggy and lacking all around. Tracking was ineffective as it would register steps when standing still. All-around awkward to wear - it would dig into my wrists whenever I did any floorwork yoga. The SE version was definitely not worth the extra money since my bank wasn’t even supported, and the lavender band got dirty and dingy within a week of wear. The last straw was the rash it gave me, even after removing during sleep (which rendered sleep tracking useless as well). Cleaning it regularly and wearing it looser didn’t help either. Returned.
 This was a Christmas gift and it was a great purchase!!!!!
 Too bulky for me..
 Excellent
 Absolutely life changing!
 My everyday watch!!
 I've had a Gear and an Apple watch. This one does the very same things for less money and holds a charge for several days.
 Wife loves it
 Long battery life, accurate heartrate reads, and makes me more active!
 Works great, as does the app. Has accidentally been smacked off a couple of doorframes, and is 100% intact - perfect for me!
 Sleep tracking and heart rate were terribly inaccurate. There is a huge forum related to these issues in the Fitbit Versa Community, and yet Fitbit has decided to blame the consumer as opposed to addressing the issue. I understand that not all of the devices are defective, but there seem to be more defective units then there should be. I would recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 3 instead.
 Great product.  Daughter really enjoyed receiving this for a Christmas gift.  Thank you.
 I love my Fitbit. So easy to use. Looks good too.
 Awesome product
 Arrived quickly. Easy to set up &amp; use. A great motivational tool!
 Heart rate monitor doesn’t work consistently for people with wrist tattoos per Fitbit support.
 Christmas gift
 Bought it for my mother. Great Christmas gift!
 Love it 😍
 works well. Little difficult to change bands<br/><br/>Best fitbit I have owned so far.  Looks attractive and sylish
 I had an original Fitbit that was starting to show its age. Because it was not counting each step and I wanted a more accurate caloric burn with my heart rate, I decided to upgrade. However the price difference between the Fitbit Alta and the Fitbit versa made it a no-brainer. So far, I have really enjoyed all of the features that I have used and customized. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it being my first time using a smartwatch I may be missing some valuable information. But from my limited perspective, it seems to be a great product.
 Nice just doesn’t charge long 4+ like it says
 Can’t sent return text on iso like androids but love it
 I love my Versa!!<br/>It’s so versatile!! And durable.<br/>Thanks, FitBit!!
 Cool, works great
 
 Set up was a little challenging as I couldn’t get it to connect to our WiFi but after I wa able to update it, it’s great!
 The watch irritated my skin. I'm sending it back.
 Love it!
 monitor my day
 Love this item!
 Love it!  Thanks for such a great deal!
 Great watch/fitness tracker! I upgraded from the original flex.
 Christmas gift
 It is always shutting off even if fully charged...
 I loved it, not too big,
 works great and helps me keep track of everything even my sleep love it
 It’s cool
 It has a nice design and several apps but the poor connectivity and very limited compatible phones make it unusable.
 It's easy to setup &amp; easy to use
 My screen already shattered god knows how. Wish it wasn’t so fragile
 I like how it can do what the apple watch does while being more affordable.
 The 4 day battery life is great and it is worth the money.
 It does everything I need it to and so many new things I need to learn about my new Fit bit!
 Did not like, does not sync, do not recommend
 Works well for the price. Very light weight. I have not tried it in the water.
 I love that the watch will still read heart rate when sweating.
 Love the Fitbit
 Love it!
 Perfect
 love it
 Hr monitor stopped working 5 months into moderate wear
 Excellent and accurate
 Love it!!
 Great device
 I don't like the fact that you can't use after market bands on it.
 Simple Awesome.
 Step counting is not so accurate, even regular motion of the hand is getting recorded as step
 Excellent
 Great fit not to big and flat to the wrist.
 Keep steps. LOVE it
 Stopped working after 3 months...manufacturer sending a new one or offered 50% refund
 I like my Versa but online setup and use is difficult and not clear.  Once downloaded no instructions for use
 Its design is absolutely sleek.  Love all the apps you can use with it.  Great battery life.
 I was not sure if this would be worth the price but it is. I'm very happy with my purchase.
 So far, works perfectly. The IQShield sucks though.
 Very satisfied with the product.<br/>Good Battery life.
 Upgraded from  Alta HR<br/>Still learning how to use. First impressions are I'm going to like it
 Great watch
 Great
 I am not getting heart rate monitor to work past day one. I like some of the other features like deep breathing.
 To hard to figure out will need to try again
 Works great. I had a blaze previously so going with another Fitbit was a no- brainer!
 Love it for swimming. Prompts me to swim longer and faster.
 I absolutely love my fitbit. This is my  first one. I am hooked.
 Love this Fitbit!
 The item was exactly what I wanted and ordered
 Good choice, recommend !
 Amazing!
 So far so good. I love it. Still learning new things with it. Still need to go swimming to see how it works.
 Much smaller the tsurge I had and had more features
 Gift to my husband
 Stopped working correctly after about 4 months.
 Love it!!!
 Lots of fitness functions. I like the sleep analysis.
 Easy to set up, great value, I’ve had 3 versions of the Fitbit and this is the best version yet!
 Great product
 My wife loves her new watch and uses all healthy perks come with it.
 Wonderful for keeping me active and aware of my health. Great motivator for busy moms😎
 Like the looks and styling. This is my third Fitbit and each new model gets better.
 To monitor my exercise, calories, and weight loss
 Love it works get
 love the versa! nice design and function. only thing is wish it supported the spotify app for music.
 Screen design and material make it very susceptible to breaking
 It’s now an everyday use kinda tool
 My husband loves it!
 Love it
 Love it! My new fav fitbit!
 Very good
 Great watch!! My wife loves it!!
 after about two weeks it would fade every time I turned it on.
 Light weight, sporty, easy to use. Like it alot!!!

 Girlfriend liked it so much had to get 1 for mom.
 Didint last 5 months and screen went out
 
 Really nice watch to track your day by day activity.

 I love this Watch!! It does everything I need
 Like it but want to see the time all the time
 I really like its sleek design. It does what it purports to do.
 so many to updated 12 hrs
 Must need an android Returned.
 Love it !!!
 Been using it since Wednesday. Battery at 59% still.
 All I think about the product !!! excellent
 I love the fitness support it offers. I dislike the challenges with the notifications shutting off.
 Battery life is not long,  n ..its not to accurate
 Battery was deffective
 Got it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!
 I love mine!
 The band sucks.
 Got it for a program at work, well worth the money
 Love it! Great for work and working out!
 Great product and I got it at amazing low price of $95.
 Very very disappointed..
 Love this!  Works great
 Love so far. Wish I could get iheart radio as I dont like Pandora.
 Very easy to use and has all the bells and whistles.
 Love it , so far so good.
 I love the long battery life compared to the Blaze
 Greta product, and love the battery life compared to Apple Watch!!
 Awesome product. Wife absolutely loves it!
 Great watch! I need it for notifications and fitness tracking. This does both well!
 Fast shipping and my son loved the watch!
 I love it and it is so pretty.
 I love this watch. It does everything I expected and more.
 I have an Apple watch, a Samsung S2 and this.  The watch is very well made, comfortable and the great battery life is a huge plus.  However, this device is completely unreliable as a fitness tracker.  I wake up some mornings and thousands of steps have already been recorded.  One lazy morning I get an alert that I've done over 10k steps which was not possible.  Hope this can be fixed in a firmware update, but for now I would not purchase this watch if fitness tracking is important to you.
 👍
 This product has a very sleek look and I love it to use as my every day watch.
 Yes
 Problem fixed.
 I love it
 Love it! Everything I wanted
 The wife loves it.
 Husband loves
 This watch is awesome! The battery life is great and the stats are cool too.
 Nothing to dislike everything is perfect - easy to set up
 Piece of junk!  I got this to monitor my pulse!  It is at times giving exteme readings - when it does this I check with BP cuff and pulse oximeter to verify.  When it happens both of those devices give about half what the FITBIT does.  Had it checked at doctor's office yesterday.  Same thing.  It just randomly goes crazy and makes up it's own readings.  I have tried moving it all over the place to see and it just about doubles the correct reading at times.  USELESS DEVICE.
 Garbage. Device worked for 5 minutes then quit. Returned.
 Love it!!
 Great gift
 This watch is perfect! No complaints!
 Easy to use
 Excellent
 I have loved the versa since the moment i took it out of the box.
 I love my Fitbit Versa!!
 Love the battery life
 It doesn’t fit the Fitbit watch and not sure why it doesn’t
 ❤️
 I love it!
 Nice very happy
 Works as advertised, light weight.
 Works very well with my Samsung phone.
 Love it!
 Good for price
 Works awesome. Wish the heart monitor was a accurate
 Battery lasts one business week.
 Everything is wounderful!
 Awesome
 Glad I made this purchase
 App doesn't connect to the phone reliably and watch face won't come on easily enough.
 I love this watch! Works perfect!
 I like the fit and functionality.
 Nothing like Apple Watch don’t waste your money.
 This watch will not download to my Samsung Note 8 phone
 Have no complaints. It's a great watch!
 
 I like that the Versa looks more like a watch than my previous Fitbit.
 Daughter is in heaven with this watch!
 I love the fitbit versa! I can swim w it and no problem
 Absolutely live everything about FitBit
 Great product
 Love love love this!!!
 I just wish I had the option to reply to text
 Band has nickel in it and my wife is allergic.
 So far so good. Need more time to try it out.
 Love the watch and new Fitbit technology, however band changing is a huge problem.
 I bought this for my wife and she just loves it!!  Looks great on her!!!
 Great  investment.  Much improved technology and very user friendly!
 I'm so upset and dissapointed with this. My alta never had any issues meanwhile the Versa took about 6 hours to set up, had a defective screen that wouldn't show color and was no responding to touches at all and just flashing between different screens. I spent about 4-5 hours with fitbit trying to remedy the issue which did not help so I am returning to amazon for a replacement. Will update this review with how things go on the replacement.
 Bought my daughter and myself one and we LOVE them.
 I live it!!! And I use it for exercise.
 I have had the watch for less than a week and I love it!
 Love it
 Love this an especially the sleep tracker!
 Far better than the blaze.
 Always calculating False Step Count!  Cant be fixed :(
 Great!
 I really use the sleep tracking
 Battery does not last long just 2 days
 I like it now  it  working
 Was worried about it being too big for my wrist but it’s not at all!
 The watch looks great on the wrist, and serves it's purpose very well.
 User friendly and great design
 Very convenient
 Works great except it doesn’t stay linked to my phone so I don’t get any notifications!
 I just wish there was some kind of voice to text option!
 Love the style, features, and user friendly interface! It’s my favorite Fitbit so far!
 Have Sync Issues
 Good support for exercise; multiple watch faces; applications available
 Why you broke and still buying this
 This veras dose not receive or clear messages
 I love my Fitbit
 Perfect for everything.
 Works great
 Like the options
 Wife loves it
 Tracker looks good, and is mostly comfortable.  That's the positives.  Everything else is the pits.  The battery life has gone from 5ish days to 3ish days in less than 2 months.  The heart rate tracking is wildly inaccurate.  The auto workout tracking is pitiful at best.  Sitting at my desk at work, my heart rate will measure anywhere between 70 &amp; 110 BPM, just typing.  When I do a workout, the auto tracking starts 15-20 mins after my workout and stops about 20 mins before it ends.  So my hour kickboxing class registers as 30-35 mins.  FitBit support has been less than helpful, asking me to drain and recharge the battery numerous times before determining there is a problem.  They also have acknowledged that there is a known issue with the accuracy of the HR sensor: "I've been reviewing the system and noticed this issue that your Versa is experiencing with the heart rate showing high at certain point during the day is and ongoing situation that is under investigation.  We have opened an ongoing investigation and would like to know, if I can add your case to this with the correspondent ticket?"<br/><br/>Seriously!?!?  I expected more from a $200 tracker.  I should have just bought an iWatch.
 Sleek and comfortable
 Perfect! Lasts for a long time, waterproof, and easy to set up.
 I have not had enough time time to give an accurate review.
 This was a gift for my daughter. She thinks it's fantastic!
 THE WATCH BAND ITS HARD, NOT GOOD
 Instructions not very good
 Keeps adding extra steps, nearly every time I put it on the charger.
 Everything you want in a Fitbit/smartwatch
 My workout is much more easier with this device
 Very inaccurate.
 Junk. I’d like a full refund.
 Steps and work outs for my weight watchers app.
 Nice graphics, low profile, light in weight
 My wife loves it. Thanks
 Arrived as promised!
 Too complicated - do not feel or hear alarm to get my 250 steps in
 Item defective/doesnt work
 It's very convenient to use
 I love it 👍🏼😉

 Es un dispositivo cómodo, facil de usar y muy práctico
 So far so good! Fits great and love the notificayions
 Love my versa!!
 Has all of the features I want in a “fitness” watch without the cost of an iWatch.
 Love it!
 I love everything about this beautiful
 Excellent fit!!!!
 First off, I love the way the watch looks and feels. Unfortunately that's about it. Since day one I've had issues with having to keep setting up my WiFi connection. Then, after my return window closed and the firmware update, it began to reset itself continuously. It will easily reset itself 10+ times a day. It becomes annoying when it resets itself back to back. Looks like I'll be going back to my Alta and using this as an expensive paperweight.<br/><br/>Update: Since the initial issue, I have now had problems with syncing. After days of not syncing I unpaired and it would no longer pair with my Galaxy 8. Eventually FitBit support had me do a factory reset, losing all un-synced data. After the factory reset, the HR stopped tracking so now I get the basic sleep patterns instead of the advanced ones. A few days later, it stopped syncing again. I have not used it since. I suggest you do not buy until they fix the firmware issues.
 Me encanto
 Love my versa, gives so much more info than all of the other fitbits I had
 Love this, it has everything I want under one design
 Love this Fibit
 Love the watch!
 Love this Fitbit for everyday life :)
 Me agradó todo
 Beware before you buy--massive Bluetooth issues with Android phones, Apple phones, and Windows. Can't sync.<br/><br/>I purchased my Fitbit Versa and over the past two days it has since stopped syncing. Upon trying to troubleshoot the issue I stumbled across pages upon pages on Fitbit's own website of owners complaining of the exact same issue--no solution seems to be in sight. If you go off the Amazon 4/5 stars you'll be fooled just like me. Don't! Look up Fitbit's website and see the massive issues for yourself.<br/><br/>This product does not work--I cannot sync it with ANY of my devices, and it cannot install new apps, either. Beware! $200 wasted!<br/><br/>Update 7/9: after all morning working on it the Fitbit finally synced. Still, all apps are extremely buggy and the Bluetooth is spotty at best. I've adjusted my review to reflect this, but I still have higher expectations spending $200 on a smart watch from a reputable Silicon Valley company like Fitbit.<br/><br/>Another update 7/11: Bluetooth and syncing issues continue to plague the device. Of the 5 days I've owned the device it has only auto synced once. 1/5, or 20%, is failing last time I checked. I've purchased a Fitbit bluetooth adapter, and I will update the review once it arrives. Hopefully, their own hardware can solve the problem.
 Awesome watch
 It is perfect for reading texts!
 I love the fact that I can go swimming with it. So far so good!

 Product is good
 Trouble with some of the features
 I switched to the FitBit Versa from a Pebble Time Round. I like alot about the versa, but.....it dosen't have some basic features. 2 such features are music controls for Spotify. I use this all the time when listening to Spotify on my phone while connected to bluetooth speakers / headphones.<br/>2nd is phone locator. Press a button on your watch and locates your lost phone. I use if often enough. Pretty ridiculous that fitbit choose to leave these features out. These are pretty basic and have them on most cheap smartwatches. For 200 bucks they should have these features. I returned the watch and continue to look for something better.

 Nice watch
 This is my 4th Fitbit product.  Purchased this one so I could use in pool for water aerobics.  This Versa “will not” stay synced with my iPhone so I can use the Fitbit app.  Please read all the comments online about this product before purchasing.  Fitbit doesn’t seem to acknowledge a problem even though Android users are experiencing the same problem.  I have always loved Fitbit products but I am very disappointed in the Versa.
 Parfait
 The sleep component is great
 Best Fitbit out there
 Motivates me to walk more
 Love my versa
 Best purchase ever.
 Love it
 ❤️❤️❤️
 Love it!
 Purchased back in April, 2018 and worked great. Starting around July the Versa began to drop connection to my phone's GPS during exercise. This appears to be the same issue that has been reported by other users. I've since had to switch back to other apps on my phone for GPS tracking. Step counting, Heart Rate and other functions appear to be fine. Difficult to recommend the Versa due to lose of one of its key features not working.
 Love it!
 Love it!!!
 AmaZing watch!
 Great
 Color screen, more efficient watch
 Sucks
 Great watch! Love it!
 😍
 I must say....I'm really disappointed with the Versa. It was working well, but I began noticing that the battery was draining quickly and now I am having a constant issue with syncing. I've had to remove and add my Versa in the app 5 times today alone! It's so frustrating! I am super regretting this purchase.<br/><br/>5/10/18 update - had another syncing issue and now the battery seems to drain so fast. I did not wear it Wed evening because I let it charge all night to 100% - 2 days later, the battery is already halfway through. This seems very short. How frustrating!!
 Still has not shown sleep stages
 Will never sync.
 Love it...it’s addictive
 I can't set it up
 Excellent in every way.
 Nice
 Love mine!
 Good maintenance

 I like the Versa but I can''t give it a 5.  It only supports Pandora and Deezer music apps.  I wish I would have known this before purchase.
 Amazing watch
 Light and great
 Daily activity
 I am in absolute love with it
 I loved it
 Best investment ever
 This device constantly logs steps not taken and floors not climbed. For example, it logged several thousand steps and multiple floors while driving. I’ve restarted and power cycled the device. A little research shows multiple Versa owners experiencing the same problem for months prior to my purchase and still no solution. I do not recommend this product.
 Love love love my new Versa!
 I loved this watch so much until yesterday. It completely stopped working. It won't connect anymore. Still waiting for Fitbit to call me and explain what happen and how to fix it.
 Good
 Good product
 arrived in good order.
 Fits well
 Ok fitness tracker.  GPS ALWAYS shorted my miles.  Had it for a little over a month before the screen cracked. I called customer service thinkint surely something can be done since it's only a month old... Nope.  Not covered by warranty.  1 month if use is definitely not worth the 200.00 it cost, and the customer service was far from what I expected
 I received the Versa and it worked as expected right out of the box, although I noticed it did not track my sleep as well as the Charge 2.  One day the battery died during a workout.  No big deal... I’ll just plug it in when I get home.  When I got home I put the Versa on the charger and went about my business.  When I came back to get it I noticed it was very hot.  I pulled it off the charger and it was dead, would not turn on.<br/><br/>So I call Fitbit support and the instructed me to reset it... but still nothing.  So they ask me to email them a video of it not turning on.  Weird... but okay no bigge... done.  Next day I receive confirmation that they received the video, and now they want me to ship my Fitbit back to their warehouse for the warrenty replacement.  Fitbit says they will send a replacement 5 days after the receipt of the broken unit.  Now I am waiting.<br/><br/>What a pain in the butt.  I use my Fitbit to track exercise and sync it to MyFitnessPal.  I also join regular challenges.  I miss it and this process is taking too long 😡.<br/><br/>The 2 stars is for the Fitbit Versa lasting 45 days from the date of purchase and then breaking.  I will update when I get my replacement... maybe I will feel better.  This disappoints me... I love my Fitbit.
 
 Love my watch
 Fitbit Versa is a great watch. The problem is that screen is very delicate and it can crack/ shatter easily as oppose to what FItbit support/ customer service tell you. Fitbit does not offer any screen replacement and their solution is to lose your money and buy another fitbit. If you still want this watch please buy a screen protector still there is not warranty that screen will not crack as it also can crack with  with temperature changes.  Fitbit has also reworked their warranties and policies as to cover only malfunctions but not screen damage. Practically your screen has to be damaged in transit /under USP/UPS, etc so it can be replaced. Very disappointing that I had only used this watch for 3 months, and screen cracked at a minimal impact.
 Awesome!
 I upgraded to this from the Charge 2 and really WANT to wear/like it... but the band does not stay connected to the device. The clasp/band setup is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only is it challenging to get on in the first place (and for someone that likes to swap out bands, that's unfortunate), but it doesn't stay connected. Twice I've been walking down the street, only to have the band disconnect from the watch face and it fall to the pavement (thankfully no scratches YET).<br/><br/>I'm giving it 2 stars because the watch was comfortable and functional... when it stayed together. I ordered new straps to see if it makes a difference, but have seen many videos online of people struggling to get the straps on. I don't usually post negative reviews on Amazon, but feel people should be aware ahead of time.
 I purchased the fitbit versa for my wife in May.  The bands were supposed to be easily interchangeable and were not.  The pin on one side of the watch was difficult to engage and although I thought it had been done so successfully in short order it became dislodged and fell from her arm.  It hit the pavement and cracked the crystal on the face of the watch I contacted fitbit and was informed that they do not have any repair centers and could not offer any help in the repair process. So I would caution anyone preparing to spend $199 for the watch to beware.  If it becomes damaged they can't/ won't fix it.
 I have had several FitBits, so I had high hopes for the Versa. I received it the first day it was available in April 2018. The battery died in July. The replacement one charged ok until I went for a swim after having it 2 days (it is advertised as water resistant) and now it is dead! Very poor quality control for such an expensive item!<br/><br/>** Update - spoke to customer service, again. This time they want me to ship the old device back to them before they will send a replacement. They absolutely will not extend the warranty out for the time I have been without a working Versa (which is now adding up). Look on the forums - the Versa has a history of failure after swimming (and also for battery failure), even though they advertise it as such. I strongly suggest everyone look for alternatives - their customer service is very poor!
 If you are an iPhone owner, this watch is not for you. Nothing but a expensive activity tracker. Could have bought something cheaper that does the same things his watch does. I returned it after a couple of days. Very disappointed!
 I suppose I should have read reviews more carefully.  Using Android the GPS connection is exceedingly poor.  Disconnects from the phone constantly throughout the ride and so the data is useless.  The general smartwatch functions are reasonably good, as I would expect from its Pebble heritage, but the poor gps function is a dealbreaker for me.  I have to go back to recording my rides on my phone directly leading to the question, why watch?
 Id Only Recommend Getting This If You Have An Android Since The Apple Watch Is Much Better. The Versa Tracks Heartbeat And Sleep Patterns, Has Stopwatch Feature, Alarm And Notifications, And Pretty Much Everything The Apple Watch Has. Only Problem Is That You Can't Pull Up Music On It From Your Phone Unless You're Playing It From Pandora I Hope This Gets Fixed With A Software Update Though. I've Also Had Problems With Syncing And Had To Contact Costumer Support To Fix It. The GPS Feature Only Works If You Have Your Phone Nearby So Sadly No Distance Tracking Without Your Phone. All In All Solid Smart Watch
 I like this watch..  Why one Star then......  Well about two weeks ago my watch stopped calculating my sleep. It was working great before for two months and now it won't even document one minute of sleep. I tried resetting it, getting new firmware, and reformatting it.  I cannot get this to work and I don't know what else to do. I wear the watch higher\lower, tighter\looser. I even put the watch on my dominant wrist and nothing will get it to calculate my rest anymore. If somebody can fix my issue or replace my watch to get the sleep calculating again, I'll change my review to 5 stars to represent good customer service<br/><br/>Aside from my issue.... This watch it great. The watch is a perfect size for me.  This watch works great under water and the screen is amazing. I wear this all the time at work where I touch a lot of computers. And Sharp edges I have rubbed the glass on many items on accident and the watch is still in great shape<br/><br/>Please fix my issue 😃
 Love the watch. Fit bit customer service is awful. Watch display went blank 33 days after I received it. It's was 9 days of calling before I had to send a video of me trying to do a company restart. Now the emails indicate it will be another 2 weeks.
 I purchased this for my wife. From the start we had trouble with this smartwatch. It appears Fitbit pushed this to production too soon, and expected the general public to be the test base as they worked out the bugs. The sync to the smartphone (iPhone) was not easy. The sleep feature stopped functioning. The heart rate monitor stopped working properly. There are forums with other Versa owners having the same issues. This product was a disappointment, so we returned it.
 I was very excited to receive my new waterproof Fitbit as I loved my hr, however, this was not at all what I was hoping for. I would sync it only to have to continuously remove it and re-sync as it wouldn’t stay connected. It looks like I’m not the only one to have this common problem - just disappointed!
 Save your money or buy a Fitbit Versa for the same price.  I bought this in May.  I wanted it for times when I needed a more formal look than the Fitbit.  I wanted to love this devise.  A number of people have commented that it’s an interesting looking ring.  That’s the best thing that I can about it.  Most days it says I have slept zero minutes. Most days it says I have taken zero steps.  I can turn this on my finger to sync forever &amp; it doesn’t sync.  The battery life is not the stated 3 days, it’s more like a day &amp; a half.  Today I got a notice  telling me that my ring had to be reactivated to continue to use Motiv services. Unlike my Fitbit this devise only properly sync to one devise - my Fitbit syncs to all my devices.  When I contacted customer service I was told that a few customers were experiencing battery problems but that would be corrected with a software update. I downloaded the update &amp; it did nothing to help.  I regret having bought this. If possible I’d give it zero stars.
 So far I like my Fitbit versa. The two things I don’t like are I can’t text back from the watch and the band is extremely hard to get clipped in. So it’s a BIG pain when I go to charge it (I have a case on it) to have to undo the band cause it takes 5 minutes just to get it back on. More apps would be nice too. But it serves its purpose
 Love the watch.  Hate the watchbands.  After changing the watchbands (I have different colored ones) once a week for 2 months, the won't stay attached any more.  Took it to a jeweler and was told the "attachment" part is cheap plastic and the pins have worn it so they won't fit any more.<br/>Just called customer support and they refuse to exchange it unless I send them a video of me trying to attach the band.<br/>The rep also said "oh, this is common".<br/>Why do I want another one if the attachment part is "cheap" plastic!
 After 5 weeks of use the wear on finish is showing. The black coating is chipping away around the band and at the pin holes used to hold strap. The watch itself is a good, should option for the all silver one if you really like this watch.
 I am very disappointed in this Fitbit.  Part of the problem is my expectations, I thought it would be more like the Apple watch.  The bands are difficult to change.  My biggest issue it does not sync.  I will go into app and manually sync it and it won't work.  The app keeps closing on me so I uninstalled it.....reinstalled it and still won't sync, at least app isn't closing on me.  Finally got it to sync after restarting phone and watch.  Out of the blue the clock disappeared, then had to reinstall it.  Maybe wait to buy after bugs have been worked through....sorry I spent so much on this watch!
 I purchased this Versa and was so excited to use it! But unfortunately, it would never go through the set up process. I searched for troubleshooting advice in the Fitbit Forums and was disappointed to see that many people were having the same issue. I tried everything that was suggested....over and over, but the device would never sync/pair with my iphone 7 or my laptop. Due to this, I returned the Versa to Amazon. BUT.....I decided to purchase another Versa directly from Fitbit. Guess what?!?!?!? I had absolutely NO ISSUES at all with set up. It did everything it was supposed to with no issues whatsoever. Because of this, I am giving the Versa 5 STARS!
 I wish I could give this 4 stars but too many issues that occur. Definately not worth the expensive price. I like how you can personalise the watch but am constantly having problems with syncing and the battery doesn't last as long...usually have to charge it twice a week. I should not have to restart my phone every time I want to sync. Apparently I am not the only one who has this problem. Plus I have tried multiple times trying to log into my pandora account so I can use it on my watch. However it refuses to load, even using wifi/and 4g service it won't load. I can't use more than half of the features it shows. Basically an expensive basic watch.
 So many things I love about this watch: water resistant, durable, no excessive alerts (which you have control of), has quick workout coach, auto detect sport activity for things like running and cycling, sleek and easy to clean - perfect for work in the healthcare.
 Love this smart watch! A more affordable version of an Apple Watch, I only wish it was more customizable. You can’t add or remove any of the apps that it comes with or move the order in which they appear. Or at least if you can it’s difficult to figure out and I have yet to. It doesn’t come with a Spotify app, only pandora (premium required) and deezer (whatever useless music app that is). It also doesn’t connect with other workout apps like one I already have and pay for separately, rather preferring that you subscribe to the “coach” app for compatibility.
 I use this for everyday watch and fitness tracker.  Have had fitbits for years, working my way up to the versa.<br/>Only had it for 4 days but so far, all is going well. I find it is easy to navigate once it was charged and ready to go.  Only struggle was changing out the bands.  Switched from small to large band and it was not smooth sailing but got it done.  I bought a package of colored bands but don't know that i will be switching out much now.
 I really wanted to love this watch...I replaced my FitBit Blaze for this and wish I would have kept it.  When I have it connected to my phone to sync or receive notifications it DRAINS my phone battery... it was dead in a few hours! This never happened with my Blaze! Very disappointed in this watch...I've been a Fit But user for years and this is my least favorite item I've purchased.
 Good update to the previous version.
 Most comfortable Fitbit I️ have owned. Love this!!!
 Seems fairly accurate. I get a couple hundred steps driving to work in morning, 30 mile drive. Music isn’t stream lined to set up and I’m a techie. I spent an hour creating a hour creating new play list and then it wouldn’t load and lost play list. Might be a poor desktop app. Pandora did ok, but took 2 hours to load list 2 play lists. Blue tooth earphone syniked np. Slow and limited but fun and useful. I like the social aspect of competition with FB friends. I guess it’s worth 200$, I’ll update. It’s only been several days.
 I love everything about this smartwatch... Except I bought it when it first came out, and now the new ones have a smart pay option. I'd love that feature, but I'm not willing to buy a whole new one just to get it. I wish there was a trade-in upgrade option for those of us who purchased early. It's the same price as the original and I haven't had it that long. *Insert sad face here*
 I am very pro-Fitbit, but this product was very disappointing. I’ve had it less than a week and it has froze and rebooted several times. After doing some more research it turns out this is a common issue and there is no solution yet. Seeing that it not operating properly is a pretty significant issue I am returning it. If this wasn’t a problem I would have loved this new device.
 I was very disappointed in this purchase so I returning it. It was advertised to hold a charge for four days, however I never made it more than one day without having to charge. In spite of reviewing the instructions several times, I could not get an accurate sleep analysis.  I’ve ordered an Apple Watch wishing I had done that from the beginning.
 Disappointed my watch stopped working after 4 weeks. I preordered mine too and paid extra to have it ship early. When I called Fitbit’s customer service, they had me do all the different techniques to reset the watch but no luck. Then they said in order to exchange for a new watch, I had to send a video email recording of my attempt at resetting the watch. Pfff nah... Called amazon and got a refund. Perhaps once they work the bugs out, I’ll order another in the future. It’s really too bad, I enjoyed the variety of features while getting to know my body better.
 Frustrated!<br/>1. Once or twice a week I have to recalibrate so it will connect to my phone<br/>2. Does not pick up Auto  workouts.  You can’t do any work out with a glove on that covers your wrist or it will not give you credit for a workout.<br/>3. Free clock faces are cheesy.  Most good ones cost money.<br/><br/>Personally I would not buy again.  I like the size of it but everything else is a let down.  I had high hopes  that some updates would come out and it would be better.  3 months in and I’m still disappointed.  I would not recommend.
 This watch sucks so hard! I must have gotten a defective product.<br/><br/>I am certain that Fitbit isn't having these many problems.<br/><br/>First I can't get it to respond to when I turn my wrist, then it goes on and stays on.<br/>The problems are on and on.<br/>I had the blaze and liked it okay. I am done with Fitbit, you got the money I get the junk. My loss.
 Make sure your phone belongs to the supported models (and probably even after that you won't have guarantee it will work).<br/>I have OnePlus 2 and couldn't pair it. Only afterwards I have found a lot of complaints from people with the same cellphone that they cannot connect. On the other hand, connecting it to $50 BLU phone (not sure which one) was a breeze.  I have no idea if it's a bug/feature in the software (most probably) or somewhere else.
 Does fine as a fitness tracker. Won't work with most music apps people use including Spotify, play music or Apple music. Tends to unsync itself from my phone so that notifications don't work, no notifications for email calls or texts most of the time.
 Had it for 2.5 weeks and then the face went black. Going through the return process with Fitbit which is going to take a month. Their customer support person told me it's taking 5 days for the warehouse to process returns because they are receiving such a high volume.Not impressed.
 At first this smartwatch seemed great, easy to use, pretty accurate heart rate and activity tracking. Then I noticed that alerts (text messages, phone calls, etc.) were not always coming through to the watch. Then, after 35 days, the heart rate tracking went out of control showing very high numbers even when the watch was not being worn. This then threw off the activity levels. Needless to say, an inaccurate fitness tracker is pretty much worthless. I spoke to Fitbit support who told me to reset the watch a few times, which I did, with no improvement. They then told me they'd look into it further. I missed the Amazon return window by 5 days, and Fitbit support is doing nothing to remedy the situation. So I'm left with a fitness tracker that doesn't work. Don't waste your money on this product!
 Very fragile watch. My screen broke within the first 5 days. If you are a athlete, active person, swimmer, hiker, playing actively with dogs... do not get this watch. Also Fitbit DOES NOT cover any screen damage or have any way to fix it. I had a screen protector on it, it only kept the screen from shattering small glass bits into my wrist. Will never get any product from Fitbit again. They do not back the product. Customer service basically told me I had to purchase another watch.
 Face cracked after a month.  Didn't do anything but everyday things.  Betty disappointed.  Fitbit won't do anything!
 Unable to get the thing to work.  I may just take the loss and smash it with a hammer for  ejoyment.<br/><br/>UPDATE. After removing my Charge, also changing to a different WIFI I was able to  get the Versa to link up and work. I feel FitBit could do better as far as directions on how these things work and how the buyer can use them.
 Keeps losing runs when using exercise app and connectsed to GPS. Customer support has had me fo factory reset. Still happens and now will just restart itself. Fitbit will not send me a new one until I send this one back. I refuse because I paid too much money for this and be at their mercy if replacing it within the 5-10 business days after they receive it. I don’t recommend the Versa. They don’t know why it is doing what it’s doing.
 Do not buy this product, it is not as advertised. I am 2 months past the return date so cannot do anything but post a review. Over $200 and it does not store your music, it does not tell you about texts and calls, the clock doesn't work. I should have stayed with the less expensive watches, but I got excited about all that it promised. Don't believe it, they have lots of work to do before this is worth the money!!!
 I love the look of this watch but it drains my phone (Note 8) like nothing I've ever seen before.  I can have the phone on the charger, and it's steadily draining.  I had the Blaze before this, and only bought the Versa because it looked a little more lady-like.  I have tried everything to get this watch to stop draining my phone, but nothing helps.  Fitbit, please do something about this...it's horrible.
 I found out the hard way (at the expense of 2 Fitbit Charge’s) that Fitbit’s are not waterproof and really not too water resistant. I loved the watch so waited for the Versa to be released and have been wearing it for 4 days now. Love the larger screen and relieved that the displays and functions are basically the same so I don’t have to relearn how to use it. Only thing I’m not crazy about is the type face used for the time display. Makes me feel like I have double vision but getting use to it.
 This band is a perfect match for my Fitbit. I will purchase more.<br/><br/>There is a magnetic clamp to allow for easier adjusting. Will definitely purchase more.
 If you have sleeves this device will not able to read your heart rate. Doesn't notify me when I have any kind of notification, can't detect when I'm asleep....not accurate at all. Soooo disappointed. My Polar watch can read my heart rate even with my tattoos, so confused.
 Update: Less than six months later, it’s dead. Th battery went from 60% to 0 in an hour and none of the “fixes” work. Highly disappointed.<br/><br/>Upgraded from a Surge and loved it when I first received it. Fast forward two months and the GPS isn’t working and the special lavender band I paid extra for is filthy and looks so bad I had to order an aftermarket band.
 I really wanted to love this Fitbit. It was lightweight, tracked steps, and my sleep. Unfortunately, the touch screen/tap screen would not work. I would tap repeatedly and nothing would happen. I couldn't switch between apps or even touch the exercise app to track a run. Or the screen would freak out and go between various apps and I couldn't get it back to normal. I reset the watch multiple times, but it continued to be unresponsive to touch/tap. I couldn't justify keeping a beautiful $200 watch if the apps did not work or respond to touch. I am really disappointed because everything else worked great.
 This watch isn't as water resistant as its advertised to be. I bought the insurance plan as well and when water damage happened, the insurance reimbursed me for the watch and said that it was "Beyond Repair". The watch lasted me 3 weeks! Now I have to purchase a new watch and another insurance plan out of pocket. I expected more from Amazon. Also, they refused to post my review 3x already.
 I was so ready for this watch!  It looks great, but until their latest update is a complete roll out, I have returned it.  The list is long and tedious, doesn't stay connected to phone, impossible hoops to jump through trying to move your music to the watch...I say TRYING, as I was never able to complete the feat, because of spotty connection to phone I didn't get notifications...I am FAR from computer illiterate and I spent two days trying my best to find a way to put up with the inconsistencies until the update roll outs that were promised, but since you never know if they will even fix all the glitchy software, I just couldn't take the chance.  Back she went.  But she is a looker, AND if they ever get her in fighting mode down the line, I will be back!
 Will not turn on 54 days after purchase and becomes extremely hot when put on charge. This tells me the lithium battery inside is not likely of the best quality and is likely dangerous. I can only imagine what could have happened if it exploded or caught fire while my wife was wearing it... We have to send it off to fitbit and they will not be returning it for over 2 weeks. Very disappointed. I recommend not buying this product.
 I love my Fitbit versa. People have had different opinions about them, but so far I don’t have any complaints. I have really enjoyed using mine. My only hope is, that in the future I can respond to texts with it, as of now only android users can.
 Love this thing!  Especially the virtual pet!
 Screen cracked with screen protector.  Only solution, buy a new one.
 I've had the Fitbit Versa for about a month when I first got it took a long time to sync. And even to this day it doesn't sync all the time I have to either turn my phone off or turn the Fitbit off and play around with it for a while for it to sync.
 I upgraded from the Charge 2 about a month ago to this device, everything ran smoothly for the most part and it worked perfectly for my swims. But it's now started resetting itself every time the screen turns off and has basically become unusable. Am very disappointed with this product since I spent so much money and nothing seems to fix the issue sadly. I have tried factory resetting twice and keeping the original face clock but it still keeps rebooting itself.
 The step count on the watch is moderately high (10% or so). The stair climbing is wildly high. The app on my phone sucks up battery even though I sync only twice a day.  The alarm does get me off my butt every hour so it gets a low 3 stars instead of a high two. The sleep monitoring doesn't help me much as it seems to miss naps. I don't use the music function so don't know how well that works.
 Terrible product. I purchased a month ago. It spends more time not syching with my iPhone than with my iPhone. I have spoke with technical support. They can help to get it working, but then it stops again. I spend more time angrey with the versa than enjoying it.
 Stay charged for 4-5 days, looks great, the run tracker works perfectly, and it stays paired to my iPhone at all times. I do wish you could reply to texts, though.
 Bought this to upgrade from my Fitbit Charge 2, but that was one of the worst decisions I've made. Going back to the Charge 2. This pseudo Smartwatch is supposed to be the best of Fitbit and Smartwatches, but fails in both areas.
 It’s ok, I had higher expectations for it based on the hipe. I don’t like that some of the clock features example the “weather” one after a  brief time will hound you with advertising to get you to buy the weather app. The add takes over your watch hindering you from seeing any other features of the watch. Very annoying. Other then purchasing the weather app the only way around it is to not use that clock face.
 Best...heart rate monitor, auto detection of exercise<br/>Worst...syncing problems<br/>2nd review:<br/>Syncing has improved immensely.<br/>Display is one of the best<br/>Best Fitbit I have owned (have not owned an Ionic)<br/>Wish it had on board gps
 The product is useless. After updating firmware and reseting it a thousand times it is impossible to synchronize or to install any apps or watch faces. There was not one single positive experience about it. I am a tech addicted and had all Pebble models since the first kickstarter campaing and also had fitbit Alta HR and Charge 2. The only solution is to change brand. fitbit is killing such amazing products  simply by making public such disastrous product... <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Versa-Smartwatch-Gray-Silver-Aluminium-One-Size-S-L-Bands-Included/dp/B07B499PWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Versa Smartwatch, Gray/Silver Aluminium, One Size (S &amp; L Bands Included)</a>
 So far so Good! Love the quality. Super lightweight. It's very cute too. I wish it had more options for apps
 Fitbit needs to fix the "Not Charging - not enough power detected at this source" problem. It's a great looking device that I was looking forward to, but it's useless. Tried cell phone bricks and laptops. Nothing. Returning. I was really excited to start tracking  my lack of] sleep, which the Apple Watch sucks at, but until Fitbit fixes this major problem (check the internet, lots of threads on this "not charging" issue) I'll be getting another Garmin. Oh well lol. Don't bother.
 As soon as I opened the Versa and attempted to connect I have had nothing but trouble. It would not keep a Bluetooth connection and after several failed attempts called Fitbit and they where not able to correct the issue. They ended up having me send them the Versa back to them. That was a month ago. They received the Versa at their facility on the 3rd of July( verified by checking the tracking number of the package) I still have not heard one thing from them on what they are going to do.... I feel as I wasted 200 dollars. Not happy at all!
 Very good heart rate monitor but the GPS phone syncs feature is highly inaccurate with my iPhone X. The Versa only registers a quarter of my distance on my bike rides. The sleep app is pretty cool but the others are hokey.  Should have spent another $100 for a top of the line Apple Watch.
 I had this fit bit for 2 weeks and then it did an update and won’t hold a charge for more than a few hours.  That’s without exaggerating.  I tried to do a return on amazon but the product was not available so it said I needed to wait for a replacement.  Well now it is 2 months later I can’t do a straight return for my money back because now it’s to late. But I tried to return it 2 weeks after I received it.  I spent 244.00 for this and it doesn’t work I am so disappointed and I use amazon for everything.
 Why fitbit doesn't let the buyer select the size of the band at the time of purchase is beyond me. Go to their website and check out the pages of buyers who were unable to get the band on for the correct size. I tried, watched the video, had other people try and we could not get the large size band on. Sent it back. Had it for three hours. A total joke and why would you need a small band and a large band ? Be brave at time of purchase and figure out what size band  you need.
 Not good so far<br/>No sync with WiFi<br/>Slow very very slow to responding<br/><br/>After Restarting into racing all data three times and still on able to synchronize after battery has run down from an Apple iPhone this product can be thrown in the river. No that wouldn't work it's waterproof. In 15 years with Amazon this is the most worthless product I have ever purchased<br/>DO NOT PURCHASE!
 First time I went swimming with it, it quit working
 I loved the device itself but, I had a reaction to the band.  It gave me a rash and blistered.  I sent the device back as instructed and I still don’t have the refund.  It is still traveling to the plant.  So I am without a tracker, my money is still tied up, can’t buy new tracker yet, and when all is said and done it will have been over a month since I sent it back.  Very disappointed in Fitbit. 😩
 El reloj fit versa tiene en sus caracteristicas una fidelidad de la frecuencia cardiaca segun ellos del 95% , Por una situación medica he tenido que monitorizar mi frecuencia cardiaca con otros dispositivos , y la diferencia es hasta de 40 latidos por minuto!!!!!, eso puede ser hasta peligroso para una persona . Les he escrito y he hecho todo lo que me han indicado para mejorar la sensibilidad y sigue exactamente igual. No lo recomiendo es muy costoso y de muy mala calidad !!
 This is a wonderful easy to use Fitbit.  Nice appearance.
 Love my new Versa! Works great!
 Love this Versa,
 Originally, I love this Fitbit. After 2 months though, it stopped working, watch wont turn on, so I'm going to try to return it. If I can't, then I'm out $200 plus the different bands I bought for it. I'm just going to look into getting a smart watch. They do the same thing plus much more.
 So disappointed!! Gave this as a gift to my son. Second time it wouldn't charge. He followed all the directions, even factory reset. I should have read the reviews. This is obviously a product flaw. Why continue to sell a product that stops working immediately?! Now I have to pay to send it back.
 It is a pretty watch and a good interface when not trying to connect with other software. Disappointingly, it is a worse fitness tracker than my Blaze. I can't add workouts to it....nor does it record workouts that I've done on the watch to the app. I also no longer get my sleep schedule which was another favorite part of the watch. I was so excited for the watch and now I am disappointed
 Heart rate monitor seems to not quite work right and it crashes when I hit the left button while it’s displaying the message that I got my steps for the hour.
 Bought this based on the promises of 4 day battery life. At first I could easily manage to get 4 days of battery life. After a month of use, I'm lucky if the charge lasts a single day. I have tried all of Fitbits support tips to increase the battery life. Nothing works. This product was clearly rushed to the market and not ready for primetime.
 I bought the Fitbit Versa because I had a flex and loved it! I thought I would upgrade to the new one. When I got it, it worked for about a week. After that it started flashing through different screens with out me touching it. I called tech support and they had me factory reset it. The very next morning it started doing the same thing and the the buttons stopped working. Thankfully it’s within the return period so I can get a refund.
 pros I like how it looks cons i had to re-set it up over 5 times the text messages had hard time getting it to work then the sleep count didnt work and when it did put it on wrong days and I reset it and still didn't fix it
 I bought the versa because I swim and boat. I read that the Versa<br/>was water proof up to 50 something. When I get it I find out that it is only water resistant for a few seconds. I am also have issues with it pairing to my phone.  It's ok, just not worth what I paid for.
 Love it. Specifically if you are a fitness first and smart watch second person.
 I was excited to receive and start using the Fit bit Verse. After my first firmware update,  the screen would no longer come on. Fitbit customer service wasn't excellent, but after a bit of pressure including social media push,  they finally sent me a replacement.
 I use a floor fan. I set the tracker for charge in the same room and it records steps. That was not expected from a company like Fitbit. This is the second Fitbit i am disappointed in. Returning it
 Changing the band is a nightmare it is going back. So disappointing that a simple band change could be so badly devoloped,considering the wife has a a charge 2 and has many bands that simply snap on and off. Should have done better research even you tube videos explain how much a pain it is just to put the larger band on it.
 Would not get notifications from my Apple Watch. Tried for 2 days. Had to send it back. Other than that worked fine.
 Great battery life and I love the new design. BUT it is tracking way more floors than I do in a day. It tracks 13 floors by 8 am and I only go down my porch steps at that point. It is pretty frustrating because I did not have this problem with the Blaze.
 I really liked this until Fitbit 'updated' their software.  I have done everything you can for troubleshooting but the Fitbit app will no longer find my Versa.  It's been this way for three weeks and there is no sign of a fix.  It won't even keep accurate time since it can't interface with my phone.  So I have a $200 brick.<br/><br/>As a warning, Fitbit will not stand behind their product for a refund unless you purchase it through the Fitbit site.  I am going to try to contact Amazon with the details and see if they can do anything, but can't say that Fitbit, for all of their 'rah-rah' marketing is worth anything.<br/><br/>I bought a Casio that keeps perfect time, tracks my steps on the watch itself, and doesn't need to interface with my phone.
 This watch stopped working after a month. Amazon refused to let us return it.
 This watch is made more for a woman rather than a man. Its very small and will disappoint you if you want a lot of features go for the blaze or icon instead
 Beware, this does not pair with new android phones and fitbit has not released when it will.<br/><br/>I have an S9 and only ~50% of the functionality works.<br/><br/>Beautiful product, but unfortunately unusable with newer phones.
 I bought this because I needed a watch to track my fitness routine and to give me notifications so I will not run late for meetings. I returned it within a few days. The engineers are obviously still trying to figure out the software behind it. On a good day, I get a third of my notifications with less than 2 mins delay (which is significant). The app crashes a few times a day. If you go online, you will see many people have trouble receiving their notifications. This is basically a over priced fitness tracker with somewhat working smart watch functionality.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Light weight<br/>2. very nice design<br/>3. Fun watch faces<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Can't rely on it to get your notification<br/>2. Terrible sleep tracking user interface<br/>3. App constantly crashes<br/>4. Screen does not auto wake upon notification<br/>5. Very much under developed software in watch that crashes, delays when you use them<br/>6. Basically, IT DOES NOT WORK AS A SMARTWATCH<br/><br/>I say if you are willing to pay $200 for a pretty smart watch looking fitness tracker, then go for it. Personally I advise against it, STRONGLY
 It stopped working after 2 weeks, dosnt turn on or charge RETURN THE JUNK
 The main reason I bought the Versa was because I just had a baby and I want to keep track of my exercise. It really doesn't make since that the versa it's telling me that I took over 500 steps after just washing dishes.
 Has trouble syncing with Bluetooth. Have to restart constantly to sync
 Worked fine until it got wet.  They claim it's waterproof to 50 meters but it clearly isn't.  Sometimes had trouble syncing too.  If you buy it, DON'T GET IT WET!
 I would think that the Fitbit Versa should last more than 10 day. The Versa took tree charges the fourth it will not, now down to zero battery. It does indicate that it is charging but, not.
 Very nice looking. Great design. Now that it kind of looks like a Pebble, maybe it should be as reliable as one. Seems to work pretty well, though. Not many devices are officially supported by fitbit, and doesn't always sync properly. Otherwise, I like it a lot.
 I don’t like the fact that the battery runs down so quick... it will be fully charged on a Monday but by Wednesday it is already down to 53%... are there ways to slow down the battery usage??
 LOve this watch.  I hope it will last more than one year.
 Able to see in bright sunlight. Did not like requirement for putting music on reliant on a computer.
 I was excited about this produce because I have heart issues and it monitored my heartbeat, as well as other features.  But, less than 2 months, the screen cracked when I placed it in the charger.  I can't find a glass replacement option and if I have to buy a new one, it won't be a Fitbit. I even had a screen protector on it but that was useless.  Do your research before spending this much money
 Bluetooth connection is spotty at best. Constantly won't sync up with my phone. Notifications come through sporadically. I'm super disappointed so far and I'm using a Galaxy S8, it's not like I'm using a ten year old phone.
 2 stars because 3 would mean I have minor gripes but overall happy, and 1 would mean it was garbage, Im mad and about to be a troll.. but I dont want buyers to miss the information I'm providing.<br/><br/>I loved this watch. I preordered the rose tinge for my wife and charcoal for myself. She still wears hers nonstop, and I check my pale un tanned wrist for my heartrate and the time every 10 minutes it seems.<br/><br/>I cracked my screen. I called fitbit, filed a claim and sent in requested pictures of my device.  That's when they told me they dont warranty the screen. That isnt an issue in the slightest.. who hasn't cracked a screen before and had to deal with it?<br/><br/>Normally you crack a screen, a hip the broken one in, pay $100 or so and get a refurbished model back.. so it's a minor inconvenience.. well see that's the thing..<br/><br/>Fitbit (at least for the Versa) "do not have facilities that repair our device"<br/><br/>They did offer a very generous free shipping if I were to purchase a brand new one though.<br/><br/>So. Awesome watch. Really 5 stars cool and once you have it you'll nonstop use it. Very good stuff.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Fitbit did one of two things.<br/>1: Released an awesome, knowingly fragile product before they had means of addressing the 100% probability that these watches will break and people will want them repaired, even pay to have them fixed.<br/><br/>2. Released an awesome, knowingly fragile product with no intention of addressing the 100% probability their customers will want and pay for their damaged product repaired.<br/><br/>The first way, there is negligence, the second way there is a cold shouldered "thanks for your money, sucks to be you" mentality.<br/><br/>It's awful, because it's a dang good watch. :'(
 Purchased this item as “new” but it was clearly used.  The box had been opened, item unpackaged, and scratches on the screen.  So disappointed.  I went to Target and bought the same item NEW for the same price.
 The watch is great, however only giving one star due to when I opened the box the screen has a small scratch on it. Tried it on for size and capabilities but am not happy with it already being scratched!<br/>Am looking at returning.<br/>Will give more stars if exchanged!
 I’ve had this versa for 6 months and I’m already on my 4th replacement. I am Not satisfied with this product... this will be my last Fitbit purchase
 The product is good got addicted to it from the first day, the only spoiler is the constant flashing green light on your skin , even turining of the heart rate monitor does not turn this light off, I only need the heart rate monitoring during workouts, having the green light penetrate through my skin 24*7 is a big disappointment.
 Horrible, broke already!!!!
 Had issue, chat with fit bit, corrected problem!
 Liked it, but after a month of use whenever the watch screen would turn off to save power it would turn to max brightness and glow on a blank screen.  Battery then would only last an hour.
 Pretty basic and unimpressive on most levels. The app is the best part to Fitbit and it’s nice to track everything. The step counter is incredibly inaccurate. While driving I can reach my steps per hour goal no problem. Considered returning because of the cost for mediocrity
 Well, the price of an apple watches the quality of kids play watch. that sums it up. The band was good, the watch itself was the lowest quality plastic ever. The interface was slow and the OS, well if you are fine with the 5 good apps they have, go for it.
 Do not buy this watch.  It lasted a month, and the screen stopped working.  I thought I would try Fitbit, hoping they had improved their workmenship.  I was F**** wrong.
 Heart rate monitor doesn’t work
 Was nice for tracking but it didn't sync with my phone to control music. It only worked about 25% of the time. It also wouldn't sync to my phone one day, no matter what I tried.
 I bought the Fitbit Versa (coming from a Moto 360 Gen II) -  I loved the look of it. After realizing I really only use my Android Wear watch for notifications, I pulled the trigger on the Fitbit.<br/><br/>I'm returning the watch after a week.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Watch feels great to wear, light, comfortable, nice looking - I could comfortably sleep with it on.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The notifications will not work if my phone is in silent mode (complete deal breaker)<br/>- The screen is not always on (no wonder it gets 4 days of battery)<br/>- The screen does not "turn on" with new notifications<br/>- The charger clamps on watch - with my Moto 360 I could just rest / set the watch and it'd charge wirelessly. Lining the watch up seems like 5 years ago.<br/><br/>Wanted to love it - but Fitbit has a long ways to go for me before it can realistically be an option for me.
 The watch was a gift. As far as I know the person loves it.
 Worked like a charm for about 10 days, then stopped syncing, stopped restarting, and all around stopped working. Just set up my exchanged device...we'll see how long this one lasts.
 Very dissatisfied. Glitches out and doesn't record workouts!
 I have had my versa for under 2 months, the screen has gone black now and it will not charge or turn on. On the fitbit troubleshooting boards many people are having this same issue from fitbit. I spent the morning with fitbit support to find out that it will take a month for them to send me a replacement watch for a mechanical issue. This is my second fitbit watch and I loved my first I just wanted to upgrade, I am very disappointed that the watch quit working in less then 2 months and the lack of response time with fitbit's technical support. Contacting technical support only led them to tell me to do the things that the website suggests you do BEFORE calling technical support. Prior to the versa screen not working and the versa not charging I really liked the watch, but the fact that the watch stops working after so short a period is not ok in my world, as well as it taking a month for a replacement to be sent from fitbit. Poor service.
 While the design is pretty good, the software both on the watch and Android app is incredibly buggy. Issues range from killing phone battery, inability to add cards to Fitbit Pay, missed connections between phone and Versa, and missing tracking sleep.

Received my brand new fitbit versa today and it does not charge. I have tried numerous sources and it just does not work. I even tried a different charger. Quite disappointed in this faulty product.
 Easy to setup. Gives lots of info.
 Awesome upgrade from my Blaze!
 after two months of wearing it. It quit working.plus it cost extra money to use it features. Amazon took it back, but I rather get a cheaper way of counting my steps
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2GC680MHH5XDH"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-e5wuXaTS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WOj2UXuMS.png"/> It’s a beautiful watch, but it isn’t super innacurate... I was in a road trip a whole day, and the amount of steps and stairs it said I did is CRAZY. My charge HR 2 was better. I hope they fix this soon.
 After a bunch of issues with it not responding, failing to sync, it has finally died, a few days after the return period. Tried forcing restarts, etc nothing. Will have to go through manufacturer to get it repaired. Looks pretty, but does not perform well, and software is flaky.<br/><br/>EDIT: After contacting customer support, a replacement was sent out without any hassle. Appreciate the great service. The product is a great product if it actually lasts. Heart rate monitor / steps sensor is very responsive. The watch is also very stylish, definitely an improvement in design over the blaze.
 I am still trying to get my Fitbit to work. I have called Verizon several times to get the Fitbit connected properly and it still is not working. I am upset with this Fitbit.
 More modern appearance than the Blaze. No complaints so far
 Amazing!!
 LOVE THIS 💗
 So my 10 day old Fitbit watch band already broke. Any chance you will send a new one?
 I just got my new Fitbit Versa and I’m super disappointed as the heart rate monitor doesn’t work. I did some googling and this seems to be a very common problem. I would highly advise getting this watch!
 I love this watch. I still can't figure out how to hear incoming calls on it. This is why I gave it r stars instead of 5.
 I’ve had a Versa for six weeks. Today at the pool it stopped working. The warranty and customer service said it’s not covered. I’m so disappointed
 I had the Fitbit less then a month before it completely stopped working. I have a completely blank screen
 If I could give this product zero stars I would.<br/><br/>Let me begin by explaining the good about this watch. The build quality, size, comfortability, style etc...<br/><br/>Don't let all of this fool you. I love this watch so so much but the step counter is literally worse than what you would get out of a Happy meal. Before I get out of bed, I would have hundreds of steps already. You can literally shake this device and it will count steps. Without proper step count it is hard to consider this as a device I would recommend.
 I cannot have both - a Versa and an Ionic setup at the same time. This should be noted in the sales info.
 I love everything it does
 They call this a smart watch, but it's skirting the lower limits of the definition.  First, you can't control music playback with it. This one is especially bad to me because it's listed as an advertised feature. It might work with some phones, but on the Pixel 2 XL, one of the newest model phones and the flagship Google phone, it does not support music control. There is no excuse for that. I've been waiting months for Fitbit to patch in a fix, but nope, I guess that's not a priority for them.<br/><br/>Second, the apps for the watch are extremely limited. There are only a few to choose from, and none of them are very useful.  It's extremely disappointing after owning a Pebble and a Pebble Time, both of which were excellent smart watches, then buying this thing and finding out it's nowhere near as useful.<br/><br/>I thought I was upgrading from my Pebble Time, but it turns out this was a massive downgrade in terms of smart watch capabilities.  It's so sad that Pebble sold out to Fitbit and this is all that they have to show for it.  Even more sad, Fitbit could fix the issues and make this a great product, but they don't.  If you're looking for a smart watch, get something else.
 Never syncs unless I do a factory reset every time, which completely defeats the purpose of having this watch.
 The quality of this watch is the worst that I have ever seen. It looks really great but the glass is sub-quality. Fitbit will not warranty the defects in the screen. DO NOT BUY THIS! Get a Garmin instead.
 The Versa is a nice fitness watch, I really enjoyed using it. However, after only one month of use it did the blue-barcode screen of death and then died the next morning. They definitely need to work out the kinks of this new device.
 Fitbit  will not pick up WiFi or Bluetooth tried everything that is ask me to still nothing,your product horrible
 My text message notifications do not work. But the rest does and it seems to be okay.
 I can not get it to receive text, I've tried all the suggestions. My surge gassed no complications. I'm not really happy with this purchase....as of now.
 Had my Fitbit versa for two Months and stopped working , the screen went blank doesn’t work
 I use it to track sleep ands steps as well as practice breathing. I don't like it can't check blood pressure but I still love it
 I like the fit and the sensitively in picking up steps. I don’t like that it doesn’t respond to the move of my wrist to get the time like my charge 2 did. I end up having to tap it several times to get it to respond
 I was so excited on getting this, it looks really good, feels good.. but having a Samsung gear before it was a mistake.. I had too high expectations.. it isn't what I wanted out of a smart watch. the Music restriction from a desktop (which I own a chrome book) kinda make it restricting like an Apple watch. not a whole lot you can add to the watch with its small memory, alarms on my S8+ wont linked up to the versa, May have to return, and get another Samsung.. pay the price for the best.. my opinion. .
 DO NOT BUY!!  Just after 48 days my Versa quite working, will not sync to app and the battery wouldn’t hold a charge longer then 3 hours. Because I purchased on Amazon Fitbit will not honor and give a refund.
 I gave it to my spouse as a present and she hated its size and didn't find it useful compared to iWatch
 I bought this thinking it would be like the other smart watches I have had in the past but it’s not. The step counter adds steps just from my arms moving. The band is bulky and doesn’t flex with movement so I bought a mesh band and it rips out my arm hair. My other watch’s were Samsung’s and although they were bulky I was able to text and receive calls using my watch. This watch only shows me who’s calling or the text message but I am unable to reply or use my watch to talk. If I answer a call i have to have my phone to talk. It tracks the sleep patterns and HR but not your sp02 levels to see if their are any apnea moments during your sleep. I like the watch design itself but I wish I’d of saved the money to buy the Apple Watch instead.
 The verse the overall is pretty good. However when I'm running, the GPS doesn't work in the map function doesn't work as well. Really wish that it worked as good as the charge 2 did.
 My wife and I have been long-time Fitbit users. We've gone through quite a few devices - Charges, Charge HRs, Charge HR 2s, Blazes, etc. We even took our slight detour for the first round of Apple Watch and returned after just a few months. Generally, we've considered Fitbits to be an 18 mo. device, which has been very reasonable given the price point. After a period of time you can safely expect them to wear out, crack, scratch, etc. But for $100, $150, it was kind of expected and we've been pretty hardcore fans of Fitbits. Most of our friends and family now sport them from our recommendation.<br/><br/>We've been waiting for Fitbit to put out a smarter, sleeker, sexier fitness device that has some smart capabilities to it. So, we pre-ordered the Versa and waited patiently.<br/><br/>First impressions: We absolutely loved it. The interface is effective. The device as accurate. The new features are impressive. We love a few options with apps (not many, but a few good ones) and we love having things like weather now.<br/><br/>Second impressions: The quality of the device itself just appears to be incredibly disappointing. We didn't have our devices a week and both of us have scratches and minor cracks on them. I'd understand if we were tough on the devices, but we aren't at all. I'm an office executive and runner. Standard day to day wear and minor cracks that I have no idea what the cause was. My wife stays home. Same experience. And we've had enough fitness trackers and smart watches to know what to expect. But for both of these devices to be in the condition they are in after a week or two is really disappointing. Qualitatively, there is a stark difference between an Apple Watch and Versa. But there is a stark price difference. That said, if you have to replace your Versa every 3-6 months to keep it looking professional and sleek, the Fitbit ends up being more expensive.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Fitbit has a great product here with a great interface. But I wouldn't go into this expecting to save money compared to competition when you factor the difference in quality. Perhaps we just got devices with faulty screens or the first batch in pre-order had some marginal improvements to be made. But I'd consider the long-term cost of ownership and what it means to you to have brand new devices with cracks and scratches from everyday wearing.
 We are not in the late 2000's. There is no reason why I should have to struggle for 4 hours to add music to my fitbit. I thought I was receiving a fitbit with tap pay but nope, this version does not have tap pay. I am going for the Samsung Gear S3 for $80 more but I get thousands of apps including spotify which a light year better than pandora. I am from a younger generation and this watch is aimed at us but Pandora? really? Us younger people do not buy music anymore, we stream it and for that reason we like to have full control of our music library. There are only like 20 useless apps officially uploaded by fitbit. There are only a few clock faces created by fitbit too which is a complete false advertisement of their 500+ clock faces. I feel completely ripped off even at the cheap price of $200. I expected more and I feel completely let down. Thank God I am getting a full refund.
 Will not synch with my android phone
 When it works it's great.  But syncing is ridiculously bad.  Tried suggestions on forums but it is still not working.  Debating whether to return it and get something else
 it was fabulous until just past the return date. Now, this piece of crap won't stay powered more than 5 to 6 hours making it worthless even as a watch.
 I really like the look and fit but the battery doesn't last long and i couldn't connect to messenger plus
 This is the first time i took the plunge on getting a device at first release just on specs and I am a bit disappointed. I was looking to upgrade from my pebble steel to get better fitness tracking but keeping smartwatch benefits for notifications, music control. The watch is promising the music control feature does not work reliably. I have to constantly unpair and re-pair the device with my Samsung S7 edge for music control. Totally not worth my time in troubleshooting bugs with basic connectivity one of the top selling phone model. Will probably return it and wait for bugs to be resolved.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Surprisingly Lightweight<br/>* Great design and easy to switch straps.<br/>* Great battery life and quick charging.<br/>* Fitness tracking<br/>* Good price considering features. Assuming the basic features work as advertised.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Bluetooth connectivity with Samsung S7 for music control is horrendous. Seems to be ok for other syncing.<br/>* Tracking is slightly off. Adds steps even after just sitting up in bed in the morning.<br/>* Text messages notifications do not show part of the message similar to other apps like email or whatsapp. Just shows number of messages received without number/user and part of the message. This is highly useful in other smartwatches where you can get the code for two-factor authentication conveniently instead of logging into the phone.<br/>* No call reject/accept feature<br/>* No text reply feature for responding to messages with a canned message.
 When I received the box, paint chip smaples came with it?
 After 1 month the watch quit working. Totally dead
 Didn't live up
 I love my Fitbit Versa.
 This device doesn't accurately track my steps nor does it have all the functionality that it was supposed to have. It is a glorified pedometer at best
 Was bought as a gift. She loved for the first 2 months. Now the charging station has stopped working. An will not charge. So basically it's now a $200 plastic bracelet.
 This Fitbit is not what I expected in an upgrade. It doesnt record sleep correctly and records steps when your not even wearing it!
 Doesn’t do everything I thought it would.
 This the worst product someone can consider buying for an Android phone.<br/><br/>Never connects on Android app. Used it just for 2days and frustrated.
 Color screen, functions, size and look.<br/>Disappointed in heart rate function, seems to read very high during excerise.
 Nice watch, cool features..as far as the fitness part of it, I like that it's waterproof up to 50 meters and it's super light, I barely noticed it there..<br/> I went from a Samsung Gear S2 (because I wanted an upgrade) to this and there's a few things I dislike...<br/>1. There was no "find my phone" option (yes I lose my phone a lot)<br/>2. You can't just press and hold a button to shut it off, you have to go into settings and click shutdown in order to do so...<br/>3. You can't respond to texts, you can only view them, I sometimes like to be able to send a simple "ok" if I'm not near my phone.<br/>4. If you don't clear said texts right away, there will be a million of them piled up and you'll need to scroll all the way up to "clear all"<br/>4. You get alerts from your calendar..but can't view the calendar you're getting alerts from, like you can on the S2 ...<br/>All in all, it's nice and works well, but I'm going back to my S2
 The bottom line is this - if you have a Pixel XL 2 - this WILL NOT work for you.  It would sync for 20, 30 minutes and then lose connection.  Restarting my phone was a temporary fix - but it just WILL NOT stay connected.  It's a HUGE bummer because I love the usability of the fitbit.  It's so user friendly, you can customize it to your style and the apps are fantastic.  I contacted fitbit and they said there's no fix in the near future and the XL 2 isn't on their list of "approved devices."  Sooo... my advice is to not waste your time or money.  So bummed.
 Love the graphics , my bad didn’t realize I was getting such an all black watch so when bands added still mostly black looking ( not very feminine)
 dislike the rubber band, had to spend more to get a cloth one
 I am coming from a Charge 2 HR and in short it is an upgrade. You are able to see notifications from multiple apps, not just basic supported ones from Fitbit, read the notifications and a few other features. What I do not like however the is laggy interface and the short battery life. It is a trade off I am willing to make with nightly charging and at times clunky operating system in the Versa.
 Nicely built. Basically a big fitbit, but little else. Have to recharge more often because it's in color.
 Works great.
 Had issues with syncing to iphone. Did not get through the process. The gear kept turning but no sync. Other than that, great device.
 Extremely hard to set up for someone who already had a Fitbit.  I would like the calorie counter to be viewable on the watch display.
 This is a great watch..... The heart rate monitor is okay but not as good as a strap around you chest....... I am returning it because it does not read your heart rate when you're swimming.... So if you're buying this watch and hope to use it while you're swimming forget about it..... It's waterproof up to 50 meters but it doesn't track your heart rate!
 It's great and does more than I expected
 Within 2 months of having the watch, the battery failed to last through a whole day on an overnight charge.
 Hate it.  F'ing big weather thing keeps popping up and doesn't let you see watch or steps.  Should have bought a vivofit.
 I don't get my notifications like I need. So I'm definitely not happy with it.
 Nice
 Great device but as a determined user the syncing process is inconsistent.  The inconsistency can be very irritating.
 Good toys
 This is a piece of junk. I wanted to like it, but after 5 days the screen is cracked. I consider myself a very active person I don’t know if it was self inflicted, but Fitbit does not replace or repair the screen.<br/><br/>If you are only going to count steps, or you have a desk job it’s probably fine, but I don’t recommend it for active lifestyles.
 Will not sync to my phone.  Too late to return.  Now I am stuck with a $200 POS.
 I love my Fitbit. However it seems like the Versa has battery life issues.  I may just go back to my Charge!
 I had high hopes for this watch. I really like the bright, colorful display and the many choices of watch faces. I've been trying fitness functions for two weeks and I'm very disappointed. The Versa paired up with my android phone and synced immediately but the Fitbit app refuses to sync with the watch automatically. I have to manually restart Bluetooth and force the sync every time. I find the fitness functions to be grossly inaccurate. For instance, the step counter says that I am taking 2,000 &amp; 5,000 steps per day. I am disabled and use a powerchair most of the time. I am only able to take 200 or maybe 300 steps per day. The sleep monitor doesn't show me asleep until I've been asleep for an hour or an hour and a half. This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made and I will be returning it.
 Versa does not get text message alerts, only phone calls. Not very
 2nd Fitbit. 1st one succumbed to ocean water dplash.
 I decided I do not need to know my steps. Works fine. Music download isn’t easy.
 I love the personalized features available. I wish it was more compatible with iPhones.
 Was awesome, for about a 2 weeks. Stopped sending notifications, keeps saying restart device. Fitbit support is laughable. As someone who has these as items for sale at their job I can no longer recommend anything fitbit.
 I WEAR A LARGE IN THE CHARGE 2, BUT THIS BAND WOULD NOT FIT AROUND MY WRIST EVEN THOUGH IT SAID S/L SIZE. I WAS NOT GOING TO BUY A BAND WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I SPENT ON THE WATCH, I WILL JUST KEEP WITH MY CHARGE 2 UNTIL THEY FIX THE BAND PROBLEM AND MAKE IT SO WE CAN SELECT A DIFFERENT SIZE. I DID NOT GET TO TRY THE WATCH OUT DO TO BAND.
 Doesnt work sometimes very spontaneously without any reason. Update... same thing. Very frustrating.
 Scratches super easy and workouts always stop recording halfwaythrough. Design looks great tbough.
 I absolutely loved my Fitbit verse for months until it randomly just stopped working one morning
 Sending this trash back. Beware that this is a nice product that has garbage software to work with it. Spent 7 days (on and off) going through turning off bluetooth, clearing data, turning my phone off and on again, resetting the watch etc. just to have it not connect to my phone ever. Tried to get a new clock face when I thought it was set up and it just says that it can't connect. Purchased this for a Mother's Day gift with exercise in mind but so far the only thing getting exercised is my frustration! I highly recommend that you look for another brand of wearable fitness tracker that doesn't require calls to their support to get the thing set up in the first place.
 Sent it back! Did not work reliably AT ALL- couldn't always turn it back on after it shut down by itself, and so it then wouldn't record steps etc.  Fitbit needs to do some work with this watch!
 I love how it keeps track of my heart rate since I have a heart condition.
 Has a delay with giving text messages and phone calls.  Calls are missed before the versa even notifies me that someone is calling.  After installing it on my phone, my phone stopped connecting to my blue tooth in my car.  Not what I expected.
 Unlike the blaze this watch does not turn on when you look at it.
 Uncomfortable. Too big for me I guess
 So far so good!
 Love it
 How do I tell you how bad the battery sucks?
 Step counts are not accurate, either is the calorie count
 Text notifications don’t work only able to see calls.
 There's nothing special about it. Wish it gave bp numbers.
 It’s just absolutely amazing!!!
 Product does not pair with Moto X4 phones
 It does not track steps accurately.
 Loved the weight, size, and appearance of the Versa, but the accuracy of the steps, floors, heart rate, and calories burned was way way off. I sat at my desk most of the day and it showed I’d climbed 13 floors and walked 9,208 steps. Showed I’d walked 75 steps before I’d gotten out of bed.
 Received watch tried to set it up however it wouldn't sync. Googled was to fix it, tried all recommendations however nothing worked, just the fit bit logo and and blue bar had way across the screen.  Called customer service and they were also unsure how to fix it. After reading multiple reviews via the fit bit community page many have had issues with the new Versa. This is now being returned....looked nice just wish it worked.
 I used my first Fitbit Versa for about three weeks and loved the versatility and ability for tracking both my runs and lap pool swimming. It was amazing. Then, the battery began failing over three days, then two, and eventually could not keep a charge for a full day. I thought it was an anomally and returned it for a replacement.<br/><br/>Again, the watch worked beautifully--doing all I needed it to do--for about a week. Then the battery crashed again. I followed the online suggestions for turning off the notifications and all day synching hoping that would do it. I charged it up overnight, put it on in the morning, and went to swim my laps. It didn't last more than two laps and it was dead! Sadly, another return. Fitbit needs to figure out a better battery usage. They've got an extremely useful tracker/watch--if it only lasted more than a day.
 Will not work with windows
 Band Quality is very bad
 One of the reasons I bought this was for the ability to download music onto it and not have to carry a phone. At this point, I can't spend any more time trying to figure out how to do it. It disconnects / says there is no more room on the phone (no songs downloaded at all).  Perhaps Fitbit should figure out how to work these features before putting the product on the market.
 Got it because it was a cheap fitness tracker, comparable to an Apple Watch in terms of capabilities, size, and look while approximately half the price. When it was first delivered, the touch screen would not work. Sent it back to Amazon, and they replaced it with a new one. New one worked well enough at first, did what I wanted, but things started to go downhill after around 1.5 months of use. The battery life was pitched at 4+ days, what they don't tell you is that this is with literally every feature you'd buy it for turned off. It essentially lasts as a wristwatch with a dimly lit screen for 4+ days. Now, two months out the battery only lasts about 25 hours, if I'm only using the watch and heart rate monitor features. If I connect to my phone with bluetooth, I'd be lucky if it lasted a day. If I knew about the precipitous drop in battery life so soon after buying the watch, I would never have bought it in the first place.
 This is the 3rd fitbit that i purchased because i loved it until it got a cracked screen. They said it was damaged~which it wasnt~ and they have NO ONE to repair it even if I pay for it. Now that's the dumbest thing I have ever heard. So there goes $200 down the drain. i will NEVER buy another Fitbit. Do your homework before you buy!
 Received this watch today. It's pretty small with childish LCD screen (I guess you get what you pay for). I have multiple smart watches including Series 3 and S3 Frontier but this is not worth my money. May be it is great activity tracker as others saying but this watch keep updating since last 3 hours, I mean seriously? If Fitbit reading this review then that's how you lose a customer. TURNED OFF &amp; GOING TO RETURN.<br/><br/>(P.S. Trying to setup on iPhone)
 Difficult to setup with iPhone 6.  Bluetooth keeps dropping which means no sync
 Looks wise this product is great. The watch face isnt too big and it's fairly comfortable to wear all the time. The waterproof feature is nice too so I don't have to take it off for a quick shower. That's all I've liked about this product. Since this product does not have built in GPS you have to use your phone. This feature doesn't even work!! It will say connecting forever and when it finally connects the pace never changes!! Even when I'm clearly sprinting the pace will not change. It is not accurate at all. I miss my fitbit surge from 2016. It was way better with no issues. This watch is buggy and the main thing that is supposed to work doesn't. Very disappointed and returning
 I had mine for a week and then it stopped syncing with my phone. I resolved the issue by re-downloading every couple days. After a month it stopped working. Fitbit helped trouble shoot and decided they would replace it, but it took almost a month to receive my replacement.
 Versa worked great for a month then no more Bluetooth.  Cannot get it back.  Contacted Fitbit.  They would not offer return because I bought it thru Amazon.
 I'm happy with it.
 Swim proof???  Really. Went in the pool today and it died. Doesn’t work anymore and it’s stuck on the info screen. Really. $200 for this. Come on.
 Got mine yesterday. Connected to my phone but can't update. Restarted both phone and Fitbit, uninstalled and reinstalled the application and still nothing. What a disappointment. Nothing really changed since I had my first Fitbit in 2013 and had exact issues. Never had an issue with my Pebble. I guess it takes a little bit more than just buying a company with all their products, you actually need to work on getting yours better. Giving 2 stars only for a nice hardware.
 I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and had an extremely hard time setting this device up. It froze and I had to start over again. Took almost to hours to complete the setup and update the firmware on the Fitbit. Not a happy customer.
 The smartwatch was not charging right out of the box. After calling Fitbit they determined they had to send me a new charging cradle but they were back ordered. They quoted me 3 weeks for a new cradle. I decided I couldn't justify paying 200 dollars to have the smartwatch sitting around uncharged for 3 weeks. Item was returned.
 I think I might have ordered the wrong "watch"  I wanted something for work, I am a nurse and I see everyone with smart watches and the like.  I though the price was reasonable but I am not really looking for a fit watch but a smart one.  It is lightweight but the battery doesn't last very long either.  I am sure this would be ideal for some but just not what I really wanted( not enough free watch faces with a second hand) you need to pay for better ones, it doesn't take phone calls...  Like I said I just ordered the wrong item
 to delicate for an active person. the raised glass will crack with a hard bump or drop.  would not recommend.  stick with the blaze.  i cracked 3 screen protectors with no damage to the screen.
 Wish the face was a little bigger. Hard to read at times
 This is certainly an upgrade from my Alta HR, but it can be very irritating to have these syncing issues. I constantly need to restart my Fitbit Versa and my phone (a Sony Xperia XZ Premium) and turn my phone's bluetooth on and off just to sync my data. I will not be returning it though as it is not worth the hassle of returning this watch from Bermuda.
 Update: Notifications are now working. I hope the problem is truely resolved because I do like this gadget.<br/><br/>Notifications are not working. I love the look, the feel in my wrist, and the overall Fitbit experience. However, a huge part of this device is notifications and no matter how much troubleshooting, they don’t work.
 * Music controls do not work, official troubleshooting steps do not make them work. They have been broken for months and I have little confidence they will be updated/fixed at this point.<br/>* Sensors work but data tracking is inconsistent and wonky. Watch thinks I climbed 6 flights of stairs one night while sleeping. Another night I woke up to several thousand steps. I understand difficulty training the sensitivity of hardware sensors and I don't expect it to work perfectly every time, however they are often orders of magnitude off and count everything, including driving. Step/sleep tracking is something that already exists, why not turn those sensors off if I'm not walking or if I'm sleeping? That would go a long way to fixing the problem. For driving, Fitbit recommends you negate them by logging a driving activity. First, I would have to do it every day to log my commute and I already spend too much time fighting with this watch; secondly it logs it as an exercise activity which counts toward your exercise goal. So the workaround introduces more work and adds another problem.<br/>* No intelligent alarm feature. Sleep tracking is one of the only things that is actually pretty great so this is increasingly annoying. I have a kid now, work with me. Fitbit asks us to request the feature, I and others have done so; but I"m not holding my breath.<br/><br/>The worst part? All of the above worked great with my cheap Pebble Time Round. I've had 2 Pebbles and never had these kinds of issues. I had hoped that Fitbit buying Pebble would bring some consistency to their experience, but so far it's been consistently bad. I'm selling my Versa (maybe iPhone users have a better time) and getting a Garmin. Incredibly disappointed.<br/><br/>As an aside, the food tracker needs some improvement as well. It's ok, but it needs the ability to save meal compositions; in other words, let me group ingredients into dishes I consume frequently rather than trying to figure out the count for a custom food item. Also it needs to keep a longer history in the app, more than once I've had a frozen item for lunch that I came back to later and can no longer find in any of the lists. If I remember the brand/title it's not so bad but I tend to buy from several different grocery stores. A few weeks later and I can't recall if the generic-looking frozen chicken I'm packing my lunch with came from Target or Smiths; and of course I no longer have the barcode. Never mind the difficulty with actually using the app, well over half the time I'm typing something in to look it up only to have the entire page refresh and what I entered wiped out.
 Don’t buy this Fitbit because the battery is only 6 hours and you have to charge the watch EVERY day min twice. Worst experience ever and extremely disappointing
 Fyi doesn't sync with Samsung Galaxy s9! Will be returning!
 It doesn’t count steps as good as the blaze or Apple I watch. Battery life is good but unit isn’t that user-friendly
 Uncomfortable and lacks functionality. A glorified heart rate monitor that doesn’t even do that accurately. FitBit also has trash customer service. Don’t bother - buy a similar product from a better company and you’ll be happier in the long run.
 Not impressed so far. I just upgraded to the versa from the HR2 because I wanted the pay option and the music. First off I found out it does not sync with my Amazon Music account so I had to switch to Pandora Premium.  Second none of the app choices will load on the fitbit app itself. Third, it will not sync with my wireless headphones.  And Finally I didn't realize you had to purchase the special edition watches if you want the pay option. The only difference so far is the quality of graphics and the size of the screen. Thinking of returning and going back to my HR.
 Least - navigation and display on and off.
 It tracks randomly hand movements. When i just sit in the car it adds up steps.I use my hands a lot at work (deal blackjack) and therefore at the end of the day i am at 15000 steps for the day. And also it randomly shuts down completely.Gonna return it.
 Worked for about two weeks. I have had this watch a whole month. It no longer holds a charge over 9 hours, and the screen is fritzing out and flashing white lines through it. And of course I cant take it fitbit because they dont warranty anything sold on Amazon. Product is crap. And if you do get one that works, make sure you get it from fitbitl
 Very in happy with it. The steps are way off. Like 800 steps off. Called for help followed Fitbit recommendations with no success. Called several times. My case number is 25040651. I want to send back and refund. Very frustrated
 This Fitbit is actually worse than Apple Watch in terms of heart rate tracking during intense interval training. I was very surprised that a device designed specifically for sports tracking was so inaccurate—actually dangerously inaccurate. There are class action lawsuits over this. Buyer beware. Back it goes to Amazon.<br/><br/>Also, a quick word about the music features— in a word: disaster. The transfer process takes forever for just one song—that is if you can get the desktop app to even connect to the watch at all. Honestly, I feel like I’m in the 90s with the first MP3 player ever (Diamond Rio you’re that old). Actually, it’s far worse than the Rio because it just doesn’t work half the time. I have never seen such poor, non-intuitive software. Too bad Apple can’t get it right either, but at least the Apple Watch interface makes sense. The Fitbit Versa is as if people who never designed hardware and software before just threw spaghetti on the wall to see where the buttons and interface might stick. Seriously, pull this diasaster off the market and work on the software guys. It’s embarrassing.
 This is the second one I got after fitbit made me run through hoops to show that their battery was draining exceptionally fast (won't make it through 12 hours before shutdown).  I set up the second one this morning after being on the cradle charger for 12 hours (they say you must charge for three hours even though after 1 it claims 100%).  After 30 minutes of being on my wife's wrist it already is down to 70%.  Now I was within the return window before I got the replacement but now I'm out of it and stuck with continually sending back fitbit versas to Fitbit.  Don't buy this one.  I have a charge 2 that's been working perfectly for the same amount of time (1 month, so I guess it could die soon too).  But this one just has terrible quality control issues.  I'd love to just send it back to Amazon but I probably won't get my money back now.  Too bad I got a bunch of accessories too.
 Hate this fitbit! This is my 4th fitbit. I upgraded to the Versa from the Blaze because pf the new features and apps. If you are a person that likes to change the straps often, this is not the fitbit for you. Horrible strap/pin design makes this almost impossible.
 Logged steps while I was driving.. everything else was fine fit comfort etc.  I cant trust it it was added steps I wasnt walking  that makes the calories off as well.. One Job Versa!
 Pros:<br/>Cheap. $200 is a steal for a smartwatch that has a battery lasts a couple of days.<br/>Comfortable on the wrist. Comes with 2 straps.<br/>Light - lighter weight than the $300 one.<br/>Easy to setup<br/>Fitbit gives you the option of learning how to develop your own<br/>I can slightly check messages and emails.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Clock Face apps are stupid. Fitbit has managed to let 3rd parties in to look at your personal information to sell you clock faces. The default clock faces must be intentionally hideous. Layering numbers on top of each other instead of displaying the 4 digit digital time. No designer is that daft.<br/>No microphone or speaker &gt;:(<br/>Screen refresh is less than 10fps, which is jarring on the eye and makes it feel cheap as you use it.<br/>UX is horrible, swiping in directions to see certain things, and buttons not intuitive.  &gt;:(<br/>ENCRYPTION IS OFF BY DEFAULT! TURN IT ON.<br/>There's no compass :(. They don't even have a bearing available, which is totally possibly because they're constantly using my GPS sensor.<br/>Same topic, the GPS connection notification is ALWAYS ON, from my phone, so the watch must be continually polling my GPS sensor wasting resources, and indicative of wasteful code, and there's no way to control it but to disable the permission, but once you disable the location permission, the fitbit app refuses to sync ANY DATA to the app, because apparently they need to know your location in order just to sync data! What a joke!<br/><br/>A regular fitbit is a better fitbit. A real smartwatch is a better smartwatch. I moved up from a fitbit Charge 2, and the charge
 LOVED the Fitbit.<br/>HATED that it’s already broken in less than 8 weeks! Fitbits customer support has been a nightmare. Recommended this product to 10 friends and family who have recently ordered since we purchased this, yet I’m left with a BROKEN FITBIT.
 Bands are a pain<br/>Not a lot of apps<br/>Lightweight<br/>I put it under water and it started glitching<br/><br/>I had owned 2 Fitbits before, the first one broke and they replaced it. Then a few months later that one broke (HR2) I tried a third time and bought a (Versa) - 👎🏽
 This would be a five star if it connected better with my phone.  It has taken half hour or more to get it to sync.  Sometimes not then.  It's set to be constant,  if only it did.  No notifications coming through.  Changing the band is doable but not near as easy as my other fitbits.<br/>Positives.  Very light and comfortable. I really like some of the watch faces. Nice looking. It would be nice if you could switch between them without going back to redownloading.  I'm happy with the apps.  The sleep monitor on the fitbits is really detailed,  if and when you can getit to sync.  It would be nice if you could access it directly on the watch.  I'm wearng it now but will probably go back to my gear.  I have other fitbits,  syncing is a problem on all of them,  had hoped this this one would be better.
 This was my first Fitbit and I wish it provided accurate data. HR was all over the place. When I am on treadmill going all out it shows my heart rate as 113, which is impossible, and my real HR is close to 170.  I also got thousands of extra steps with only hand movements or driving. With all those ghost steps I burnt a lot of calories.. 600 in 2 hours to be exact. Someone who is sitting doing nothing burns about 60 calories per hour, a person with a desk job may burn a whopping 170 calories! I managed to burn 600 of them cooking dinner.  Setting the watch for a dominant hand did not help. Customer support suggested to log an activity as Driving to negate ghost steps. Supposedly, steps, floors, and calories burned should decrease for the time period specified but nothing changed. And if it did, I'd have to note when the watch started miscounting the steps, for how long and log it every single time as driving. What a pain! I don't know if these are Versa bugs or previous Fitbit trackers worked the same, and I should not worry about this glitches, but I kinda hoped for a somewhat accurate stats without extra work. So I am returning this watch and will look for smith else.
 There was an issue with receiving email and text notifications. I tried to troubleshoot to no avail. I went back to the Blaze.
 Needs more apps
 Worst Fitbit I have ever own. I think they released it before they had worked out all the bugs
 I recommend taking $200 and flushing it down the toilet as a more beneficial use of money. I've owned this product for 90 days, and it is a near-daily occurrence that it loses its sync/Bluetooth connection with my Google Pixel phone. I use plenty of other BT devices without ever having an issue. I have contacted Fitbit support on a weekly basis, and they run me through the same steps of reconnecting, or factory resetting the device. Each time within a day or two the same issue resurfaces. They won't help me fix it, I'm past a point of being able to return it, so I'm just doing my duty to let you all know that you would be wasting your time and money to purchase it.
 Seems good
 This is my first Fitbit. That being said, I’m disappointed that so far (5 days) it doesn’t do all the things I thought it would.  It cannot show me sleep stages, I cannot get it to work with my Peloton, it doesn’t partner with MyFitnessPal and so on.<br/>I do like how it fits, the look and the quality of the screen display.<br/>I think it’s average.
 It worked really good for the first couple weeks, then would not sync so I returned it got another one. I am having the same issue again, it wont sync with my phone. Of course now I am outside my window of returning. I would not recommend this product
 I liked that it can be worn in the pool.
 Got this for my wife as a mother's day gift  and already having problems with it. The screen went out and the watch no longer turns on or charges. Very disappointed!!!
 The Versa is what I wanted EXCEPT that for some reason, this Versa does not have the chip to take payments!
 The messaging doesn’t work correctly only 10% of the instant messages show up
 Never connected and can't tell how to return to Amazon Worst experience I've had with anything I've ever purchased in my 59 years of life.
 Pathetic battery life even not lasting for two days
 On wrong time zone n no instructions to fix. Won’t sync w Aria
 I've had this for two days now, it is not my first fitbit product, I've not been able to get the apps to work, can't track my sleep, can't set up the silent alarms.  It is very disappointing I will give it another day and will be returning it.  My HR is kind of old and it is not holding the battery charge for long anymore that is why I bought this.  I guess I will go back to my old HR.
 This watch (and as it turns out, other Fitbit watches as well), doesn't support Unicode in messages. This means that it can't handle any language that isn't English. If notifications from messaging apps are an important feature to you, and you live in a country where English isn't the native language, this watch will be useless to you. I'm returning mine.
 Does not hold a charge more than two days. Very disappointed in the product. Would like to return. Troubleshooting did not help the issue. Miss my Garmin watch.
 There sure is a lot of hype about the Versa! I believe it's unfounded.<br/><br/>I have a Charge 2, which I mostly like. My biggest issue with the Charge 2 isn't the actual watch, but the Android Fitbit app. The app has difficulty consistently syncing with the watch.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of a waterproof and WIFI capable Versa. I was hoping that the WIFI would remove the phone as the "middle-man" for synching with fitibit.com. It turns out that the Versa doesn't sync over WIFI. It uses WIFI to download updates and sync apps. The Versa still uses a Bluetooth connection with a smartphone to sync with fitibit.com. Also, syncing up Pandora failed multiple times. I played with it for about an hour and decided that it wasn't worth the $200 considering my charge 2 is in fine working order.
 I was super excited to get this fitbit... I received it in the mail today, I came home and put it on the charger for over an hour and it was almost fully charged.. I started trying to sync it to my Samsung phone and update it and it won't work.... why should I have to update something that was just released?? Now it is not charging at all, the battery dies as soon as I take it off the charger. I'm not getting anywhere with this thing. I'm going to charge it all night and try it again in the morning. If that doesn't work I will be sending it back..<br/>Well after leaving it on the charger all night it won't turn on when i take it off the charger, it will turn on if it is on the charger but has 1 bar charged and the battery symbol at the top shows it's charging... I tried to reset it and nothing. I am sending it back for a replacement, hopefully this one was defective and the next one works for me with no problem. The only good thing i can say is thanks to Amazon my replacement will be in tomorrow.
 Wish you could respond to text
 Haven’t figured out how to listen to music on it. It’s Bluetooth to my iPhone
 Lots of issues out of the box - will be returning. Heart rate monitor does not function, I get notifications for phone calls but not texts and now my steps aren’t being counted correctly.  Fitbit forum is filled with others having similar issues.
 I went through two of these because I really wanted it to work. After about 2 days each one lost their connection. Such a shame, the design is great but the software is junk.
 I don't like that I can't change the face of my watch too show pictures. I also don't like that I can receive text messages on my watch.
 At first this watch was exactly what I was looking for. HR monitor, long battery life compared to apple watch, connected app on smartphone, waterproof, cheaper than similar style watches. It worked great and I enjoyed it for about a month, until I broke my phone (galaxy s7.) So I searched a bit and found a good, inexpensive replacement phone (Honor 7X.) Much to my surprise when I tried to sync the app and watch it doesn't work. The app installs fine on the phone. The phone has all the required hardware and works with every other bluetooth device I use regularly, but for some reason Fitbit doesn't want to support this phone.<br/>I understand that I could or should have looked on fitbit's site and searched their compatibility list before purchasing this phone. However, it's 2018! All android phones are pretty decent now and have very similar features; there is no reason that Fitbit shouldn't support them. If they supported this, and many other popular phones, I would give it a 4-5 star review.

Not impressed for 200.00 dollars and only three weeks. I did call fit bit and after three times of calling them back and trying all their suggestions Their sending me a new one.<br/>I really like the watch until the screen started doing this today. I love the fit as I have a small wrist. The workout features work great. I'm definitely not someone that works out extreme. It has all I need. Love that I can swim with it and it counts my laps. Hopefully the new one will won't have the same problem with the screen.
 I have been a Fitbit user for years. Upgraded from Blaze because I liked some of the new features of the Versa.  Within a few days, the battery was barely lasting 24 hrs.  Went online and LOTS of us had the same battery issue.  I did everything support says - stopped syncing/notifications, you name it. Still only held 1 day charge at best. Contacted Fitibit support, they are replacing my unit. Their return label will take 1-2 weeks just to return to them, probably another week or two to send me a new unit. Most likely I won't have use of a watch for 3-4 weeks.  SO SORRY I gave away my Blaze!
 I was so excited to buy this watch I had waited so long for a new looking Fitbit so when I read it would be released in April I pre-ordered it! When I got it I had a bit of difficulty getting it set up. Unlike all my other Fitbit's there was a bit of a struggle it  would just time out! The watch face it pretty big much bigger than the 42 CM Apple Watch. I have a small wrist so I used the small band but the strap kept sticking out! My 2nd day wearing it the band came loose on my hand and fell off luckily I found it. I did not really like all the watch faces some were so much blinking and so crammed together it was hard to see anything on the watch face. I found only 2 that had Date, HR, Time, Steps And Temp. that I liked. But the Temp kept going off so I would have to keep re-installing my whole watch again. There were a few watch faces that were cute but you had to buy those. Then to change the band was such a HASSLE! I tried for hours and even my husband and then to put on a new band it was the same big struggle again. Finally we noticed that the little screw in there on the Versa was bent!! So after all of that I had to return it! I love Fitbit and have had them all! So for now I will stick to the Blaze or Charge 2!!! These are so much easier to change bands and to use!! Just wish they had newer watch faces for the Blaze!!
 I really really wanted to love this, but the HR monitor stopped working after 3 days. I’ve restarted and reset the watch. Nothing works. It also only registers my sleeping maybe half the time. My Charge 2 did both for 4 years straight without the issue, though the HR monitor seemed closer to accurate before it stopped working on the Versa. Lastly, the watch forces you to click through an entire screen dedicated to informing you of the percentage charge you have left before you can even check the time. Really disappointing purchase so far.
 For people who’s live active life to have this watch is necessary
 Terrible..... could not get it to work.
 Does everything except receive notifications from my phone. Ready to send it back.  I've tried everything.
 Love it, but Apps are limited.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3FCLE9CLE4HUU"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1tSyk5qrVS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DIBp6YXyS.png"/> I put it on the charger after only 3 weeks of use and now it will not turn on, even after contacting the company and trying a hard reboot.  I loved having it when it worked but poor customer support and non-working, very expensive item, make for a 1 star review.
 Sleep function doesn’t work. Won’t connect to phone. Customer service from Fitbit has had me restart my phone and watch multiple times over multiple days expecting different results. Spare yourself the pain and don’t waste your money on a bad product.
 Not compatible with my Google Pixel 2 XL. After a frustrating night of trying to set it up and going through all of the troubleshooting procedures and then finally I talked to Fitbit customer service and they told me that my phone was incompatible. Very frustrating and disappointing. Wish I would've known before purchase but I'll have to return it. Have had a good experience with Fitbit before as I've purchased the Charge 2 as gifts for family members and they love them and have had no problems. I'm sure that the Versa is a good device (with nearly every other smartphone) but I have to give it one star for not being compatible with Google's flagship phone.
 Returned this watch after receiving it a few days ago. Functionally it was great and lightweight and stylish however the face becomes easily scratched by the slightest contact with another surface. Cannot wear it with bracelets on the same arm at all.<br/><br/>Once scratch (not crack) came when I was playing with the kids and brushed my arm against the wall running down the hall in my house. I can't imagine wearing this as a fitness watch if you're going to go out and do exercise like biking or trail running or anywhere you might hit your wrist on your surroundings. I also have a Samsung Gear 3 and I've never had the face show a scratch at all so I feel this must be a flow of the face being so exposed without a bezel.<br/><br/>Fortunately Amazon was awesome and refunded my money.  After some research I found that there are screen protectors you can buy on Amazon and I would definitely recommend it. I'll be watching reviews of the screen protectors, if they seem to work, I'd consider purchasing the watch again but not without something on the screen.
 I had a Fitbit surge device for three years, I was impressed because right out of the box I was able to set it up, pair it to cell phone and computer no problem and no calls. After about a year, the band separated from the tracker display; I was able to used super glue and repair but now it just can’t be fixed, so it’s time for a new device. I decided on a Versa smartwatch. So far it been over two hours and five calls to (877) 623 4997 and the device still does not work. I have no idea if is going to work or not. Sorry Amazon, but it may be returned. Warning the technology is not mature, not user friendly, and the support team is uninformed.  It sucks, because for the price, I should not be disappointed.
 I have had a Fitbit a few years ago (mid-range model - can't remember the name) and returned it because they did not fill my needs and I thought it was inaccurate.  Went through a few fitness trackers before coming across the Samsung Gear Fit Pro.  I got it for free when getting my S7 Edge in August of 2016.  Loved the watch.  Did everything I could think of for me.  App was good, not great.  But unfortunately after a couple years of hard work, it started to fail on me.  This is what I base my review on, by comparing the Samsung and the Fitbit Versa.  When the Samsung started to go, I started looking at what was out there and what was coming down the pipe.  Found the Versa.  Read great pre-release reviews of it.  Saw several mentions of the "Apple Watch Killer".  Never owned an apple watch or know the features of one, but after owning the Versa for a few days, I highly doubt that statement.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>- Good looking watch.  Fancier looking then the Samsung.<br/>- Nice display and easy to ready<br/>- App is even better from the first time I used it.<br/>- User friendly, which should be a given.<br/>- Battery life.  After 2 days of wearing it and 2 workouts, I am at about 65% battery.<br/><br/>What I don't like compared to the Samsung:<br/>- I get text and phone notifications with the Versa.  Nice, but the Samsung, I could do quick replies to the text from watch.  Not the case here.  Samsung also seemed to "read" the text I got and based the answers on the text.  Ex.  If there was an LOL in the text.  The first couple replies would be hahaha or LOL.<br/>- I could answer my phone from the Samsung if I had headphones on or a Bluetooth enabled device ( Ex. headphones, Car)  Not the case with the Versa.<br/>- I could also deny phone calls from the Samsung.<br/>- A lot easier to start tracking my workouts with the Samsung.  Setup a button, if pressed twice it would start monitoring the workout type I want.  Versa, I have to slide to the left, select exercise, select the workout I want to track (Weights, treadmill, elliptical, etc), select that, hit start.<br/>- I would get a notification on the Samsung if it could not communicate with the phone.  Saved me quite a few times.  Like getting in the car and backing up to go to work.  Notification would let me know phone wasn't in range, meaning I didn't have it on me.<br/><br/>I am kind of on the fence if I am going to keep the Versa.  After writing the review, I think I am leaning towards returning it.  Samsung does a lot more in my book and costs a lot less.  The big issue I had with the Samsung was the way the watch band attached to the watch itself.  It was plastic and after almost 2 years of wearing it in the gym 5-6 days a week, the plastic deteriorated and I could not get a band to stay on.  I hope this was resolved in the Gear Fit Pro 2.
 Excellent everyday and active lifestyle heart rate monitor. Good step tracker and watch combination. Good sleep tracker. Good price point and excellent battery Life.<br/>Does not play well with other apps outside of the fibbing environment. Does not share data with Apple Health app. Music app requires computer transfer. Water and food tracking occur through the phone app only.
 The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the device is generally good. That being said, the company is insufferable. Their servers are down for several hours now and a brand new $250 watch right out the box can't load the watch face after setup, with no way to factory reset. It's basically unusable. The company is unresponsive. Terrible, terrible experience after spending this amount and waiting several days for the backordered "Special Fail Edition"
 Absolutely love this new Versa. I got the Lavender/Rose Gold edition and I love that it has the chic appearance of an apple but has the functionality of a Fitbit. For me, I prioritize the activity tracking more than being able to text or call on a watch. This watch allows me to see notifications, tap to pay, pay for Starbucks, compete with friends throughout the week, and also leads me in workouts through Fitibt Coach.<br/><br/>My previous watch was the Fitbit Charge 2. I loved the transition and think it's totally worth it to promote yourself to a Versa if you already have a Fitbit. The Versa has alarm functionality and the ability to download various apps. It is lightweight and very stylish, and even seems to have a lower profile than the Charge 2, which seemed to jut out a bit more on my wrist.<br/><br/>Yes, it's WATERPROOF.  I even SHOWERED with it last night and it still works perfectly. Not having to take off your watch when you shower is GOLDEN.<br/><br/>Regarding the BATTERY. For me, the battery has met expectations and charging it is very easy because you don't have to take off the band.<br/>The directions recommend to charge the Versa right when you pull it out of the box so that it can last through the software update. But, my battery appeared to be around 50% so I DID NOT charge it, as suggested. I have heard that on your first charge, you want your device to completely die before charging and then completely charge when you charge it. So this is what I did. I let it die and then charged it fully on Friday morning. Today is Tuesday morning, so that is exactly 4 days and it is currently at 17% battery. I am very pleased with that battery life.<br/><br/>The only slight negative so far is that I have to wear it one notch tighter than I'd like because I got the Lavender edition, which has material that is not grippy so it twists slightly on my wrist unless I tighten it. I don't mind tightening, it doesn't make it uncomfortable, I just would prefer one notch less. However, I believe using the standard band (which was included!) that is more silicone like would solve that issue because it's more grippy.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great investment and I get compliments on it.
 I had really high hopes for the Versa and felt as if I’d done significant research prior to buying.<br/>The biggest flaw in my opinion is the step count. It’s perpetually inaccurate and completely outweighs all of the pros. When I wake up each morning I already have 30-36 steps logged. I could turn my device off at night, but then I wouldn’t be able to utilize the sleep tracker. In addition to my sleep steps I’m taking, I’m certain it’s also tracking a significant amount of steps while I’m in my vehicle. As a result I do shut it off during any amount of time within the vehicle.<br/>I researched others that had similar issues and was prompted to manually adjust my step stride within settings. I did so and noticed a mild difference, but still somehow managed to walk 36 steps in my sleep just this past evening.<br/>I hope this flaw is fixed, if so I would definitely redo my review. Until then, I remain incredibly disappointed with a product which is solely known on tracking steps.<br/><br/>**Update 17JUN18**<br/>I decided to call it quits and return this product. I just spent 15 days camping with friends, one of which has an Apple Watch. Although hands down the battery lasts much longer, the features just do not compare. The most discouraging part of this watch as I mentioned in my initial review is the step count. My friend and I sat by the fire and I somehow managed to rack up 47 points throughout the course of an hour without even getting up. Moving on to the Apple Watch!
 Really liked watch but didn't sync to my phone after numberous trys.
 Just bought it and already having problems. It’s glitchy and the screen won’t even come in when I turn my wrist to see the time. Definitely regret buying it.
 can't read Arabic notification .
 I received my new Versa today and I am so disappointed. The only instructions were for using the straps and the charger. For the device and app, it just said to download the app. If the install would have worked, that might have been fine. I spent a full 8 hours trying to get this watch to sync with my Iphone or Windows 10 computer, 1 at a time of course. Customer support was very nice but made me repeat all the steps I had already tried from their support web site over and over. After 2 hours on the phone, they decided that restarting my phone was going to fix the problem. That meant we had to end the call and then the restart still did solve the issue, it got hung up on the screen where you enter the 4 digit code again and would never move forward.<br/><br/>It is so frustrating to receive a new product that doesn't work. It's extremely frustrating that I had to waste my entire day on a $200 product that should have been plug and play. They never offered to replace the Versa, even after I pointed out a few times that I shouldn't be the one spending my time fixing this watch that I had just purchased. I'll get my money back when I return it but I'll never get that time back and I still don't have a product that works.
 Waste of $200.  Bought Fit Bit Versa May 25th stated using early June.  Within a few weeks the screen cracked and Fit bit will not replace.  They do not stand behind their less than 2 month old product, what a joke.  Will not purchase anything from them again
 For $200 it should come with a manual.......in English! I shouldn't have to go online and spend 20 mins searching for a manual to figure out how to turn off the exercise app.
 Brand new out of the box doesn't charge. Called Customer Service and it is a wildly known Issue, Wish I never bought this $200 piece of Junk!
 Want to start off by saying....SAVE YOUR MONEY. This fitbit is 100% NOT accurate. I have had it for 3 days, and have found it is horrible at tracking your steps accurately. On day 2, I thought something was "off" so I tested it out. I COUNTED my steps against what the fitbit was reporting. I would take 50 steps, counted out and the fitbit was recording it as closer to 100 then OVER 100, and the third time. about 70 steps.<br/><br/>Today, while sitting on the couch, I was giving my cat a vigorous petting, and happened to have the fitbit app open on my phone. I sat there WATCHING the number of steps increase (my butt is planted on the sofa). According to Fitbit, I walked about 200 steps in the span of a few minutes petting the cat.<br/><br/>What else is the fitbit not accurately reporting? I have zero faith in this thing....
 The Versa worked as described for about a week. I was getting message, call and other notifications. I chose a great watchface that provided all the info I needed. Then I went out for a bike ride...and all info went blank, including the time...then I didn't get any notifications. I have not been able to connect to my Samsung Note anymore. I went to the forum and apparently many others noted the same problem. Apparently there was a software update that might have caused the problems. Fit bit support is useless. I'm thinking of returning this product even after purchasing new band and face protector. Very disappointed. It does count steps, water drink count, and bpm,  but I wanted notifications as well.
 Overall good quality but it often has trouble syncing with my phone. And I haven’t been able to get it to connect to WiFi at all
 Was difficult to use and didn't pare well with my Samsung s8. Also big and bulky
 Refuses to pair.  Then refuses firmware updates.  Then refuses to sync.
 The watch is attractive but does not function properly. You need to turn off most of the features to achieve reasonable battery life. The connection with my phone has also been unreliable and updating hit or miss. I wish I would have saved my money.
 It won't sync.
 EDIT:<br/><br/>I’ve reduced the review from two stars to one star. See final con for why.<br/><br/>Looks a bit prettier and is less clunky  than the Ionic but in my opinion it functions only half as well.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-Battery life is noticeably shortened vs. the Ionic. I'd say its close to a 36hrs less. The inside mic would give me 5 days of life. The versa seems to die around day 3.<br/><br/>-Data is very very inaccurate. It counts steps for almost any movement. I work an office job. I typically had less than 4,000 steps on an average day when measured on my Ionic. The Versa is counting like I said, almost every movement. In fact, my step counter just went off as I type this review. Its horribly inaccurate. 6,000 steps as of 3pm, completely incorrect.<br/><br/>-Setting it up is a nightmare. The Wi-Fi issues with past Fitbit persists in the Versa, arguably even worse this time around. The Versa would not recognize any Wi-Fi networks aside from my home network. Even when it found my home network, it gave me an error message every time I tried to connect. It took 3 days of repeatedly forcing it to connect to my home network before it finally decided to do its job.<br/><br/>-Not a very big deal, but when piled onto the rest of the issues I mentioned, it starts to add up. The clock face selection is very limited and almost all of them are useless aside from attempting to look...good? Idk. What I do know is the Ionic had superior faces with superior stats/data. Even the default Ionic face beats the default Versa face by miles in terms of data and looks. Could be the new OS, but thats a lame excuse when Fitbit has an entire app dev team at their disposal.<br/><br/>-No idea why, but when recording data while set to "Run", the Versa pauses my exercise once every 30 seconds. Maybe its a default setting or something, but I could not find why this is happening. Only happens when set to Run. Weights worked just fine.<br/><br/>-The versa will record every rep of the weight you lift as a step or even multiple steps. This makes it so that the number of calories shown after finishing a workout is completely unreliable because it’s adding hundreds of steps worth of burned calories that you didn’t actually take. Went to the gym with 700 steps this morning. I did chest and shoulders for a little over an hour. The versa recorded 4,000 steps by the time I left. So it recorded about 3,300 steps I didn’t actually take since all the weights are in close proximity.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Looks like an Apple Watch. Albeit, a very cheap plastic toy looking Apple Watch.<br/><br/>-Cheap<br/><br/>I recommend pretty much any other iteration of Fitbit over this one. Very underwhelming and disappointing. A step backward.
 I bought the Fitbit for my wife. She feels it's too complicated to use. She is computer literate-she uses one for her job.We're still trying to get to first base with it. Our next move is probably the help desk.
 Battery life not as strong as promised
 Awful! Worked for two weeks, now it won’t sync or connect to my phone. Somebody should go to jail for this!
 I purchased this product just for the battery. It constantly dies and doesn't work.  That's the primary selling point.  Very disappointed.
 Screen size is awesome.<br/>Had it for 2 days and started off with problems. Technical support unable to fix issue. Was not syncing my notifications to my watch. Was bummed out that I had to return.
 I’m sure the versa is great. Tried to remove the band to see how that process worked and could not get the band back on the watch. The engineering of the band is TRASH. Who approved such a flawed system of attaching bands?
 This item was defective when opened, and did not turn on.
 Worked fine the first day, but will not sync to my phone anymore.
 PRODUCT IS USEFUL BUT THE ASSESSORIES TO WEAR WITH i.e. the strap lock with the product is connected with a pin. this is the most foolish thing appeared with the design of the product. pin touches your hand some time unlock the strap from the watch. I would not suggest anybody to buy this.  I have alta, iconic Adidas edition also. everything was perfect so I bought this to gift it to my brother.<br/>but useless. it is .....<br/>fitbit should see it
 I purchased this watch with the idea of helping me take care of myself not to share my information and photos with all of the other fitbit users but that is what is required if you want to use this product.  they want access to all of my information photos, contacts, all of the information on my phone even including messages, calls and history.  With all the problems with identity theft why would anyone allow some company that has no right to even ask for it access to this kind of information.  It is not worth a silly watch to give up all my information, I'll do without the watch.
 After having the watch for less than 24 hours and I am disappointed. I bought my wife and I each one of these hoping to replace the Pebble Times we had, but after having to be on chat support to get the device barely working I am ready to return it.<br/><br/>Issues so far<br/>1) will not stay connected to my phone via bluetooth<br/>2) cannot get notifications(even after trying all the "solutions" on the fitbit forums)<br/>3) it will not connect to wifi<br/>4) interface on the watch is very clunky
 Not impressed at all. I loved the surge. My battery has not lasted a whole day. You have to work to get the clock to slide up to read the stats not as easy to view as the surge. Sending mine back.  They were more focused on making it like an Apple Watch they missed the focus on making it great for people to are focused on fitness information. Time to look for a better watch to track my steps, miles run. Oh and you have to buy a face clock and The options for the clock are terrible. You can see a quick glance at anything. Disappointed
 Cannot believe that fitbit actually release this product to the public. After 2 weeks of fighting with the bluetooth syn to my phone it is being returned. There are hundreds of similar posts on the web from other new Versa owners. Poor product development.
 This Fitbit does not track while pushing a cart or a stroller. For a busy mom with 2 toddlers, this is pretty disappointing. I upgraded from a Fitbit flex and this devide does not warrant the $200 price. Customer service suggested wearing it on my knee if I cared about steps and heart rate so much. Pretty disappointed. The color of the watch is beautiful and so far the battery life seems to be about 3 full days, rather than the 4+ advertised.
 Do not  buy!!! Charged it and went through the setup, the next day the watch worked great....day 2..watch would not sync at all. Went through every option to try and get it to sync to no avail. Fitbit needs to work the bugs out before releasing a new product to sell. Very disappointed!!!
 Purchased this for my 13 y.o. daughter as a birthday gift (her request). She was super excited to receive and start using - she immediately started tracking her steps, using the 2 minute breathing exercises and tracking her sleep.  However, she has spent several hours to get the installation sync on her iPhone.  We consulted the internet to figure out what we were doing wrong - that lead to a thread on the Fitbit community (fitbit website), and found out that dozens of people are unable to connect, as we were.  Fitbit tech unable to help.  Returning this smartwatch.  Hoping Fitbit will fix or come up with a fix.  Will wait until that happens to re-purchase, if we even do so.
 I thought I was going to like the new Versa, however what a pile of junk.  Really liked the ease right out of the box.. three days after unboxing and only one charge.... screen stops working.  Constantly vibrates but does not doing anything. Do not buy the new Fitbit until they fix.  Apparently trying to be a smart watch and a fitness tracker was too much!
 Works very well as a fitness tracker, so-so as a smart watch. It needs big improvement with notifications.
 This has been a nightmare to set up, Very disappointed with this item and am thinking about returning it
 I opened the box and everything looked great! After I set everything up though, i started to get disappointed. The designs of the app logos and just the general setup are so juvenile looking. I am returning and looking into an Apple Watch instead.
 Changing my review from 1/5 to 3/5. If we were being really accurate I'd be giving it a 5/10<br/><br/>Great watch, great features. DEFINITELY a lot of cons<br/><br/>Wasn't working straight out of the box. Took 12-24 hrs for the CLOCK feature to start working. Yes, the MAIN feature of a WATCH wasn't working for the first 12 hours of me having it<br/>The battery life is AWFUL. I have to charge it less than every 24hrs and it generally dies while I'm sleeping, and sleep tracking is my main reason for owning a Fitbit.<br/>I understand it has a different display so it needs to be charged more often than the Fitbit Charge 2, but this is frankly ridiculous. I shouldn't have to charge it more than once a day.
 This Fitbit would not reset it's step count. I tried everything could not get it to reset. I sent back for a refund.
 Although the watch seems to be great, it needs to be said the support is severely lacking. The FitBit site shows a lack of support for many of the major flagships out today; neither the Samsung Galaxy S8/S9, LG V30/G6, or the Pixel 2 series are supported. I wanted to use, and enjoy, the watch, but without proper support I cannot even install the app, let alone detect/track my activity. Truly disappointed. Will be actively searching for a Wear OS watch to replace FitBit.
 After 2 months of wear it broke, the screen went black and wouldn't start back up.  Fitbit is sending me a replacement, but I don't have high hops.<br/><br/>The Versa will not connect to 5g wireless.  If you are having this issue, turn off the 5g and only allow your 2.4g to be on, then the versa will connect.  But unless you know about wireless networking you're never going to figure this out.<br/><br/>I would NEVER buy this product again.
 After having my first one replaced for the heart rate sensor not working....the replacement had the same issue. Fitbit support is a joke. I'll stick with my blaze.
 I ordered one charcoal band, and one lavender one. They sent two charcoal. Mostly irritated at this; If you say you're going to sell me something, send me the correct item!<br/><br/>I've had this a little over a week now, and I like the device itself. It is comfortable, once my wrist got used to having something on it all the time. I do *love* the waterproof aspect of it.<br/> The battery hasn't lasted me or my spouse 4 days, though. We charge it every day, day and a half. I don't even turn on the screen and fiddle with it all that often.<br/><br/>My watch broke three months ago, and I sent it back in. I'm still waiting for any sort of word on the status on it.
 I loved it until I realized the data was inaccurate.  It says I did 9 floors of stairs today.  I haven’t done one.  It’s also adding steps while I’m driving.  This is too much money to pay for something to glitch so badly.  Other reviewers on Amazon have reported the same thing; so have people on Fitbit’s online community.  Fitbit needs to fix it.  :(
 So I have been using the Versa for a month now and it works fine in all categories, it is a bit laggy/sluggish but nothing to annoying.<br/><br/>However, the annoying part is the HR tracking. I am not a fitness person but I like to exercise 3-5 times a week for 30-90 minutes. I do HIIT and hiking and this watch sucks for both. For some odd reason every time I pick up the intensity during any exercise my HR will go from 130/140 to 105 which is silly since it should be going up not down. Every time I go up hill hiking my heart rate drops, it will track my HR correctly while walking but when the intensity goes up from going up hill it suddenly drops. I checked my HR against my phone and a chest strap HR and both would read 160-170 but the versa will read 105. I contacted Fitbit and tried to fix it with three troubleshooting techniques but after the last one (factory reset) did not work I gave up and returned it.<br/><br/>I really liked this watch because it was sleek, stylist, and did a decent drop of being a smartwatch. I also love the FitBit app and wanted to continue utilizing it, however now I cannot. I wanted to try the Ionic but I am afraid that one has just as many problems if not more....
 this is my second Fitbit watch and i am in love! I started off the the blaze and while i enjoyed it, it was a bit bulky for my small wrist. This is what i have been waiting for. Its smaller and there are quite a few advancements from the blaze. Very satisfied.
 Watch looks great, and seems to do a good job tracking exercise. However, changing time zones is a nightmare (you can only change time zone through the FitBit portal login which never seems to work well - and isn't exactly easy in an airport's arrival terminal), and forget about trying to upload music... Rather than simply plugging your watch into your computer, you need to connect through your phone/tablet, and then connect to your computer, and then... It hardly ever works... Managed to transfer 40 or 50 songs, and now it never seems to connect. Really - if FitBit had simply made the transfer easier by just connecting your watch to your computer - rather than having to run through the organization's servers (and it is more than a little repulsive that Fitbit wants to track everything you do), the watch would be fine... But being proprietary never works for any company, and I'll never buy anther FitBit again...
 I know several people including myself who love the versa size and options.  However, the inability of Fitbit to address the syncing issues even if you set it up again it will sync for a few days or weeks then it stops on both Android and Apple OS cells. There are many post out there and I have had my versa for a year.  I have spent too many hours on my versa and with several friends that have purchased at different times and some have a newer firmware but all have syncing issues. Going through Fitbit support just gives you same resolutions and will not give you answers about if Fitbit is looking at this as an issue they need to resolve instead of just going through deleting the device and setting it up again.  Another corporate company who does not want to listen or care about the quality of their product or customers.
 I want to start out by saying I'm a long time fitbit owner and have owned 4 different styles and purchased over 10 devices for myself and others as gifts.<br/>I use to love their products and would rave highly to anyone who showed interest.<br/>Most recently I purchased a versa. It was great and ran as advertised for approximately 50 days. Then very conveniently it stopped holding a charge a few days after the return period was up.<br/>Talking with customer service has been a nightmare and they're not letting me have it replaced, even though I paid for and have a full warranty on it.<br/>They keep sending emails to do this or to do that... All of which are things that have already been addressed since I tried troubleshooting the problem on my own before I emailed requesting a replacement device.<br/>I hope someone reads this before purchasing one and doesn't end up in the same position I'm in...out over $200 with a paperweight of a stylish bracelet that use to function as advertised.
 Upgraded from a Charge 2 HR to the Versa. Did NOT get the special edition as I've no interest in Fitbit Pay and the bands aren't worth the extra money. It's a nice upgrade, works well. My observations on it, partially as responses to other reviews I saw online before purchasing.<br/>1) It's NOT a smartwatch. I don't think it was designed as one either. It's a fitness tracker first and foremost and throws a few smartwatch-style features in. If you want a full-on smartwatch, there's nothing to see here. If you want a fitness tracker and would like a few of the notification features of a smartwatch, this is worth looking at. You won't really be using it to reply to anything, but it will show you enough from an incoming text, email or calendar notification that you can see what it is and decide whether it's worth pulling your phone out for immediately. There might be a few little apps that will appeal to some people, but again, if that's what you want, then move on to actual smartwatches!<br/>2) The bands aren't that difficult to change. It can be a little difficult the first time when you don't know what you're doing, but once you've managed it, it'll be fine after that.<br/>3) The band that came with it is OK, but nothing special. If you'll be wearing this all the time, expect to buy at least one nicer band for it. Nothing wrong with it, it's just not really suitable for wearing to more formal events. I did the same with my Charge 2 HR, but it still looked out of place when in a suit. With a nicer band and a good watch face installed, this looks perfectly fine with a suit.
 wont pair, wont sync, full of bugs
 I was extremely excited to get this watch, when i received It I started synching it to my phone and then it stopped, it wont reconnect, tried on multiple phones and bluetooth is just not working.<br/>Update: after 12 hours restarting phone, deleting de app, restarting de Versa, etc. Etc. A gazillion times, I finally got it to synch, now the problem is that it won't count my steps, still haven't used it on any workouts, don't know if there's a bug there too, but it's an issue for me that it won't count steps, I've waited a while hoping it's just calculating strides, distance and what not, but it won't work.
 Ok as you see I am allergic to fitbit products I have learned because they are made with surgical steel which contains trace amounts of nickle, hence my wrist. I am allergic to nickle and over time this is what happens. This is actually after not wearing it for a full day. I originally thought it was due to sweat or water because I would break out with my Charge 2 on a small scale cover up for a few days it would get better and it would happen again. When I got my Versa the problem got worse fast before I got sweat or water under it. My reason for the 5 star review is that customer service has been great to me and I really do love the product.  I am in the process of getting a refund for both devices (if something goes bad with this I will revise my review). So overall sad due to the fact I cannot use a fitbit tracker but at least they are making it right and I will not be out the money which I do appreciate.  I wish they would change the product and remove all nickle or disclose it, but after reading I do not see that happening anytime soon so I will be looking at new products. So beware if your allergic to Nickle DO NOT BUY. But if you have no allergies this is a fun wearable which is a nice bump up from the Charge 2.
 This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The worst feature of the watch is that it will keep waking you up all night. It's almost 4:00am now and I'm writing this review because you guessed it, it woke me up again.<br/><br/>Let me explain, the watch is supposed to have a manual mode for the screen. Instead of the screen waking up when you turn your wrist, you have to push the left button to see the time. I preffer this as it saves battery and it's less distracting than having the screen turn on all the time while I'm driving or typing. However "manual" does not mean turn on  ONLY with the left button. The watch's screen wakes up if you tap the screen. Or if you lightly touch it with anything like a bedsheet, a jacket or anything.<br/><br/>So while you are sleeping, in the middle of the night if you toss and turn the watch will light up the whole room. Sometimes I have it close to my face, and it shines in my face waking me up.<br/><br/>There are several posts on the Fitbit support site with hundreds of people having this same issue. I've also found several posts on Reddit. Nobody has a solution.
 I received this watch as a present for Christmas. The watch was purchased from Amazon. The hardware is beautiful: thin light and very pleasing design. The screen is bright and clear. FItbit provides excellent tracking of what I do: treadmill  or outside run, outdoor walk, swim and fitness class workout. I have no complaints. There are limited amount of apps, that is true, but I personally don't use that much anyway (not on a watch).  Notifications from texts, emails, and calls appear almost instantaneously. The weather app is very good. This watch is less powerful compared to Samsung watches but it is a very good sport tracker. I am a woman so I don't run outside without a phone for safety, so lack of GPS on this watch is not a problem for me. But there is a problem with the watch faces; there are plenty of nice ones but once you pick what you like there is no way to store your favorites. I don't care from where to load the watch face but I would like to have some "favorite" folder or something. Other than that the watch is perfect. I would definitely recommend this watch for a sport person.
 Bought this because it advertised being able to send pre-written text messages from the Versa, but that ISN'T true for iphones--only for android phones. Not happy because I paid more for this and already had a fitbit Blaze that I liked okay but wanted that advertised feature. Now I wasted my money. Update a month later--my old Fitbit Blaze kept its battery for 4-5 days. This goes a day and a half. I hate it.
 My product stopped functioning after 6 months.  Reached out to customer service and they kept telling me the issue was that I had not update my firmware.  It old them the screen was flickering and would eventually fade out.  I was not able to use it after a few seconds.  The customer service &amp; tech support department were both not helpful.  I requested to send it back to see if they can repair it and they have not responded.  My mistake was wanting to try something different than a I-Watch.  Although they are way more expensive, I would seriously warn everyone  who considers this product over a I-Watch just to pay the extra money money.  Spent $ 200 for a product that lasted 6 month. What a waste.
 After 6 months of gentle wear this watch broke and we cant return it.  Hubby is a computer programmer for a major tech company and he followed all the trouble shooting suggestions.  The screen will flash on for a moment then go blank.  The watch was never dropped, scratched, submerged in water or worn in the shower.<br/>It also lags when you run with it because it needs to sync with your cell phone, in a way thats really annoying and made me give up on checking it for speed.  I'm ordering a Garmin Vivoactive to replace this waste of money.<br/>My hubby and I are loyal Prime shoppers, ordering items almost daily.  He purchased this as my birthday present back in July.
 My wife bought her fitbit versa about 9 months ago, and then bought me one for Christmas 2 months ago. Up until yesterday, we have both been very happy with the quality and functionality of the versa. However, after a brief work out yesterday, my wife looked down to see that the versa's faceplate had popped open and all of the inner workings were visible. We both took a closer and look at it and as far as we could tell, the adhesive had just given out. I googled our problem and found that there were several forums full of people who had experienced the same problem. Several people reported that they had bought the product recently enough that the retailer was able to exchange their versa. Several Others reported that they were out of the retailer exchange period, but still within the 1 year manufacturer warranty. Of these people about 50% were told that this falls under the heading of "damage" and therefore was not covered by the warranty. Still others were quickly offered replacements by fitbit. Hoping for the best, my wife and I started a chat with fitbit customer support. After being asked to send a picture of the problem, we were informed that this falls under "product damage" and that it would not be covered by the warranty. I asked about the people in the fitbit forum who had had the same problem and had their fitbit replaced, a question which the representative completely ignored and instead offered us a 25% off coupon for the inconvenience. I again explained that nothing had happened to the versa to cause the screen to open and therefore it should fall firmly in the "product defect" category and again was apologized to and offered the 25% off coupon. At this point, I was quite angry with the fact that I was being brushed off and rather than take this anger out on the representative who had been growing increasingly rude, I accepted the coupon and ended the chat. We then took the survey and expressed our extreme dissatisfaction with the handling of our case. We have both been fitbit users for years, but this will be the last fitbit either of us own. I don't know why some people had their versas replaced and others didn't, but the 25% off coupon was extremely insulting as they were basically saying, "I'm sorry your $200 dollar watch fell apart, if you give us another $150 dollars, we'll rectify our faulty merchandise." I recommend anyone considering the fitbit versa google this problem before your purchase.
 Not a very high tech watch at all. Very off going with an apple or a Samsung or maybe a designer smart watch. The pebble is also very cheaply made as is the band. Then rubber band it comes with is ver flimsy and not durable. I returned mine to target within 3 days for a full refund. And on top of everything it’s not really that accurate!! It says I climbed floors when I didn’t and it also said I burned just a few calories more per day when I was exercising a lot more than other days when I was relaxing. So bottom line it’s not worth the money.
 Once I saw the picture of Fitbit Versa and got to know its 4+ days battery life, I ordered one for my wife right away. It arrived today and she REALLY LOVES it! The set up was straightforward (you need to connect versa with its charge base in the setup). Her top 3 favorite features so far (she only uses a few):<br/><br/>1. She loves the fact that you can use her photo as the clock face (picture 1) and the box is beautiful (picture 2).<br/>2. Fitbit Pay is very convenient.<br/>3. It's very light and modern.<br/><br/>PS. I bought her an Apple Watch a few years ago. She likes it, but she put it in drawer after a few weeks because she was tired of charging it every night (picture 3).
 Out of the box, the charging doc does not work. In the process of getting it replaced. Lovely to have to do with a quality brand and $200 product. Have to send in a video to clarify/justify my situation. Not happy! The two hours I had it loaded with a live battery was good but not long enough to review product other than this process of disgust.
 I frequently switch bands so that I can wear my FitBit to work and still look polished.  The wrist band on this unit is designed with terrible tiny (sometimes removable) pins that need to be carefully wedged at a precise angle into a miniscule hole.  The first night I had this, it took an hour to switch back to the original band because even my short nails get in the way of snapping the teeny tiny pins into place.  I also painfully broke 2 nails the first night trying.  After days of practice, it takes less time now.  This wrist band design flaw is so massive that I will choose an Apple Watch the next time I upgrade.  Shame on the dude who designed this without a thought for women in mind at all.  (The watch itself works well and I like it which is why this still gets 2 stars).
 I used the Versa for about 3 weeks after I got it as a late holiday gift.<br/><br/>I had previously used the Fitbit Charge HR for a short while and after that fell apart, I decided to get a Versa (over the Ionic which looked terrible). The Versa is a smartwatch that apparently tracks multiple sports including your running, biking, swimming, and can display the results to you via smartphone app or desktop app. I was amazed at the watch when I first got it but after a week of use I realized it's expensive for what it does and isn't great at tracking.<br/><br/>First, the tracking. The tracking is what Fitbit products are known for. My Charge HR was great at tracking steps; 10 steps I took, it registered about 10 steps. The Versa, on the other hand, was very generous with steps and often counted about 1.2-1.4x as many steps as I actually took. This typically involved walking every hour in the office, walking during my breaks and lunch, and then again after dinner for about 15-20 minutes. Sometimes, according to my Versa, I'd hit 10,000 steps before my 2nd break. If you can compare the steps you take and how many steps it's counting, you can get an idea how many steps you missed. I didn't try other sports since walking/running was my primary goal.<br/><br/>The app and syncing is a hit or miss. The app connects by bluetooth (or Wifi if you place the watch in the proprietary charger, which is terrible and has an awful shape). I personally have not had many syncing issues with my Galaxy S8 but other people have. The app is the main hub that tells you all your exercise tallies and lets you change your watch face, display, and install 3rd party app support. Don't be fooled by the marketing, there are not many apps and ones that are available often require payment. The only app that I used and liked, was the music controlling app that lets you control the music playing on your phone by pressing buttons on your watch. Not only that, but many watch faces are not free, most are created by the community.<br/><br/>The issue that has turned me away from Fitbit was when my watch glitched and could not be reset. I was trying to setup a new alarm to wake me up in the morning and the time suddenly turned to 0: minutes]. No matter the hour, it would always display as 0. I thought it was a minor issue so I went to bed. It surprisingly woke me up at the right time but as I tried to fix it the next morning, the time just disappeared. I could still swipe and access the app list, notifications bar, etc, but the time wasn't showing. I restarted my device several times and did a complete wipe to no avail.<br/><br/>If you read up on other reviews, or check out Fitbit's forums, you will know that the Versa has many issues. I was lucky in that I could still return it to the store where I bought it. I did consider requesting an RMA but I'm convinced I would have received a Versa with issues again in the future.
 Loving it so far. Only down point for me is have to have phone for it to GPS runs.
 I love this new Fitbit! I can personalize it with my own picture and change the color or text style on it. It has so much more background than the normal plain ones the rest come with and I like that it come in black,silver,rose gold, and white that’s a definate plus :).  when I move my wrist it actually lights up and shows you the time unlike my Fitbit blaze I had before this, which I fried when I accidentally dunked it in the pool while trying to stop the cover from sinking. I had to push the buttons to get the time which was kind of a pain. This one is so much nicer and sleeker than the blaze and looks amazing on and more like a watch than a big/bulky annoyance It also has a stronger vibration than my blaze I can wear it in the pool without worrying that I’m gonna ruin it! The battery life is outstanding I had it for 4/5 days before I had to recharge it. This is definately the Fitbit to get without a doubt!!!! I did not purchase it from amazon but from Walmart :) and I would without a doubt do it again  A+ A+ A+
 Nothing but connectivity and sync problems.  I have literally spent HOURS on chat with Fitbit support trying to get this working as advertised.  I cannot even get a headset to pair with it.  Contacting Amazon and going to return it.  Very unhappy.
 This is my second try with this watch. I bought it originally a month after it came out. I really liked it but it seemed buggy. And while fitbits customer support was great I didn’t feel like being a guinea pig at full price. So come Black Friday and I could get $50 off the special edition I decided to try it again. I’m glad I did. I upgraded from the original charge HR so there was considerable improvement. I wasn’t looking for a full blown smart watch and I think this is a good fit. First off, it’s water proof. I’m not sure why it took so long to get a fully functional waterproof tracker from Fitbit but I’m glad there are options now. I let my watch sit in a glass of water over night when I first got it with no issues. Since then I’ve been swimming with it and showered with it with no problems.<br/><br/>I was afraid it would be too huge on my small wrist but it’s not at all. It’s anazingly slim and super comfy.<br/><br/>Everything else works as stated as well. I had a minor issue with Fitbit pay that customer support quickly fixed. My only real complaint is some of the third party apps only work once and then gave to be deleted and reinstalled. This seems to be a developer problem as I’ve never had an issue with Fitbit apps. It is a little frustrating being so tied to the phone but again it’s not and never pretends to be a full blown smart watch.<br/><br/>All in all I really like this watch and have been using it happily with iOS for a few months now.
 Looks like there are quality consistency issues at Fitbit.  So many complaints about problems that I do not luckily have.<br/>What I like:<br/>- Form factor.  Very light, sits well on my rather thin wrist.  Buttons are having a good feel to them.  Nice screen.<br/>- Watch function.  I could find myself preferred watch face easily.  Wakes up on wrist turn consistently.  Alarms are easy to set up and vibration works better than buzzer when I have earplugs on (e.g. in a hotel).<br/>- Tracks stairs very well for me.  Every time I go up one standard floor (8-10 ft) it credits me with it.  It also converts elevation gain on hikes appropriately.  I find stair tracking on Versa more consistent that iPhone Health app which takes ~12 ft of elevation for one stair credit.<br/>- Tracks swimming very well.  Does a great job counting laps even with alternating swimming strokes.<br/>- Notifications.  I like calendar reminders and reminders to move.  Text message notifications are okay, but text is very small for me to read.<br/>- Tracks steps reasonably well. No step tracker is perfect and Fitbit in general is more optimistic (gives more credit) than others.  You can adjust stride length if necessary to track distance better.<br/>Not so great:<br/>- Sleep tracking.  Don't bother to try making sense of the data.  It shows me awake at least for one hour every night.  I need to set up a camera and record myself sleepwalking nightly.<br/>- Heart rate monitor.  Works well when at rest.  If I sit down and take reading with a blood pressure monitor, the monitor would read the heartbeat matching Versa almost exactly - 55-65 bpm.  If I stand up and start walking at normal pace, it gets to 100-105 bpm very quickly.  To me it looks like Versa adds some of the arm motions to the heart beat count.  I know for sure that I need to break some sweat in order to get above 100 bpm.<br/>Overall: Not perfect, but it works for what I need.
 I have never had such trouble linking a wireless headset to this kind of product..<br/>I have had FITBIT in the past - and absolutely LOVED this when the VERSA came - I knew this was the FITBIT for me, so techy and sleek - everyone commented.. !!!<br/>My FITBIT Aria and the DEEZER did not work<br/>Nothing worked and I work in technology.. I tried everything.. For those who are not techy - sorry friends - you are going to struggle.<br/>I returned this after talking to the tech team for FITBIT and they gave me no direction..<br/>SO extremely unhappy - wish I could give it less than 1 star !!<br/>Sorry FITBIT - so Crap and so very frustrating...you need to make it so much easier..
 Do. Not. Buy. This piece of crap. I am an experienced IT professional and I have been in the technology business for 15 years and I have never had SO many problems with a device. Fitbit REALLY dropped the ball on this one.<br/>The device doesn't even have real WiFi... it won't sync music to it... it wont STAY connected to WiFi. Took 7 hours to update over bluetooth before I found out that it only connects to certain WiFi routers... OH thats awesome. THANKS. sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Rant over.  Dont waste your money peeps. I will never buy a FitBit tech again.
 Don’t get me wrong the first month or so was great everything works good the app is good and love the basis of the health behind the product. The problem is the company and quality of their product. The watch doesn’t even connect to my phone 5 months later. The screen from normal wear has been terrible and when contacting their support they said they can do nothing but a 25% discount. Not even 6 months later they expect me to pay full price for a device that is not working due to construction and it’s on the consumer to buy. I know it seems like a good option but it’s not worth the 200$ it will break there are no replacement screens available and customer service is automated personal responses. Very poor
 I bought my first Versa and I was very excited about the look and everything that it offers. I am an athlete getting ready for a competition and wanted something to help me track my progress. After the first month of daily usage at the gym, it stopped working. I complained to the vendor, they sent me a new one. It stopped working in 2 weeks. It happened again after 2 months, it stopped working again. I am about to receive my Versa number 5 and I am tired of not be able to rely on this watch. I asked for my money back, but they don't refund my money, only keep sending watches that will stop working. I am not planning to use the new one, because I am beyond frustrated and I am searching for a different brand do buy. I do not recommend this watch.
 I received a Charge 3 and a Versa for Christmas - a nice surprise since I needed to replace older fitness wearables.  With older models, the Fitbit app enabled user to store multiple devices and seamless switch between those models; e.g. wear the Alta HR for evenings, a Charge 2 during the day and, and a Blaze for workouts.  That's not an option with either the Charge 3 or the Versa.  To switch, you'll need to delete one device, then go through the pairing process, update check, setup (WiFi and Bluetooth connections to mobile phone and earbuds - display/activity customization - reload  music &amp; podcasts to Versa), review the quick tutorial, etc.  Apparently, this restriction is intentional and unlikely to change.<br/><br/>I'm a definite fan of the Fitbit Dashboard for general health and exercise tracking - it's an pleasing interface with a layout that helps me track fitness basics.  However, with these two new models, they've stripped capabilities that enable the various Fitbit models to co-exist seamlessly - not a smart move for a 'Smartwatch'.  Nonetheless, I'll keep one of the devices (probably the Charge 3) and give the other a friend who is embarking on an exercise program.
 I have had it for almost two weeks. I absolutely love it. I swam in it everyday for 6 days and it’s still brand new. Travelled internationally and counted my steps every single day and my sleep every single night. Battery is not what it’s advertised as I don’t allow notifications or constant sync yet at the end of the day battery would be between 62 and 67%. I’m used to charging my Alta HR every other day so it’s not a problem for me; however, manage your expectations and minimize sync, notifications and weather features in order to preserve battery.
 I like the Fitbit and all but this version DOES NOT support Fitbit pay like they said it does. You look at the ring around the heart rate monitor to find out if it does or doesn’t. False advertising in my book. Not happy with that fact. Otherwise it’s fine.
 After Fit Bit acquired Pebble (and killed the kick starter) and Coin, I was eager to see what would come out.<br/>Well I have been very happy with the Versa so far! It’s a nice upgrade from the Blaze and way more attractive then the Ionic.<br/>I LOVE the pay feature! That was a big draw for me. At first I had trouble but now it works great at registers that accept “tap” payments. There’s a nice selection of faces to choose from (I recognize some Pebble ones. I like the “pet”. )<br/>The messages don’t always seem to come through. I felt like the Blaze did a better job. Opening the FB. App and syncing helps. I really like the timer and workout trackers. Fit Star/Coach used to be free 😕<br/>FB software is also excellent. Great interface. Easy to use.<br/>The fabric band is very comfortable and easy to clean. It dries fast too. I like it better the. silicone or leather.<br/>Battery is a few days. I think my watch face drains it more. I give it a booster charge while I shower. I hear Apple Watch battery lasts a day, so guess I can’t complain. After reading other reviews I am NOT getting it wet! (Note: I’ve dropped my Blaze in the water a few times and it was fine).<br/>Overall I’m happy with my little Smart Watch and would recommend it.
 I was so excited about my Fitbit Versa when I first received it.  It was my 3rd Fitbit over about a 5-6 year period.  I'm in workday challenges each week and one thing that is important to me is the battery life because you don't die during the middle of a challenge.  Never happened with my Charge HR unless I forgot to charge the battery on a Sunday.  Now, my battery doesn't make the week without dying.  In addition to that poor (in my opinion) battery life, I can not load music onto my Versa.  My music is on Amazon Music, downloaded to my laptop.  My laptop is about 5-6 years old and doesn't have bluetooth capability.  Even if you plug the Versa into the laptop with the USB you still cannot download the music.  You have to have the bluetooth capability.  Doesn't matter that your phone has the music on it, you can't download the music from your phone, it has to be your laptop at least according to the 2 people I've talked to at Fitbit.  They even sent me the little dongle and that doesn't help with downloading music.  So to play music from the Versa I have to pay for a subscription of a music app.  Not worth the money.
 I've had my Versa for 7 months. During that time I had been very happy with it. It tracked things accurately and had a decent battery life.<br/>But after I took it in the shower it stopped working. The buttons wouldn't respond when pushed, and it didn't even turn on when I charged it. I searched online to try to find a solution and found that a lot of other people have had this same problem, where it just shuts down and stops working.<br/>I contacted Fitbit and after a chat about my issues and a few tries at different things, which didn't work, they said they would send me a replacement. I have had 3 different Fitbit products and none has lasted longer than a year. I really wanted a refund, but was told I would have to go through the Amazon seller.<br/>I did purchase a warranty through Asurion and after contacting their customer service was told that I can only get a refund if I send back the item, they pay for shipping, and after they try to fix it and are unsuccessful. I'm going this route and just hoping that they won't be able to fix it so I can get my $200 back. This was the last Fitbit product I will own.
 The only reason I forked out the money for the versa was for the text/call notification system. I thought "oh perfect! I'll be able to see, while I'm working out or working, if someone is trying to get a hold of me!"<br/>WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG-O!  It stopped syncing to my Google pixel almost immediately. My phone is always connected to it through bluetooth but there are still no text or call notifications on the watch and it only occasionally syncs steps and sleep tracker info to the app. I've reset, deleted and reinstalled  the  app  so many times<br/>with the  same results that I'm now becoming Einstein's definition of insanity.<br/> When this watch breaks you can bet I will never be buying another product from Fitbit.<br/>Looking through the reviews on the app, here and internet forums it's clear that this is a common issue that should have been worked out before being put on the market. SHAME ON YOU.<br/> But I do love Shank the Unicorn so he gets a star.<br/>Make sure your s**** works BEFORE selling it.
 The Versa is my 4th Fitbit. I also own the Fitbit One, Flex, and Alta HR and all tracked steps very accurately. I could tell it was accurate because I am able to watch my steps on the app and see in real time the steps I am taking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that is not the case with the Versa so if you are looking for a tracker to track your steps, beware. It will only track your steps if your hands are down at your side and even then it tracks differently depending on how vigorously you are swinging your arms. If I am walking and have my hand in my pocket, resting on my purse, carrying boxes or other items, pushing  cart or stroller, resting hands on sideraill of treadmill, it does not track. So then what does it track?? Also, the heart rate is extremely inflated when I walk on the treadmill. My treadmill has a built in heart rate monitor which shows my heart rate about 20-30 beats less per minute than the Versa.  I know the treadmill is accurate.<br/><br/>Also, if you have it set to track exercise automatically, it will begin "counting" it as exercise only after 10 minutes of continuous exercise. This is fine, but at the end of a 60 minute workout, it will show that you only did 50 minutes rather than 60 because the first 10 don't count.<br/><br/>I've had 3 sessions with Fitbit customer service  and spoken with a supervisor to no avail. They will not replace it because they say that is how it is supposed to work and I will only be disappointed again if they send me a new one!. Unbelievable! They admit the Versa works this way but offer no way to resolve this issue.<br/><br/>I say why bother wearing a tracker if you can't get a somewhat accurate count of your activity.  I guess it's time to go back to a plain clip on activity tracker. The Versa is a huge disappointment.
 I had this product for 3 days took it in the shower and it broke definitely a waste of money
 I switched from the Charge 2, which I love but can be very glitchy. For instance, lately it wasn't picking up my heart rate properly during exercise. The Versa has corrected that, my heart rate tracking is much better while exercising,very accurate. I tested it against a chest belt that I own. It's also very beautiful to look at and I love that it has a color touch screen with so many options for clock faces. The only thing that's not working perfectly is the reminders to move but I'm going to reset it and see if it fixes the problem. I didn't think I would like it over the Charge 2 but I do. I was going to buy the Charge 3 but so glad I have the Versa.
 I've been using an Alta HR for a few months but recently decided I needed a bit more "smart" in my smartwatch, so I took the plunge and upgraded to the Versa.  Overall, I'm incredibly happy with it, with a few gripes that could very well be fixed in future software updates.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The screen is bright and beautiful, even up close.<br/>- It's waterproof and incredibly lightweight.  It doesn't feel cheap, either, for being on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of price for a brand name device.<br/>- You're able to allow notifications from any app on your phone to be sent to the watch.  The Alta HR only received notifications for calls and texts, so I often missed out on notifications from Wi-fi messaging apps that I use more frequently.<br/>- There are expanded options for manually tracking workouts, including a generic "Workout" option that can cover a wide range of activities.  I find that the automatic tracking feature can still be a bit finicky, because it's solely based on the movement of the arm the watch is worn on, so being able to ensure that my workout is being tracked, as well as my time and calories burned, is a huge step up from the Alta HR.<br/>- There's more overlap between the small and large size bands than on previous devices.  For those that tend to be right smack in the middle of sizes, it makes buying replacement bands a whole lot easier.<br/>- The default Fitbit app has more than enough functionality for the average person.  Real health nuts may benefit from additional apps, but not having to pay for multiple app subscriptions just to be able to track my workouts and calorie intake was a huge plus for me.<br/><br/>Cons: Again, none of these are real dealbreakers for me, and many could very well be fixed in additional software updates.<br/>- Swapping out bands is much harder than with other Fitbit models.  You have to get the pin aligned just so, and it can be easy for one end of the pin to fall out while you're trying to get the other one in place.  For those that struggle with dexterity, I could see it being impossible to replace the bands without help.<br/>- There is no way to save previously downloaded clock faces or even bookmark them in the store.  Every time you want to go back to a previous clock face, you have to search for it in the store, re-download, and re-install the entire thing.<br/>- Payment for clock faces and apps is entirely handled through third-party websites.  In order to re-download a paid app or clock face, you have to visit a specific link on the developer's website every time- the Fitbit app does not track whether or not you've paid already, and it can be easy to accidentally pay for an item multiple times.<br/>- In order to transfer music to the watch, you have to use the desktop Fitbit app and a Wi-fi connection.  You can't transfer music from your phone, nor over Bluetooth, and I found the Wi-fi transfer process to be incredibly fiddly and slow.<br/>- It IS possible to re-configure the side buttons to open specific apps, but you're never told how to do it.  I eventually figured out that the top button opens the top left app on the first page of apps, and the bottom button opens the bottom left app.<br/>- There is no way to log calorie intake on the watch itself.  I understand that searching for specific foods is impossible on such a tiny screen, but I feel that there should at least be a way to add Quick Calories without pulling out my phone.  Logging weight is possible, but only through the use of a third-party app.<br/><br/>Overall, I find that this is a great little device for those that are trying to track their fitness, as well as having enough "smart" features to put it on par with other smartwatches out right now.  Its compatibility with both iOS and Android, as well as its increased water resistance and lower price point, make it better both for fitness and general use than an Apple Watch or any other Fitbit product out at the moment.
 It won't set up. Says clock error. No solutions out there. Can't email have to call or twitter. I don't do twitter. Waste of money
 I purchased the Versa to upgrade from my old Charge 2. The charge 2 was a solid watch but over time the battery life was its weakness. I thought I’d have a better experience with the added functionality and smart watch features but I quickly realized this was plagued with firmware issues. For starters it would not sync with my Samsung Note 8 beyond a couple times during setup. It also failed to sync water consumed when entered via the watch. Overall I liked the look but had to return it since it didn’t function consistently.
 I bought one and returned it. Instead bought the Apple Watch because I have iPhone.<br/>The Apple Watch 3 or 4 vs versa.  Just no comparison.  Apple Watch can do 10 or more times the things the versa can do.  After a couple of hours I figured out the entire versa Watch.  After 2 weeks, I am still overwhelmed by the iwatch 3.  It has so many features.  Eg.  type with speak.  Write also messages.  Versa Is just a good fitness device with a few low quality third party app.  Sorry Fitbit.
 So far so good. It's a very light watch and looks well on my petite wrist. There's are a ton of options to change the band and a ton of cases to change the face. I wish the app store was more robust. Coming from Samsung, there aren't a lot of utility apps, particularly a great calendar/agenda app. The 3rd party agendas don't work well on the screen or sync well. There's a $2 one that I've yet to try but agenda items should have been native to the watch. Hopefully the app store will grow. Overall it's works great and is very stylish for the price point. I have the special edition with NFC.<br/><br/>Update:  I finally found an agenda on the app store that displays well.  I've also managed to get more than 4 days battery and I sleep with it on.  I will move it from 4 to 5 stars now that I've had it a few weeks.
 Ordered the new Versa to enter the world of upgrading my FitBit to the "next level."  I'm a fan - I've had 2 Flex Fitbits, 1 Alta, and was ready to get into the smart watch upgrade.  First, while I love increasing steps, the first thing I noticed was this was increasing my steps...incorrectly.  I checked out how to reset and also check settings - I've been down this road with adjusting my Alta and my sleep sensitivity so this didn't seem like a big deal to need to do this with the Versa.  Dealt but was kind of uneasy about the inaccuracy.  However, saw today that an update needed to happen with the Versa.  Started the process of syncing and connecting, but the device kept failing.  I logged onto the Fitbit world forums and followed directions of resetting, connecting to Bluetooth and then re-connecting, disconnecting from my Fitbit app and then reinstalling. It would start to connect, and then failed again.  I did this during the day over a series of 12 hours.  Finally tonight after trying "one more time," and reading that other users are having similar issues I realized it was time to throw the towel in.  Either the device is defective, or unable to load the new update.  So frustrated with it at this point, I'm just heading back to my Alta, which although it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Versa, at least I get accuracy and can actually still believe in the Fitbit device itself.  Perhaps when a new version upgrade happens, I'll look at it again.  I like the idea of the smartwatch but not going to cheat my own activity and exercise efforts with something not working.  Would rather someone else out there who might consider and get a Versa, if they start to experience the same issues, can alleviate the frustration and also return without repercussion.  Next time, Fitbit.  I'm not at a loss yet with your efforts.
 Given the greacreviws I had high hopes for the device but a little time with it and I'm sorry I didn't just get the Apple watch. First the install was the most tedious error prone I've ever encountered. It took an enormous amount of time for it to install. Not sure what it was even installing. It never connected to my wifi and that became very problematic. They should not even  mention that you can get music on it. It only supports Deezer (?) or Pandora and only in their premium 9.99 monthly charges and another install configuration effort. I hit too many hurdles attempting to downlaod my music files. Start by thinking you have to first download the fit bit software on your computer, the app on your phone or tablet configure all these various settings to even start! Music is a must have to accompany exercise. I also noted that the trackers were highly inaccurate. It was tacking my heart rate whilst in its proprietary charger. So yet another cable that must be packed and tracked for any trip. That being said the battery life is very good. The deign is great, but basic functionality very limiting and that caused me much frustration. Good looks will only get you so far...I can't rely on its measurements, basic functionality is missing. Really who chose Deezer over Spotify? I could never get the music app to download my own music. I'm sure that more hours invested in scouring forums, help files etc might have yielded some better result but frankly the setup is something less than plug and play which a device should be. Changing the watch bands provided additional frustration. Really not worth the effort.The Apple store probably has more apps in one day that this device has had in its lifetime. This was my third fitbit device and my last.
 Haven’t had a fit bit since the charge he<br/><br/>Also let it be implicitly and emphatically  stated that it is all subjective and relative to the activities of each individual user.<br/><br/>Had a Garmin and it worked well and held up exceptionally well strength training, cardio, swimming in the ocean... unlike my sunglasses I lost in the gulf this past summer.<br/><br/>.....May edit this later as I’m still in the honeymoon stage of this purchase.<br/><br/>I digress...<br/>Pros:<br/>(A lot of good things, I will probably miss some stuff but here’s most of it: )<br/> I strength train usually before I do any cardio.<br/>cardio: typically stair climber, elliptical, and treadmill. Along with the miscellaneous steps from work and home.<br/><br/>Digital payment-paired with my cash app card<br/>Indirect link to my bank account/credit card.<br/><br/>Interchangeable bands !!!!<br/>*which are much easier to remove than people make it seem.<br/>I literally expected the worst only to find out that there’s been some over dramatizations.<br/><br/>Relatively good battery life compared to Apple Watch. Not as good as garmin which was 6-7 days but it wasn’t a color screen and wasn’t a smart watch.<br/><br/>Alarms: useful for the times my phone alarm doesn’t go off or i forget to turn them on after the weekend or days off.<br/><br/>Performs really well when it comes to recognizing activities and not just counting steps.<br/><br/>Great at tracking sleep and especially my impromptu naps.<br/><br/>The relax feature is really nice, a good way to have intentional downtime in your hectic life.<br/>I like that it is rather brief, but mindful nonetheless.<br/><br/>Watch lock !<br/><br/>Customizable clock/watch face- was very minimalistic but I went with a stat heavy theme.<br/><br/>*Maybe it’s not the best for everyone, my vision is 20/15 so I could see if some people feel they can’t read the small print. Coworker pointed this out. Lol<br/><br/>Love love love the app and the community!<br/>Far exceeds that of garmin. Sorry not sorry.<br/><br/>Obviously love the notifications and steps reminder. It helps me stay conscious about my water intake.<br/><br/>I love the challenges!<br/><br/>Over all user friendly, I carry my phone almost always so the fact it doesn’t have gps doesn’t hinder me or my activity in anyway. Further more it tracks with out it, even if it isn’t as precise, I don’t mind.<br/><br/>Optional coaching offered, for annual fee.<br/><br/>Learned how to fully use it with in about a day.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>I wish I could remove the bloatware!!<br/><br/>I definitely appreciate the Uber, Starbucks,Walgreens and Pandora apps. Some of them function a bit primitively for me. Very basic functionality.<br/><br/>It doesn’t play well or at all rather with Apple health and Apple Music.<br/><br/>Side note:<br/>I upgraded my pandora subscription to see if I could function with out my phone and just use the watch. Will update soon.<br/><br/>I may eventually just get an Apple Watch and my primary motivation would be the music, I love Apple Music and Spotify, neither are an option with the watch,but again I rarely do anything without my phone.<br/><br/>Another positive:<br/>It paired well with my Bose wireless in ear sport headphones. The controls work quite well for music on native and external apps. Very Responsive!
 This watch is amazing and would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the battery. the first one I received the battery wasn't lasting a full 48 hours so fitbit replaced it and now I am getting about 2.5 days but not a full 3 days of life. I don't use all day active sync or have an interactive watch face. I like all the additions to this watch and the fact that's waterproof. It is definitely superior to the blaze that I was previously using. I will say, in my experience, Fitbit does have amazing customer service and about 2.5 days of life is fine. I can always work a charge into my schedule when needed.
 I have had multiple fitbits and really like them.  I decided to upgrade to the watch and have regretted it ever since.  It took 2 phone calls and 3 chats with agents to finally get the watch synced the first time.  I have been out of town twice since syncing it the first time and both times the watch does not sync properly.  The first time it never changed time zones.  The 2nd time it changed to a completely random time.  It made no sense.  I had to call Fitbit again to sync it once I got home and after 30 mins of resetting and completely removing the versa and re-adding it I got a synced and correct watch.  Two days later my screen says "Clock Error" So I cannot see what my steps are for the day until I sync which only works part of the time.  This is junk.<br/>Fitbit is a good company but they need to dump this one and try again.
 I purchased my Versa as a replacement for my Blaze, which I loved. I was hesitant to change, but went ahead and did it anyway and gave the Blaze to my husband when his Charge finally broke. I’ve only been wearing it for a few days so far, but I’m thrilled with it! First, I still get to use the wonderful Fitbit app, and transitioning was seamless. Second, the rose gold frame is beautiful, can’t stop looking at it! Third, the huge selection of watch faces was exciting, found several that I really liked. The battery life is fabulous, and charging is a breeze compared to the Blaze. I’m still learning how to use some of the new features but I’m certainly looking forward to such experiences as listening to music right from my watch! Good job, Fitbit!
 Have owned a brand new versa (8/3/18) it never tracked workouts.  Contacted FITBIT - was told they know there is a problem with this model and they are working to resolve it to just be patient.  I waited contacting them 12 times to see when their glitch would be fixed.  Yesterday I recieved and e-mail stating: We’re aware of problem, but may not be able to provide a fix in the immediate future. We'll continue to monitor the situation, and keep our team informed of the impact to you and other customers.  THEY WILL NOT TAKE BACK THE PRODUCT - I'm stuck with a watch
 The Versa is nice to look at, comfortable on the wrist and an overall excellent product... when it works.<br/><br/>I used to be a huge advocate of Fitbit, arguing its supremacy over all of the competition - namely when I owned the fantastic Charge 2.<br/><br/>Their software has always been buggy. It just seems to be getting worse. I went through every troubleshooting step I could find on the internet when it stopped synching to my phone and refused to update to the latest firmware.<br/><br/>The customer service solution to everything seems to be to just factory reset it. When I asked the very pleasant lady whether it's a known issue, she said something along the lines of, "yes, it's just something that happens sometimes and you have to factory reset it". OK - I guess I'll kiss my data goodbye everytime it decides to do this in the future. It's an annoyance.<br/><br/>Although I hope they can turn it around, I'm beginning to agree with all of the articles suggesting that they will become obsolete within this particular sector unless they somehow pivot - or improve their product.<br/><br/>As of this moment, my next smart watch/ fitness tracker is likely to be Samsung.
 I have a samsung gear watch. It is so big, heavy, and bulky it is not comfortable to wear even though it worked great with my samsung phone. I never wore it.<br/>I have been looking for a smart watch and was leaning to a fitbit versa, but it is still kinda expensive.<br/>I found this watch, and it does what I want. It tells me I have email, or text, time,date, moniters all the fitness stuff and its only half the price of fitbit. Whats not to love?  It syncd up well with my phone, battery life so far is plain awesome, its stylish, small, light. You cant answer texts, calls and emails over the watch. But, imagine trying to type on that small keyboard, yuck. It can be read in low light conditions for time without making it light up. Very impressed so far. Only bad thing is its amazon, and it makes Bezos more rich.
 I got the Versa after having a Fitbit Charge2 and wanted a bigger screen. The Versa is comfortable and looks nice, but the battery life is really bad. I have turned off all I can, reduced the screen to be minimal data and have to press a button to get the screen to come on and I may get 24 - 30 hours before I have to recharge. There have been days where I forgot to charge and by the afternoon of the 2nd day the batter is dead.<br/><br/>There are also buttons on both sides of the Versa and when playing golf, I find I hit the button and change the screen or turn off the function I have working.<br/><br/>I find the Charge2 lasts for days and due only one button on the device, it works better when doing any activity. I have started wearing my Versa at work and the rest o the time I wear the Charge 2.<br/><br/>Overall, the Versa is not bad and like that I can wear in water, but if it ever fails, I will stick with a Charge.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3629EJB8IJLQ3"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1hO7JrQ34S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1jC0bPrZdS.png"/> Versa worked great for 3 weeks and then began acting as if possessed. Screen would turn on and scroll through content on its own or the clock face would position itself part way across the screen. When the screen was acting this way, touch and buttons became unresponsive so I could not stop the crazy behavior. If it went on too long, the clock face would turn white almost like screen burn. Later when it finally calmed down the clock face color would return to normal color. Contacted customer support and they helped me to perform a reset. Problem persisted. Sent email and used community board. Attempted my own troubleshooting. Nothing resolved the issue. No response from Fitbit (I have had many Fitbits and, in the past, I have received excellent response). Finally decided to return. I loved the features of this Versa and, for 3 weeks, I was truly delighted. Seriously waffled over return vs replace but ultimately was not confident that a different device would be problem free. Hopefully others will have a better long term experience. For reference, I preordered directly from Fitbit. I bought the Special Edition (pink/lavender) and used with iPhone 8 Plus. I had no setup problems and no problems with synching or notifications. I even tried the contactless payments and they worked great. Besides the glitches, the only other thing I want to mention is that, like others, I found the band very difficult to change.
 I've had this watch for around 8 months. It's a pretty watch and very thn so it looks nice at work. I love that there are no worries when it gets wet. It's a great going to the gym or a mom running around type watch (i am a 50 yr old mom). It's not smart enough for me to use during my work time. I knew that going in but I am now going back to a watch that I can do voice commands and type to talk and text.  I am keeping this watch though for my kayaking and exercising activities. The watch is worth buying.....however the notifications, although you can get them, are very very limited so if you are tech minded at all you will most likely get frustrated with it if that's what you are looking for. Also my daughter is a serious runner and this watch does not do what she wants in a watch regarding tracking her runs just an fyi.  It's nice for what it does do.
 So I just upgraded to the versa from a charge 2. I love the look, features, etc. It advertises a 4+ battery life. I can't even get 2, and I didn't exercise at all. I don't get many notifications and I turned off the automatic wrist turn option. Love the watch, hate that i need to carry a second charger!
 The HR monitor on my Versa gave out after 8 months. My normal resting heart rate is close to 62bpm. For the last few days, the device has been logging my heart rate as sitting around 150bpm all day. The device said that I burned 9000 calories the other day when I only walked 4k steps.<br/><br/>Fitbit support refuses to repair or replace the device. They claim that this is a software bug that is being worked on. However, there is nothing online about other people experiencing this issue. I have used Fitbit products for 8 years. I lost 100 pounds with my first Fitbit. I will never buy another Fitbit.
 I had very high expectations for the Fitbit versa. Purchased a special edition gray version which initially seem to work reasonably well.<br/>After some time not sure exactly when some month or so in I noted that when I was away from my residence Wi-Fi I had no real Bluetooth connection with my phone which would not sync with the device. I run a Verizon LG G6 which unfortunately upon further investigation is not listed as a supported device for the Versa.<br/>I believe supported devices are found within the app or simply Googling devices supported by Fitbit versa which I never did prior to purchase.<br/>If you are having constant syncing issues and other issues with the device I would suggest you check the devices supported page.<br/>I'm hoping a future update would increase the number of supported devices and I can use the Versa again.<br/>I will likely be less enthusiastic about any other Fitbit products in the future do to this unfortunate situation.
 I had high hopes for his watch, and after doing a lot of research determined it should be compatible with my Lg G6+ phone (which two other brand\model phones I had previously bought were not and had to be returned).<br/>Nowhere did I read that to set up the Versa does one need two other compatible features: a home or office wifi connection ( I only have a hotspot on my cellphone) and a computer running Windows 10  to copy music to the watch ( I have a Chromebook and an older Win 7). Finally after trying for 3 hours did this become apparent.... Have to return it :-(
 There are a lot of features I loved about this watch. The size, the timer and alarms, the weather app, and the altimeter. However, this is wear the love stops. I primarily got this watch for the ability to download music. This process is one of the most cumbersome and abysmal processes on earth. In fact, after several hours by myself and several more hours with Fitbit customer service, it was IMPOSSIBLE to download any music at all. Look for other reviews regarding downloading music across the internet to confirm this.  Too bad. I hope they fix this known bug. Returned it.
 First watch died after a few months. Just a black screen. Second watch has been fine after getting a replacement that wasn't that much of a hassle both watches have always had problems synching with Android. My device is on the approved devices and I still have multiple synching issues a few times a week I'd say 5 out of 7 days. This is for sure my last fitbit device as long as I own an Android device because they simply cannot be bothered to fix their app and synching issues. Most of the time I just have to log out of the app and log back in but doing it daily is just annoying. Id stay far far away from this watch if you are on Android.
 HELP!!!  The Versa is not downloading the apps!  I went to Fitbit website &amp; it states<br/> "We have resolved the issues affecting Versa and Ionic, including syncing, setup, firmware updates, music, Weather, and App Gallery functionality. Thanks for your patience while we resolved these issues" . Issue is not resolved.  I’m having problems w/ WIFi &amp; no apps. Mine is still not working. Please help me.
 Got a fitbit for Christmas. After less than a week I woke up to a cracked screen. I researched on the web and found this is a fairly common occurrence. I contacted fitbit who told me the cracked screen is not covered under warranty but if I sent them a picture and a handwritten note they would give me 25% off a new fitbit. Huh? Horrible customer service, buyer beware. You are taking your chances with this device (Versa) as it obviously has either a design or manufacturing flaw that the company will not own up to or honor. Take your money elsewhere to a more deserving smartwatch company. I am.
 This is a joke, i got an empty box, with just the charger.
 I bought this and loved it. However, I accidentally cracked the screen a month and a half in. Firat off I would have expected it to hold up better but okay it was my fault. So I go to get it fixed and find out you can't. The screen is not replaceable and if you damage it then it's a 200 dollar arm weight cause its definitely not waterproof now. Either way they wont gr my business again.
 First of all, this was a great device for the few days I had it. I was pleasantly surprised with the battery life, how light it was, how well the notifications worked and loved the fitness tracking side of it. However, after just a few days the same pain that I noticed with my previous Fitbit Alta returned (achy hand and wrist, pain slowly creeping up my arm to my shoulder and losing strength). I realized that Fitbit still has not fixed this issue that was widely reported with their previous models. As much as I would love to be back in the Fitbit ecosystem I ended up switching to an Apple Watch which doesn't give me pain like Fitbits seem to do.
 Was expecting something comparable to an Apple Watch like they advertised and got a watch that barely works. The biggest issue I had with this watch was the battery life. I would charge it fully in the morning and have 40% battery life by dinner time. Another issue was having to get a paid subscription to pandora or deezer to listen to music. Waste of time and money.
 Bought this to replace an older Fitbit Charge my wife had.  Like the looks and features of the Versa. What a HUGE disappointment this device is!  Cannot get the Bluetooth to connect/stay connected to my wife's LG Android Stylo 4.  Device will not sync and therefore cannot change the watch face or update the data on the phone from the watch.  Never had this issue with her old Charge...  Going to return it and get my $200 back.
 I had the charge 2 for about 3 years and my husband gifted me with the Versa in November so I could use in the gym and the pool.  So far it has worked great!  I have used it in the pool, the beach, and even inside my gym’s sauna and steam room!  I was hesitant to use at such high humidity places, so initially I covered it with a towel 😉.  Then after a couple of visits, I removed the towel and my Versa kept working perfectly.  I’m very happy with my Versa.  It has worked as described.
 I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my fiance. She and I are active in the gym and she wanted a engaging way to track calories. As you probably know the main way that the fitbit does this is through heart rate monitoring. If you are like me you probably DONT know that the Versa has been notoriously bad at estimating calories burned and grossly exaggerates it. In comparison there are better smart watches on the market (even in the fitbit family) Just do your research before purchasing to make sure this is the watch for you.
 I had a Fitbit Charge 2 and upgraded to a Versa a few months ago.  Although I like what Fitbit and the Versa offer, my biggest complaint is the SYNCING!!!!!  It NEVER syncs properly.  And by properly, I mean I have to fiddle with different things on my phone just to figure out what's going to work THIS time.  For instance, turn on/off the bluetooth, exit and reopen the app, forcequit the app, restart phone, uninstall/reinstall app...reapeat all those in different order.  Ugghhhh!!  Although customer service is nice and they try to be helpful.  They have no idea why the device doesn't sync either.  This has been an ONGOING problem with Fitbit and for some reason they just can't get the darn thing corrected.  You don't hear of this with Apple, Garmin... I have thought about giving my Versa away and starting over with something else SO many times!!!  But I spent the $$ on this not too long ago and don't want to spend $$ on something new.  But if this keeps up, I will.  If I had to do it over again, I would go with the Garmin (since I don't have an Iphone).
 So disappointing.. do yourself a favor and get the apple watch if youre looking for a smart watch that pairs well with your iPhone. The fitbit is terrible for the $. It was cute and slim but the design in every respect is flawed with the exception of the actual device. The band was difficult and less comfortable than the apple watch, the technology is seriously lacking as is compatibility. This isn't even a good fitness tracker! I bought the apple watch in replacement and was NOT disappointed. Im sure this is nice for fitbit users who just want an upgrade but compared to a REAL smartwatch this is terrible.
 I Give a 3 star rating as i love the look, size and features which works very well.  Charges pretty quickly and last for 3 to 4 days before needing to charge again.  If it was not for the scratches on the face, which i later purchased a screen protector to limit the damages and the fabric on the band falling apart, I would have given this a 5 star hands down.<br/><br/>Fitbit customer service was very helpful, up to the point of shipping me out another band but they could not do anything with the scratches even though it did not take much effort to be scratched.  I purchased this as apart of my Wife's Christmas gift so I'm not satisfied being the only thing she has done is wear it off an on without any form of exercise apart from getting in her steps for the day.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to buy the screen protector if you buy this watch and apply it immediately.
 Bought it because it states you can take you music on the go.  It also states that it works with Itunes.  Silly me thought this would include apple music.  It doesn't.  Apple music has a special DRM that doesn't allow you to download that music.  So for 1.29$ a song you can have music on your watch or you can pay pandora or whatever other company they have a deal with.<br/><br/>It seems to estimate reasonably well miles ran based on your user profile. I checked it against my other GPS watch.  It was withing a few hundred yards as far as accuracy.  Who knows about calorie accuracy.<br/><br/>Bottom line, until they can fix the Apple music issue and let you link your account (much like my android watch does with google music) then it is pretty worthless to me.<br/><br/>I Will try to return it.
 In some ways this is a decent watch, but I could never get it to reliably sync with my phone and get email notifications. I have spent a lot of time troubleshooting, but it simply does work reliably for me. I am returning it to Fitbit (I bought it directly from them) and will revert to using my Pebble watch, which has been working fine for the past two years.
 It's a very short list of phones this is compatible with. Go to the Fitbit help forums and look. Won't synch with LG G6 and many new phones. Don't assume because you have a new phone that it will work. Fitbit hasn't updated their list of compatible phones for most of the trackers in ages.<br/><br/>Only way to get it to synch is to uninstall and reinstall the app. It synchs one time and you have to do it again to synch. Notifications don't work if your phone isn't on the short list of compatible phones.
 Customer support is poor. They are hard to understand and give script answers. It’s frustrating. My Fitbit weather app is using  centigrade instead of Fahrenheit. This support person tried to fix it but it didn’t work. Then she said nobody knows how to fix it.<br/>I asked to talk to a manager and she said there wasn’t one. My fit bit doesn’t always sync correctly with my phone. She didn’t fix that either. I also get notifications of voicemails on my fitbit that are not on my iPhone. When I call back the person they tell me they didn’t call me.  ???<br/>The customer support said “that’s weird”and that was the end of it.
 I was disappointed. The latch to keep the band lock to the watch would not stay attached to the watch so I returned it. I could not even wear it to see if it worked well. I will have to try the FitbitVersa regular edition and see if the band is better. I am very active and do not want to lose the watch. I lost my fitbit charger due to the band falling off.
 Battery life is horrible. I’m lucky to get a full day of use of it. Thought it was broke, so I got a replacement under warranty, but it’s the same. Has a lot of cool features, but the battery life is just really bad. Maybe if you don’t use any of the features, and only look at the time you could make it last two days or so. I previously had the Blaze and the battery lasted few days, so I was expecting similar length of use out of the versa, but no such luck
 I wouldn't of bought this product if I had known it wouldn't work with my phone. I had to contact Fitbit to get help setting it up, only to realize after an hour that my phone wasn't on the supported devices list. Also the advertising is kind of misleading, you can not use the "Apple Pay" like feature unless you buy the "special edition" of the watch. It's also made of plastic not metal like the picture suggests.<br/><br/>The positives are that it's durable, reliable and lasts a long time after a charge. I used to have a gen 1 Apple Watch and switching watches had to happen since I changed from an iPhone to an android but damn I wish the Fitbit watches were made of a higher quality material. Or maybe I wish I would have read the fine print on the watches and what they were made of.<br/><br/>Over all, its great if you want a plastic watch, that keeps up with your fitness and works with only apple, pixel or galaxy. If you want a higher quality watch steer clear. Thats my opinion at least, thanks.
 This watch is great when it works.  I bought one in April and it had water damage from daily showering in less then a month.  Fitbit did send me a new one, but that one went out without water damage in less then a month too.  I sent it back to have them look at it and that was July and I still don’t have a watch.  This was a complete waste of money and the quality of this product is terrible.
 I got the standard edition versa, and I honestly love it. I've wanted a Fitbit for years and finally got one for my birthday. It's wonderful! It's actually waterproof, and not just to be able to wear it in the shower, I even go swimming with it.  It tracks my steps accurately and through the app, I can even monitor my water and food intake.<br/>The ONLY downside is the notifications through the watch. I have it synced so my cell phone notifications will appear on my watch and I have to reset my watch about every 3-4 days because it almost freezes. Basically, you can pull down a notification tap and it keeps one or two messages and won't delete them or show new ones. If they fixed this little bug it would be perfect. And to get the notifications to work I have to delete the device off the app, then delete the app and basically, 100% restart the watch for the notifications to be fixed.<br/><br/>If you don't sync cellular notifications though, this is perfect.
 I got this for Christmas from my husband because I wanted a pedometer and basic functionality related to heath tracking. Unfortunately, fitbit is just not made for all people, especially parents of small children and pregnant women. You can't tell it that you're pregnant, a time when you naturally have a high heart rate, so any readouts for heart rate are not that useful. Worse, the step count is extremely inaccurate because you have to be swinging your arms for it to count steps. I can go for a three mile walk with my baby in a stroller and it will register less than 200 steps because I'm not swinging my arms. I imagine it's great is you always have the luxury of swinging your arms when moving, but I don't. Even if you run while pushing a stroller it does not count your steps with any degree of accuracy. I wanted to love this watch, but so far it's just an expensive piece of plastic that I could definitely do without.
 I can't believe fit bit can make such a mistake. The device itself is good so far. But the bands are wrong. The sides are not correct
 I bought this from Costco last month. I really enjoyed it the first few weeks. The idea of having a fitness device and a smart watch all in one was something that I really liked!<br/>After using the FitBit for a while it stopped getting notifications regularly... It became frustrating constantly having to restart my phone in order to correct the issue.<br/>For $200 I'd expect something to work well and be reliable.<br/>I ended up returning it today and purchased a "Samsung sport." Although it was $20 more it seems to be extremely reliable. It does what the FitBit can but gives you the option to respond to people and control your apps. I have a galaxy S9 and it works extremely well with my phone. The Versa screen also didn't pop up when I'd face the versa my way... Just not what it should be for the price.<br/>I would not recommend this product.
 Loved the watches until we traveled to Europe. What good is a watch if it only tells the correct time in the USA? Neither would sync to the local time even though we tried everything. The other problem is that it is inaccurate in measuring steps....my husband and I walk approximately the same number of steps on many days but he earns one or two or even three thousand more steps than I. Not happy!
 I bought 2 versas (for myself and my wife) when they launched. They look nice and track well (at least mine did) but they are incredibly unreliable. They both randomly restart, and my wife's would be off for extended periods without her even realizing it.<br/><br/>Hers was so spotty that we finally switched her to an Apple watch (which stays powered on thankfully). My biggest issues have been syncing. Text messages will get through one minute and not the next, forcing me to restart the watch/phone constantly.<br/><br/>I upgraded to a new phone, hoping it might alleviate some of the issues. Instead, now it's even worse. I've finally given up getting it to sync. After reading through parts of a 90+ page Fitbit support thread, I've discovered that syncing with Android Pie has known issues and Fitbit hasn't fixed them in about 6 months.<br/><br/>I'm going to start looking for a new product that actually works and is supported by a company that knows how to update its products.
 I was super excited about this fitness watch and bought it at Walmart. I loved it. It is light wt. And looks very cute on my tiny wrist. For about 2 months I was very happy, then it started draining battery really fast. 3rd month it lasted for 30 to 35 hr. Now it's been 3.5 months battery lasts hardly 10 hrs. I crossed the return mark and really not happy with this purchase.<br/>I am fitbit lover, wore blaze for last 2 yrs and bought this one thinking it will not look as bulkier. $200 is a lot of money for me.<br/>I wish I could recommend this to others but unfortunately can't. Looks cute though.
 Love the watch, I had a blaze before, I miss my blaze for two reasons, 1) to change bands was way way easier. 2) You could get extra large bands with the blaze, you can’t with the versa, now even universal ones, the largest I seen said it was an 8.9... my foot it was more like an 8.25... FRUSTRATING, so I’m having to wear a watch that possibly isn’t getting accurate readings because it’s so tight.
 My baby's doctor in the NICU said she suspected that I had gestational diabetes, and it terrified me. I got the fitbit versa to help me be accountable for what I do, and don't do to help me lose weight and make better choices. Its helped me keep up with my activity and motivates me to keep pushing on. The app helps me keep up with my calories and water. I've lost approx. 12 pounds in just over a week keeping up with my daily goals, calories, carbs, and drinking 80+oz of water a day.
 Had to return a Charge 2 when I developed a burn spot on my wrist. Bought the Versa because the customer service agent said they had heard about that problem and fixed it in the Versa. One week later returned my Versa to Best Buy for the same reason. I think the battery must leak or something. I’m not allergic to stainless and wear other products without a problem so can only assume it’s the electronics.
 its been very useful in helping me to track my extremely bad sleeping habits, as well as tracking my fitness (or lack thereof). my suggestion is if you think its not tracking correctly, switch the "dominance" in the settings. ie, if you're wearing it on your non-dominant wrist, change it in-app to state that its on the dominant wrist. i've found that this leads to great accuracy.
 I loved the watch at first but when I realized with my iphone i couldnt text or do anything not even listen to music without pandora premium and i use pandora free. I only used the watch to monitor my sleep, heartrate and the time. Not really good for anything else. I upgraded to an apple watch and im glad I did. I can actually do everything my iphone can do . This watch is GREAT for androids not great for Iphones.
 So if your looking to just track your steps then buy it. Long story short I bought the new versa via Fitbit website and it was counting like 22 floors in a day when I had gone up 0 stairs/hills. They sent me a new one- did the same thing. Sent me another. Same thing. Now I can’t return it or exchange . I’ve had it for 2 months. I had the old charge and that one worked perfect. They tried to tell me the environment/air was what was the issue with counting floors. But my charge never had that issue. I’m sad because I LOVED Fitbit -but I will not recommend them.
 I’ve had a Fitbit since they first shipped in 2009, and am very pleased with this company.  Their customer service is, for the most part, excellent, which I appreciate it.  Before the Versa came out, I purchased the Ionic, which I like, but the Versa’s style really appealed to me.  My first Versa, however, had a problem with the battery life (less than 12 hours before it drained), and the Fitbit company replaced the watch.  I have had my second Versa for a week, now.  What I really like is the look and feel of the Versa.  It’s very comfortable, and I do wear it 24 hours a day.  It’s less clunky than the Ionic.  I love having the weather app and also love changing my watch face regularly.  What is not as good is the battery life.  Even following the suggestions for extending battery life, I’m only getting about 3 days max.  The other downfall from my point of view is changing the wristband.  It’s very difficult.  I have watched videos and gone to the Fitbit community.  It’s just not very user friendly, which is disappointing as I like to change my wristband frequently.  As always, the Fitbit App and tracking are the best part of the Fitbit, and Versa did not disappoint.
 It's lightweight, comfortable, and attractive, but the Connected GPS is horrible. It barely connects and when it does it logs Soo inaccurately it's useless. I'd you want basic step counting, heart rate and things like that it's not bad, but don't expect to track walks or bike rides via GPS
 I bought a Fitbit Versa 1 month ago, and so far I really like it. Not only the watch looks good, but you kind of forget that it's on your wrist. The battery life is great as well. I get around 4 days of battery life (two 30-minute runs with music). To me, this is the point of departure from other great smartwatches such as Samsung gear s3 and apple watch 3. In addition, I really like the Fitbit app as a versatile fitness application with all the fitness modules and a huge community. The only downside of Versa is that it does not have a built-in GPS. Other than I strongly recommend this product for fitness tracking.
 Fitbit has awful customer service. They make up different rules for their warranty - person per person. They replaced my friends missing versa and I was so happy for her because she was really upset well low and behold 2 months later I lost mine and they said they can only offer me 25% off - which is nice, too but I feel like it shouldn’t differ person to person. Also, the thing was giving me issues for a while, too.
 Battery is worthless...I have to charge mine 2-3 times a day. I keep charger with me most times to avoid losing somewhat accurate account is acyivity. I keep my Bluetooth on phone turned off so that it doesn't suck the life out of watch but still doesn't help.<br/><br/>Sleep function rareactivity.<br/>Think I should go back to a charge, this is pretty but I didn't pay $200 for just pretty!
 The only good thing about versa is how it looks... Other than that it is all about disappointment.... The worst thing about it is it's connection to the phone it keeps disconnecting and you don't get any notifications from your phone there is definitely something wrong with it so Bluetooth even when it's connected my phone only sees it as paired and not connected.  It is a common complaint from many costumers on the fitbit site and they do not seem to do anything about it.... Also it's vibration is very week,  it doesn't have many options if compared to the Samsung gear... There is no any indication on the watch to tell you that u r disconnected from your phone , it doesn't have find my phone option,  it doesn't have any sound all it's notifications are just week vibrations even the alarms,  even in fitness tracking it is very bad it keeps counting steps and burning calories even if I'm resting and doing nothing.  I really regret not buying a Samsung gear
 I am using the product to get back into shape. Ive been used Fitbit products like the original Flex and Aria in the past and loved them both.<br/>I purchased the Versa because of the multi-sport function and GPS as I am cyclist.<br/>I was disappointed to learn the watch doesnt have an onboard app store; you have to use the fitbit app on your phone to load apps and watch faces on your device, albeit it is a slick process. Also, there isnt a way to save your watch faces for later use.<br/>I do love how light weight the device is, and all the fuctions it has. I have only had this device a few days.
 Does not count stairs and watch fearure is nit flear; numbers overlap so difficult to tell time
 I bought 2 of these as a cheaper alternative to the Apple Watch for my wife and I. Mine was great for 4 weeks when it decided to stop tracking my sleep, or showing a vague graph of restless/restful sleep, and displaying notifications for texts, calls, misreading my heart rate etc. I tried resetting the watch and phone, deleting the app and starting from scratch. I returned the watch and got a new one which worked properly for 1 day. From day 2 on it doesn’t vibrate and display notifications. You can swipe the screen down and they’ll show that way, but it won’t alert you that something came in. That was a big part of getting these watches. My wife’s has only had trouble tracking sleep. As a fitness tracker it’s pretty solid. As a smart watch it seems to fall short. I also tried the new update from Fitbit that changed the whole today app and everything else and that didn’t help either.
 Product is underwhelming and broke within a week. Stopped turning on and would just freeze in the loading scree.
 I love the color and how lightweight it is. Very handy when my phone is on silent and I get a text or notification. Kinda upset I can only use quick replies and not compose my own message. I was hoping it was going to be like the iWatch when it comes to texting. I hope they update the versa so we can.
 Really think twice before buying this.  I pre ordered and bought mine right off of Fitbit.  I had it only 4 days and somehow scratched (deep scratch) the screen.  It is NOT covered under warranty and Fitbit will not cover it.  The Versa is supposed to have gorilla glass and this should not have happened.  This has to be a product defect.  Check online for "Versa Scratched screen" and you will find many complaints.  Buyer beware.  I have owned ALL the Fitbits and got a new one every year.  This may be my last.  This is a fitness watch and I would expect for the price better quality.
 Well I used to have the Fitbit 2 and I loved it, but accidentally hit the screen and,that was it,so my husband got this new version for me and really disappointed because the distance isn't accurate at all you can see the different from my treadmill  and my Fitbit versa, very sad, looks nice but doesn't really count the steps  judge you self.
 I have been a fan of Fitbit for years. I started with a Fitbit Alta, and was excited to upgrade to a Versa late last year.  It has many great features - when it works. After a mere 3 months, my Fitbit went unresponsive. Restarting the product did nothing, and I got the "white screen of death." I am currently going through the warranty process to get a new unit, but at this point I wish I had not made the investment and had stayed with my previous product. I'm quite disappointed in the brand and I don't really see a need to keep trying out their new products in the future. I am always the type to read reviews and recognize that lemons happen, but after seeing the experience of others this seems to be a more widespread issue.
 Solo quería agradecer por esta herramienta increíble de bienestar, en pocas semanas es increíble como ha mejorado mi vida y como (por fin) la tecnología está siendo usada a mi favor. Este dispositivo es simplemente increíble, si ha presentado algunas fallas (mínimas) pero en general es una herramienta absoluta de bienestar y mejoramiento de vida. Y si hay dudas no me pagaron por este revide (ojalá) jaja de vdd recomiendo este dispositivo es genial !
 I pre ordered a Fitbit versa directly from Fitbit.  I was so excited about it. Well it is a very nice looking tracker but it doesn't seem to track my steps or sleep very well. I have gone through 2 Fitbit charge 2's.  My charge 2 would usually say I was awake or restless for 10 -20 minutes a night. The versa has me awake for 40 -60 minutes a night. And a lot of nights it will say I was awake 10 -30 minutes at a time. I would remember being awake for that long. All they could tell me from Fitbit was to tighten the band. I laughed when I heard they were going to try to get into the business of helping doctors diagnose sleep apnea. Not with the versa. It also seems to count on average25% less steps than my old Charge 2. It is much nicer looking than the charge, but not close to accurate. So for me not with the money I paid for it .
 I bought this when it first came out. It wouldn’t connect to blue tooth classic, which is needed for many functions.<br/>I recently tried again, it still will not connect.<br/>Look on the internet and see all the complaints about this. Fitbit offers blithe canned answers in response to complaints but does not offer any real help. I’m so glad I have an Apple Watch that works flawlessly.
 I got this when Fitbit first came out with the Versa last year and it's now dead. It turns on and then the screen slowly fades to black even after being charged all night. We've tried the Fitbit ionic and versa now and both stopped working. We're really trying to steer clear of the apple watches but after two watches just completely dying, it may be time
 I bought the Alta HR, which uses the same sensing technology and backend software.  You can see my review on its Amazon page.  The bottom line:  FitBit devices all suffer from serious flaws tracking almost everything, but especially sleep. Just do the research via Google.  You've been warned! :-)
 Its been over 30 mins and it finally gave options to go through the settings, but my wife's phone is still saying updating.  Worse experience ever with this fitbit and i've been buying my wife a new pair every 2 years since that appears to be their lifespan.  If she breaks this again or if it falls apart, she is on her own.
 I’ve had it for a few months now, and I hate it. I felt like I was lied too, it’s so glitchy. It’s always freezing. It has a horrible charging life. If I would have known I never would have bought it. SAVE YOUR MONEY. BY SOMETHING ELSE.
 I really did like this product, but the band kept randomly disconnecting from the watch. I usually caught it and would reattach the pins into the watch, and tug at it a few times to make sure it was locked in place. However, when I was at the airport, it fell off without me noticing, and I lost the watch after having it only 4 months. I wouldn't recommend this product for that reason - there seems to be a design flaw in the bands connecting to the watch. Fitbit doesn't cover "lost" products, which I understand, but I do hope they fix this issue. From my Googling, this doesn't appear to be uncommon, which makes me think it's a faulty design rather than a "lost" product.
 I bought this as a present for my mom. She had an old Fitbit that was starting to die on her. I read good reviews about this watch and was excited to buy it for my mom as a x-mas present. She does like that fact that it’s slimmer then previous edit bits she has had in the past, but the pedometer seems to be out of control.<br/>My mom is a stay at home grandma and watches helps watching my kids. She doesn’t walk much and about half way through the day it shows she has walked about 10,000 steps! It doesn’t seems to be too accurate and she really wanted it for the pedometer feature!!! Would really help if they can foxy this issue because there is now way she walks 10,000 steps before noon.
 I bought this product (Fitbit Versa SmartWatch) in December 2018 for Christmas but it worked till Feb 3th and completely stopped working. I just realized that the return of the product is allowed until January 2019.  It surprises me that this product packed up just 3days after the warranty expired. I will not recommend this product to anyone. It worked for less than 2 months and packed up.
 Love the functionality. Compared to iWatch, very few apps, but I love the balance between being connected and not having a phone on my wrist. It’s everything great about the HR, plus swim proof, intuitive function and stylish.
 I have the pink versa Fitbit. I had went back and forth and between this and the Apple Watch. Not wanting to pay $400 so I looked into different alternatives. And I’m am so pleasantly please. I’m so happy I made this decision. For starters just having it makes me want to work out so I can enjoy all the features. It has workouts included in the watch. It’s super cute. And of course everything Fitbit is already known for. It can sync messages so I know when I get text and such. I do have an Apple phone so I can’t respond from my watch, but androids can. I hope they update this feature but even without it I’m still pretty estatic. I go to the gym way more often just so I can play with it. So yea. Pretty dope product.
 Felt a bit cheated with this purchase - I've wanted to upgrade to some sort of sleeping/fit-bit monitoring device for a while, the moment I took it out of its packaging, the device wouldn't start. Feels like more of an expensive paperweight than anything. If it worked as advertised, my review probably would be 4 stars. Otherwise, I would save your money. There are far better monitors/trackers
 WARNING ! Buyer beware all Fitbit merchandise not compatible with Samsung Note 9.  It's been approx 6 months since release of Note 9 and Fitbit still has not  added the Note 9 onto its compatibility list or created firmware dont waste your money if you have a Note 9 !!!!
 My husband brought me this watch last Friday and I really love it. It is my first smart watch and I'm very impressed with it. I am going to buy another band, one that is more dressy to wear with my dressy clothes but the bands that come with it not bad just a little bulky for my taste.
 At first it worked really well.  But after a few months all the tracking was off.  Steps were way off. Said I was riding a bike when ever I was in the car.  Sleep tracking was off.<br/>I also bought one for a friend and it died after 4 months!<br/>I went back to my IONIC!
 I purchased the versa and loved it.  Two weeks later the screen went dark.  I called customer service and after a couple hours trouble shooting they sent me another one.  I purchased the versa for the heart monitoring and the heart monitor did not work on the second one.  I called customer service and was told only one replacement per customer.  So they sent me a defective replacement and if I want a versa I need to go out and buy another.  I guess they have a policy of two lemons per customer.  I checked the internet and a lot of people had my same issues.
 Bought this when it was released earlier this year from Amazon. It worked for 3 weeks before the battery refused to hold a charge. I tried working with customer service for an RMA, but the service representative kept asking for more and more details over a very protected time period. One point, they wanted me to video tape my device and send them the video. I didnt have time to do this whole "jumping through flaming hoops" deal. I gave up and now I have an expensive paperweight. It worked great, until it didn't. Customer service was poor. Very, very poor.
 Love it! Hate to take it off. I use get more steps each day. I have helped each of my family members get one, even my grandmother! I also check my heart rate when people I love or don't enjoy come around, it works!! It's the best thing after sliced bread!
 The screen cracked just over a week after I started wearing it (even with a screen protector).  For something that is supposed to be used for activity it is poorly designed.  The functionality is great if it had not broken so easily.
 I was really happy with my first FitBit purchase for a grand total of five weeks.  After the fifth week i started having constant problems with the watch becoming useless for anything other than a watch because it will not sinc with my Wi-Fi. Constantly having to get it back is driving me batty. I lost my text alerts fairly early on and I now have lost most of the other features. Originally it was holding a charge for up to five days.  Now it’s down to about two.<br/>I was planning to keep working with it, but I have decided to send it back tomorrow. A two hundred dollar plus purchase should last longer than two months and I’m getting very little out of it at this point.  I would NOT recommend this product and I’m really disappointed.
 Love it! I've only had it a week, but it is my new, fav, gadget. It does SO much more than the Fit Bit HR. Love the weather feature. I would have done 5 stars, but it could be more user friendly. Definetly check out a you tube video. I bought the pink one, love the color.
 I want to start out by saying I love this watch. I love the design. I love the apps and the layout.<br/><br/>However, I am only giving a one star because the step counter doesnt work. I am constantly getting ghost steps and I've had it for 4 days. Still debating on returning it. I've had a fitbit for years and none of my previous ones ever had ghost steps. This is a major design flaw especially for a product that's sole purpose is to record ACCURATE activity. When it's been on a charger all night and hasnt been worn but I not have 10,000 steps that's a problem.<br/>I've tried all the tricks I've read on the Fitbit community and no luck.<br/><br/>I'd say save your money and wait until fitbit has resolved this issue
 I just bought the Fitbit versa special edition. I can't get over how light weight. It is on wrist. The set-up. Was very easy. One little bump in the road. But shouldn't be playing with phone. There is also another of watch faces to choose from. I really like the charging dock. Instead of the plug in,or the magnetic plug. From other Fitbit.
 My biggest problem with it is the heartbeat it’s all over the place and that’s a problem. The purpose of a fitness watch is to be able to track things when the heartbeat is off. Then your tracking is limited running it will say 89 but I know I’m more 170 that’s bad.
 Versa tracks pace and distance for static workouts (e.g. weight lifting) which is useless information. Fitbit has been aware of this bug since November 2017 and the issues has not been fixed. Thousands of complaints on their community but they don't seem to care.  My advice is go with a brand that listens and cares about their customers.
 I am now coming up on one year of having my Versa and I should have saved my money and got an Apple Watch. Within the first few months of having the versa, I stopped receiving notifications of text messages and calls on my watch. I did reach out to customer service and community but they had no real solution. Now, the face of my watch mysteriously popped out while I was sweeping the floor (no strenuous activity) and it’s not covered under their warranty. I would recommend spending a little more for quality.
 I purchased the Versa directly through the Fitbit website. I have become so disillusioned with it I had to leave my review for it hear too... maybe save someone else some $. This watch looks good, but is definitely not ready for prime time.<br/><br/>I have gone through 2 Fitbit Versas. The shelf life of this watch seems to be 2 to 3 months before it starts acting up. The heart rate stops reading accurately. It begins wildly overestimating your heart's BPM during light activity like sitting. No activity recorded (of course because you're just sitting) but your heart rate will register in the cardio or peak zone. Having this one inaccurate reading causes a cascade effect... Your calories burned are wildly inaccurate, sleep data off... Two Versas in the span of 6 months, same issue. Apparently Fitbit techs are aware of the problem. Months later they still have no workable solution. Contact them and they will ask you to be patient while they spend weeks and months trying to figure out the kink in their product.I had to badger Fitbit customer service to honor their company warranty and replace my watch the first go round. Now I'm just disgusted with it. Chalk it up to loss. $200 that could've gone to a product that actually worked properly beyond 90 days.  Heed this warning and save youself some aggravation. THE FITBIT VERSA IS TRASH!!!
 I've had mine for over a month now and I really like it. I was recently diagnosed was tachycardia and I wanted to find a fitness tracker that had a heart rate monitor so I could keep track of it. My only complaint at first was the battery life. It was advertised as four days but mine was lasting about half that. A quick Google search let me know that I had to turn off some of my notifications and the auto screen awake. That did the trick, now I have no complaints.
 I have a lot of problems with my Versa. Problems syncing to my iPhone. Battery dying prematurely. It’s been three months now of not working right and I am so tired of it and I am ready to return this thing… It’s not worth the hassle and would like a refund, please! No more playing around… I wouldn’t recommend it and will not buy one again
 This could have been a good review, the product worked great, however my wife's screen cracked on her watch after only 3 days after receiving it as a Christmas gift.  We then contacted customer support and the best they could offer was 25% off of a new one.  Why would we spend all that money for a product that last three days and the manufacturer doesn't back up? We wouldn't.
 Nosotros compramos el fitbit versa para mi esposo y para mi lamentablemente la bateria le fallo al mes que haberlo comprado y es muy rapido para que fallara se descargaba muy rapido de un dia para otro y ahora el mio igual esta lo cargo casi diario y segun la bateria es para 4 dias mmmm lo dudo mucho la verdad si me gusta mucho pero me siento muy decepcionada de FITBIT es un robo ya que no es tan barato y para que se le descargue la bateria en un dia co mo que no los compramos en Diciembre asi que jamas vuelvo a comprar ni mucho menos a recomendarlo DECEPCIONADA
 Buyer beware!!! Go to the fitbit.com/devices and make sure your phone is listed or you will have trouble getting it to sync.  My Charge worked fine but the Versa does not even if you try to force it, reboot everything, turn bluetooth on and off.... Their help desk is nice and says we are adding new devices to their list every day, well that was sure helpful.  Also the list of credit card providers is missing a few big names for the wallet feature.  It would get a higher value rating if it actually worked.
 Buyer beware, the Versa does not work with iPhone XR.  Just talked to fitbit customer service, because it is a new phone, they don't know when it will work with the XR.  Their advice: keep trying, some day it will work.  In the meantime, use your iPad. Don't buy yet if you don't want this inconvenience.
 Loved my Versa when I first got it last year.  I guess with any new product it pays to wait and see if there are any bugs... well after less then a year my battery has gone from lasting 2-3 days to barely a day.  I am still within my warrently but customer service wants to tell me all the things I’m doing wrong, like how I’m not charging my Fitbit correctly. But I haven’t changed how I charge it since day one.  Very frustrating...should have went with an Apple Watch...better reliability and customer service.
 Upgraded from Charge 2. The versa is sleek and beautiful. Setup is straight forward. She loves the bloom clock face.
 Terrible.  After 1 month, I am still trying to figure out why this watch is so dumb.  Most of the fitness tracking features do not work.  Steps over count, sleep tracking is terrible - I get steps when I drive, sleep and even when I am not wearing the Versa.  When I select biking for my exercise activity on the Versa, then go for a 2 hour bike ride, it still gives me 10,000+ steps during the same time!  WHAT KIND OF SMART WATCH IS THIS?  The only saving grace is the battery life is excellent.  Notifications are spotty on android and stop working often.  Then you have to shut it down, close app, turn of bluetooth on phone, repair etc to get it back again. Then a few days later, rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>The Versa has great battery life, looks good, is light weight.  Everything else - all smart watch functions, fitness tracking and app is terrible.  I have owned a Pebble Time, Samsung Gear S2 Classic and they were far better than the Versa.
 My Fitbit quit receiving notifications from my phone about a week ago.  I've had it about 2 months.  It is extremely frustrating.  I like it for monitoring my heart rate and my sleep but that's all I use this for.  The call and text notifications were awesome when it worked but I cannot get them any longer.  This was a gift and that's the only reason I still have it.  If I had spent my own money on this I would be very upset.  Don't buy this if you are thinking it will be a good alternative to an Apple Watch.  You'll be wasting your money.
 I love the actual watch! However...it doesn’t sync. I have tried everything (following all the tips from online posts), but this seems to be a common problem. Most think it is an app problem and not the actual watch. Really hoping Fitbit will get it fixed soon!  I just bought my daughter the Fitbit Ace and we were looking forward to being able to track each other‘s progress. However, mine does not sync so that is not possible right now.
 It was a great step counter and checking notifications was awesome. Let down that we couldn’t reply to messages like the Apple Watch. For workouts it was so/so. But coming from the Charge 2+, this was awesome.<br/><br/>After about two months the screen gave out. If you image search Versa Screen Glitch you’ll know what I’m talking about. Customer service gave me the run around until I put my foot down. After three days of talking with them they have accepted and shipped a free replacement.<br/><br/>45 day refund with Fitbit and one year warranty from purchase. If I’m not mistaken.
 So far I am extremely disappointed and upset with this! It has so many glitches, I wish I would've kept the charge 2!
 Sleek design. I like how thin it is and I have a small wrist . Day 4 and still have not had to charge it yet ! Very happy with it!
 I bought the Versa a little over six months ago.  Its been a great watch as advertised.<br/><br/>Now I'm completely upset.  This watch's battery usually lasted up to three days until I recieved a FIRMWARE UPDATE during Christmas.  Now my watch won't stay charged longer than a day.  Thanks FitBit for the obsolescence of your products.  You should sell out to Apple.
 Versa stopped syncing with my android, and since them can't adjust the time on the watch.
 Dead as a door nail after three trips to the pool. First trip was succesful last two not so much. My wife bought this for me for triathlon training in the pool. Been a Fitbit fan for a long time. Called and got a run around from CSA. I’ll return it to where I bought it not worth the run around. Sorry Fitbit maybe I need an Apple Watch. I remember when you had good customer service. What a shame
 You may like it now, but give it 4 months and the heart rate monitor stops being as accurate. I also strongly discourage wearing it while swimming - though it says you can. I’ve had to replace it twice after wearing it for a swim workout. Not to mention they stopped with the warranty at Best Buy, and yes it’s because they break so often. I’m definitely going to be trying a different brand that was recommended to me.
 It's a great watch that works well and I absolutely loved it but my first one was fried after wearing it in the shower a few times  and my second one shattered from a two foot fall 5 seconds after taking it off to get in the lake so that it wouldn't short out again. It would be a great watch if it wasn't so fragile and could actually withstand everyday use.
 I got the versa for Christmas and LOVED IT, however, the last few weeks I noticed it wasn’t keeping charges nearly as long as it used to. Then yesterday it just went dead, won’t chare, won’t turn on nothing. I didn’t drop it or anything.
 This thing is my sanity life line. I have ptsd from ppcm related cardiac arrest, my boyfriend bought this for me to see my heart beat and calm myself when I panic. It has a relax feature that helps you calm with breathing and literally everything else I could ever want two thumbs up !!!
 I have purchased  3 of these and all three are super slow. I do not recommend what so ever. Your better off with the Charge HR2 or Ionic.<br/><br/>When you get the Versa you have to update the software and that can take anywhere from 30min to 4hours.  Its is a terrible user experience. Trust me you better off with a Charge HR 2 or ionic. I have owned almost all models except the Blaze and by far the versa is Horrible. I dont even know why they sell it.
 I like the look and the design of the watch and its functionality is very useful. My issues w i'lth ot are mainly from the limited music selection options. I do listen to Deezer or Pandora, I'm more of a spotify or Amazon prime person. So I cant bring myself to pay for one of those since I already have a preferred music app. The watch needs more options for music. Everything else is great though!
 I bought this item because I wanted the phone free music. I tried for months with several very long conversations with Fitbit customer service to get music loaded onto it. They even sent me another because mine wasn't working (which I do appreciate very much) but it did no good. Still no music. That's the whole reason I bought this fitness watch in the first place. So, now I have a $200 pedometer. :(
 DO NOT BUY THIS FITBIT! I ordered my Fitbit in late July 2018, less than 6 months have passed. Since then I have had to call Fitbit customer service 4 times for replacement devices. Software malfunctions, screens freeze, and the latest FALLING APART. I was in the shower with my Fitbit, like I do daily. I looked down (while in the shower) to see that my Fitbit was open. I panicked ripped it off my wrist and threw it outside of the shower. I had no idea if it could or would electrocute me. Terrifying.
 Sooo worth the money! It's very affordable, fashionable, all around versatile! It is the lightest watch I've ever worn and it's so amazing!
 I bought this as an upgrade to my Blaze as it is waterproof and I can wear it during swims.<br/><br/>Main problem is the abysmal battery life. FitBit advertises 4 days battery life but the versa is drained in 24 hrs even if you leave it on it’s own.<br/><br/>I have restarted it, turned of quick view, turned off BT to GPS during runs, factory reset it. Nothing works. My blaze had a 5 day battery life. This barely lasts one day.<br/><br/>The only reason I bought this over the Apple Watch series 3 was the battery life.  They have gotten rid of that reason.
 It is an awesome fitness monitor; however, fashionable it is not. It looks cheap. It looks like only an athlete would wear it. I wish it would be fashionably attractive, aesthetically pleasing.
 I love the light weight and design of this new Fitbit. Phone notifications are a little slow. I was hoping it would improve from my Blaze but it's a great upgrade.
 Tried their solutions for water damage. It did not work. Tried calling. No solution Big offer of 25% off a new Fitbit. WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY ANOTHER ONE AFTER HAVING ONE FITBIT LAST 13 MONTHS AND ANOTHER LAST 17 MONTHS?<br/>Very poor product with exceptional planned obsolescence. AVOID FITBIT.
 The Versa worked pretty well for about 1 year and thats it. second time with the same results. i wont buy another one. also, the company apps for updating and syncing are simply awful.
 Great for on the go moms like me that likes to keep track of her health without a fuss.
 I bought this watch/fitness tracker in the end of Nov 2018, so it has been 2 months now and I can say it does EXACTLY what it promises. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the syncing is sometimes slow and the step counting is to some extent is not accurate. I sometimes find that I have extra 50 steps when all I was doing is driving my car but I guess  this is the case with all fitness trackers. Otherwise it does everything as expected.
 I love how its sleek not bulky. Love this style. Thought you could text back but I guess that’s only for Android. Not happy about that. I’ve had 3 different Fitbit styles so far. I was going to switch to an I watch but Fitbit won again.
 Not even worth 1 star, but I couldn't post without at least giving 1 star. The Versa Special Edition can't log stair count, PERIOD! And the battery doesn't last 2 days even with minimal notifications allowed. Save your money and buy anything,  BUT NOT FITBIT! The company is too busy trying to put newer versions on the market without working out the issues on the previously released versions that people have already thrown their money away on.
 Love the look and fit of this one compared to my previous Fitbit charge HR. It has different apps which is nice, however would be better if you didn’t have to have premium accounts on the apps for them to work. Pandora will not work with the normal free version. Also would like the timer to stay on the front without the screen going black if I’m not looking at it. With that being said I still very much enjoy this watch and recommend it
 This is the worst product fitbit has made. I have 2: one purchased here for my husband and one through fitbit direct. I am very disappointed with both. I have had a charge HR and a charge HR 2 in the past that worked very well. If you're aiming for this for fitness use, go for one of those- the versa is more expensive and less functional.<br/>Here are the issues with the Versa:<br/>The GPS feature NEVER works. It cannot report back a map of the running route.<br/>If I run and walk the SAME distance, it will report very different mileage. For example, my regular run is 3.1 miles. When I walk this same distance, it reports it as 2.3 miles. Google maps says it is 3.0 miles....<br/>The outdoor bike feature does not work at all - says I went 0 miles at 0mph after a couple miles of riding.<br/>Notifications require regular restarting of my phone and are often delayed (i.e. I will have already answered the call when fitbit notification start).<br/>Syncing now requires an intense amount of battery power from your phone and tries to run in the background draining your phone battery.<br/>The women's health feature is oversold. This is no different than just writing on a calendar yourself (you have to input all information and the only predication which occurs depends on a cycle length which you also have to input).<br/><br/>"Positive" features:<br/>I like having Pandora on my fitbit so that I do not need a phone when I run. ... but be warned. This only works with paid Pandora subscriptions and you have to download your top 3 stations so whatever station you regularly listen to in your car HAS to be the station you download. You cannot pick and choose stations. The only alternative to this are using 3 pre-defined playlists from Pandora- I went with this option but unfortunately find myself changing the music a lot while I run.<br/>Bluetooth headphones easy to connect.<br/>No water issues. I have swam laps with it. I never put it deeper than ~2 feet though.
 I have had 2 Fitbit trackers.  Both failed just outside of the 1-year warranty period, and Fitbit could not provide a fix for either problem.  Even though I had already bought a 3rd tracker, the best Fitbit would offer was a 25% discount on yet another tracker.  That does not indicate Fitbit stands behind its product or values it’s customers’ loyalty!
 I have had the fitbit versa for 4 days now and absolutely love it! It was a little tricky to get it setup but after a few tries i was able to get it. It has every app that i need or want. Syncs automatically. First Fitbit and I'm a Fitbit fan for life!
 Not the best with letting us know when things change (like adding permissions for Clock Faces without telling us so things just stop working). Not sure why my Fitbit can't let me know that its battery is low and it requires an email instead. But issues aside, it's a good device.
 The fitbit had already been opened and all of the packaging seals were broken and the device had already been turned on, the screen protector was already removed and the bands had been switched out.  If I am paying $200 I expect a new product, not a used one.
 Great watch which motivates me to stay fit with excellent tracking. Nice and affordable alternative to Apple watches. The dispaly and touch works well. The Fitbit app allows to control your devices fully. It is a fantastic buy !!
 This watch has a lot to be work on, its very limited. The apps are limited and so is the option to text it only allow you to send 5 responds that are pre-set and the same apply for the email. The color is cute but not worth the money, I cant honestly say my Michael Kor is 10 times better than this.... Fitbit really need to upgrade. This watch is only good for working out and HR and things having to do with physical
 Heart Rate measurement is inaccurate.  when my heart rate is at 145bpm, the Versa reads around 115bpm.<br/>So what possible use is this toy?
 The pins that hold on the band are absolute garbage. They pop out frequently and easily during normal activities. I wouldn't trust it to swim in because I don't want it to fall off and sink to the bottom. Also, the pins are extremely fragile! Within 2 weeks I broke the one in the large band, replaced it with a the one from the small band, and broke that one too! Other than that it seems to work fine...
 This is a big problem with the Versa. If I go on a 20-mile bike ride it will log at least 7,000 steps...What??? Lot's of complaints on the web regarding this. The Fitbit Blaze did not do this.  There doesn't seem to be anything that can be done to fix this.
 Love love it....it was an upgrade for the Charge 2 that I’ve had for the past 2 years...let’s see how it goes
 Still getting acclimated. So far, aesthetically, it is MUCH better than the Blaze, much more like the Apple Watch.  Wishing it had some more features the Apple Watch offers like replying to a text, etc, but much prefer Fitbit for actual tracking of exercise, sleep etc than Apple.
 I love the versa. I had a charge 2 and liked it but lost it.<br/>This is much better. Easy to see in daylight, waterproof, more flexibly in display. Love it!
 Love the look but I had to do a factory reset to get it to work after it stopped syncing with my phone. Still, it’s a great watch. I love how it controls my music from my phone.
 One of the worst-designed pieces of technology I've ever tried to tolerate.  Doesn't connect to most Bluetooth devices without a fight.  Doesn't control media on my phone, period.  Doesn't actually stream Pandora!  That's a lie they are using to sell the product.  What it does is download a handful of songs from each of a handful of stations (and will ONLY do this while in its charging cradle), and plays those on shuffle.  I heard the same song half a dozen times in a day.  Freezes, runs slowly, refuses to update or sync at random.  Basically a Blaze with a sleeker exterior, for all you can reliably do with it.  When I put mine back in the box to return it, it was 20 minutes in to trying to connect to a Bluetooth speaker that had previously worked with it, and works instantly with other devices.  I couldn't get it to stop trying, or even turn the screen off.  Total garbage product, and FitBit knows it--inquiries about some of these issues are met with "Our engineers are aware of the problem, and working on a solution."  They know it's bad tech, but they're selling it anyway!
 I purchased the Special Edition Versa directly from Fitbit. The product has never worked properly. It fails to sync unless the phone (fully-supported Nexus 6P) is restarted. The Fitbit payment app does not work and I cannot sync to set up any of the other apps (e.g., Starbucks app). Moreover, the GPS would not connect with the phone, giving no GPS functionality. I spent hours troubleshooting with Fitbit support, but that resolved nothing and instead caused a new problem - the battery goes from 100% to 0% in ~5 hours.<br/><br/>Customer service is not "empowered" to make any effort to resolve this, leaving me only with the option to return the device and hope a replacement is better.<br/><br/>Check out Fitbit forums and other customer review sites (frontpage of the internet) and there are countless numbers of complaints about very similar issues. This watch was rushed to market before quarterly earnings in an effort to bump stock prices.<br/><br/>2 stars because it does track the time (until the battery dies, at least)
 The sleep stage function worked for awhile, then didn't, I reset the device and it worked for one night only, then stopped again.  Do not waste $200 on this product. Works inconsistently, then doesn't for no apparent reason. Bite the bullet and get either an Apple watch or an Android Smartwatch that has the Fitbit features plus a lot more. I am returning this Fitbit. Not ready for prime time.
 This fitness watch is the best one I have had... fit bit out did itself with this one... the different exercise to choose from makes your tracking more accurate, it's waterproof which is awesome for laps in the pool... best one yet and for the price you can't beat it
 I really like my new fit bit! It’s really kept me moving since I bought it. It’s nice that it prompts you if you’ve been sitting too long. I like that since I have a desk job and I hate sitting all day!! I also like it monitors my sleep. I have to get used to wearing it at night though you can add you food and water intake as well. It’s pretty nifty. I wish it came with more bands though. I really like my fit bit. You will too!
 Great watch. I love being able to see my text messages and answer. Only complaint is not being able to type out an answer but if I really had a problem with that I would've went for a different smart watch. The fitbit app is very easy to navigate too. Overall, just an awesome watch!
 I bought the Versa and was excited to start using it. Unfotunatly, my new phone is not a supported device so it won't update the apps. Also, you cannot us an wifi that is encrypted, you have to unencrypt your wifi to update apps. I returned mine after speaking with tech support at Fitbit
 This product is really useful and I love how it tracks your sleep patterns. There’s a bunch of fun and useful apps that you can download on it too to personalize your experience. One recommendation if you have the normal rubber ish band is to make sure you dry off under it and keep your wrist clean. I had a problem where my skin didn’t dry so it started peeling in a spot. Ouch 😬.
 I bought three of these. One for me and two for gifts. I can't stand to be without mine. It tracks sleep, I can read my texts and emails! I love this watch sooo much!!
 This happened in the shower...suppose to be waterproof? Ruined, not working 5 months old. Hoping they replace it.
 We have had 2 Charge 2's stop charging after less than a year of use. Now my Ionic is also failing by counting 1 step per second while sitting on my table and flashing on and off. Tech support was Zero help all 3 times. I will never purchase another Fitbit product and I highly recommend you do not waste your money.
 I like it because you can really customize it. It has more clock faces. It is sleeker and smoother than the rest. When I first saw it on someone’s arm, I thought it was an Apple Watch. I also love that it comes with two different size watch bands.
 Love it! I upgraded from the Blaze and this is way better. It is loaded with way more new features than the website describes.
 I haven't had the versa long, but I like it so far.  I love that it is water proof.
 I have used Fitbits in the past, and this one has the worst tracking ever!<br/><br/>I bought this because I didn’t want to break the bank buying an Apple Watch.  I love the look and feel of the watch.  It is unobtrusive, and comfortable to wear all day.  Battery life is great.  Decent amount of “watch faces” to change the look of the watch.  Syncing with the app is simple and fast.<br/>Now the cons.... the Versa is WILDY INACCURATE!  I woke up one morning with 127 steps.  While driving, it will notify me that I am close to my step total and before the ride is over, it will notify me that I reached my goal.  This has happened twice so far.  I am honestly thinking of returning it.  I estimate over the weekend when I did not leave the house, I took at the most, 500 steps.  The Versa had me at 13,374.<br/>I am pretty disappointed in the Versa and Fitbit let me down this time.  I only gave a 3 because it is actually a good watch, but not that smart of a watch.<br/><br/>Get it together Fitbit!
 Battery life so far seems kinda weak.  Can't reply to texts on the device (no quick replies even).  Hue lights app doesn't change colors - even though it seems to support that feature.<br/><br/>Looks like it was released too early, without enough live testing.  Considering returning the device.
 This watch is incredible. My wife tracks her fitnes, sleep, steps, calories, etc! She loves it. And it looks so sleek.
 A great watch and fitness tracker. Many features such as Starbucks, music, weather, etc. only thing I don’t care for is a lot of times it doesn’t show my heart rate, and I have to go to the app to see It.
 Lights cause skin burns and make battery run out.... I miss the pebble.....
 This product cannot be setup for a child. I bought this for my teen daughter and found out it can't be attached to a child account. Really frustrating as a parent.. No parental controls.. Fitbit please fix this!
 Comfortable and has excellent display design and information. Easy setup. Long duration battery
 Came in undamaged. Everything is good so far that ive been using it and its cute!! Love my fitbit!:)
 Was really excited to get my new Fitbit.. until I realized how crappy it really is. It would not sync with my phone at all. Returning it and going with the Apple Watch.
 got this as a gift, works well! notifications received on note 9
 As you can see from the photo, I  am stuck eith half a screen more on than off since the beginning. I  callef Fitbit to no avsil
 Simple and useful, but doesn’t seem durable.
 Have always loved Fitbit, but this is my favorite. Already have used them for years, but my newest one stopped working randomly (never had a problem with any of their products before,) and they sent me a new one for free.
 I love this Fitbit! It’s very nice looking and works well. It is not a “smart watch” if that’s what you’re looking for but it is more advanced than the other Fitbit. There’s a lot more options for fitness related things, which is what I got it for.
 I thought it was a great product until I had to contact Fitbit Support.  This makes the product less than acceptable.  After removing from the box, I managed to get my android phone and Windows PC to recognize the device and it works very well with the Fitbit App.  The problem is that it needs to have the firmware upgraded but it will not connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth under any circumstances, with is required.  I contacted support and it was the worst I've encountered so far.  The tech had me install, remove and reinstall twice on 2 different PC's and 2 different android phones, including a factory reset, which means I lost all my data, but they are now insisting that I create a video of myself performing another factory reset and sending to them before they can escalate my support call.  Beyond ridiculous so I will be returning.
 Don’t seem to use it for much other then the steps and the timer.  I do like the reminder to move
 Stylish, light and very useful. It was for a gift to my sister and she was delighted with the watch.
 I have used fitbit watches for about 4 years. I have gone through 2 original charge HRs and most recently the special edition versa. My first fitbit broke while working with students in Autism. I had had it for just over a year and Fitbit would not replace it but offered a new one for a cheaper price then buying it elsewhere. I purchased it and it broke even faster and was not replaceable through fitbit. I looked into newer ones and was between this and an apple (which I hate) but have heard great things. After looking into it, it came down to price. This was about a third of the price of the apple versions. I went with this and had it for maybe 4 months. When i was writing, the latches opened and the watch face fell, hitting the ground, shattering the entire screen. Fitbit said this was not covered but they could send me a new band. . . I will never again biy a fitbit product and as a waitress in 2 restaurants and a part time student will be sure to voice my opinion to help others avoid this situation.
 Feels like fitness first and smart watch second. Has all the fitness recording functionalities, even more. This version has Fitbit pay, music, other apps. No comparison to Apple watch, though look like. Differences are there , of course not paying that much, am a satisfied customer with all 5 stars to the gadget. Recommend if you are looking to begin a smart watch relation.
 Husband loves his watch
 The watch worked well for a month then started over heating and refused to charge; the Fitbit company was kind enough to replace it however the replacement refuse to connect to WiFi
 The Versa is a 100% improvement over the Alta.  The screen is super easy to read and I love the sleep portion.  It really motivates me to get more sleep!
 Bought this at Best Buy and use it everyday. Love it!
 Love it! Sometimes the watchface doesn’t light up right away when I go to look at the time. But other than that I am very happy with it!<br/><br/>Love the automatic sleep tracking and automatic exercise tracking
 It’s light, good looking, with good battery life (around 4 days). But it can easily get scratched, the charger’s clamps are not the smartest idea, and if you choose a clock face that’s larger than 150kb of size it gets really slow
 Very happy with my Fitbit Versa purchase. Very comfortable, looks great and a fantastic motivator. Everything is working as expected notification on calls and messages. Some nice apps to download, a couple of my favorites are a stock tracing app and the golf GPS app so I can see my yardage on my wrist when golfing.
 I’ve tried so many fitness watches, and this,by far, beats them all.
 A definite up garage to the basic jawbone.
 Watch is less than a year old but the charging function quit working.  The power is being delivered (I tested the voltage at the output of the charging cable.)  Now the face is blank and there seems no way to bring it back to life!
 Bought a Versa and spent three hours on the phone with Fitbit support.  The Versa needed the firmware updated in order to move forward. However, the Versa could never find the WiFi despite repeated attempt, including using a hotspot.  REturning it.
 Love all the features, information and abilities of the Versa. Love it!
 I’m slowly growing to love my versa. It’s taken a little getting used to the big face, especially since i had the charge! And I’m totally in LOVE with the Rose Gold color!! At first I was displeased because it would not sync or pair with my phone(iPhone 7 Plus). I had to delete the entire app and start from the beginning.
 The best smartwatch I’ve tried! The battery life is incredible (4-5 days).
 Love the flexibility
 Love it. I am actually encouraged to move more. I got in 10,000 steps already today
 Do not buy. Watch bands do not stay on device. Mine came off three times without me realizing it. Finally the last time I lost it was in airport security when taking my backpack off. The watch must have fell off and now it's gone forever.<br/>I def wouldn't buy another one.
 Awesome upgrade from an older Fitbit
 Watch was perfect worked well in the pool.  Was very easy to work and has a tone of watch faces.  Only complaint is that it does not act like a phone to speak or hear from like the Samsung or apple.
 Such a great and beautiful watch and wearable tech! Was a good choice my better half gifted me. Love it!
 Product does not pair with Android devices am going to send back
 So far, so good. Still learning all the particulars, but it's fun.
 My first fitness tracker. Didn't like the wrist band it came with, but you can easily change bands on the fly.<br/>So far, no complaints...
 I don't know if it's my Pixel 2 or the versa but I lose Bluetooth connection too much. So the point of syncing up the two for my texts, emails and caller ID becomes a moot point. I like the tech in the watch and the new fitness side to it but I need it to connect all the time.
 Excellent features
 Es una porqueria, es mejor comprar un samsung por el mismo precio y hace mucho mas
 It is awesome. I made the switch from the Charge 2 and dont regret it.
 I love it. Coast is reasonably and it works nice.
 My battery only lasts 1 day. I have to charge it every night which makes the sleep tracker completely useless. I have deleted as many apps as possible with no improvement in battery life. Screen scuffs very very easily.
 Love this Fitbit, especially the fact that I get all the perks of Fitbit as well as now have the ability to get text and phone call notifications as well.
 Watch has a malfunction where the screen stops working, there will be a glow and that’s it. Resetting it every time works for some people but mine the screen never reappears. Now I have a nice $200 bracelet. Frustrated to say the least
 I have the rose gold and love it. Tracks my steps, heart rate and sleep cycles. Lots of faces to choose from. Had notifications for calls, texts etc.
 Love that I can change the face designs !
 Will not sync to text messages as claimed.  Wasted over one hour onnohibe with Fitbit and numerous ensigns to tech support andcthry dint know jyw to fix.  Starting reading messages and seems many people have this issue.  Must likely will be returning soon
 The fact that it malfunctioned two days in and stopped . blank screen nothing .
 Battery life should be better
 UPDATE AT BOTTOM-<br/><br/>So first with opening the package, it was missing one of the extra watch bands. After some issues getting the Versa to sync- I charged it and had a lovely hour and a half with it before it completely shut off and starting heating up. I took it off and it continued to heat up even hotter. Called Fitbit support and they’re having me send it back and 5-10 business days after they have looked at it, they’ll send me a replacement that’ll take up to 2 weeks to get to me.... I really hope I just got a bad one but regardless- not happy about this purchase even though I’ve been in love with Fitbit in the past.<br/><br/>UPDATE I’m just exchanging to Amazon instead. But it looks like it’ll take even longer to get a replacement (May 31 😭😭😭)<br/><br/>UPDATE UPDATE 😆- I returned the original to amazon (still waiting for a refund...) and went ahead and bought one in a color I didn’t want at Target in person. I had the Blaze before and this is basically a waterproof one piece blaze. The first few days the heart rate, stairs, and steps were totally off but now after a few days it’s seemed to normalize. Sometimes the watch says my stats are different than the app says, even after syncing. And the app is constantly telling me to connect my watch to WiFi (which it is usually. Stay at home mom here). I’m happy to have a Fitbit again but it definitely didn’t live up to the hype.
 The first month was OK, after I was able to remove my old device from my Fitbit account and update the apps. The second month has been ongoing problems and troubleshooting. Now I'm going on 60 days with a 45-day return policy. It doesn't sync, and won't load the recommended update. The troubleshooting tips don't work and "tech support" = "Go ask the Community" AND now I have a scratch across the glass. If you want to look at your wrist and see steps and heart rate, there are less expensive products available.Too bad I upgraded the band and purchased an extra one too :(
 Different clocks .
 Inaccurate
 Beautiful, comfortable, easy access stats and alerts. Love the variety of clock faces. Best version yet.  Wanted:  to voice text responses.
 My wife bought this watch about 6 months ago and is now completely fried! It won't turn on or charge at all, for the price this watch is a waste of money, my advice would be to stay clear!
 Awesome watch
 Like: the style and features.<br/>Dislike: the difficulty in changing bands
 After falling in love with my Surge, it died on me. So, I tried the Versa. First off, it doesn't have "hike" in the exercise portal and I miss that..... A LOT. But it feels lighter and sleeker on my thin wrist. I also like the bands are EASILY replaceable. After using the Exercise portion a few times I see the readout once synced shows slightly different, but I'll get used to it. Ohhhhh.... I LOVE the vast options of clock faces! I'm discovering which ones pull in the battery. For 3 days of use, I give it a 7, mainly because I haven't yet discovered the "exercise/ workout / activity " benefits yet. I figure those bells and whistles should be increased from my Fitbit Surge.
 So far I have really liked this product, although I’m afraid to get it wet... lol
 Fitbit is not doing anything to replace this watch, and requesting that it be sent in for review/repair prior to doing anything. Once a refund occurs, I am buying an apple watch.
 Love the colors and watch face themes and now that it's summer- I especially love the waterproof /water resistant feature.
 I'm loving this Versa! On top of everything and looks sleek!
 Expensive, but gets you active and motivated with a good interface on the dashboard and quality tracking on your body from heart rate to sleep
 Looks sleek updates quickly tracks everything, you can easily change the clock faces using your phone, absolutely love it so far
 Amazing. Best smart watch out there.  Simple and shows you what’s important &amp; at the same time best customizable
 Love my Fitbit!!!!
 Love the feel and lightness of it, just wished the band was silicone though, also would like if the face changes were done on the phone and not the app.
 This is a great product for anyone who likes fitbit
 Notifications stopped working. cannot get it to work again. Also the apps are not good. No selection. Have only had the watch for a little over a month. would not recommend.
 Easy to use! Helpful with weight loss!
 Simple and comprehensive fitness tracking plus some extras.  The biggest selling point for me is that the battery life is sufficient for sleep tracking -  unlike the Apple Watch - very pleased all around.
 Livraison rapide. Produit excellent.
 Literally trash, does not sync much of the time. Get something else.
 Seems to loose charge earlier than charge 2.
 After a day it no longer syncs. Even after two factory resets.
 So far so good. I still need to program in my food so it is more accurate
 Gift for my son &amp; he loves it.  Wears it all the time.
 Very simple to use, light and good looking jewelry.
 It was a preorder. The Fitbit was actually delivered on the release day. I was impressed.
 Health tracking, sleep Tracking, etc..
 Love it! Looks great, works great, and is fun to play with.
 I like the Fitbit Versa SE for the most part but I dislike the way the watch band goes on and off.  You can't respond to notifications. And no ability to make or receive calls.
 The only thing it's missing is NFC. Connectivity is excellent! The ability to reply to text message is a much appreciated.
 My girlfriend loved it!
 I have a locked down computer and am unable to download apps on my laptop. This makes it impossible to sync my music (that I purchased). I will have to return this item.
 Love the Versa just wish the text back worked with the iPhone
 I like it better than my Apple Watch. Battery life is so much better
 I’ve had it a few days and I love it. I swam with it on yesterday and it worked great.
 I’m still learning all of the features, but I love mine! Great graduation present!
 5 stars
 It's a very nice product. Love it
 I like that I can see time/steps and heart rate at one glance.
 Battery life is less than advertised
 It work what I for like taking and steps but it does not work with my phone good!!! I cant get text or messages
 Love it totally worth the money!
 It looses the connection to the phone app time and again and the app drains phone battery so quick.
 I love everything about this watch! You can just jump in the pool - do not have to put it into water mode! This thing is just great great great
 It has all the info that I need to help me manage my steps
 There is really nothing to dislike about the versa.<br/>It’s comfortable and really a fantastic fitness tool. I love it!!.
 Love my Fitbit. I had the charge 2 for several years and was excited to upgrade. I really like the versa but not sure it’s worth the extra money .
 Didn’t have nfc pay
 I like it a lot *in Jim Carrey voice”
 Fast delivery and good quality
 Easy to setup, perfect upgrade from original
 I have only had it for a week but so far I love it!
 The watch is the great, veery usefull. The apps are the best and you can have a control of your daily exercise.
 I’ve been wanting a Fitbit Versa for awhile now and I finally got one last week.  I LOVE it!!! So many different things you can do and see.
 It’s alright, but after wearing it for a day and a half, the stupid wristband broke...smgdh. I bet this wouldn’t have happened if I got an Apple Watch...
 Its comfortable to wear. I ordered a fancy band to dress it up and it is gorgeous.  I love that I was able to put my favorite picture on my clock face.
 I love this watch. It has replaced my wristwatch
 Had it for about a week. Love that it’s waterproof. Like how it looks. Don’t like the GPS run distance...it’s not accurate. Overall much better than past versions.
 Not sure I can wear it in the pool
 Love it... it works great. It looks good. I get a lot of complements on it.
 Love all of it especially my own pictures for the screen
 Love it!
 Awesome
 I love the versa, the screen is so real. The only problem is that you cannot message back like it advertising that you can.
 Love everything about it!
 Excellent battery life and accurate fitness tracking. Also very intuitive app. Love this thing.
 I really like the display options and the fact that I can actually respond to texts using the watch.
 Love it
 I like the fact that when I get text messages or calls I can see who their from
 This watch is not working at all. Getting ready to make a return.
 Nice watch with awesome look &amp; helpful features ! :D
 So far, I love it!!  ❤️ Works great, I can scan the bar code on what I eat to get accurate calorie intake!
 Love it
 I had the charge 2 I wanted a fit bit that does everything including being able to pay with the watch and this fitbit versa doesn't do that
 Shard to set up
 Love the sleek design, simple user interface and extensive capabilities.
 I love everything except that it WILL NOT SYNC regularly.  That is very frustrating!
 I bought this for my wife for birthday and she loved it until it stopped working.  Fitbit authorized a return but then couldn't send a replacement for over a month because it was on back order.<br/><br/>Last week my wife finally got her replacement device and once the updates were completed it stopped receiving text.  Turns out that this is only an issue with Android devices but that's unacceptable.<br/><br/>One of the main features was the ability to receive texts.<br/><br/>What a piece of junk.  Avoid the frustration by purchasing something else<br/><br/>Seems that Fitbit resolved their issue with text messaging in the latest update.
 I love it
 Love it!!! Battery last about a week. Easy to use!! Awesome product!! So glad the band is exchangeable!!
 Excellent. Only wish they'd allow to connect with external heart rate sensor.
 Cool
 Had it 3 days and on second call to fit bit with tons of syncing problems!!! So disappointed!
 I love it... it’s my first ever smart watch but it’s great
 I don't like the fact that it doesn't come with instructions! Makes it hard to use even with the app.
 Love everything about it!
 Love love love this! User friendly.
 Works well with my phone, has reminders to get up and move each hour and is very comfortable to wear.
 I’ve only ever owned an Apple Watch and a Fitbit Alta HR. I like the versa better than the Alta HR. The versa has better battery quality, than the Apple Watch. The only difficulty with the versa is, trying to take on/off and replace the wrist straps. Also, I have a silicone case on mine, and I can’t charge it with the case, which is a little frustrating. Overall I so far like the product.
 Love the size of the face and the variety of functions it has.
 Dislike that I can not talk in it or text messages back
 Still has a few kinks to work out. Bluetooth has trouble connecting. Weather app does not find locations.
 Very good watch, using for my walking mainly
 Love it.
 Everything from tracking of steps to heart rate. Inspirational messages etc
 Great band matches my versa
 The weight and what it does.
 I like the look of the versa, long battery life and it is waterproof!!
 I love this watch and everything about it!
 I love it. Wish I got one one sooner then I did.
 I liked all the apps on it. Exercise
 Very nice and durable
 Happy I switched to Versa from the charge 2
 Low battery warning doesn’t notify you soon enough
 Item shipped 5/12/18. It was setup and worked for about 30 days at which time the tracking stats (steps, heart rate, etc.) stopped (registered zeros). I contacted Fitbit and tried the standard trouble shooting. This resolved an issue with battery drain but did nothing for the tracking. Because I purchased it through Amazon they do not guarantee it. I would not recommend this.
 Stopped working in two months
 Nice display but it OVERESTIMATES calories burned.
 Great at keeping steps and heart rate
 Face large and band bigger than my 2
 My steps!!!!
 Love it
 I love how big the numbers are.
 Good!!
 I like the coler
 Bigger screen. Not as user friendly.
 Great product
 Nice upgrade from the Blaze
 Like it all
 Great product
 Excelent
 Love it!!!!
 Lots of insights!
 Despite treating this watch with the utmost care, it only took 33 days for it to completely and utterly fail. The screen glitched out over night and that apparently kills the battery too. I fully charged it up and did all the resets to try and fix the screen but it died again from full charge in 5 hours. I had thought I could at least keep tracking my HR and steps despite having a defective screen but nope, the battery life is now so short it's useless in that regard too. I stupidly bought it from best buy because I didn't want to wait to get it and their return policy is 14 days and apparently fitbit doesn't let them do anything in regards to returns or warranty so now I have to return the stupid thing to fitbit and wait probably a month for them to most likely send a refurbished unit for a device that is obviously a piece of junk.<br/><br/>I bought this to help me get through the end of my diet, specifically, to make sure I lost the last 15 pounds on schedule. I only have a month or two left on it and now I'm going to be without this thing for probably a month, which defeats the whole purpose of buying this piece of garbage. Now I'm stuck with this one and I'm always going to hate it.<br/><br/>I'm impressed though that it only took fitbit 33 days to go through the cycle of gaining a loyal customer and then losing one. I'll be letting everyone I know hear about my experience as well.<br/><br/>I've seen so many people say that this company used to have great customer service but that now it's garbage and I think it explains why I have a $200, 33 day old paper weight on my desk. It's the typical cycle of business, they invest a lot of money in making quality products and providing great support until they have a solid reputation and a loyal customer base. Then they pull the rug out and start cutting costs everywhere, customer service, product quality, etc.and just ride that sweet profit wave right into the toilet like Sears did.
 Doesn't connect to phone.
 Heart
 I love everything about it
 Steps
 Wish you could have more access
 Great watch
 Love it!
 Love it!
 I absolutely love It!!
 Nice watch
 The watch looks nice but I don't think it's compatible with my Moto g6. I can't set up payment or use the music. There also isn't 15+ exercise modes there's only 5 false advertisement ..will be sending back
 This watch may look like an Apple watch, but dare not compare it to one. As with everything the devil is in the details. You may be wondering how Fitbit achieved a 4 day battery life and a slightly lower price point. Well, by cutting a few corners:<br/>* The watch has no microphone, so you can't take phone calls. Not to mention a lack of voice assistant / commands.<br/>* The watch has no speaker, so it cannot alert you with sound.<br/>* Notifications aren't supported on iOS, and on Android they're not synced with your phone. That is, if you dismiss the notification from your watch it will still show on your phone, and vice versa. Also, incoming notifications will not turn on the display.<br/>* The raise-to-wake algorithm, that thing that's supposed to turn on your watch when you look at it, works very poorly. This ruins the most basic functionality of a watch - telling the time. Be prepared to shake your wrist or tap the watch multiple times when you just want to tell what time it is.<br/>* Non-latin characters aren't supported.<br/>* The bezels are huge.<br/>* The band is not very comfortable over extended periods of time and very difficult to replace. Sure you can buy a replacement, but just be aware what you're getting out of the box is not very high quality.<br/>* The vibration motor in this thing comes nowhere near Apple's taptic engine.<br/>* Fitbit OS feels dated and performance is poor.<br/><br/>If you're an iPhone user, you're way better off investing in an Apple watch. For Android users, there are plenty of "smarter" smartwatches available.
 I purchased this to,replace my dog bit blaze....not a good purchase...I loved my blaze but the versa does not have all the bugs worked out and it was NOT cheap..if you have a phone by Verizon it is NOT compatible and you can't receive messages...bummer...not happy
 It does not sync as it should so does not update some areas properly.  It does not sync with MapMyRun, so disappointed!😩😩
 I've had the versa (not peach but black) for 5 days.  The tech support is nonexistent.  The guidelines it gives for changes or deleting items is not correct.  I should have stayed with my blaze.
 Won’t stay charged.. only had 3 days and the warranty I purchased will only be honored if it return to store purchased
 This watch quit working a week after we got it.  It won’t pair to the iPhone.  We’ve tried everything.  We tried all the tips and troubleshooting we found on the internet, still no luck.  Hopefully we can send it back.
 It doesn’t accurately monitor heart rate when you sweat. This is a known issue with fit bit devices generally (as well as with other devices using the wrist to monitor heart rate).
 I like the way my garmin vivoactive gps better but this is definitely more feminine looking. Also the garmin charge is better.
 I can’t get my pandora to work on it.  Someone help
 Walking is fine pretty accurate.. But leave it at home if your are driving ..I did 47 stairs and 4200 steps in a 45 minute drive. I know you can record that you are driving ..sorry don't have the time to do that ever time...
 I got this for health management. I do lots of different activities and wanted sleep analysis.
 The heart rate is very inaccurate.
 The Versa is a great smart watch.  The special addition is not so special.  The fabric band started fraying in less than two weeks of wear.  Fitbit in the past has provided great service, but not this time.  Called Fitbit and their response was fabric band is not for daily use or use at night.
 You couldn’t use Spotify on the Versa. Fitbit wanted to pay for their version of Spotify called “Dezzer” or pay for pandora. The clock face options were not customizable. I returned it after 3 days for an Apple Watch that was $100 more but much more user friendly and didn’t require purchases to use apps
 A bit large
 It looked great but only had it for a couple days and I returned it. The only thing it does good is keep time. It shouldn't have been launched and had all the issues fixed. I have it 2 stars because it is a nice looking watch but for what it cost, it should do what it's supposed to.
 I am currently returning and exchanging for a new versa. Hoping this one was just a lemon.
 Bought this as a mother’s day gift. Terrible user interface, extremely difficult to set up, not compatible with newer versions of Samsung galaxy J. Even tried using it with my Apply interface and it was still extremely more work than convienence. Returning it for the Fossil Gen 3 Explorist
 The clasp on the band came broken. Would rate it higher except I can’t wear it due to quality issues.
 Love it. Large to see the time without squinting. Love the sleep graph
 If Fitbit can fix their issues they would a decent product.
 I had one for year and love it now it doesn’t work. I miss it don’t work now
 Just got my Versa today and half of the large band is missing! The box was sealed and everything looks new so think it was just a manufacturer good. I called Fitbit and they are sending a replacement band. Happy they are resolving the issue but bummed it happened.
 The watch will not work with Pandora as promised so I still have to carry a phone to listen to music when I exercise.
 TL/DR: After many years and many fitness trackers, this is the best one I've tried. It's lightweight and comfortable and doesn't feel weird on my small wrist. It's also got great battery life, given its long list of features.<br/><br/>****Update after almost 2 weeks (I think I will move the original review to comments)****<br/><br/>First, I can't believe how light and comfortable the Versa is. The back is flat, despite the sensors (no green light seeping out when I sleep, either). It doesn't leave a single mark on my skin, even though my skin marks easily. Fitbit bands always seem a little cheap and plasticky, but they're the only ones that NEVER make me itch. Also, it looks a lot bigger on my wrist in the picture than in real life.<br/><br/>Setup was easy and took a bit more than 30 minutes. I was able to uninstall the apps I didn't want (Starbucks tastes burnt - come at me!) and pick my clock face, no problem. You can also rearrange the apps on the watch and the apps on the top and bottom left on the first screen can be accessed with the top and bottom buttons on the right.<br/><br/>It's definitely hard to choose between all the clock faces available. I really like the HUD2 one you can see in the picture. It shows all my goals and my progress, plus a bunch of other stuff. I was worried the screen would be too small for it, but it looks really good.<br/><br/>There are a lot of apps to choose from. I think. I'm a little old and don't really understand "apps." I do have one that counts so it helps me keep count when the grocery store has a buy 5 save $5 promotion or whatever. Yes, I'm old.<br/><br/>It seems really accurate (definitely as, or more, accurate, than any other fitness tracker I've worn on my wrist/ hand/ arm), if you temper your expectations. A tracker you wear on your body is always going to count steps more accurately than one you wear on your wrist. The light based method of tracking heart rate isn't the best. There's sometimes a weird spike or trough, but I feel like it's accurate overall, especially the resting HR. In fact, the resting HR on my Fitbits always tell me when I'm sick, because it spikes.<br/><br/>I use about 25% battery per day, which is expected. I always charge it when I'm in the shower, even though it is waterproof, so it stays pretty well charged from day to day.<br/><br/>Versa definitely syncs more reliably than any Fitbit I've had before. They've been doing a lot of work on the app and it shows. There's a small bug where it doesn't remember your custom stats for exercises, but I called support and they're working on it, so it will hopefully be fixed in the next firmware update.<br/><br/>I do get too wordy, so I'm going to stop now. Again, many more words in the comments.
 I just got the Versa  few hours ago but thought I'd do a preliminary review since a lot of folks have had set-up issues.  I upgraded from a Charge 2, so that's my base line.  I use the app on a Samsung Galaxy S7.<br/>-- The initial set-up takes about 30 min.  It's super easy but it does take a bit of time.  I had the Versa charging during set-up &amp; it was at 100% battery when it was done. I've tinkered around with loading apps &amp; syncing, bringing it down to 93% in 45 minutes.<br/>-- It's super light weight!  I have tiny wrists &amp; it's not overpowering.<br/>-- You DO NOT have to take the band off to charge it. The charger is easy to seed the Versa into.<br/>-- There are a gazillion watch faces!!  It's easy to switch out between faces.  FYI - some require payment, most are free.<br/>-- The app selection isn't fabulous but I wouldn't expect a lot of choices for a fitness watch.<br/>-- The product description is accurate.  I've read users state they didn't realize certain things about the Versa (i.e. Spotify not available, payment is via FitBit Pay, Android text reply not yet available, etc etc) but carefully reading the description states all the items folks were surprised about.<br/>-- You cannot have 2 Fitbits synced to your Fitbit app at once. The old one has to be deleted prior to installing the Versa. The app &amp; online sources does keep all the info from your prior Fitbit, though.
 I read some of the comments and was a little worried about upgrading from my charge 2 to the Versa.  I wanted a clearer screen with more customizable faces with readouts.  Plus I wanted a little larger display, lighter weight and so on.  I always take reviews with a grain of salt, figured I could take a chance based on a lot of other experiences.  So far, all the negative reviews I read were either off the mark, incorrect, or just bad buyers luck.  I have only really had bad buyers luck (lemon) once with an unrelated issue. I got the special edition for credit card use.<br/><br/>So, here's the pro:<br/>Much lighter than I expected, perfect size for my rather small wrists (I'm a male, 5'9", 180 pounds) Not sure my wrist size, but the large band fits, near to the tightest notch, but with cold weather.  In warm weather, most likely I'll need to run it out a little.  Fitbit very nicely put two bands in mine, of two sizes, so I can switch back and forth.<br/>My bank/card does not work with the CC function, but that's okay, I think it will in the future.  I wanted it for future use, but suspect it will be a while before this feature is common use.<br/>Read out/display is fantastic.  You have to purchase some faces, but you get a day or two trial.  most of the ones you must pay for aren't really worth it.  I tried out several and found an excellent non-pay face.  I like that you can switch it to something that looks nice, like the really nice copy of the famous Steve McQueen Tag/Heuer Monaco.  I have a Tag/Heuer, so this is a really nice feature.  I especially like the weather features some have.<br/>So far, steps, stairs and other exercise seems to be right on par with my charge 2.  Not always 100% accurate (I think) but close enough for government work.<br/>Syncing initially didn't seem to work.  I switched back and forth with my iPhone and ipad.  It turns out if you just shut it down, and then go back on, it will be there and all you have to do is sync it like normal.  Just be patient and fiddle with it.  Remember, millennials love to make things like this over complicated, fortunately I'm an old baby boomer retired infantryman, so all I did was try it a couple ways until it worked.  I don't return things unless they are really broken, which is rare upon rare.<br/>The battery life seems okay, I've been fiddling with it and changing watch faces constantly since I got it about 20 hours ago and I have about 80% less.  Going to run it out completely to see how accurate that reading is.  I really only expect to get one or two days out of a charge; I always half whatever manufacturers say about battery capacity that way I'm never disappointed.  If I get two plus days out of it, that'll be good enough for me.<br/>A big plus for me was the water resistance.  Have read good reviews about this part so hopefully that will prove true.<br/>I still have a lot of features to test out, but for now, just have to say it was a good choice.<br/>If you are a glass half full person like me, you'll like it.  I think some just have unreasonable expectations.<br/>So for Cons, I have to say I haven't found one yet.<br/><br/>I would buy one again if I had it to do over, so far it's exceeded my expectations.  Really surprised about the lightness, and the screen size is near perfect.  Additionally, it's much thinner than I had anticipated; it sits on my wrist really well.
 Alright so I'm gonna try to make this review helpful, bear with me.<br/><br/>I've been wanting a Fitbit for a few months now, mostly because I got fat at my last job which I thankfully no longer am at and wanted to track steps and sleep and all that other cool stuff. The more I researched Fitbits, the more I got assaulted with ads to buy one on Facebook which probably contributed to my purchase but *shrug* what can you do.<br/><br/>I especially wanted the Special Edition because the idea of swiping my Fitbit to pay if I don't have my wallet with me was some super futuristic Jetsons type stuff that appealed to me. The mistake I made was not checking beforehand if my bank is supported, which it is not. It might be in the future but I'd expect Fitbit to add real-time mood monitoring before that happens.<br/><br/>Being that I was drunk when I ordered it, I also made the mistake of getting the rose gold because the other SE colors were not available for one-day Prime shipping when I ordered. Don't get me wrong, it's cool and all but I'm so not a rose gold kinda girl. Every time I look at it I'm reminded of my drinking problem and how I make stupid decisions when I'm drunk.<br/><br/>ALRIGHT! With that out of the way...<br/><br/>This little thing is pretty rad. I am heavily tattooed and didn't even think to Google if Fitbits work over tattoos until after my purchase at which point I learned that dark/saturated inks can definitely affect device performance. So, I wear it very loose on my dominant wrist where I have a small chunk of blank skin. Sometimes it slips back up my arm where I'm tattooed and has trouble getting a good heart rate reading. Something to keep in mind if you are fully sleeved like me.<br/><br/>The sleep tracking has been the best feature. I knew my sleep was bad but seeing it clearly in the app shows me just how bad it is. I miss maybe one or two nights a week in the app, not sure why but my guess is fit/tattoos. Keeping the device loose seems to go a long way toward getting accurate readings.<br/><br/>I really like how many customizable watch faces there are and the low profile of the watch. As previously mentioned, I'm fat right now but am lucky to have super skinny wrists and freakishly long fingers/hand, the device isn't bulky at all.<br/><br/>Given that this is my first fitness tracker, I don't have much to compare it to (I've used MapMy whatever] apps for years but obviously all that is manual), but have to say I'm really pleased with my drunk purchase a month in. I feel like I'm learning a lot about my body, my habits, and just how sedentary I can be as a freelance writer despite my bike being my sole means of transportation.<br/><br/>If you're looking to get your first Fitbit, I can definitely recommend the Versa. Just, you know, don't order it drunk on accident and get the ugly color.

For the past two months it has been dropping connectivity from my Note 8 sporadically during my runs. On average I lose a 1/4 mile off of each mile. The only solution presented officially is a list of 5 things to check for which are permission options and always conncected features between your phone and the Fitbit app. Many other users have been reporting this issue as well so I will probably end up giving this to my wife who only uses a treadmill and look for a different brand with better GPS tracking. See my new photo that shows this problem through Strava.<br/>***<br/><br/> I've had my Versa for a week now and after testing every exercise mode and feature besides the fitbit pay, I can say that this is the best smartwatch I've ever owned and an amazing fitness tracker with great statistical accuracy.<br/><br/>I tried the gear fit pro 2 for a week as well and took it back. That watch had poor apps, poor battery life, and constant hr freezing. The Versa on the other hand meets everyone of its advertising claims and I am so happy it does!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is 4 days as advertised. ( If you want the best battery, turn off the always connected mode, the watch will only sync when you start a workout or enter the app on your phone.)<br/>-HR tracking is accurate and insightful<br/>-Sleep tracking is accurate and insightful<br/>-Ease of exercise selection, stop, start, pausing, and syncing<br/>-Strava syncs flawlessly<br/>-Community feature is great and fun<br/>-Coach feature is awesome!<br/>-Connected GPS for running and cycling is easy and accurate<br/>-Heart Rate zones during running and working out is very insightful as you can see effort, intensity, and stages of cardio activity<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-No Spotify!<br/>-When swimming it did not count laps when I used training fins without arm movement!<br/><br/>Overall if you are looking for an affordable and stylish fitness tracker for 24/7 usage, get this!<br/><br/> I don't like or use the text messages or phone notifications on any fitness tracker so the battery is amazing for me. There are complaints about the setup but it tells you it that it will take 30 minutes in the manual and I've had no problem connecting this and my aria 2 to my account.<br/><br/>I've added a video to show how relatively easy it is to switch bands. I used to be a jet mechanic so maybe it's easier for me but:<br/> 1) Grab the fitbit with one hand, with the other hand grab the strap while depressing the release<br/>2) Seperate the band from the watch by pulling the release part of the bar away from the watch and then lifting the other side out.<br/>3)To install: Hold the fitbit in one hand again, the band in the other<br/>4) While depressing the release insert the opposite end at about a 45 degree angle(very important for installing the classic band!) to the watch.<br/><br/>5)When that end is inserted, move the other bar into place while continuing to press the release. When the release pin is in the general area of its insertion spot, release it and gently wiggle around until it finds its spot and inserts itself into it. Done!<br/><br/>Hope my vid helps, good luck!
 My wife loved the Fitbit as it was an anniversary gift. However, the device started acting up less than a month of receiving it (Screen would lock up and become unresponsive. Device would randomly shut down). My wife contacted Fitbit directly and that has been a journey itself. Constant back and forth with one and after another instruction, requests for video showing various troubleshooting steps (all of which had been previously attempted). It was now been a week since my wife contacted Fitbit and she's still being asked for more information and the issue is still ongoing. I can see how a new device can have issues but with such a horrible customer support experience, i deem this rating accurate.
 BEWARE!!  Today my watch fell off my bathroom counter and hit my tile floor and cracked the screen on my Versa.  I received this watch on 4/18/18 and loved it until I had to contact customer support.  I spoke with a John Z today via online chat and he informed me that FitBit will not replace the watch since it was my fault.  I understand that and I wasn't trying to get a freebie but I would like it repaired being that it isn't even 5 months old.  Apparently Fitbit cannot repair their products so I'm stuck with a broken display.  I have owned a Alta, Charge 2, Versa, and Aria scale.  My husband has the Blaze and never had durability or quality issues.  I'm very disappointed with the ability to repair my watch.  There goes $200+ down the drain, the edge is sharp and cannot continue to be worn.  I'll just purchase an apple watch since Apple has a great product support/repair shop.
 I like this watch a lot. This is my first smartwatch. Prior to the Versa, I had the Fitbit Alta. I was searching for a smartwatch and didn't want to leave Fitbit but the look of the Ionic wasn't for me. I was set on buying the Apple Watch until I learned the Fitbit Versa was being released soon. Excited about the look of the Versa, still being able to stay with Fitbit, and the long battery life as opposed to the Apple Watch, I preordered the Versa. It came on Tuesday and and I've been wearing it for exactly two days now. I've been playing with it's functions a lot, and still have 50% battery left. It does everything I wanted in a smartwatch (calorie tracking, step tracking, heart rate monitoring, and message reading). I don't mind that I can't respond back text messages or answer phone calls. These weren't features I was particularly looking for in a smartwatch. I also LOVE how light this watch is. Sometimes I forget I'm wearing it. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars yet is because of the lack of apps, but I'm confident they will come in time.<br/><br/>Update 5/2018: I'm changing my rating from 4 stars to  1. I bought my versa  when it released and was really liking it. I recently switched to a Google Pixel 2 and learned that the versa has inconsistent compatibility with this phone. I've tried multiple times to connect the watch to my phone including factory  resetting the device and deleting  and reinstalling the Fitbit app to my phone but that hasn't  helped. Why did Fitbit release a product that doesn't work with one of the latest flagship Android phones? This is so frustrating and I can no longer use the device because not being able to sync it with my phone makes the watch useless. My best hope is to be able to sell it someone else.
 First of all, I pre-ordered this watch and even though the black and pink colors came out at the said release date the gray version took a month longer. No contact from Fitbit stating that it would take longer for the gray one or why everyone else was getting their Fitbits but not me. Had to get onto support forums to find out what the heck was going on. I pre-ordered the Fitibit and should have had it on the specified date. BAD communication from Fitbit to make a promise that I'll have it on the release date but then not actually get it until a month later.<br/><br/>Then, when it finally came the connected GPS feature does not work. It's one of the main selling points of the watch and sets it apart from a lot of its competitors at this price range. I have spent hours with customer support on it. After trying all things (re-install, reset, etc) they finally said that my phone (LG Stylo 2) is not on Fitbit's 'fully tested' list and may not be compatible with the connected GPS feature. Looking on the support board for this (apparently, it's a very common issue), there are lots of other phones that are not compatible with the connected GPS feature such as iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and LG. Fitbit Support has given no indication that they are working on this issue or that there will be a fix for it soon. It was a main selling point for the watch and if it doesn't work people would be better off buying a competitor that also doesn't have a GPS function that costs much less $$.<br/><br/>In addition to the connected GPS issues, text messages don't sync with Verizon's text message app Message+. The feature of getting text messages on the watch with the option to quick reply was another main selling point. If this feature doesn't work with one of the largest carrier's message app then they shouldn't advertise it as a feature. Fitbit's solution is to use another messaging app like Whatsapp or Hangouts (which a lot of my contacts don't use).<br/><br/>Simply put, this product was not ready for launch. They're still working out a lot of the simplest of bugs. And they have no timeline or details for when the bugs will be fixed. I'm returning the watch. The Suunto Trainer HR has all the same features at a similar price point and doesn't require a phone for 'connected GPS; plus, the battery life is much longer.
 Very comfortable to wear, love all the watch face options (I went with a Star Trek theme), having physical buttons helps a lot. Pretty easy to use overall. Best fitbit I've had, really enjoy it overall. Only frustration is that the UI can feel a little jittery, Also, sometimes it seems to take a while for the bluetooth to connect/sync. But, these are relatively minor concerns. Overall I'm very happy with the device and would recommend it to casual folks who just want an easy to use, lightweight, waterproof, cool looking smart watch. Or, if you work out a lot and want to track your activities, it doesn't get better than FitBit. Lastly, I'll note that I was an Apple user for over 10 years, and recently gave it up to switch to Android. This is a wonderful smart watch for Android users - no interest in an Apple watch for me. Seems like more of a status symbol these days than a practical device.
 I was so excited about this - I love FitBit! But I bought this for running and the ability to track my pace/mileage. It's COMPLETELY INACCURATE. You can google the forums and find that tons of others are experiencing the same thing. I called Fitbit support and they don't have any help to offer except to buy the Iconic with built-in GPS. I personally don't want to spend that much, and this one advertises the functionality to track pace/mileage/etc. with your phone, and the fact that they're disregarding that it doesn't work is a huge bummer.
 My fitbit broke less than 6 weeks after getting it (the HR monitor malfunctioned and then the entire screen went black) Contacted customer service which is now outsourced and "Jeff" read a list of scripted responses. After an hour long process I was told I had to return this device and it would take approximately 10 days for the warehouse to process it and THEN they would send the replacement.  If that wasn't bad enough he said I would get the label to return it right away and 2 hours later I still have yet to receive it.  I guess I have fo follow up but the process of answering 27 scripted questions before I can even discuss what I'm calling about has me dreading it.  Fitbit used to have impeccable customer service but my experience today was one of the worst I've ever experienced, all to save a dime I'm sure.  Well their cost saving strategies just lost them a previously very loyal customer. If you do decide to get something from them I would go with one of the other devices.  For $200 you get a device with a widely inaccurate HR monitor, an awful battery, and is almost impossible to change the bands. Not to mention it will break in a couple weeks and you'll have to wait weeks for a replacement.
 I got a Versa to replace my Charge 2 for two reasons. First, I wanted more accurate heart rate measurements than I had on the Charge 2during more strenuous exercise. Second, I wanted a shiny new object. My review will focus on exercise.<br/><br/>I do a HIIT (high High Intensity Interval Training) several days a week that includes 30-second sprints going as fas as I can on my exercise bike. The Charge 2 did a poor job of recording heart rate during the sprints.<br/><br/>- The image that has 81 avg bpm is from the Charge 2 in the Fitbit app.<br/>-The image that has 105 avg bpm is from the Versa in the Fitbit app<br/>- The image with the spikes is using a Scoche Plus heart rate monitor and an iPhone app called FITIV<br/><br/>Before I go further, I think the Scoche + Fitiv is the most accurate and this is confirmed by lots of users. You can see the well-distinguished spikes that correlate to each of the sprints (eight of them).<br/><br/>With the Charge 2 you would have trouble knowing I was even exercising except for a somewhat elevated avg. bpm. With the Versa, you can start to see bumps that are a dampened version of the true heart rate spikes seen in Fitiv. But at least they are somewhat distinguished. Also, the avg. bpm with the Versa is close to the Scoche (105 vs. 107), which is good as far as I'm concerned. The other good thing is that the max. heart rate with the Versa is close to the that of the Scoche (130 vs. 133)<br/><br/>So it looks to me like the Versa is doing a pretty good job on heart rate although it with the Fitbit app is not able to paint as pretty a picture as the Fitiv app. My four-star rating is based on this.<br/><br/>Judging from early reviews lots of people are having lots of problem with the Versa. I didn't. I'm also still getting used to it. My biggest disappointment is lack of Spotify support and having to use Fitbit Connect to get music from my Mac to the Versa. It's not only cumbersome, it doesn't work at all for me. It just freezes and I have to Force Quit.<br/><br/>But overall, I like the Versa so far.
 I am a long time Fitbit user and loved using the Charge HR.  I switched to the Versa because I wished to have access to more in-depth data, including more sensitive heart rate monitoring as well as improved sleep data.  I have now been wearing the Versa for 11 days.  I am pleased with my purchase so far.  I still have a lot to explore in terms of apps and watch faces, but simply having a lot to choose from is great.  I am impressed with the improved sleep data and heart rate monitoring.  The sensor seems much more sensitive and thus gives me something closer to real-time data.  After a little practice, navigation through the interface is easy to do.  I have gotten my watch wet and have had no problems.  The battery life is as advertised.  Usually I use about 15% battery per day; I understand the battery life may worsen with time.  The Versa comes with both small and large bands - I received the black bands.  The band material is not as slip-resistant as was with the Charge HR and does slip off my arm and onto my wrist when I exercise.  This causes me to lose some heart rate data while I am active.  I will likely be seeking out a slip-resistant band so that I can receive more accurate heart rate data while I exercise.  The band is the reason I am giving this product 4 stars rather than 5.  Overall, though, I really recommend this product.  Thanks!
 This is the smartwatch on the market! I have went through many smartwatches over the years but this watch is easy to use, excellent battery life, and excellent health/fitness features. I bought Apple Watches in the past and I must say that I am truly impressed by the quality of this new Fitbit. For the price, it is superior to the Apple Watch. I would not even consider purchasing an Apple Watch for $300+ when there is a smartwatch like this on the market. The screen is excellent and the apps are plentiful. I can't wait until even more apps start to come out for this watch. This is a must buy for any individual interested in health and fitness.
 UPDATE: After about 5 months using my Versa on a daily basis, it suddenly crashed after a full charge, the display was blury and with white stripes blinking all over the screen.  I contacted customer support and they told me how to do a factory reset but it didn't work.  After verifying my purchase they told me I was still eligible for replacement and they sent me another watch.  I hope this time it works for more than a few months. I have not been able to sync it properly with my android but I sync it with my work's iPhone, so it's ok gor now...  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I got my Versa on Thursday and it worked perfectly, I love the look, the band is very nice and easy to change/adjust, but today I had to charge it for the first time after the initial charge and after it charged I couldn't sync with the app on my phone anymore.  I tried all the solutions listed on Fitbit support page but could not get it to sync again.  Finally I removed the app from my phone, installed it again, turned off both the phone and the watch for a few minutes and then configure the watch again from scratch, that worked... I will wait for the next time I have to charge it to see if this issue happens again, if it does my Versa is going back :(  so sad because I really like it, will update soon.
 This is going to get a one-star review until I can successfully use connected GPS with my Samsung Galaxy S8.  Spoke to fitbit customer service and they say its an issue on Samsung's side with their bluetooth connection. I have my doubts about that because I can connect to everything else via bluetooth with my phone. This is useless if I cannot track my runs with GPS to give me better stats. Currently looking at other options for a fitness tracker. Suggestions are welcomed :)
 I was so excited for this watch after owning two fitbits (the original Charge and the Alta HR), but then I read the reviews and was very disappointed. However, after about two weeks of sleeping on it, I took the plunge. A smart watch for $200 from a reputable company? Heck yeah. I have not been disappointed. Although I personally don't find use for a smart watch when I already have a smart phone, I love the look and feel. It's lightweight, fast, efficient and holds a charge 4-5 days depending on how much I look at it. I just use the fitness portion of the watch.
 I love the watch but was a little upset when I received it to find out it didn't support NFC. Unfortunately the product description says "some models with NFC" but not sure how you're supposed to know which one you order has it. Other than that, I love everything about it.<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW:<br/>Will probably be returning this product. My first one completely died and when I called Fitbit about it I went through all the steps they wanted me to go through only to be told that I would now need to submit a video proving I went through all the steps to try to get it to work again. Rep said he would send me an e-mail that would tell me how to do this. Never received the e-mail so I called Amazon and thankfully they replaced it for me even though I was just past my 30 day return mark. Now I have my second Versa and it has quit syncing with my phone. Finally removed Versa from the app and app from the phone then reloaded both. It is now syncing but not receiving notifications. If unable to receive notifications soon, then I will be returning for money back. This is too expensive to not work properly. This was my first Fitbit product and will probably be my last.
 My Versa seems to accurately show my heart rate during the day but at night it completely miscalculates my SLEEP and sleep patterns.I have read and tried all of the Fit Bit Community website instructions submitted by Fit Bit product support moderators and found nothing has changed. Apparently, this is a universal problem without a solution. Fit Bit infers that it is a user problem not a Fit Bit malfunction. For 2 years I wore a Fit Bit Charge HR and got perfect sleep tracking results. Now, when I watch TV is indicates I am sleeping, when I'm in bed asleep it indicates nothing. I feel great today but Fit Bit says I slept only 3 hours! Ergo, if Sleep tracking is important to you DO NOT buy a Fit Bit Versa.
 I really have enjoyed Fitbit and this is my first move into the smartwatch realm. After using the Versa for the first 2 weeks I really enjoyed it and really liked the user interface. There are are some concerns though with the watch:<br/><br/>- Lacking major apps such as spotify<br/>- Phone pinging (to help find a phone)<br/>- Needs more dedicated FitbitOS apps<br/><br/>Last thing, after having it for less than a month, the Versa battery life has decided to die quickly. It used to last about 4 days and now it lasts about 1 day after a full charge. It could possibly be a bug, but there hasn't been much community support even after bringing it up. I would strongly advise someone to wait for possibly the second version of the Versa if they are looking to not join the pilot watch in what could be a great series.
 I love the design of the versa compared to my blaze. I also love that's its water proof so I can swim with it.<br/><br/>The one huge con I have is the battery life. My blaze could go 5 days with ample warning when it was going to die.  The versa hardly lasts 4 days and does before I even know the battery is low.  I'm sure the battery life has to do with the apps I don't care to use that are on the watch but I wish it lasted as long as the blaze.
 I bought this watch on May 22nd - less than 3 months from today (closer to 2 months, actually). On Saturday, my arm bumped a wall and cracked my screen. Assuming my watch was still under warranty, I contacted FitBit directly with questions about how to get it repaired. I was advised the screen breaking was due to user damage and was not covered by the warranty. Although this was frustrating, I asked what it would cost for me to ship my Versa to FitBit to have it repaired. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO REPAIR CENTER FOR THIS KIND OF DAMAGE (broken screen), since that kind of repair is not covered by the warranty!<br/><br/>This is absolutely ridiculous. I have a $200+ Versa, less than 3 months old, that I can't use nor repair even if  I were to pay for the repairs myself! This is a sports watch! How is this so fragile? I will NEVER buy another Fitbit product again (this was my second - I had an HR previously and liked it much better). Complete waste of money, and FitBit clearly doesn't care about providing good customer service. I spent some time on their site and saw numerous other customers with the same complaints. I wish I'd taken more time to research this product before buying.
 I purchased this as a gift for my wife. This is one of the worst pieces of tech I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. The first issue I had was the inability to pair with a phone. On setup the watch would find the phone but give an error when trying to connect. After multiple tries, with multiple phones, it finally connected but would time out on updating. After a couple days of coming back to it I finally got it to connect., it seemed.<br/><br/>My wife drives 180 miles a day round trip for work. S started telling my about how the steps counted were excessive compared with what she had with her previous Fitbit. An extra 3000-4000 steps a day were being counted. I asked Fitbit support what the fix was and their replay was...get this....keep up with the extra steps counted during driving and subtract them after the drive!. So, do the work for the device because the device is a half-baked piece.<br/><br/>Back to the connection to the phone, I thought it had finally connected only to find out that it had lost connection and could no longer sync. Back through the hoops...only this time I decided Fitbit didn't deserve money for their laziness. The Fitbit was returned and my wife is now shopping Garmin and Wear OS devices.<br/><br/>Avoid Fitbit.
 I bought this to replace my Blaze which died after 2.5 years of hard use. The versa is an upgrade in pretty much every way. It looks nicer, has a better user interface, better watch faces, battery still lasts 3+ days,, and is more accurate at tracking bike rides (a constant annoyance with the Blaze).<br/><br/>However, it still completely fails at tracking your heart rate while doing high movement/high intensity exercise. I often do sprint interval running and there is always annoying when you get done from a series of sprints and see your heart rate in the 120’s when you were in the 160-165 range. Check your watch after a minute of walking and it usually reads in the 140’s. So sprints and other HIIT exercises (Insanity, jump training, etc) give a reverse readout where you high intensity portions are the low heart rate readings and your rest periods are the spikes.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this watch is great for most people. It tracks well for most types of exercise (it’s fine with steady state running generally), but if you are a person who does targeted heart rate zone training or lots of HIIT stuff then I would look at a more athlete-targeted tracker if want accurate tracking.
 I so badly wanted to like this, but there are problems that I cannot overlook:<br/>- The sleep tracking is completely off and very inaccurate. I slept a good 8 hours last night of this posting, said I got 1. My old Charge 2 had no such problem.<br/>- Tracking my heartbeat when I'm on an elliptical was scarily inaccurate. It said I had a 100 bpm when it should've been 160.<br/>- Updating and downloading new apps is a huge pain. Fitbit's Coach app was giving me the most trouble since it wouldn't update no matter how long I waited. I couldn't even delete it since it was so set on updating.<br/>- Fitbit's support on their forums is unhelpful in answering the above. Never once have their solutions worked for me.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that I don't have anything positive to say:<br/>- The heartbeat tracker (outside of elliptical work) is accurate and works well.<br/>- The swimming tracker is well done and I've had no problems with its water-resistance.<br/>- A lot of the apps work surprisingly well; including the news apps.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I wouldn't upgrade to the Versa until they have their problems sorted out. And these problems aren't just me. Going onto the Fitbit forums shows just how many people are having problems with stuff that this Fitbit promised it would do. It's honestly troubling.
 I switched from using wear OS watches and this is my first Fitbit.  I have had the Versa for approximately 5 months now. Here are some of my personal experiences.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1) with all the sync / notification options off I get about 2-3 days of battery life<br/>2) sleep tracking is really useful when it works<br/>3) fitbit app tracking options are great (calories, weight, sharing with friends, etc)<br/>4) I have really sensitive skin and with the right watchband, and leaving the watch slightly loose, it doesn't irritate my skin<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) Randomly stopping tracking sleep<br/>2) Draining 3 different phone's battery (google pixel 3, samsung s8+, iphone 8) extremely quickly requiring me to leave sync off.<br/>3) It rarely actually displays the screen when I look at the watch so I end up just using other methods to tell the time.<br/>4) Red X of death after 5 months of use, customer service is useless.<br/>5) Customer service told me its because the pixel 3 is incompatible.  Beware pixel owners!  (Strange how it worked 5 months with it just fine)<br/><br/>I put up with some of the annoyances for the last 5 months because I really just want to be able to track sleep/hr and stairs/steps.  However now that it quit working and customer service is less than helpful I will be switching brands.
 First off let just start with saying how much I love Amazon! I pre-ordered for the Fitbit Versa SE lavender from Best Buy. Online it said "guaranteed in store pickup by 4/16 (release day). On that day I had to find out that my watch never shipped! I ordered it way in advance. They were quick to charge my card but couldn't even notify me that it was on backorder. I was pissed! I logged into my Amazon account to find that i could order this watch (which was on backorder everywhere else) and have it delivered that day. Totally made my day! So thank you Amazon and the customer service rep i spoke to just to make sure it wasn't some fluke.<br/>As for the watch itself, I freaking love it. Setup was easy. Make sure you do it over wifi and no one else is connected so it can go faster. I downloaded an album from Deezer even though I'm still on their free 30 day trial. I'm able to leave my phone at home or in the car and listen to my music with my earbud or headphones. It still needs another update and like all other technology that just release, it has its bugs. Over all I'm super stoked with my purchase.
 The battery draw on this device is kind of large. I found that the easiest way to combat this (if you have a decent daily drive) is to charge your watch while you have your daily drive. You aren't moving, so there are no steps to count anyway.<br/><br/>The screen is nice and the interface is intuitive. The NFC payments with the watch are great and the setup is really simple.<br/><br/>One thing I found that I do not like is the designer band. The band is a slick fabric and does not like to stay in place. The watch is always slipping around my wrist with it on. If I adjust my watch to not slip around, it is tighter than it needs to be. Also, there is a loop on the band right where the buckle attaches to the band, this loop is not movable. This makes it difficult to easily put the watch on because you have to bend the band thru the first loop. There is a second loop on the band as well that is adjustable. Luckily, there is a second rubber (silicon maybe) band in the box. That band is great. It stays in place and has a great fit. It also doesn't have the first loop that the fabric band does.<br/><br/>I had some issues connecting the device to my house wi-fi but had no problems connecting to my wi-fi hotspot on my phone. After looking at Fitbit forums, it seems that wi-fi issues are known. Luckily for me, I was upgrading my router to a more powerful model and the router upgrade resolved all of my issues. Just to be fair, I went back and reset my old router to factory settings with updated firmware and set up all of the wi-fi settings to match the new network. The watch refused to connect to the old router. I am not sure what is the issue. If Fitbit reps are reading this, I would be happy to sell you my old router so your engineers can figure out what is stopping your devices from connecting. ;-D<br/><br/>The device has some shortcomings but nothing that would have me send it back. The interface is solid, wireless payments works great, and you can clearly see the screens even in direct sunlight. There is even an embedded light sensor that allows the screen to adapt to the ambient light conditions so you don't get blinded by your device in the middle of the night (I'm looking at you Charge 2).
 I really wanted to give this a 3 1/2, because of the step count not being accurate but that option is not available.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>DESIGN (It’s pretty)<br/>WEIGHT (Very light. Not cumbersome or bulky)<br/>TRANSFERRING MUSIC (Note: keep watch in charger while transferring music, otherwise it will lose connection because this feature is very processor intensive. Found this out by calling customer service).<br/>TIMER (Has countdown and stopwatch)<br/>ALARMS (Nice amount)<br/>NOTIFICATIONS (can see text msgs &amp; phone calls)<br/>BATTERY lasts 3-4 days (Without using GPS or Exercise Mode...not sure how long it would last using these) (only 1 time so far did the battery only last for 2 days).  CHARGES quickly (within 1 hour)<br/>HEART RATE has been accurate<br/>PAIRING (Pairs with Bluetooth earbuds/earphones)<br/>CUSTOMER SERVICE is quick to respond in trying to resolve problems and very friendly<br/>APPS: Has some convenient apps like, calculator, to do list, uber, calendar, maps...(Looking forward to seeing more)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>STEP COUNT is not that accurate. (15 steps counted before even getting out of bed) It counts arm movements, not steps. (If you know that ahead of time, you can compensate)<br/>WATCH FACES Limited (Hopefully, they will add more)<br/>GLASS scratches easily<br/>NOTIFICATIONS (can’t answer text msgs &amp; phone calls) (Not really a con for me as I don’t need to answer notifications from a watch.)<br/>BLUETOOTH might disconnect if you’re trying to use it on two devices at a time (computer and phone).<br/>WEATHER APP sometimes sync goes out even though the Fitbit App says it's in sync.<br/><br/>Other Notes:<br/>Reviews have indicated that the charger is awkward but I found that it is easy to attach the watch to it. (Just pinch the sides).<br/>Step counting although not as accurate as I’d like Is manageable (It’s in the ballpark).<br/>Buy a screen protector for glass<br/>Reviews have said that the band is hard to change.  I find that the difficulty level is not that great. I watched a Youtube demonstration once (because I saw the negative reviews) and have had no problem changing bands. (If you’re not a hands-on person, you may have more difficulty).<br/>Everything is online nowadays, hence there is no comprehensive instruction book comes that comes with the watch.  Use the Fitbit app to find out more information on how to use the watch and what applications you can download.
 Sep Update: My Versa has completely died. Approximately five months after purchasing this pretty expensive fitness tracker, it's dead.  Fitbit has no intention of replacing it or fixing the bugs that prevented it from tracking accurately.  Sadly, I would strongly discourage anyone from wasting money on this product.  Fitbit used to be such a great company - this experience is an epic fail though.<br/><br/>July Update: So now my Versa no longer accurately syncs steps accurately and the steps logged on my watch don't sync with the FitBit challenges (part of the reason I chose this over an apple watch).  I went online and people have been reporting issues for months (frozen screens, not logging sleep, steps, or mileage).  Apparently "they're working on it" but there is no reported ETA on when this will be fixed. I would definitely NOT purchase this watch.  There are too many bugs to be worked out.
 One day last week my night table had a resting pulse of 130. When I put the versa on, so did I. I had to restart it to be accurate. Every night now I make sure I turn it off. My poor table should see a Dr. Two days later we woke up with a pulse rate of 165.  This time it took several restarts to make us better. A few months ago the time on the watch was completely wrong, not just time zone wrong. I googled and found out I had to change my watch face to fix it.  Today is 11/20  and it's 2:12 pm. I really like this watch face, but I guess I have to say good bye to it because it says 11/19, 4:40. But my pulse is good. 150.00 for 6 months. apple lets you lease an iPhone for less. 1 star cause it's cute.<br/>I found the customer service number on your order page on amazon. there is a contact manufacturer tab. I spoke for a half hour with a rep. She was very polite and helpful. We went through multiple set up procedures and now it is fine. I received an email with a case number in case I have future problems. Excellent customer service.
 I've been wearing this watch for almost a month now and I'm impressed with the overall quality of the versa. The only issue I have is that I do not believe the calories burned during workouts are necessarily correct. I wore this watch along with my polar ft4 heart rate monitor ( HRM ) and chest strap to see how they compare. The heart rate was near perfect when compared to the HRM. During the same 75min workout my HRM said I burned 692 calories, while my Versa stated 976. This alone is not a big enough issue for me to warrant returning the watch. I love my versa. Its attractive, motivates me to move more to hit that step goal, and helps remind me of my overall goals. It is waterproof. I was skeptical and nervous af first. But I've worn it in the shower and swimming with no issues. I was worried about the band fitting since I am a large woman. Im 5'9 &amp; currently 302 pounds...However the s/m band fits with 4 extra slots. The watch comes with a large band too so I wouldn't worry about the fit. Remember to clean the band as it can get smelly if you dont daily or every other day. I dont use the watch for "smart watch" purposes so I can't comment on that aspect.  The battery lasts about 4 days for me. The watch Is very attractive and the app it syncs to can provide a lot of really good insights when it comes to sleep, workouts, and daily activity<br/><br/>Update. It's been almost 9 months and the heartrate sensor is shot. I contacted Fitbit support and they told me to factory reset and now the watch is basically useless as all it does is flash the fitbit logo and a few languages telling me to download the app. I really hope they'll replace it, I'm calling again tomorrow to get things sorted.
 I bought this one for my wife and after 2 weeks, she loves it.<br/>In a nutshell, here are the positives:<br/>1) It's very comfortable to wear. She forgets she is wearing it which means it is a good watch to sleep with.<br/>2) The size is great for female wrists. She is a tiny person (5 feet 1) and it looks good on her.<br/>3) HR monitor seems to be good, very consistent. I read some other people have issues but so far it has been good for her.<br/>4) Battery life is great. I goes a bit more than 25% per day so 4+ days may be a stretch but it is fantastic anyway.<br/>5) Sleep tracking data is great.<br/>6) The watch does a good job picking up activities automatically. I wish there were more activities but so far it has been good<br/><br/>The things that could be better<br/>1) App selection is very limited but she was coming from an Android Wear device and in full honestly you don't use apps that much besides activity tracking. Who really calls an Uber from your watch?. I wish we could see more airlines, smart locks, hotels, car companies adding apps. And of course, the health ecosystem as well: blood pressure, glucose monitors, and so forth.<br/>2) Software no so snappy at times but not a big deal.<br/>3) As I said, the list of activities it tracks could improve a bit<br/>4) I wish we get the same iWatch feature that the watch alerts you if your heart rate goes crazy. That would be cool and I believe it is just a software update.<br/><br/>Overall if you are looking for your first smartwatch, if you are on Android or a combination of both, this is the one you need to get.
 Have been a haopy Fitbit user since 2014.  Was excited to receive a new Versa for Christmas.  The excitement ended there - this product is not ready for prime time.  Endless problems with bluetooth connectivity using Samsung's flagship S9+ phone. Reading the Fitbit user forum, I discovered that these problems have been well known since the spring of 2018.  I wasted 2 hours a day over the last 2 weeks trying to make it work.  Gave up and returned it today for a refund.  Will stick with my Charge 2.  Please get your act together, Fitbit!
 I love it! I upgraded from a Charge 2 and I am so happy. I upgraded to get one that was water resistant and have showered with the Versa twice. I've had no problems so far. Battery life is about 4 days. Haven't tried to upload music because I don't use it. I'm really happy I went with this one.
 This was an upgrade from my blaze which I loved. Transfer to the Versa was flawless. Opened the box and literally just needed to pair the Versa with my iPhone 8plus and the Fitbit  app I have been utilizing for the past few years. Easy and fast. I’m very happy with the design and it feels very much like my blaze with a few upgrades. It isn’t a giant leap forward from the blaze but I have had my blaze for awhile and it was simply time to upgrade. If you are happy with your current Fitbit, I see no reason to upgrade yet. Perhaps the next iteration will make greater strides to warrant the purchase. However, if you’re like me and have wore your Fitbit for years and your Fitbit has seen better days, then you will be happy upgrading to the Versa.
 I am having a ball with my Versa! I originally bought (2) Fitbit Charges a couple of years ago for Xmas so my husband could stay on track with our fitness goals.  Sadly he said he wouldn't wear it so I returned it.  Fast forward a year later I bought the Charge 2 for myself and said OK you just follow along and he did and we loved using it together.  He lost 30 ls in 3 months!!!!! and I lost 25 lbs.....tracking our food vs our calorie output.<br/>As happens to a lot of people we fell back into our old ways and no excuse but we travel the world a lot and love to eat all the different cuisines etc.<br/>While we're definitely active if you don't keep an eye on the calories they add up over time.  2 weeks ago I said that's enough - we have got to get back to our fitness levels and I downloaded Map my Fitness and My Fitness Pal...I tried but I wasn't enjoying it.  Hubby said go back to the Fitbit - you loved it, it's user friendly and we had great success with it.<br/><br/>Yippeee - now you have the Versa and my friend wears the Ionic and it's swimmable!!! She is an Ironman person into extreme fitness, I used to be like her but still like being fit.  The Versa is just great.  Like so many of the other reviews that I read - it's lightweight, it has lots of good tracking features, it syncs easily and in a day or two I will swim with it - but so far so good.  I shower with it, do dishes - I literally never take my watches off so comfort and water-resistant are huge features for me.  I have a smaller wrist and the strap that it came with is perfect.  My husband is actually using the Fitbit that I bought him last year for his birthday because he sees how much fun I'm having with mine and he likes comparing my stats with his stats.<br/><br/>As a aside - the second day that I had it there was a delay in the syncing of the information and I tried all the troubleshooting that I found on the Fit bit site and couldn't get it to work.  As I experienced before, they have great great customer service.  I called and the rep was awesome.  We got it working and I am dedicated to our fitness goals in earnest once again.  As I said to my husband - we have tools for so many things in our lives - right??  Well why wouldn't we use a really great tool to help us stay on track.<br/><br/>Whether you are new to fitness or an avid extreme athlete like my buddy - there is a Fitbit for your needs.
 So far so good. Really impresses me how simple it is to use. Really like how many watch faces you can choose between and how much info on one screen.
 I have no problem whatsoever with the watch. Perhaps I was lucky to receive an error-free item, since I've heard many people got lemons. Or simply because I did a thorough research before buying and know what to expect of it. So after one week it still works as expected (I will update if things change). The pairing and update process out of the box was smooth, only taking 30 minutes. Sleep tracking is correct, battery good, the heart rate is spot on except when I ran on the treadmill and loosened it a bit. Connected GPS is good but not great: when I tried to run on a same route, it showed the correct map both times but the distance the second time was off by about 10%. Anyway, GPS connection was never dropped. As for steps and floor counting, I don't expect them to be accurate, but in fact it was rather believable except when I drive. It is a hassle that I have to log the driving time manually on the phone to avoid inflated steps and floors. It is even weirder that Fitbit considers driving an "exercise" and gives me props for exercising on consecutive days. This problem with driving has been raised 4 years ago but Fitbit never actually dealt with it. Anyway, it is a Fitbit issue rather than Versa issue, so I wouldn't take one star off this review.<br/><br/>Although I love the watch, I would like to point out that setting up the Versa may not be easy for people who are not into high tech. It doesn't work right away like an iPhone (although admittedly the iPhone now has lots of complicated, hidden features that a lay man never knows). Just like the Android OS in its beginning stage, setting up a Fitbit will require tweaking this and that a little bit to have the best user experience. Having to read the manual to know how to push notifications from a phone to Versa, or how to connect to phone's GPS and make sure that the GPS doesn't drop a long the way, etc. are something that an average customer like my old mother should never have to do. That's why I think a Fitbit smartwatch is not a good choice for them. A more simpler device maybe.
 I went from the original Flex to this and initially wondered what I would even do with all the features (but went for it since I really missed having a watch) however now couldn't be more glad that I made the switch.<br/>Having all these tools has been really educational for me in my fitness journey. Being a golfer, I love having the weather on my wrist at all times. I have also synced to some wireless headphones, so it's awesome to have music with me outside or working out and not necessarily need my phone on me as well.
 I bought a Versa to be accountable to myself about my fitness/activity level.  It presents me with facts about my activity/inactivity and how much I am sleeping/not sleeping.  This has really been helpful for me because there is no denying the numbers, and that has lead to positive change.  I keep track of my general daily levels of activity, exercise, sleep, heart rate, menstrual cycle, and water intake all using one watch/one app.<br/><br/>I love knowing when I've hit the cardio zone (and how long I stay there) during a workout.  There are several workout modes, and you can edit which ones are readily available on your watch.  Once again you can use these setting to hold yourself accountable for how long and at what intensity your workout actually is.<br/><br/>There are several pre-loaded apps on the watch; they can be removed.  I don't ever use Pandora, and it was easy to take off.  On the flip side of that, there are many other apps you can load onto the Versa if you want.  It seems to be pretty easy to customize what you want from your watch.<br/><br/>On the down side.  The battery does not last four days as advertised.  The battery hardly lasts two days.  This is not a deal breaker for me personally because I just charge it everyday when I hop in the shower, but I was surprised to find that I should charge it every day.
 Ok so it not a Pebble - My Pebble was way better at notifications - by that I mean I never missed a phone call or text (had all others shut off) Wished the Versa vibrated more/longer/ plus notification showed up on screen - hate to have to touch it to see if I got a notification. The health aspects of it are stellar - Heck isn't that what Fitbit is know for ? Only odd thing is counting steps - I think its pretty close to what I do (Pebble ave was near same) it oddly counts steps when I am planting in my farm tractor - guess it thinks all the movement are steps ? 1st time it hit 10000 an buzzed the happy screen at 10 am in morning - that startled me - by that night I had gotten over 36000 steps - Which lead me to notice my heart rate was running between 100 and 110 - I came to the conclusion it was right and steps were right - which explains why so darn tired after driving tractor (farm) for 14 hrs. It was consistent day to day (5 stars) my ave daily heart rate is shown at 65 when not in tractor so cool. I've had this for over a month an found pretty hard to get 4 days battery life unless on turns off All-Day sync. and back-light to shortest time.  With them on 3 days max - not bad though.<br/>If Fitbit would use the 10000 step alarm to let one know call or text or notifications in general - one would never miss one - Fitbit are you listening ?<br/>Color screen is great - an IMHO plenty of watch faces to choose from - I've tried at least 8 and finally found on I like - no whines there. I did read some thought it affected their arms/wrist or whatever but none of that for  me. I did order a different watch band one of the metal ones but after getting it decided to send back - like the light wt. one that came with it - the metal one was heavy and bulky (I didn't put it on )<br/>I did put on a IQsheid hard screen protector and each one broke within a day from me hitting something - no doubt ok for office but not for someone who works around machinery - that said did put on IQshield (IQ33958 screen protector x6) that is a flexible plastic type - and so far no problems - bottom line the hard shied sucked and the plastic one is great.
 3 days into having this watch! I love the size (about the same size as an apple watch), light weight and super easy to use even right out of the box.<br/>Things to know:<br/>you can change the face (there is a whole store for that....I have not found one that i have had to pay for...unlike samsung which I had to pay for the cool ones)<br/>There are more apps that are coming at some point, including women's health (super excited about that as a female)<br/>I can finally get all my notifications including what's app<br/>connects via Bluetooth to Pandora, you can upload your own music as well<br/>you can add pictures to scroll through<br/>there is a bluetooth pay app for starbucks<br/><br/>alarms have to be set on the watch, no longer through the phone app.<br/>It will update right out of the box so be prepared. It took around 30 minutes. I suggest connecting it (the watch) to your wifi to make it go quicker. I did it through bluetooth via my phone.<br/><br/>downside:<br/>the phone has to stay on vibrate in order to receive phone call notifications, if it is on silent, you will get text notifications, but not phone call notifications. It will tell you that your phone is in "do not disturb" mode if it is on silent. I am hoping that they update that as I hate listening to my phone, even when it's on vibrate.
 First of all you have to understand that there is a "supported device" list. This will tell you if your PHONE model will<br/>work with Fitbit's software or firmware. Do not think this is readily available to the consumer, i.e. do you see it on this Amazon page?<br/> So just because you are running android on your phone, doesn't mean you will have full use of this watch. I only found out my Moto phone was not supported after trying to get some help from Fitbit community help forums. So what are my problems? Frustrating set-up, couldn't find the device. Will not connect to phone GPS, so that feature is useless, but most of all "syncing" problems. If you can't sync, you won't see sleep track data, you can't push your activity data to 3rd party apps such as MyFitneesPal to help in your food plan and you won't see any of the graphs you can create on the dashboard because the data is still in your Versa. Then it will decide to sync, then it won't for a day and then it will, really? For $200?
 The watch's square screen takes some adjusting and for such a big watch the screen feels quite small. The screen resolution is also disappointing; I often feel like I'm looking at a slightly improved handheld electronic videogame. My wrist was super unhappy with the silicone band so I had to switch it out for steel with magnetic closure. The watch cannot control my phone's music or camera. Picture messages cannot be viewed on the watch. Quick replies (cutomizable preset message responses) from the watch are limited to 5. The app selection is vast when it comes to fitness but otherwise sparse. The interesting apps are not free. The Uber app failed so intensely that I had to remove it. I cannot remove Strava from the watch which is very frustrating because I don't use it. The Fitbit mobile app freezes a lot for me. My meal input from a synced app worked only once. I can't get the clock face to show me 24 hour time presumably because time is set based on time zone but it's particularly frustrating because my chosen clock face is advertised in 24 hour time.<br/><br/>That being said, there are seemingly infinite clockfaces to choose from. The watch is responsive and accurate when it comes to activity recording. The sleep tracking is also more accurate than apps that use my phone's accelerometer. The move reminders are helpful without being daunting. The Fitbit mobile app is pretty comprehensive with easy setup and practical function when it comes to expanding watch data.<br/><br/>I usually protest things that are pretty obviously marketed toward women when they don't have to be. I probably should have stuck with that inclination though I don't imagine the regular versa is any better. I chose this instead of a Samsung watch like my partner got because I no longer have a Samsung phone honesty I regret it. Their watch solves every problem mentioned in my first paragraph except the band, but that's an easy switch. Their watch even cost doightky kess than this one  Not sure why I'm sticking this one out. I really want to love it.. it was well worth it and I'd probably be pretty darn happy if I had nothing to compare it to.
 I don't usually find myself writing reviews, but at nearly 2 full months of ownership, it has gnawed at me, slowly. I decided to keep it after buying it for a very cool price during the holidays, even with the slightly extended return window. I could have easily received my money back if anything was wrong, given that I already own a Fitbit Charge 2 that is fully functional, accurate, and also own several bands. Was there any point in making this purchase if I own something that still works?<br/><br/>That would usually be my train of thought, but I was getting a bit tired of the Charge 2 and wanted something a little modern, and something with one specific feature - I wanted onboard memory for my own music.<br/><br/>This was THE reason I kept it. In fact, if there was a device that's job was just do that without any other feature, I would be very interested if the price was convincing. It can even mimic the Versa, I really like how the watch looks.<br/><br/>Everything else was either a step sideways or a negative when compared to the Charge 2.<br/><br/>Sideways - Changing the strap is still stupid, just in another stupid way. I understand why they do it, but man I can't believe they still haven't figured this one out. I would prefer the Charge 2 method of changing bands, but the Versa bands look better without the extra piece of metal.<br/><br/>Huge Negative - The Versa has a much larger disparity in terms of heart rate. It is usually off in either direction by up to 20 beats, which is incredibly bad. It's slow to pickup during a workout and slow to come down. Sometimes you'll notice that it can't even get a read. This problem was not present on my Charge 2.<br/><br/>Huge Negative - Take what you read about and change Heart Rate to Step Count. Also, change 20 beats to up to 50% additional steps; yeah, it's that bad. The step count is so wildly inaccurate, it's actually shocking how Fitbit could have allowed such a device to be sold at all. I actually left it on a dresser one night and it counted that I walked 400 steps! The above two disappointments led my to one of the worst features of the Versa, and it's one I think is what keeps me for recommending this device at all: The Customer Service.<br/><br/>HUGE Negative - CS, they are terrible. One question per email. Takes an entire day to respond. Some of these questions are an incredible waste of time such as "Are you wearing it on your dominant hand" and "Have you adjusted your Stride Length" and "Have you tried Restarting it" to finally "yeah, it will be fixed in a future patch" *B***S***". They don't know and they do not care at all. I reported all my troubleshooting in the initial email I sent, and they basically through textbook questions at me without reading my original email. Incredible.<br/><br/>So why did I keep it? The music feature. Yeah, that's it. It's not even that good. The DAC is pretty terrible, and navigation is a joke. For instance, if you start working out, you cannot exit to access your music collection on your watch; it just isn't possible. Huge oversight. It just takes you back to the Workout app. You have to exit your Workout to access music first, then you can start the Workout app again.<br/><br/>And I don't wear it at night anymore, I just keep it off and wear my Charge 2. They both last twice as long this way and I charge half as often.<br/><br/>However, at MSRP, I could not recommend this device. Even if you do get it, just keep in mind that all information that it collects is wildly inaccurate and only use those numbers as reference points to how you feel rather than what they should be scientifically. My resting HR is 85 in this compared to an actual 65. So instead of using 85 as an actual metric, I just analyze how it moves in a longer period of time. Unfortunately, my chart is completely messed up since both devices collect very different numbers, and I don't think it will ever be fixed. The music feature keeps me entertained and focused, but I wouldn't have bought it if I knew of these issues.
 My husband bought this for me after I kept taking his Fitbit ionic when he forgot it at home etc. I’ve had the Versa for several weeks now and I feel like it’s time to leave a honest review.<br/>PROS: it is sleeker and more compact than the ionic. The edges of the watch are rounded and it is smaller in size, making it more comfortable for an avid gym goer who may be using their wrists a lot.<br/>CONS: bear with me here because I do have a list. First, I need to point out that the charging port is awful. AWFUL. Half the time it will say it’s charging, and when I come back hoping for 100%, it’s still at the same percentage that I left it at. The port is flawed in some way or another. This is my biggest issue thus far. Another issue I’ve ran into is I have gotten it fully charged through some sort of magic sorcery and two hours later it is DEAD and won’t turn on at all. This has happened to me once in the past week. I’ve also read reviews mentioning how awful it is at counting steps and detecting heart rate when you are sweaty....this is also another issue that I can’t deny. I was counting on something that would give me accurate heart rate info during my daily workouts at the gym and I’m very disappointed. I’m talking 20-30 beats per minute difference in my actual heart rate and what the monitor says I am at. That’s just unacceptable. Another problem is the app, as others have also mentioned. Sometimes the watch just won’t sync with the app. Turning the watch completely off and back on works for me, but it really shouldn’t have to be that way...<br/>Needless to say, I’m disappointed. I was hoping for something that was up there with the ionic as far as performance goes, but the Versa is lacking in many very basic aspects.
 I absolutely LOVE all the features of this smartwatch &amp; it even helped me realize I have a rapid heart rate, BUT it only lasted 3 weeks! After just 21 days, the entire Versa DIED. I tried everything to no avail. It makes no sense. I wore it carefully, never had it exposed to water (even though I'm pretty sure it's waterproof), never dropped it, was never rough with it. IT COMPLETELY DIED. I called Fitbit (through the Amazon link) and they gave me two choices: (1) receive a replacement watch MINUS THE BAND or (2) get 50% off another device. THERE WAS NO OPTION IN RECEIVING A FULL REFUND and I find this unacceptable, especially since the device worked a mere 21 days. Awful.<br/><br/>Please save stress and get another smartwatch before you're disappointed like me.
 I’m so incredibly unhappy with this thing- cost more than my Blaze and does less. I can’t even control my music on it unless I make sure all other Bluetooth devices are off, start playing music on my phone, then pair my watch to my phone and then after that, turn my Bluetooth headphones on. Every time. If I want to put my music on my watch I have to go to my laptop (if you don’t have an actual computer you can’t do this) and transfer a playlist from my iTunes and this only works a fraction of the time and only after I’ve yet manually paired my headset to the watch. Nothing about this is easier. If I want to change a song while jogging, I have to stop and change it directly from my phone. And forget about it when you get a phone call while listening to a song- might as well restart the entire process all over again.<br/>And let’s talk about sensitivity- my dog could fart in another room and it will count as steps- and I have it set to be less sensitive.<br/>And then there’s the home screen- on my Blaze (which I’ve never missed more than I do right now) whenever my screen would go to sleep, regardless of what I was doing, it would always go back to home so I can quick check the time, my steps, any messages- not this thing. This thing stays on whatever you were on, be it workout, settings, or timer. Doesn’t go back unless you trace back to the home screen yourself.<br/>And lastly, the customer service. When I called about each of these problems I was told (and I quote) “these are expected glitches”, in other words- they are aware of these issues and have no intention of rectifying them.<br/>If you like complicated extra steps and inconsistent performance this product is perfect for you. Personally, I’m thinking of returning it and getting another Blaze. Big thumbs down from me.
 I've had the versa now for 5 months now and waited in writing the review for it until today. The versa is a good first try in my opinion in the right direction for Fitbit in a sea of smart watches but it still lacks. The apps store is a sad empty space, getting my notifications as of late has been random sometimes it syncs then other times it doesn't. You cant even reply very much since all you get are quick reply options of happy faces and basic stuff. I tried to link my Starbucks card to it for payment  and I was unable to at all.<br/>The nice thing is that it's light I get compliments very often for it since I have the rose color option. Beyond I feel like the battery life has become shorter, it used be four days now it feels like charging every 2. Tracking wise Its consistent with what my Alta data.<br/><br/>In all its a nice first attempt but not one worth paying 200$ when you can get something similar in price with more features. Hell it's still very expensive just for a basic watch.
 Honestly, I was more interested in the Smartwatch functionality than the fitness tracker part, though I do use the fitness tracker.  I was a Microsoft Band user but unfortunately, it is discontinued (the actual wristband itself kept breaking but not the face/brain part) and I was looking for something that had the same features.  Versa has finally met all my needs.<br/><br/>One of the things Versa had lacked was a clock face that had everything I wanted (time, month, day, day of the week, battery life and step count) but was also legible (my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be).  I found some clock faces that had all the stats I wanted but they all used fonts that were too small for me to read.  Fortunately, you can make your own clock face using JavaScript and I made my own custom one so I am happy about that.<br/><br/>The other thing that the Microsoft Band had that the Versa lacked was a Microsoft calendar viewer.  There were plenty of apps that accessed Google calendars but I didn't find one that worked with Microsoft calendar until recently.  The app is called "Events" developed by a third party.  Now I can check my calendar of things coming up!<br/><br/>A feature Versa has that I've found very useful is mapping two of its buttons to specific apps.  I've set mine up to open "Events" or "Weather" which are two things I check at least once a day.<br/><br/>I also really enjoy the Sleep tracker part.  I like that it tracks three stages of sleep: Light, REM and Deep.  For a while, I had issues getting consistent readings of the three stages.  If the Versa has issues tracking your pulse while you sleep, it only gives you very basic info and none of the three stages.  Recently I've found that if I wear it so the face is on the inside part of my wrist (basically just turn it around 180 degrees) and make sure it's snug (not tight, but not loose), then I'm getting the advanced stats.  I've had 10 nights in a row so far with advanced stats where previously I could only get up to 4 nights.
 I had an original Huawei smart watch that I loved every thing about except battery life. I could get a day out of it if I only used it for a watch and notifications. If I tried to make use of many apps on it then I could forget it lasting a whole day. It was nice to have Google assistant to control my smart home but unfortunately it quit taking a charge so I started looking for something new.<br/><br/>I decided battery life was important for me as I couldn't use many of the "smart" features anyway on the Huawei due to battery life impact. And I wanted to have better fitness integration also.<br/><br/>I decided to go with the Fitbit Versa and I am glad I did. It is well documented how well the battery life and fitness tracking work so I will not say more than it does a better job than I expected and I love the sleep tracking!<br/><br/>I want to talk about the smart watch side of the Versa. Of course I wish I could talk to it and use Google assistant but I will give it up for battery life. I wanted to be able to control music and podcasts playback from my watch and was worried how this was going to work. All I had to do was go into settings and enable notifications from the apps I want to control and then I can start a play list or podcast on my phone. From the watch I only have swipe down, open the notification, and the controls are there! I used to build my own watchfaces on the Huawei watch with the "watch maker" app. I found a similar app in the fitbit app store called "maker". I haven't tried it yet as I am happy with the fitbit watch face I am using for now, but I am happy to the option is there for when I get bored and want to change things up later. It was nice being able to control my smartthings lights with the Google assistant on the Huawei but I can use my phone if needed and I have Alexa and Google home all over my house for that so it is less important. There is an app called "switchr" that will let me press buttons on my Versa to control them but I have not figured it out yet. That's my fault not the Versa as I have not used IFTTT much and I need to fix things on that end.<br/><br/>Overall this is the perfect watch for me. It has all of the smarts that I care about. Of course Fitbit has the fitness part down as that's what they are known for. And I get the best of both worlds with great battery life. The Versa is small, lightweight, comfortable, and the best looking square watch In my opinion. I can't get over how thin the Versa is compared to other smart watches. It is thinner than some old dumb digital watches I have seen. Fitbit really got this one right!
 Replaced my fitbit charge HR with this.  Just learning to use it, but love it so far!
 This has been one of the most irritating devices to get set up!  I have spent HOURS trying to link to wifi, download music, etc.  I have looked at every help topic and googled every method out there.  I am at my wit's end - this might be going back!!<br/><br/>Updating and downgrading from a 2 star to 2 star...<br/>Unit will not sync reliably, I have been on community support for 2 days due to them admitting there is a wifi and connectivity defect identified with this product.<br/><br/>Definitely returning this.  My fitbit days may be over - Garmin is looking good!
 I’ve reset it and reconnected my Bluetooth but I no longer get any notifications. Not happy at all. Tried contacting Fitbit and that was a useless got no answer. So I now have a almost $300 watch that counts steps and heart rate but can’t even get text or call notifications anymore. Yes all my notifications are on this isn’t my first Fitbit. I updated to this one because this was supposed to be better than the one I had before.
 I had a FitBit Charge 2 and I fell and the pulse stopped working and then it would not hold a charge. I started looking for a new one and saw this Versa. It is light and thin. It does everything my Charge yet in a better style. I can download music on to the Versa, but I have not done so yet. It is much lighter than the Charge and looks more like a watch. It is not a IWatch, but it is just as nice and does what I need. It tracks my pulse, steps, runs, get notifications from my iPhone. I looked at the Ionic, because it does more, but not in my price range. I did purchase a pack of screen protectors as the charge I had was scratched.
 Love the Fitbit Versa!  Ordered two, one for my daughter and one for myself.  Hers worked great and accurately, however, mine did not track my sleep correctly saying I only slept 2-3 hours a night.  It also didn’t start tracking my sleep until after midnight, 1 or 2 o’clock when I had been asleep for several hours.  It also had me taking over 500 steps before I got out of bed. (I must have been sleep walking!! Lol)  I was truly bummed and disappointed.  I was gonna return to amazon when my daughter told me to call Fitbit.  I’m so glad I did!!  They send a replacement face after walking through a check of my Fitbit watch which they found faulty.  It was a quick and great experience.  My new Fitbit watch works awesome and I love it!  Would recommend!!!  I didn’t need a cellphone watch that’s why I chose Fitbit.  I wanted to track my heart rate, steps and sleep.  It’s great for overal health watch.
 I bought this to replace a Pebble Time Round that was on it's last leg. I loved my Pebble so it's tough to really compare this to that. What I like is that the screen is touch and pretty darn clear. What I don't like is that I can't speak into it to reply to texts though I could with the Pebble. I love that it tracks my sleep and has the relax featuring for breathing and also comes with the couch for some easy, quick workouts. I don't like that you have to redownload watch faces unlike the Pebble that stored them and you could easily switch in and out. It's a good replacement that was about the same price as the Pebble. Just wish it had the speaker for replying to texts by voice.
 Review done after owning since 4/16 and using daily - review done on 5/9.<br/>Way better than the Blaze. Waterproof. Has Apps and better faces. (Watch out for pay apps though)<br/>Faster User interface. Faster and more stable Bluetooth connectivity. Notifications work a lot better than previous model.<br/>NFC (in special edition) for paying with credit card if you forget your wallet.<br/>Cloth band feels amazing compared to rubber ones. Unit is smaller and lighter and less obtrusive with soft round corners.<br/>Larger buttons make for ease of use underwater, etc.<br/>Fast GPS acquisition via Bluetooth. Battery life is 4 days on average with heavy daily use.<br/>Screen brightness and quality of graphics is greatly improved.<br/>According to specs I read online, it has a 3-axis gyro instead of a 2, which makes it seem to be more responsive to movements and detect things better.<br/>Built in music works awesome!
 Fitbit is in over their head and their new line of smartwatches proves it. I'm sure they're great for the people that they actually work correctly for but the rest of us are left out to dry.. 17% of us, the last I checked.<br/><br/>Finding a phone that works with this watch is tricky because their site incorrectly says phones are compatible when they are not. This watch was not ready for release and Fitbit was definitely ready to support it.<br/><br/>The two biggest problems that I have had with this watch are that the GPS doesn't wand to work and notifications from the phone do not work at all.<br/><br/>Getting support is next to impossible. What little I got from them pointed me back to their FAQ pages.. which I had already been through. With no further diagnostics, they said that the watch needed to be replaced<br/><br/>I replaced the watch and had the EXACT same problems. I emailed them for a week trying to get help but only got one autoreply that said that their customer service department was overloaded. When I finally DID get an answer, they simply said that those functions take Android version 5+.. even though their website SPECIFICALLY says that it is COMPLETELY compatible with my phone running 4.4.4. They haven't changed it and I have seen reports of people sometimes get it to work with 4.4.4. They simply did not want to help!<br/><br/>This is no way to run a company. Thank goodness for Amazon and their customer service!!<br/><br/>If you buy this watch, you are taking a LARGE gamble that it will NOT work. Make sure to keep it in it's return period!! Amazon will take care of you (at least for 30 days) when Fitbit will not.
 I purchased a Fitbit Versa on October 3rd.  It is now December 6th.  Today the display corrupted and could not be repaired with either a reset or closing down and restarting the Versa tracker.  This was done while on the phone with a very helpful customer support representative.  The problem could not be resolved, so the customer service representative arranged to send me an email which took me to a customer service site allowing me to either get a replacement for the Versa which had failed or to get a 50% discount on another Fitbit product of my choice.<br/><br/>While I was somewhat disappointed in the time of service for my tracker, I was very happy with the product prior to the display failure that I experienced.  The watch failed without any undo wear or usage.  There was a severe thunderstorm in the area at the time of the failure, but there was no other problem which could account for this failure.
 Like everyone else, changing the bands was a nightmare for me. I purchased the special edition lavender fabric band and rose gold device, gorgeous! Exactly what I wanted. The cloth bands are super easy to change. I was happy that my purchase came with a traditional rubber band so that I could use that one for the gym and put the cloth one back on for every day wear. But trying to put the rubber band on the first day for the gym.....oh my!!!! I finally got it to stay on after about 10 minutes of frustration, and it stayed on during my workout, but the band popped open during my commute on public transportation home! I desperately tried to get it back on and ended up giving up and digging the cloth one out of my bag and putting that one on in 2 seconds. I will say this though, I have fingernails, someone who didn't would have no hope of getting these bands on or off. With so many people having this issue this seems like a serious design flaw to me, one that should have been sorted out in R&amp;D. I am probably going to end up buying cheap knockoff brand cloth bands to use during working out so that once they get funky/have been washed too many times I can just get rid of them.
 I have worn a couple of smart watches and this is the best of them. The moto 360 Gen 1 and 2 were good looking, but they tried to do more than is needed.<br/>I know a lot of folks would like more functionality like GPS or voice assistant but I think this watch does everything needed for 90% of the population. I understand runners and perhaps cyclists need built-in GPS, but most of us carry our phone regardless of the activity.<br/>Loving the pebble-like battery life at three to four days and when I do need to charge it takes only a couple of hours.<br/>The fitness parts seem accurate enough. The heart rate sensor matches the monitor I use while spinning, the steps are in the ballpark of what my Pixel senses though the versa is probably the more accurate of the two. Stairs are very accurate.<br/>I like that the versa reminds me to push away from my desk and even provides me a little encouragement when I comply.<br/>I do wish it would pair with my Pelaton spinning bike though.
 Wonderful upgrade. I had the blaze, but always wanted waterproof capabilities. (P.S. the blaze wristbands fit the versa). The system runs smoothly, I've had no startup issues. I had had a problem with Fitbit pay, but I've only tried it at one location. The watch face options are great, the apps on it are all useful. Battery life has been fine, about 4 days per charge. Overall I'm very happy with it.
 I just got this in yesterday so I am still learning the ends and outs.I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star and let me tell you why.<br/><br/> I love everything about the watch except for the fact it does not come with very good instructions. The instructions are super basic. No details what so ever.<br/><br/> I absolutely have not figured out how to turn off the watch so I am not hitting things on the screen, I do not want to hit while changing out the band. It is screwing everything up. Is there a way to turn off the watch while you do this. I honestly do not know yet. Will have to research it online to find out. Let me tell you if there is not there needs to be because the band is extremely hard to put back on. I had no issue getting the band off. Band came off very easily. But getting on is a totally different story. I literally hate that about the watch. What was Fitbit thinking on designing this watch this way.  It is not like a quick interchange between bands. This morning I wanted to put a protective cover on the watch before I went to work. Not an easy task. I know yesterday it took my an hour to change out the band.  I had to throw the watch this morning into a bag with the band not attached and take to work with me so I can take time in my morning at work trying to get the band back on. Maybe I will get the band on before the day is over.<br/><br/>I did use the watch during my early morning workout. I loved it during the workout. It workout out great. I do wish they would team up with Spotify for a music option. So I am not to crazy about the music feature on the watch. But I did go into buying the watch knowing this.<br/><br/>I do have it sync with my MacPro and my iPhone but have not tried to sync it with my iPad yet. Seems to be working fine.<br/><br/>All in all I love the watch but hate how they designed the band.<br/><br/>Update: I did figure out how to turn off the watch. Though I still find the band of the watch not as easy as it should be, I am getting better putting it on. Still wished they would of make the watch more easy when it came to changing out the band.
 I am giving this Fitbit four stars because there are still issues with it. Maybe those issues will be addressed in time, but other than that, I do really like it. It's the first smartwatch I've seen that doesn't look like I'm wearing a miniature computer on my arm. I have somewhat small wrists and this watch works out just fine.<br/><br/>I like the rose gold color of the actual Fitbit. I did go ahead and purchase another band for it and I'm not a huge fan of the pink, or peach as Fitbit calls it. The bands are not super easy to change. It's like changing a traditional watch band, but it does seem a bit harder than that. I found the best way to get the band in was to shove in the end that has the little lever first, then kind of just shove in the other end, even though that's probably the complete opposite of how the band is supposed to be changed.<br/><br/>I like that I have an altimeter again, I was using an Alta and it did not have the altimeter, but I've also found out that when the barometric pressure is wonky outside, your floor count is going to be off. At one point my Versa told me I had climbed like thirty-five floors in a day. I did climb a lot of stairs that day, but I certainly did not climb that many.<br/><br/>The step-count is not as accurate as it should be. I've had multiple Fitbits, one of the first ones you clipped onto your shirt, then the One, then the Charge(I returned the Charge because it was nowhere near as accurate as my One), then the Alta, and now the Versa. I really feel as if the One was the most accurate out of all of them. I know the Alta lost many of my steps. There were times I could count my steps and then look at the Alta screen and see that the steps hadn't changed at all.  The Versa definitely counts more steps than the Alta did, but part of me feels that it's too many. I changed the settings to say that I have it on my dominant hand, even though I don't.<br/><br/>There are not a whole lot of apps yet for the Versa, which is kind of sad. There are Fitbit apps and some others, but it's not a ton. Most of the apps are just links to various tracking services. I haven't even really tried Pandora with the Versa yet. I would really like to see more apps. I would like to see mini-games that work with your step-count, or a better messaging app instead of a few canned responses, or a better weather app, or just something a little more exciting.<br/><br/>There are other clock faces. You don't have to use that face with the overlapping numbers. There's an ok selection of clock faces, again, I'd like to see more.<br/><br/>The battery really should last longer, but it's not awful considering what all the Versa does. I do have to charge this watch every three to four days. If you're doing a lot of non-walking running exercises, you may have to charge it more often.<br/><br/>Speaking of exercises, there are still some that it's not going to track. You can track a bicycle ride, but you can't track a stationary bike ride, unfortunately. It's still awesome that you can track a regular bike ride though.<br/><br/>I do think it's pretty great. This is the first Fitbit smartwatch I felt was even close to something I could get behind. It still has its problems, but hopefully, Fitbit will work on those.
 This is the worst smartwatch I have ever used! I have used the TicWatch Pro, the Galaxy Watch, and the Apple Watch (with my old iphone) and this is by far the worst experience I have had with a smartwatch. IT IS COUNTING DRIVING AS STEPS!!! I got over 10,400 steps in under an hour!!! Not only that, but AS I TYPE, THE STEP COUNT JUST KEEPS GROWING!!!!<br/><br/>If fitness tracking is important to you. PASS ON THIS DEVICE.<br/>But if you are a fan of tracking your car's step count, then this is the watch for you.
 So, I started exercising a lot about 6 months ago, and decided I HAD to pre-order this when it became available.  Before I started exercising I owned a Fitbit Flex 2 just to track my sleep since I have sleep issues.  That Fitbit is very basic and basically just a pedometer, so this was quite the upgrade. When I started exercising I realized how important a heart rate tracker was to my exercise, and also more basic fitness trackers can't track stages of your sleep, which I really wanted.<br/><br/>I am in LOVE with this watch, and so glad I waited for this instead of getting the Ionic.  A lot of people ask if they should get the Ionic or Versa.  Well, it's up to you, but the Ionic is $100 more and I personally like the style of the Versa much more.  It's much more sleek and elegant.  However, if you have really large arms you may want the Ionic.  I have tiny arms so it was an easy choice for me.  The only thing better about the Ionic is the GPS, and I don't use that....so if that it is important to you then you definitely need the Ionic.<br/><br/>Anyway, this watch is a great competitor to the Apple Watch.  And you don't have to have an iPhone.  Be warned, most Android devices are not "supported" by Fitbit, but will still work....however, they may be glitchy from time to time.  I have an LG Stylo 3 Plus, a really new phone, and every now and then I will have syncing issues - it just WON'T sync.  I have had to contact Fitbit a few times to help me, both with this and the Flex 2.  Their customer support was actually surprising helpful and fixed it each time.  However, I also have an iPad....so if it won't sync I will just sync to the iPad for awhile.  But I know that not everyone has that as an alternative.<br/><br/>One thing I love about the Versa is that you forget you're even wearing it.  It's really, really comfortable and not obtrusive at all.  It's very trendy and modern-looking.  I got the special edition mainly for the lavender woven band, but it also comes with a chip where you can make payments on.  I actually haven't set this up yet and be warned that it doesn't work with all banks (and almost certainly not a small local bank), but it's an interesting option I will probably get around to using eventually.<br/><br/>I am mostly using this for the exercise and the sleep.  I have to be honest, I don't care much about the music and while originally I didn't think I'd care about notifications, I actually really appreciate the notifications now because I never miss an important phone call now because I didn't hear my phone over noise or something like that.<br/><br/>Exercise - most important thing for me, of course.  I love how it tracks your resting heart rate, calories burned, the fitbit coach.  I know that Fitbit has a tendency to over-count steps though, so keep that in mind.  I keep my step goal about 2,000 over because of it.<br/><br/>Sleep - One of the most fascinating things to me is how it tracks your sleep cycles.  I have some serious sleeping issues so this is really helpful to me.  It shows your REM, deep sleep, light sleep, and awake.  Don't be alarmed to see how little deep sleep you get...the majority is supposed to be light sleep.  I also noticed that when I switched from the Flex 2 to this, that I was getting a lot less sleep....both track and subtract your "awake/restless" time, but the Versa seems to be much more sensitive to it than the Flex 2.  So for nights that the Flex 2 maybe recorded 9 hours of sleep, the Versa is tracking maybe 6 hours and 45 minutes, depending on the night.  I know my sleep is bad, but I honestly this it may be a little TOO sensitive.<br/><br/>Overall, I am so happy with this watch!
 The music transfer software for this product is literally the worst I've ever seen, for the watch itself as well as Android and PC/Mac. I've been in tech support for years and was unable to get this watch to download music from either Mac or PC. I could go through everything I tried, including every source of official and unofficial advice online, but this would be a long review with the same result - failure. Give this thing a pass if you want to put some of your music on it, you'll be glad you did. The Garmin products are much faster and friendlier for something as simple as transferring a few files.<br/><br/>Regarding the watch's other functions, nothing makes this an exceptional device. It's just a typical fitness band.
 I've had multiple Fitbit devices. I waited a while to upgrade to this one and was so excited to get home tonight to check out my special edition with the lavender woven strap.<br/><br/>I got it updated, set up, and strapped it on only to find that...it wouldn't register a heartbeat. This is a feature I want and care about. I went to the manufacturer's website for troubleshooting and tried everything to no avail. Then I found out via one of their admins on their own message board that the heart rate monitor might not work if you wear it with the woven strap. What? Your product won't work if you wear it as sold and advertised?<br/><br/>The Fitbit moderator said "Also, some quick recommendations, try the device on the other wrist. Also because some accessory bands may not perform well for heart rate tracking like woven special edition wristbands, I recommend wearing a classic band for optimal results." Well I don't want to wear a watch on my dominant hand (tried it and it didn't work anyway) and I would prefer to wear a functional fitness tracker with the special edition wristband you designed and sold to me.<br/><br/>It's already boxed back up and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow. Huge disappointment!
 The design is aesthetically pleasing and the rose gold is beautiful. The capabilities of this fitness tracker/smart watch are endless. The water resistance is a must have. The Fitbit community and app is a great way to stick to the workouts or fitness level you desire. I recommend you buy the Fitbit Versa instead of the Apple Watch or Samsung Gear.
 I have a Huawei watch and close to 2 years after I got it, the heart rate sensor died so I was in the market for another one. I was used to the weight and bulk of the Huawei (I also had a metal bracelet on it) so when I got this I was quite surprised by its size and weight - small and light. It does everything I want a fitness tracker/smart watch to do - track my heart rate and activities all the time, show me notifications from my phone (I don't need to reply or do anything else), and, you know, tell me the time. It does all of that perfectly. There are a few things I wished it had or things it did better though:<br/>1. I go rowing out on the water, and there's no mode for that.<br/>2. I play the piano, and it *always* records all those arm movement as steps. I don't know how this problem can be solved though; I think all fitness trackers will most likely have this problem.<br/>3. The straps don't lay flat. This means that when I take it off it always has to lie on its sides, which I don't like (it feels like whatever surface I put it on will scratch the side buttons).<br/>4. The design of the charger is terrible (many people have complained about it already and I don't have anything else to add) but since I only charge it once every 4 days, I can live with that.<br/><br/>No regrets so far buying it.
 I primarily bought this fitbit to track calories, heart rate and steps. While the heart rate monitoring seems fairly accurate, the calories are definitely not. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 112 pounds. I typically eat 1200-1500 calories a day to maintain, depending on my activity that day. This watch says that I'm burning around 1600 calories on a rest day. On days where I do incredibly intense workouts, it says I'm burning around 1800-1900 calories. I've done a little research, and found numerous blogs and articles complaining about the inaccuracy of the Versa's calorie estimates, so I don't think it's just the specific watch that I received.<br/><br/>Also, I switched internet providers after getting this watch and, while it was connected to the internet before, now it will not connect again. So, it doesn't sync with my phone anymore, which is incredibly frustrating. Apparently, the Versa will only connect to 2.4 Ghz internet, but I've also read complaints online where people with 2.4 still can't get their Versa to connect.<br/><br/>I will say that it is lightweight and better looking than I expected. I also like that it's waterproof. I wanted to love this watch, but since one of the major functions that I was interested in isn't accurate, I will be returning it.
 I had bought all the previous Fitbit devices and I find the Versa the best of the lot. I never used the GPS in Ionic, so when Versa came out with this non-GPS version at a reasonable price, I wanted to give it a try. I find this Versa perfectly designed, right size and light weight. With the special edition charcoal strap, it is quite comfortable and you sometimes forget that you are wearing one until the vibrates nudges you to move on.. Would love to see more watch faces in the app.
 Never tried anything like this before. My old watch was a Rolex I bought 30+ years ago. Decided to buy this to help motivate exercise and promote better sleep. At the same time I bought Alta HRs for my wife and 3 daughters, a better size for petite ladies but unfortunately not waterproof; and I also bought some third party bands and protectors in different colors, a nice feature. I received mine just before vacation, so I cannot yet judge its effect on my normal lifestyle, but so far the exercise part looks pretty good. The only complaints I have are about sleep.  First, it does not track all my sleep. For example, back from vacation after a series of flights with 26 hour door to door travel time, last night my old Respironics REMStar Auto C-Flex machine said I had slept 2.2 hours before my first nightly visit to the bathroom, but FitBit didn't think I had slept at all. This kind of result has been fairly typical. Second, I do not like that FitBit will not give me a breakdown of sleep stages for sleep sessions of less than 3 hours' duration. At my age, I am awake often during the night, sometimes long enough that FitBit decides to end a sleep session and start a new one later, instead of recording it as one sleep session with a longer than usual waking period. Right now my evaluation of this gizmo is borderline between 3 and 4 starts, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.  For now.
 Who needs an Apple watch when you have this?! I absolutely LOVE it! The fitness tracker aspect is flawless. Tracking my sleep. My steps. My heart rate. The heart rate tracker is the BEST. I have horrible anxiety and I can physically see my heart rate rising when my anxiety goes up. I love the fitness challenges on the Fitbit app. Currently I'm virtually running the NYC marathon! There are also guided workouts right on the watch. Now the smart watch side. When i get a phone call I can decline the call from my phone. I can read and reply to texts from my phone. There are apps to read the news. Track your period. 2 games. Calculator. You have the Walgreens app to check your balance rewards points. Plus a ton more. The battery lasts roughly 3ish to 4 days depending on use. With that said, it charges up to 100% in a flash though. I highly recommend this watch!
 I decided to use my FitBit Versa for at least a month before posting my review.  I used to own a FitBit Charge HR (an older version of the Charge.)<br/><br/>A few things that I'd like to share:<br/>1. The battery life on my Versa has been excellent.  I regularly charge it when I'm not using it, so I can't tell you exactly how long it lasts, but I have gone at least full two days without needing a charge.<br/>2. It took a short while to get the hang of changing the bands, but it has not been as onerous for me as it has been for other reviewers.<br/>3. I am able to read the first part of texts and emails that come in, and I've found this to be very useful.  I do not need the ability to send texts via the watch since I keep my phone with me all the time.  If I did need that capability, then I would look into the Apple Watch, but that comes at a significantly higher cost.<br/>4. I like that I'm still able to participate in FitBit challenges with my friends and family using this watch.<br/>5. I've mostly been sticking with the official FitBit clock faces.  I would recommend that you do that when you first start using the watch so that if you have any trouble, you know that it's not due to an outside developer's clock face.<br/>6. I bought the Ezco tempered glass screen protector to prevent scratching and that seems to be working out well.<br/>7. I've noticed that a few reviews mention that they would like a different style charger.  I'm fine with the charger that was included.  It's easy to use and the Versa and wrist band stay flat against the tabletop when charging.<br/>8. The NFC chip for secure payments works as advertised.<br/>9. I have not done much with music yet because I currently work out at home so I haven't had the need.<br/>10. I do not wear it in the shower or swim with it.  I realize that it's supposed to be waterproof, but I have no interest in testing its capabilities only to have it malfunction after being exposed to water.  I can say that I feel comfortable keeping it on my wrist when washing dishes or walking in the rain since it is advertised as waterproof.  It's nice to be able to go about my daily life without having to remember to remove it except when showering or swimming.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very happy with this watch.  It's attractive and not boxy, not too heavy on the wrist, and there are a lot of bands available on Amazon to purchase if I want to switch them up.  I am a fan!
 I've had the Versa for about 2 months.  I'm going to say check you phone compatibility from the FitBit website before ordering.  I exchanged my first one about a month in because it wouldn't sync.  I then out of no where had the same issue again.  Troubleshooted just about everything.  I connected to Fitbit support and sure enough my LGG6 that is only a year old is not compatible.  Thankfully I do have a Bluetooth on my laptop so I can connect that way.  I was pretty much told that I can expect syncing issues since it's not compatible.<br/><br/>That aside- like all Fitbit's the stairs are no where near accurate.  Before my day starts I hit 4 flights of stairs.  It will register one.  My ChargeHR and ChargeHR 2 had this issue.  I'm just going to accept it's a Fitbit issue and I don't keep track of them.<br/><br/>I do like the clock interface.  I have a basic face so my battery doesn't drain and I do get 4-4.5 days out of a charge.<br/><br/>The sleep seems accurate, my messages come to the Versa within seconds of hitting my phone.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm content with the purchase.  There are pros and cons like all the Fitbit's but I've owned one for 4-5 years, I couldn't make the switch.
 my god this is more than just a watch. It tells you a loy about your health. The heart rate and trends show overtime how healthy you are and also shows heart rate zones of excercises. it is so light weight, being someone who never wore a watch before, i do not feel any discomfort wearing this 24/7 /sleeping/shower and all. The sleep tracking is very good and you get to know so much about your sleep patterns, REM and awake times. It is best for people who want more fitness and less a smart watch for all mobile social functions. BUT iphone users must knkw it does NOT support sms reply function at all- all you can do is view an sms or viber message and accept or reject calls only. which is ok for me as i dont prefer watch replica for mobile. the heart rate monitoring function is excellent be it your on a run, swimming or doing zumba— is shows u real-time heart beat. The best thing is fitbit dashboard in app and dashboard they email you every week- there is no other fitness watch to beat this.
 I love this Fitbit Versa! It has so many great features to help keep me active and motivated. I love that in addition to the many fitness and life/health tracking features, it also can receive notifications from your phone, you can answer calls and texts, you can listen to music and access several apps from Starbucks to Uber and Pandora. It's also very sleek and stylish. It's lightweight too. I often forget I'm even wearing it.<br/><br/>Update (7 weeks in - 9/2/18): My Versa has stopped responding to touch. Everything else seems to work ok - tracking steps, heart rate and can tell time. Can turn it on and off. However, anything that requires touching the screen, which is most of the functions/features, are no longer accessible. I'm disappointed, because this truly is a great watch. I have a case open with Fitbit. Factory reset didn't work. Hopefully they'll replace it. I'm not ready to give up yet!<br/><br/>Update (9/3/18): I am back to giving Fitbit Versa a great review. The process to replace it went so quick and easy. I am chalking this up to a random defect and am confident my replacement will solve my issue.
 I wouldn't recommend this product until they get the bugs figured out. Its essentially an expensive watch but is constantly 5 mins behind my phone. I get they aren't compatible yet but the issues I have have nothing to do with them not being compatible. It will work great for about a month then I have to factory reset and start from scratch which takes 2 or more hours. It has been constantly turning on and off for the last 2 hours today, never syncs. How convenient that it worked for a month then after my return time was up it starting going to poo. Also, fitbit help is of no help. They just tell you the same things over and over 'factory reset'. So if you really want one buy off of their website as THERE IS NO WARRANTY IF YOU BUY FROM AMAZON. They shouldn't be allowed to sell on Amazon if they won't hold up their warranty, they hold it up at other retailers, why not here? Shame. I spent way too much money on something that is a bracelet.
 Update: after much fighting, Fitbit did provide me a new Versa. However, the syncing issues are worse than ever. In the last 10 days I've only gotten 3 days worth of data because it will not sync unless I factory reset. This is insane. If Fitbit had this much of an issue they shouldn't have released the Versa.<br/><br/>I hate to do this, but I feel I've got no choice.<br/>From the get go I've had troubles with my Versa. It didn't want to sync, updates constantly failed. Especially compared to my 2 year old Blaze, the Versa is only what I could call 'a hot mess'.  I actually tossed it in a drawer and gave it up as wasted money; bad product.<br/>Frustrated by others reporting their happiness with it, I contacted support.<br/>I'm now on my second week of working with support, doing battery tests every day. Basically toting around a dead piece of technology on my wrist as every feature must be disabled. Yet the response I keep getting is I'm doing it wrong and my power source is inadequate. No Fitbit, no. Regardless what I do, I should be getting more than 12 hours of battery life on a pedometer.<br/><br/>This is my third and final Fitbit product.
 Great seller, hower I returned this  for Fitbit charge 3. The “special edition band was grey cardboard and difficult to fasten- However the thin flat screen was very comfortable and stylish. Product seemed to be boxed correctly but it has some data on it before I even had a chance to program???? It would not down load all the apps using new my iPhone -tried for days. Had problem with clock face selection although they “fixed” the bug?<br/>This one may have been a lemon? Not sure<br/>My new Fitbit charge 3-was heaven. Not as stylish but the screen on new charge is larger and it has everything you need if fitness is your goal. I will revisit Versa in the future tosee if improvements have been made! If you do like the versa -fwarning the delux  band is not worth the price!
 I really like my new Versa. It’s light and  easy to wear. I forget I’m wearing it. I wish I could take off some of the pre-installed apps. Some of the apps I won’t use, however I love not worrying about getting it wet. So far so good. I just got it a couple of days ago and I would like to give an update in a couple of weeks. So far, I’m really enjoying my new and improved Fitbit.
 Let me start with it does everything the description says it does.  Getting there is, well, not the easiest thing to do.  I am writing this instead of my spouse who is the actual user of this device.  I wouldn't consider myself a technological guru by any means but I admit that I am pretty good with digital devices and honestly the "user manual" provided isn't great.  From the time my spouse received it till she was able to navigate, use the app, etc.etc. was at least 7 days.  There were times that she would get so frustrated that she would hand it to me to attempt to figure out.  I understand that there is always a learning curve with new devices and the software but really?  Seven days?<br/>After we were able to get it dialed in, now my spouse is very happy with it.
 I've had a Fitbit One for probably about 4 years.  It was originally picked up when I had been a year into working an office sales job when prior to that I was outside on my feet doing landscaping or selling in a garden center.  I wanted something to encourage me to get up and move, and at the time just seeing the pedometer and using the app worked out fine for me.<br/><br/>Recently, I've made a much more successful effort to better my health, and during that process, I decided something that could monitor my heart rate would benefit me.  I had been looking at the Charge line, but this one popped up along the way.  I decided to go ahead and go for it.  I'd say for me, the extra cost over the Charge 2 that I had been looking at was worth it.<br/><br/>I love having a watch always there, instead of trying to remember if my Fitbit One was in my pocket or not.  It's customizable and allows you to add or remove workouts you don't want to have on the quick start portion.  It tracks my sleep in a way I find fascinating and insightful, as now it means I'm using it to better my sleep habits.  It has a silly little game you can add to the apps part that allows me to make walking a fun challenge.  It also will tell me once every hour if I've not walked around enough, key for me in my office setting.  The text portion is handy for when I'm not looking at my phone, and I love having my daily stats right there if it's not updated to the website dashboard.<br/><br/>The biggest thing I still love about it is the heart rate monitor.  It helps me see where I'm pushing myself a bit too hard, and has given me a way to know when I should be increasing my intensity during workouts.  I want to be more fit heart and lung wise, as well as loose weight.  In the two weeks I've had it, I've already improved my resting heart rate, which has encouraged me to continue on!<br/><br/>Overall, I love it and hope it continues working for years to come, lasting me as long as my little Fitbit One.
 I bought this thinking it was an upgrade from my Garmin Vivoactive HR. Specifically, I was really keen to get a phone that could hold music so that I would not have to carry my phone when going out to run. Having had it for a month, here's what stands out for me.<br/>PROS<br/>1. I like the sleep tracking app<br/>2. It looks better than the Garmin watch<br/>3. Loading it with music was not too complicated and the quality is good.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>1. I really hate the fact that the watch face is not always on. Even after a month, I still find it awkward to keep twisting my wrist to  see the time especially because it does not always work. I guess it shares this trait with the apple watch which is why I will not buying that any time soon.<br/>2. The heart rate monitor is a joke. I can be working out and my heart rate will only go as high as 99, and this is with a significant lag. Meanwhile, the Garmin watch is showing a rate of 130 while my Galaxy Note phone is showing 128. Its clear which device is off.<br/>3. When sleeping, the watch face will suddenly come on when turning. The luminous green light is very distracting when trying to sleep<br/>4. It is getting harder to sync it to the phone. Even when I switch on the GPS function on the phone, it will still take 5-10 minutes before it successfully syncs.<br/>5. It might have an impressive app store, but most of the apps are too basic in function to make a difference.<br/><br/>All in all, I am unimpressed and I am currently selling it as I look for something better.
 A wonderful and handy tool to have on your wrist, but lacks many features. For one, the watch needs its own built in speaker and mic so you can answer calls and talk on the phone just with the watch and not have to pull out your phone. It also needs its own form of texting besides pre typed replies to missed calls, something like Apple watches' scribble or heck if it had a mic, talk type messages! The app store needs a major update and more first party suppourt...we need amazon music!! Even a UPS app for your orders would be amazingly handy. Please make this happen!
 Actually, I'd give it 4.7 stars, to be perfectly accurate.  I am really enjoying this product.  Here's the breakdown.<br/><br/>PROS:  I've now been using the Versa for 3 days, 18 hours, and 30 minutes.  I still have 38% of the battery charge, remaining.  Considering the number of clock faces and apps I've tried, as well as the number of I've activated the display, because I'm like a kid with a new toy, I am certain, the claim of 4+ days between battery charges, is accurate.  The display is great, and easily readable in bright sunlight, and activates with a turn of the wrist.  The touch screen works without problem.  The screen size makes it easy to read.  It is light weight and looks nice.  It comes with both large and small wrist bands, which are easily installed.<br/><br/>CONS:  The Versa lost the bluetooth signal a couple of times.  While re-acquiring it is simple and takes less than a minute, I have to wonder why it happens when the Versa is never more than 3 ft. from my phone.<br/><br/>Hope this information is of some help.  If I should think of anything else that may be relevant, I'll update this review.
 Until this product, I used the Fitbit charge HR (and the HR 2). My biggest complaint about those products were their inability to get wet, and their lack of a count-down timer. The Versa fixes both of these, and even allows for other apps for varying purposes (and much more). I'm sad there isn't an app for guiding meditation yet, but the process for creating apps is simple enough that much of this problem will go away over time (in fact, as a developer myself, I plan on working on an app for meditation for personal use, so anyone can use it).<br/>I would recommend this product for anyone debating between a Charge HR2 and this, or anyone who wants a fitness tracker/smartwatch hybrid with reasonable water resistance.
 Freaking love it. I have upgraded my fitbit from a flex to a Versa. I have had it for 2 weeks and it is amazing. The only difference between Versa and Ionic is the onboard GPS. (Die Hard Runners would want the Ionic) I'm a hobbyist runner/walker. It has "get up and move" reminders. Text and Email alerts. you can see the text and emails on the display. phone call alerts. you can see who is calling on the display and can answer the call from the display (but it activates your phone to take the call)(expected). I ordered the black band fitbit because the gray one was on back order. Amazon has gobs of knock off replacement band options. There are so many digital clock faces to pick from; something plain that just tells time, to something that is "stat heavy" . This fitbit has a heart rate monitor and a sleep monitor. It has all the bells and whistles you are use to if you currently have a fitbit. Your Music can be downloaded to the device.  I wanted something more like a smart watch but without the sticker shock. Spend a little more for the Versa. You will not be disappointed.<br/>EDIT: after having a month. it still is an awesome product. my only con is the clock faces. all are not all free. you can use them for a couple of days then the software creator locks down your versa and sends you a code so you can pay to release the clock face and continue using or you can log into your app and install a new one. Which the new one will in the next few days, lock down and you have to pay to continue using. It is not a ransomeware situation just inconvenient.  There is no way to tell which clock faces are free and which will lock and make you pay to continue. So i just reinstall the same few over and over and so be it.  not a big problem, just irritating.
 When I first got this watch 7 months ago I absolutely loved it. However, after 4 months it stopped working. I contacted customer support and had to do a whole bunch of things like restart it and take pictures of the problem and send them to them. They sent me a new one since it happened within the first year, ok great. Received the new one and it did not work. Contacted customer support again the day I received the replacement with to tell them about the issues. Again, had to do a whole bunch of stuff and send them pictures with now with a hand written number next to the watch to prove I was having the problem. Again, sent me another watch. Now, the charger has stopped working (I hope that's the problem). Had to go thru all the same stuff again. It's nice they back their product for the first year, however,  I should not be having this many problems after only having the watch for 7 months. Also, when the warranty is up I'm sure it will break again and I will not be buying another one. I expected more from a fitbit product. I am highly disappointed.
 Pros:<br/><br/>- Receive text messages (through iPhone and Verizon)<br/>- Track your steps<br/>- Track your sleep<br/>- Gives tips to stay active (ex: 150 steps left this hour!)<br/>- A fun little message dances across the screen when you hit your step goal for the day<br/>- Record other workouts<br/>- Workout details include heart rate (average and highest), distance, time, calories burned<br/>- Female health tips optional<br/>- Easy to connect to WiFi<br/>- Easy to navigate<br/>- Easy to pair with phone, headphones, and other accessories<br/>- Great price<br/>- Quick to charge<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Cannot respond to text messages<br/>- When the battery is low, you receive an e-mail, though I would prefer it to be a message on the watch itself<br/>- Difficult to connect to iTunes: I have all old songs from CD's and not downloaded from iTunes store so I cannot transfer onto the watch<br/>- To use Pandora or Deezer, you have to have a subscription (aka pay monthly)<br/><br/>Overall, there isn't much bad to say about this watch. If I keep my phone close, messages and calls will come up on the screen. To skip paying for a music service, I play Pandora on my phone and connect through wireless headphones. The battery life is good, there is a direct correlation to how much you use the watch to how quickly the battery drains. Thankfully, the battery charges quickly. Apple watches have more features but they also have a higher price tag. If you're debating between the two, go with FitBit!
 I really loved it until three days ago. The heart monitor, sleep tracking, and activity after 10 all stopped working 3 days ago. A full charge Thursday and just about dead right now when prior to I got 5 days battery life. And the screen flashes when left button is clicked so I have to hit it multiple times.<br/><br/>Now I've had the charge, charge 2, and blaze... I've never called support where they didn't help me right away and/or sent a new product right away. This versa cost the most I've ever spent on a fitbit and after speaking to CS I've been told I have to wait up to 48hrs because it has been email escalated to another team.  I'm really disappointed and wish I just stuck with my almost two year old blaze.<br/><br/>So many reviews are talking about the bad customer support I'm now concerned I am going to suffer the same. What happened with fitbit? Frustrated long time fitbit customer...
 I like the device (basically the blaze updated); I just wish the band was easier to change.  I typically just use this one on my running days, even though I don't use the app (prefer my Garmin or Polar device).  The Versa is my pricey step counter for outdoor workouts :-).  It is basically a backup for my Alta, which prefer to wear to work and to any other events that require a sleeker or dressier look.  If I purchase another Fitbit, it will be another Alta.<br/><br/>Update to review, 9/19/2018:  Getting ready to hopefully trade this in to HRM USA since I can't return it.  It stopped counting active minutes (during cardio as well as a six mile run; smh).  I think it may be adversely affecting my Alta's performance; the app has gone haywire since I removed the Versa and will not pick up any additional steps from the Alta.  Wish I hadn't purchased the Versa at all.  Hard lesson learned.
 This product worked great for several months.  I have used it to walk, run, shower, swim, do housework, etc.  Then, one day, while I was swimming, it died.  I have been swimming with it before without any problems so I'm not sure why it had a problem this time. Of course, my time to return this product has passed so now I have to contact FitBit directly and HOPE that they will do something about this.
 when you open up the box the only instructions are the quick start pamphlet which just guides you to download the fitbit app. the only thing that happened was that my fitbit and phone started doing a firmware update for OVER 2 HOURS and then afterwards, started over for ANOTHER round! At the same speed! Will update later but I'm already ready to give up on something that is so slow to start up.<br/><br/>Update: my Fitbit has started working but my phone (pixel 2 xl, relatively new and good phone!) Can never connect to it properly. It syncs slowly when it finally does work, and Android keeps sending me notifications that it failed. Also you have to swipe up on the watch to see stats and they take forever to load
 I’ve had this for about 4 months. My favorite things about this Fitbit versa watch are the way texts show up, I can give a short reply, and I can pay just with the watch. It seems more reliable connecting to the phone than my last Fitbit, the Blaze. Getting the band on and off is a little finicky and I tend to keep the black plastic one on all the time. I like that I can gently wash the entire watch since this one is water proof.  I like the way the charger grabs the watch and I can keep the band on. I have one issue with the watch...since I’m using the wallet feature, a code needs to be typed in whenever I put the watch back on. No alarms or texts will alert me until that code is entered. Sometimes, during my sleep (I layed on the watch) or when I’m very active, the security feature is activated and the code needs to be entered. Very often the security feature is engaged during yoga and the exercise mode is cancelled.
 I love the rose gold I had the original blaze. Yes, I handed it down to my 32-year-old daughter. I did find out with this product excellent Versa has one small problem it does show smudges and fingerprints. I would highly recommend ordering EZCO 4 pack screen protector inexpensive $10 Easy to install plus you will no longer have smudges and it will protect your watch from scratches. There are are so gorgeous thin leather bands that will fit this Versa Fitbit small for ladies. The brand is SWEES.  Especially made for women with small wrists.
 Love this Fitbit. It is helping me stay on my fitness plan. Other features are also great. Four stars because sinking with apps is not that user friendly. Some apps linked to the watch easily but some are not. Getting text and phone alerts is a good feature and I'm finding very helpful.
 Wow where to start. Well, first, if you are set on getting this Fitbit, be warned. It has taken me 4 days, including contacting Fitbit support, to get the thing set up. This is my 3rd Fitbit and I have never had issues before, and I'm not that big of a tech dummy. If it doesn't like your wifi network, it will NOT connect even if every other device in your home has no problem. So how do you set up/update the Fitbit without wifi? Well, it gives you an option to skip it but trust me, that will not work. Your update will fail over and over, sometimes after hours of waiting to get to 37% and bam! update fails. **TIP** If it won't connect to your wifi and the update continually fails, save yourself the trouble and use your phone as a Hotspot and connect to that for wifi, save yourself the grief of restarts, unpairing, starting over, waiting, and frustration of multiple failed attempts. It finally worked that way for me. Now that it's finally up and running, let it be known that the bands are a pain in the rear to change, especially in comparison to the Charge2 that had a fantastic easy way to replace bands with no pins. So, ease of setup and band replacement gets an F. The functionality seems OK, time will tell. I'm not sure if this was worth $180; I'd feel better about it if I had paid the $150 sale price before Christmas. I hope I like it in the end as much as my Charge. If it gives me any more grief it's going back to JB.
 I am beyond upset. The second day I woke up, and it gave me 25 steps. I went to bed at ten the previous night, I didn't wake up until 5:30. I did not wear it to bed. When I woke up, I saw the 25 steps, put it on, walked to the bathroom then it gave me 250 steps. It's maybe 20 steps to my bathroom tops. Then, I decided to try to reset it. I didn't mind losing data since I'd only had it a few days. Now it won't even connect to my phone. I will be contacting customer service to send this back. This is absolutely ridiculous.
 I chose the Versa to replace an older basic watch that had gotten scratched and dinged up so badly it wasn't readable any more; figured I'd give Fitbit another chance.  And so far, I'm very pleased with the choice.<br/><br/>As a watch, well, it tells time and date.  It can give text and email notifications, though they're often delayed several seconds (but that's okay).  The main reason to go for this watch is its activity tracking functions, and here it seems to be doing a great job so far.  It even survives trips to the pool and my son's bathtime.<br/><br/>What I found most surprising, though, is that simply having my activity readout visible and having goals for the various categories makes me want to hit them.  I had a hybrid car for a while and that was bad--a car with an efficiency readout is a cruel thing to give to an engineer--but this doesn't make me obsess like hitting mileage numbers did.  My Versa has spurred me to start taking walks at lunch every day to at least get some exercise during a 12-hour desk job day.  It reminds me to get up and stretch my legs when I've been staring at difficult problems for a while.  It tracks my workouts and gives me heart rate plots (very interesting, those) and I can see measurable changes in resting heart rate as I've started exercising more.<br/><br/>Initially I was a little skeptical of the sleep phase tracking, but seeing the graph in the morning and correlating with how rested I feel and what I remember of waking up and dreaming, it seems reasonably close.<br/><br/>I was also skeptical of the calorie tracking feature, figuring it was really overestimating.  There was no way I was burning 3500+ calories a day with just a walk, as I hadn't been gaining or losing weight.  But then on a whim, I tried out the food tracking part with some of the things I eat regularly.  To my utter dismay, I found that I was indeed probably burning about that much, because apparently I'd been eating that much (insert eyes the size of dinner plates here).<br/><br/>I do wish the battery life was better, though I charge it every night anyway.  I also wish the charger wasn't so bulky, but I don't really see an alternative that doesn't involve an opening in the case.  And sometimes it doesn't really recognize the wrist-flick to see the time without hitting buttons or tapping the screen.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is with the app; even with all-day sync turned off and "background data" disabled in Android it will still try to pull several megs a day of mobile data.  Not cool when you share a 2GB plan with your wife.  I had to get a firewall program for my (rooted) phone and completely block the app from using mobile data, so now it only syncs on wifi.  The food tracking interface could use some minor improvements too.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm extremely pleased and am trying to convince my wife to get one of these vs. a less-capable tracker.<br/>----------<br/>UPDATE 1/28/19: I'm still extremely happy with mine and my wife ended up getting one too.  Both of us have made significant improvements to our health; I'm down 40lb (back to high school graduation weight!) from eating better and exercising a lot more; she's losing weight and exercising more than ever.  I'm even running significantly faster than I used to.<br/><br/>I think the biggest, most helpful factor has been the calorie tracking.  Losing weight requires burning more calories than you're eating; no way around that.  I think the problem is that most people, even if they track their calories, have no real good way of knowing what they're burning.  I had the same problem; without knowing what I'm burning the food target is a stab in the dark.  Either you're a lot more active than you think and you way underestimate your calories burned, feel like crap because you aren't eating, and give up; or your calorie target is too generous and you give up because you aren't getting results.<br/><br/>Enter Fitbit.  Wear it consistently and put your information in accurately, and it's likely going to give you a pretty good number to go by.  If you know what you've burned, you know what you can eat, and Fitbit makes that simple with a "you have XXXX calories left" display.  You'll still have to observe and adjust over time to learn your average error rate (I'm generally off by about 120 calories/day based on weight trends) but once you know that you can correct for it.<br/><br/>The other nice thing with tracking is that, if you're like me and you work out and exercise so you can eat, you can reward yourself for an especially active day, or tack on a workout to make extra room for a special meal, without blindly guessing.  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten to the end of the day and tacked on a brisk walk or HIIT workout just so I can go eat dessert or have a beer or two.  You can have as many "cheat days" as you want, as long as you exercise enough to make up for it!<br/><br/>Another interesting side effect is that it's made household chores like mowing the lawn or cleaning less of a pain.  Mowing in particular burns calories off like a workout, so it's like getting rewarded with food for doing chores!<br/><br/>In all, it makes losing weight (fat) simple.  Now, I didn't say it was *easy*--it still takes willpower and enduring a little discomfort--but it basically takes the guesswork out.  Unless you go out to eat at a non-chain restaurant; there you're on your own to put in your best guess for what you've eaten...
 Not fully compatible with Galaxy note 8 so I can't reply to texts which is the main thing I was super excited about for upgrading to the versa. Otherwise it is really great. I have had the charge HR and the blaze before and this one tops the cake. Love the Fitbit app as always and now there is added female healh tracking options. It is so sleek and beautiful. Very similar to Apple watch but has a slightly larger face and is square rather than rectangle which I think k looks much nicer imo. The stock band is still belt buckle style but is smooth rather than the textured which makes much more sense and holds less debris. SO MANY WATCH FACE OPTIONS. Including a few you can personalize and add a photo from your album on the background. Waterproof is very nice touch and can now use while active swimming. If you liked the blaze, this is simply a really great upgrade that gets you a little closer to smart watches. Must have paid Pandora subscription to use it on the watch which I got suckered into and just did basic plan. Now I have the option to listen without having to cart my phone around at the gym which will be nice. I really wish I could utilize the quick responses, especially considering I have a nice, new, updated phone but other than that no complaints.
 I came back to review this after it died this morning with no warning.  No damage...nothing.  It often doesn't sync with my text messages and calls.  I have given up on the smart watch part of it a long time ago.  Maybe a month or two after getting it it became a pain to get messages to sync reliably.  Now this morning I work up and it was fine.  Got out of the shower (with it on the counter) and found it to have black lines through the screen.  Then closed and woke up and the picture had started to be black around the edges.  Next time it only had a small bar you could see across the top and the rest was completely black.  Now it won't even show anything.  This is my 2nd Fitbit (Alta now Versa) and they both have crapped out before a year.  I'm done with them.
 This is my fourth Fitbit device as I was so happy with the rest but if it doesn't work with all the features. It does NOT consistently synch, loses connection and the support articles are an insult to my intelligence. "Update, reboot, update try a different device, reboot." This is a super frustrating 200$ mistake.
 Out of the gate this device suffered issues.  The bluetooth sync was eratic to say the least.  I have a half dozen friends with the same device and I've had 2 past fit bit products and we all know that bogus blutooth is part of the package.<br/><br/>But then the screen started to not turn off, it would drain battery in a 12 hour time after a full charge.  Then that would go away and the screen would dim and not be viewable.<br/><br/>this device was handled with great care and it didn't even make it 6 months, a real disappointment.  The worst fitbit yet.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Reached out to Fitbit and they are sending me a replacement.  If that breaks I'll update this again.  Knocked the rating from 1 to 4 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Yes they gave me a new working Versa, but this thing still is horrible on the bluetooth.  It syncs about 10% of the time, to 1% of the time.  I've now tried Versas on 3 different phones for extended periods of time across multiple versions of android and 2 different versa units and this issue is as bad or worse than on previous fitbit devices like the charge.  The thing is this won't fly anymore.  This device is marketed and priced to compete with smart devices and its anything but.  It is the only bluetooth device that is this bad.  This makes gps sync for actual running impractical.  You can spend an hour trying to get it to connect and still fail.  When it works and when it doesn't is anyone's guess.
 When I got this watch and set it up just two months ago, I was over the moon about it. I loved the face, the stuff it tracks, the app.  It was great and I found the data to be miles ahead on accuracy from my previous fitness watches..  I bought multiple bands to go with every occasion and made this a part of my life.<br/>But the battery life started becoming less and less.  I looked for tips online and turned off some of the functions I loved, like active sync and alarms and notifications.  But still the battery barely lasts a day before going totally dead.  So now it turns out I’ve bought an expensive piece of junk that won’t hokd a charge for a day.  Please save your money and don’t buy this watch.  Would have been awesome....great info and attractive but in reality, it’s not awesome.  😔
 I looked high and low for a smartwatch that would keep track of my husband's laps when he swims. He loves to swim laps and keep track of how many laps he does but he always loses count (since he swims up to a mile or two at a time). There were literally NO watches that were water-resistant and kept track of swim laps except THIS Fitbit Versa.<br/><br/>I was so scared to get this watch because I read such mixed reviews that this watch didn't work or do as it advertised but we have had NO problems with it and neither of us are that tech savvy. My husband originally didn't like the watch because the font is so small and he doesn't always wear his glasses but he loves the fact that he can check on his stats on his phone or laptop when he has some downtime. When you swim laps it will keep track of it but it doesn't save that info on your watch, so you actually have to check this stat on your computer (not phone).... not sure why but we don't mind since he likes to review it all on a big screen anyway.<br/><br/>This watch stays true to battery life (~4 days). He has only had this watch for about a month and when he takes it off to charge he says he feels naked now. I'm so so happy he loves it, therefore, this was a very great purchase.<br/><br/>This watch also keeps track of your sleep patterns, steps (of course), heart rate, all that fun stuff. Only bummer is that my husband would've loved for this watch to be able to pair with waterproof headphones so he could listen to music underwater but I read that the bluetooth music stops working once you're underwater. Haven't tried it yet but maybe I will and then rewrite this review.<br/><br/>Awesome watch. Would recommend. Also, get the warranty in case!!!
 There are many good things about the watch but it needs improvement.  I still cannot get any music loaded either Pandora or owned music.  Also I have bought 3 additional watch band, one one fits.  The band attachment design is very poor.<br/>UPDATE. I took away another star.  Had it less than a week and realize I should have spent the extra money for an iwatch.  First firmware update will not load.  Wasted 200$
 This watch worked pretty well for the first 2 weeks I had it and the woven band is very nice. I enjoyed that the watch will track my workouts without me having to "start" them manually, but that's about all I like.<br/>I was not able to change my watch to military time, most of the apps you have to pay to be able to use (have pandora premium), and after 2 weeks my watch kept freezing and the screen kept having a delay or not turning on at all. It's not very useful if it doesn't turn on or has a frozen screen. I do not recommend this device for anyone working in the medical field as the screen kept randomly shutting off while I was trying to keep track of vital signs, time of lab draws, etc... I will be returning this and most likely getting an apple watch in the next few weeks.
 Love this! Had an older Fitbit  that finally died (quit charging) after years of use. This thing is amazing. Love the fact that you can read messages, see who’s calling, etc. you can send quick replies to messages such as “yes” or “no”, but I still like the fact I can see who and what it is to determine if I need to grab my phone and reply. My absolute most favorite part is the ability to listen to music with my wireless Bluetooth headphones. I can walk or be at gym without carrying my phone around. Th wonky issue I’ve had is the weather app on it. It works sometimes and sometimes it doesn’t. But everything else does.  I also love the fact that it’s super comfortable — much more than the older one I had and it’s waterproof! I don’t need to take it off while doing things around water.
 So lightweight!!!  I have a small wrist, and this actually looks GREAT!  I used to use the Charge 2, it was too heavy and marked my wrist.  I LOVE this new Versa!  The clock faces are amazing!  I love the color and I can read it so easily!  Thanks Fit Bit for this new type!
 I'm updating my previous four star review.<br/>Watch started to be defective (not responding to touch) after ~60 days.<br/>After another few days the screen died.<br/><br/>I have no major problems with this, ultimately when you produce millions of anything some units will be less reliable than others.<br/>I have no way of knowing how common my problem is.<br/><br/>The customer service however was abysmal. I spent two sessions over 40 minutes of chat to obtain a return authorization.<br/>I provided my first complaint number during second chat which was completely ignored as they asked me to perform the same steps as in the first chat.<br/><br/>As far as watch functions go, the exercise portion is excellent and user interface is very usable.<br/>I appreciate the battery life and sleep monitoring all which work relatively well.<br/>The experience of using this with my Android is not even half as good as using a WearOS watch  (or iPhone + apple watch).<br/>It has very poor support for notifications / phone calls, and has essentially no other integration.<br/><br/>If you want HR monitoring like I do I'd recommend finding an WearOS watch with HR built in.
 I was loving it but then the battery and band started to fail at the same time, about 8 months in. I used other bands most of the time but decided to start using the black band that came with it a couple months ago. It detaches at one end a few times a day and has fallen out of my sleeve twice today. I’ve also recently started charging it every day so it doesn’t die around dinner time and miss some of my steps. I used to only charge it about twice per week, with notifications and raise-to-wake on. I’ve had battery issues with previous fitbits, but none this bad. I contacted Fitbit customer support and hopefully they’ll be able to offer a solution.
 This is the 3rd fitbit I have. I always loved the form factor and small weight and simplicity but these devices always had reliability issues. This one is no different. Pairing with my phone worked very well until it didn't. Using the device to reply to texts resulted in multiple texts sent out. I.E. I pressed OK to reply and my wife got about 10 texts with the word OK with it. One day it stopped syncing, time would fall behind. Bettery drained fully within less than a day. Support with fitbit is ok, they will run you through the process of resetting again and again until "maybe" they will send you a replacement. I believe the issues with this one started after swimming with it one time. Having a hard time returning it to fitbit - took over 40 minutes to have them send me a return shipping label. "Once we receive and process your return shipment (usually 5 to 10 business days from drop off), we'll send you an email with instructions for next steps." From what the rep told me it would take another few days until they ship something back. So you will be without a device for 2-3 weeks.
 Love the new Fitbit Versa! I switched over from the Charge 2. I recommend the Versa watch before any of the others. I was skeptical because I liked the convenience of the Charge 2. I found that the band was stylish and it looked more modern. I figured any upgrade would make my wrist feel too heavy or it wouldn't be as slick on my wrist as the Charge 2 was. But I was wrong! The Versa is light, if not lighter than the Charge 2. It's a total smart watch, so it still does everything the Charge 2 does, but more. I am able to send back a quick text, and I can change my text back options. It syncs rather quickly and continuously with my phone. (I have a Note 8). There have been no syncing problems. And the face of the watch is so modern. I can switch it up if I need to. I love that it tracks your steps MORE accurately than the Charge 2. You still have alarms, and the vibrating intensity can be changed higher or lower, which was a problem with the Charge 2. Also, I can set my notifications to not be bothered while I am sleeping or working out. Ugh.. It's just a major step in the right direction. I'm telling you, if you are questioning if you want this watch or not.. Don't think about it again. This is what you want. I have been too afraid to test out the water resistant feature on this watch.. I mean come on. It's a $200 watch, and I want to stick it in water right away?! No thanks. But I might get more bold soon enough. The battery DOES last 3 or more days! I want to get a nice charging stand, because this watch is so beautiful. Meant for everyday or even fancy events. I love that it keeps my fitness level in check!
 I'm not very happy with this thing. I've been wearing it for almost a week and have had to restart it 3 times. The heart rate and step tracking seem wildly inaccurate to me, though I don't have a real heart rate monitor to test it. Interestingly, it even shows a pulse when it's on the charger and starts my day with a couple hundred steps before I even get out of bed. I also specifically bought the special edition for NFC payments, but it turns out no one I bank with supports Fitbit pay. Make sure you check first, it's a very short list. The battery life is great so far, and the synching of notifications from my phone works great when it hasn't locked up.. but right now it's more like a novelty watch than a reliable fitness tracker.
 I upgraded to the Versa from the Alta, and I'm very happy!  The watch size is perfect, and it isn't too heavy. The bands can be changed. Which means I can dress it up or down.  The HR monitor is a great feature, and I like that new apps are available.  Texts are clear on the screen.  It needs to charge every 4ish days, but it charges pretty fast. I would buy it again.
 Like many, the "up to 3 days", along with color, decent features and a nice look, made this a "winner".  Unfortunately, it goes from 100% battery to 0% in 3 to 4 hours.  After reset.  After turning off many features.  After charging numerous times to test. After reading Fitbit's and other users help advice.<br/><br/>Liked it well enough that if Amazon had offered a replacement option would have tried it to see if just the one we got was a lemon.  But option was now credit against your shopping cart, and since the watch was now +$50 seemed like just returning it was the only sensible choice.  Maybe when Versa 2 comes around :)
 This is my 3rd day using ...battery is holding well and I charged it this morning while I sat to drink my coffee and the charging is fast even though it is no less than down 20%.<br/>Set up was easy but it took LOTS of extra time to download and install bc I did not have WiFi.<br/>It is pretty easy to operate . As a 50 yo the only drawback is finding a screen that is easy to read / I did, so that’s is fine!<br/>I love the warning that it gives each hour is ending that I have # of steps before the hour is up ! I  have set my goal of 5k and yesterday I met it plus some and today I’m about there so that is a good thing<br/>Only  negative complaint is it’s spotty catching calls and some texts / I thought I might not care so much about that but if I’m away from my phone it’s nice to get the alert of a text or call... not sure what’s up with that . It’s light weight NOT bulky and even the plastic band is comfy ( I was thankful<br/>I didn’t have to change the band it came with the small band on it!!!<br/>Over all I’m pleased with the Fitbit Versailles have owned two others and this one is far the best with accuracy and charging this one on the cradle is very nice. It seems to be counting my steps (not sure pushing a shopping cart how well it counted , I intended to check and forgot ....<br/>anyway I recommend the watch for the price it does a lot and I’m happy with the purchase!
 It’s a great watch. I switched from my pebble time and love it! There are still a few things I’m getting used to, like how the music controls work, and there aren’t as many apps or watch faces like there are in the pebble store. I really wish there was a Mickey Mouse face. I also don’t like how most of the apps and faces you have to pay for now. Other than that, I love the health integration and being able to gamify things and compete with friends. I’m happy with my purchase overall.
 This thing is going to possibly save your life— it will definitely change it immensely starting day 1. Turning 40 carrying too much post baby weight, seeing bloodwork numbers creeping up, feeling gross in all ways I decided to change for my health and my family. This was my birthday present to myself. Never thought I would be so responsive to cues and praise. I obey the Fitbit. I gets me moving every hour, which I couple w a positive weight loss habit like doing a flight of stairs on route to a further water fountain. For max benefit I couple with the Weight Watchers app and my fitness pal app to track total calories burned and get some fitpoints to swap for WW food points. It’s all seamless you don’t have to do anything manually. I’ve taken it swimming and got it wet in the ocean, doing dishes it’s fine. Awesome stop watch and iPhone app user interface/tons of info. Getting great fascinating info on my sleep. This is the future of health: your body as machine to monitor its “performance”. Totally sold, way exceeding my early goals. I guess I just needed a witness and nudging, pats on the back and fireworks on the screen w vibrations every time I meet a goal for the day. This is the best thing i own/I’ve ever bought after my phone. Essential. Worth is priceless for your health and family. I know I sound like a commercial but I’ve been overweight for two decades and I’m finally feeling real hope and seeing fast results. Don’t hesitate!
 Ordered this because I work in a food/bev manufacturing plant and we are only allowed to wear Fitbits or Apple watches and I'm an Android user.  Today is my second day wearing my new Versa.  Now that it's up and running, it's awesome and I'm obsessed!  I look at my wrist constantly.  It's motivating me to get up and move around throughout the day, drink more water (I'm using the Water Logged app), battery is still over 50% and I've been playing with it quite a bit, and I downloaded a calculator app that is super handy.  I have it set to a Flux watch face with a custom color theme that I really love.<br/><br/>Removing 1 star because set up on this thing was an absolute NIGHTMARE.  The initial update would not complete.  I tried to restart everything on a different connection, still no luck.  I browsed the community forums and based off many suggestions, I factory reset the watch, uninstalled and reinstalled the app several, turned off and turned on Bluetooth, and not just once but multiple times in multiple combinations.  Somewhere during all of that I got a big red X on the watch with a data not cleared error.  After just randomly restarting everything, I finally got the thing to update but then it wasn't syncing well with my phone.  My phone, an LG G6, is not on the list of "officially" compatible devices and I thought I might have to send it back.  I finally stumbled on a comment in the forums where someone with the same issues said they unpaired their previous FitBit from their Bluetooth devices.  BLESS HER HEART.  I unpaired my old Charge, had some improvement, and then deleted it from my devices on my FitBit app and voila.  It works perfectly now and I have had no syncing issues since.
 My daughter's review:  "I love my new Fitbit. I've had it for almost 3 weeks. It's a nice upgrade from my Charge 2 that I bought a couple years ago. I bought grey/silver because it goes with my outfits nicely. It is even waterproof and showerproof and I wear it in the shower. Another reason I like it is because it looks like an Apple Watch except cheaper and without the annoying circle knob. I like the wallpaper customization and that there is a swim workout mode because I love to swim and, there is also a weather app and I love to check the weather every day. The pet peeve both my dad and I had was getting it programmed and ready to use. It took awhile but it ended up working out nicely.😊"
 I have a Fitbit Charge 2 that I love, so when my husband needed a new watch, the Fitbit Versa looked like the perfect solution. And it would be, if we could get the sleep tracker to work. We've gone through all the troubleshooting, but it's still missing part of his sleep each night. If he wakes up to go to the bathroom, it doesn't track anything after that, although he does go back to sleep for more than 3 hours. We've had it for 8 days now, and this has been true every night except one.  What was the difference?  Beats us!  He has a consistently low resting heartbeat of 54, which is correct and is a good thing ( a slow heart is a happy heart), so maybe that's a factor; however, many athletes have that, so it shouldn't be a factor.  New firmware just came out, but it may be weeks before it's available on this device, so we're contemplating returning before the window closes.  I plan to wear it tonight instead of my Charge 2, which tracks my sleep just fine, just to see if it tracks correctly with another wearer with a higher resting heartbeat (mine is 69).  I'll update this review if  the problem comes to light.  Otherwise, sad to say we'll probably return it.
 In terms of functionality, this product is fine. It has the same features a Fitbit HR 2 would have, with the addition of various smart watch functionality like custom faces, apps, ability to control your phone, etc.<br/><br/>However, the battery life is quite awful even when it is barely being used (I get around 2 days per charge with very, very light usage). The battery performance is nowhere remotely near what it claims to provide. Even with the usual inflated numbers companies provide, this is pitiful.<br/><br/>In addition, it's very unreliable. It typically crashes and reboots 10-15 times per day. That is not an exaggeration. Basically every hour I am awake, it freezes, crashes, and restarts at least once.<br/><br/>Stick with one of the cheaper fitbits.
 So today is my first full day wearing the watch and I love it! Set up took around 45 minutes for me, be prepared to use your wifi to set it up. One complaint is that I wasn't able to download my itunes playlist to the watch last night because it said it was going to take 6 hours, so I suggest building a smaller playlist specifically for when you want to workout, and download that to the watch. In order to download music you have to have the fitbit app on your mac/pc.<br/><br/>I am wearing the large band on the second closure (tightest option). The small band fit me, but I didn't like how nubby the strap looked so I sized up to the large (included in the box) and just wear it on one of the tightest settings. The band was somewhat difficult to unattach/reattach the larger one, but I blame my chubby fingers for that.<br/><br/>I ended up ordering a protective screen cover for the watch, because I already banged it on the wall twice today (luckily no scratches). It was like $8 through amazon prime.<br/><br/>The watch charges without needing to remove the band which is really nice. The watch can also have individual alarms set, I set mine for taking medicine and waking up in the morning. Also, the watch does hourly notices on how many more steps you need, and it alerts you with vibration.<br/><br/>So far, So good!
 I’m a longtime Fitbit user - the Versa is my third watch from them.  I’ve also owned an Apple Watch 3.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for a fitness tracker, the Fitbit is much better than the Apple Watch.  Better app, better battery life, easier to see your results.  The overall hardware and build quality of the Apple Watch is a bit better however (but is about $100+ more).<br/><br/>However, I much prefer the the software on the Fitbit as it’s much easier to see step counts, heart rate, etc.  The Apple Health app is atrocious by comparison.  The Versa also feels lighter and less noticeable on my wrist, which is good.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for a smart watch rather than a fitness tracker, Fitbit does have a bit of catching up to do.  The Apple Watch has some nice features such as Siri at the push of a button (somewhat gimmicky but useful for setting a quick timer for example), as well as the ability to respond to texts directly from the watch.  I’ve heard rumors that Fitbit will try to add the text responses in the future but for now, it doesn’t.<br/><br/>The Apple Watch also has a smoother frame rate when animations are playing; the Versa looks jerky.  Although that does not fundamentally affect the operation of the device, it’s something that I find annoying and makes the Versa feel less premium.<br/><br/>I look forward to see what see software updates, apps, and watch faces Fitbit will release for the Versa in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, I’d give the Versa 3.5 stars but am rounding up due to positive experiences in the past with the Fitbit company as a whole.
 I was very disappointed overall in the lack of accuracy in this watch. For $200, it looked nice, but it never would keep an accurate number of steps. I'd wake up and before I even got out of bed, I had 1,100 steps??? Hmmmm. I really lost any confidence in any of it being accurate after that. This was one of the main reasons that I purchased the watch, and to use when I am at gym. I read many reviews complaining of similar problems, and "Ghost steps", or steps added while watch was charging. I did try to trouble shoot with technical support by changing the wrist I wore it on (and dominant settings) but noticed little difference.  For the investment, I just feel that it didn't live up to my expectations.  I would shop around or wait for Fit Bit to fix the glitches.
 I am in love with my new VERSA!  Setting up the Versa is easy and intuitive.  I use my FitBit in a rather unique way. I am hearing impaired and knowing that my Versa vibrates to notify me of telephone calls and text messages is critical - especially when I am in a noisy environment.  My FitBit Charge did the same thing, however, now I can read the entire text message without reaching for my telephone - this is a real plus.  I also use my Versa as an alarm clock - works GREAT.  It is so much fun choosing new clock faces (daily if I want) - I really enjoy the variety. This is the fourth morning after my initial 2 hour charge and I am still at 50% battery life - YEA!  I do not have my settings on continuous sync or have "time to get walking" messages - these are neat things, but that is not the primary reason I chose the Versa.  This would be a great gift if you have a friend or relative that is hearing impaired.  Oh, by the way, it's a pretty addition to my wrist!
 The watch is light and cool the use and wear. However, when it comes to being a smart watch it falls short.  They leaned nothing from the people from Pebble as for message notifications, alerts, other app notifications. There is a very limited number of apps. Apps are sometimes challenging to configure. Hard to find how to navigate the Fitbit app to configure apps. I still like the watch but all it really is right now is a enhanced Fitbit HR Charge 2 with a color screen. Battery life is awesome!  But I’m really hoping that with some more software upgrades that it will be a real smart watch. This product could really be so much better with input from the millions of owners. I think my Pebble 2 is much more of a smart watch right now but I’d love to see more people using this device. It will definitely help with physical fitness and make people to exercise more.
 I'm a strength and conditioning coach who has used various heart rate monitors and tracking devices. I train athletes for a living and travel from weight-room to weight-room a great deal, so it is inevitable that along the way some "bumps" are going to occur.<br/><br/>This being said, it was evident early that this screen was fragile at best. Even with a screen protector that I bought (tempered plastic), in less than 6 months scratches were evident, and later a crack in the screen. I'm fairly OCD regarding expensive devices like this, so I never wore it while doing "higher impact" movements or barbell exercises like cleans, or snatches out of fear that the screen would be exposed. To no avail, still a crack.<br/><br/>I've scoured the forums for Fitbit and it seems I have now joined the legions of FitBit customers who have no support or hope of getting a cracked screen. Spring for something more durable or with better customer support.
 So I was over the moon to get my Versa Fit bit. But this is where I'm really disappointed:<br/>1. It was a pain in the but to set up taking forever to charge.  It says that it takes 30 minutes but it took about 2.5 hours. If the instructions prepared me for longer I wouldn't have been so disappointed.<br/>2. It doesn't sync with the app on demand. It says is syncing but it's not. The app is still showing info from 2 days ago and the fitbit has 85% battery life... so it's not battery running low.<br/>3. Sometimes the screen distorts.<br/>4. Sometimes the touchscreen does not respond<br/>5. The battery life runs out VERY fast even when not connected to bluetooth<br/>6. We bought a Versa fitbit for our son at Target 2 days after buying mine on Amazon... he is having ZERO issues like I am with mine (however, it did take an hour to set up vs. 30 minutes as they indicate.. it was still better than mine)<br/>So I'm wondering if I was sent a defective fitbit.<br/>I love that my son and I get to encourage each other with fitness... I'm very disappointed that the device is not working consistently. I'm giving 3 stars because of the issues... it would be 5 stars if these issues were not present.
 I am so happy with my purchase! I previously owned a Charge 2,  but after a couple years it was starting to act up so I decided to upgrade. Did a lot of research before purchasing the Versa.  I am a 60-year-old woman, and I had absolutely no problem with set up, uploading apps, changing the band, etc. The SE version  comes with a woven band, in a size small and large, as well as the standard plastic/rubber band in black.  There are YouTube videos that very clearly explain set up, and also how to change the band if you choose.  Reason for four stars is that it did give me inaccurate readings for my sleep pattern for a couple of nights, and I understand this is a problem that other people have also encountered. However I love this fitness tracker so much that I’m willing to deal with that.
 My Charge HR was getting some age on it and needing some TLC, but there are no replacement parts available for it.  I had decided to get the Charge 3, but a deal came along on the Versa too good to pass up.  A few days before Christmas I got a notification from a deal site that Amazon had the Versa for $89.  Significant discount and significantly cheaper than the Charge 3 I was considering.  If not for the great deal I got I would regret purchasing.  The watch is a little bulky from what I prefer and it is very finicky in getting basic features to work, such as changing the watch faces. This occurs with my phone, laptop and desktop computer, so it almost has to be an issue with the Vera.  The battery life is worse than my several year old Charge HR, which I understand is due in part to the very nice screen the Versa has.  It almost seems like Fitbit might have rushed an unpolished product out to better compete with the Apple Watch.  I might just have a Versa with issues, but I prefer the simplicity and size of the Charge 3.
 I like the Versa because I can listen to my music from it. It did take some research to figure out how to upload the music though. I also like the apps. I am also able to set it to get notifications from various apps that are downloaded on my phone. The only problem I have found with the Versa is the battery life. The information on the Fitbit site said it has approximately a 4 day battery. I’ve had to charge it about every 2.5-3 days. I was used to my Alta that held its charge for almost a week. I am pleased with the purchase, other than the battery life.
 Big fan! I used the Fitbit Blaze for quite a while and liked it a lot but when I had a chance to upgrade, I did a lot of looking between this and the Apple Watch. Finally chose this one and couldn’t be happier!! I love the rose gold frame. It’s feminine without being girly or frilly and I paired mine with a pink rose leather band and am in love! People constantly ask me if it’s an Apple Watch because it has such clean lines and looks so nice! This watch is an absolute winner for me! Listen, I can read my texts and messages (without the phone marking them as “read” - which is a really handy little feature let me tell you), it tells me when I’m getting a call, alerts me to events on my calendar, I can control my music through it, shows me the weather, automatically tracks my steps and activities, it has workouts and motivations, it tracks my sleep automatically, and has a crazy long battery life!! I’ve had this thing on for 3 days and it still had charge left when I plugged her in. Seriously. If you’re looking for a smart watch and you don’t “need” to get an Apple, give this one serious consideration. I’m an Apple snob and have most of their products, and I’m sure I’d be happy with their watches too... but I LOVE my Fitbit Versa!!!
 So far so good ... The FitBit Versa does a solid job of tracking health related data and activity and presenting it in a unified App.  The Versa is smaller form factor, which for those with smaller wrists will be welcome.  The app store is good and I didn't find it necessary to purchase a watch face, plenty of good free ones and I selected one that took up less memory.  The traditional FitBit features for steps, floors, calories, etc ... are solid.  The heart rate works well and is accurate for me, as well as, more reliable, solid than my FitBit Blaze.  What could be better is the design FitBit used for attaching bands and the charging-dock ... Awkward is the only word I can use for both.  There  is an affordable third party charging "stand" on Amazon that solves this.  For accessory bands the Versa design challenges third party makers as it will you initially until you get used to changing bands.  The primary problem I find is third party accessory bands are not "flush" with the Versa's body and show a gap.  So for now I'm sticking with the FitBit bands.  This is "not a smart watch" is mentioned in many reviews and that is right .. Just as Samsung and Apple smart watches are really not solid  health watches.  For example my Samsung Gear 3 is pretty good on steps but has maddening gaps from time to time during hikes.  I've seen it on my kids Apple watches too.  Heart rate is not even close for accuracy and reliability on these watches either.  So it really comes down to what you want ... For me it's the health focus and the ease of collecting and presenting that key data.  If you bike then you want to read the online discussions about FitBits "bike" exercise function on it's platform ... I suspect you won't use this and problem will stick with apps that plug into the FitBit App like Strava or the other ones out there.  All in all the Versa is very good, solid addition with a 4 day battery that's been solid so far.
 I absolutely am loving my Fitbit Versa so far!!! It's beautiful and I bought a special Rose gold sparkle band that matches it perfectly! I get a lot of complements on it!!!!! Just wish they would add more music features! But I'm patiently waiting!!!!!!
 I've been a Fitbit user for years (starting out with Fitbit 1 which I attached to my shirt).  I had a Blaze which I liked, but thought the Versa would be better for sleep stage tracking &amp; waterproof/showerproof.  I purchased mine in July, 2018 and this week I had to have it replaced because it stopped working.  That was really disappointing, but it happens, I get it.  However, once I received the replacement "nugget", reattaching the watchband was IMPOSSIBLE.  No, not difficult.  Really impossible.  I was not prepared for how difficult it would be because switching watchbands on the blaze was a breeze.  And please Fitbit, don't tell me to go to the website and see your instructions.  I've watched youtube videos, read blogs, the Community discussions, etc.  The bottom line is, the watchband attachment is a terrible design.  Nothing nearly as easy as the Blaze.  Watchbands need to be replaced for lots of different reasons and the Versa design makes that job nearly impossible.  Fitbit needs to address this issue.
 So far so good. I like that I can put a picture on the face. I used a photo app to make a college of all my favorite photos and fitbit to my versa face.<br/>I like all the different apps you can add. I use the alarm app everyday. I also have the Starbucks app, the coach app and weather. I work in a hospital and we have a health program that if we meet goals we get paid for them. I wear this every day to count my steps. The other day I was in a room and the person was going home soon and was talking about the weather and hoped it wasn't to cold outside. I was able to look it right up for them and tell them the temp.  They loved it and thought it was SO cool 😂<br/>I haven't worn it in the bath or shower yet, to worried it will stop working, but it's gotten sprayed on by a hose...<br/>The bands are kinda hard to get on sadly, don't see myself changing it often.
 Absolutely LOVE this FitBit. My husband got it for me as a gift and it’s wonderful! I wanted to wait past the thirty day mark to give it a review, but it’s been amazing. Completely waterproof - I have swam laps with it, been in the shower, done dishes etc and haven’t had a single problem. I love the lap counter, I love that it doesn’t have as much functions as an Apple Watch (for me that would be too distracting), and I love the look! Very sleek and it goes with every outfit. It track your workouts from lifting to swimming AND it has an interval timer. You can personalize the watch face with the app and get new bands for it. It’s a great watch!
 I am new to the fitness tracking/fitness watch thing and I really love this watch! I have been trying to lose weight and thought that maybe a smartwatch would help motivate me/keep me accountable. I really think it has done the job! It is easy to use, the watch face is really clear and bright, and it is so easy to set up. I was using it within an hour of taking it out of the box and have not gone a day without it since! I got the gray/silver watch and it is really beautiful. The band is pretty matte gray looking which is perfect for my neutral wardrobe. I have not used the Pandora app yet, but I think it's a great feature that I plan on using soon. I think this is a great product at an amazing price!
 Let me start off by saying I am a die hard Apple user. I have had Apple products for the last 10 years, including several iWatch models. The Versa literally destroys the iWatch for what I want.<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>Battery life is a solid 3-4 days.<br/>Extremely light<br/>Clear display even in bright sunlight<br/>Selectable notification alerts<br/>Sleep tracking<br/>Varied watch face downloads<br/>Special edition has NFC<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>Limited apps for now<br/>No GPS, SIM card, or extra memory slot<br/>No camera
 I loved my Fitbit Blaze but it was time for an upgrade. I am very, very happy with the Versa. The band that it comes with is very comfortable and the size is just perfect. I don't even notice it on at all. I see a huge change in the screen clarity. Everything is very clear and easy to read. I do wish the battery life was more like my blaze (close to a week between charge) but it is fine. It is still better than "others" on the market.<br/>I would highly recommend a Versa for all ages. It is my favorite accessory and never comes off my arm!
 Love this Versa Fitbit.  It really delivers everything I need for tracking my calories consumed, calories burned, heart rate, exercise routines, and more.  I like that Fitbit has made a larger faced product that is also stylish for women.  My old Fitbit Surge was somewhat bulky, and the only color band was black.  You can purchase the Fitbit Versa in various color and textured bands.  I also like the selection of clock faces that can be installed on the Versa.  The only downside is that, other than the time display, the stats (heart rate, steps, etc.) are hard to read without my glasses, which I don't normally wear during exercise.  The sleep function is good in that it shows percentage of time spent in the different sleep stages.  However, if lying still but not asleep, it sometimes assumes you are sleeping.
 This is my 3rd Fitbit, I absolutely love the Versa.  I have been torn between replacing my Fitbit HR 2 with an Apple watch but have been so faithful to Fitbit, this one came out and is light and doesn't look ridiculous on my very small wrist.  I decided to get the Special Edition to take part in FitBit Pay, I love Apple Pay and am very excited to use FitBit Pay.  I love the Apps and can't wait to see what updates and new apps are to come.  The notifications are great, it notifies you of texts and incoming calls as well as some Apps loaded onto my phone. As with the last FitBit I am a huge fan of the metallic magnetic bands and ordered some with mine.  It is a little trickier to change bands at first, but once you figure it out, it is very simple.  I am thrilled that I stayed with FitBit.
 I’ve had my Fitbit Versa for two weeks now, and absolutely love it!  I was considering buying an Apple Watch, but this Smartwatch does everything I want in a smartwatch for a quarter of the price of an Apple Watch. It easily connects to the MyFitnessPal App. It wakes me in the morning with a gentle vibration. I can see text messages and phone calls when they come in. It tracks my workout time, heart rate, distance, etc., accurately. You can read it in the sunlight. There have been some reviews that say it doesn’t count stairs well. There was a tip on one of the community pages that if you raise your arm  a little when you reach the top of the stairs, it never misses, and I found this to be true. I don’t use the music app it comes with. It seems difficult to download songs, plus I have them on my iPhone, so don’t need. This is my third Fitbit. I still use the others, but this is the best one so far!
 I love my Versa. It's amazing and comparable to the Apple Watch. I've gotten many compliments on it and I love how it automatically tracks my activity and especially the new sleep monitoring.  My husband's, however, has a slight software glitch. Every now and then the screen will move back and forth as if it's being swiped to the left even without touching it.<br/><br/>He hasn't swam with it, or even worn it in the shower. I suppose it's possible he could have gotten sweat in there, but that shouldn't cause a problem since the watch is supposedly water proof up to 50 meters. Sweat shouldn't cause this.<br/><br/>We've tried cleaning off the screen and rebooting it a few times. Nothing seems to work. It's not enough to render the watch useless, it's just annoying when it happens. I think he just got a slightly glitched watch. Hey, it happens. But of course we're outside of our return date (go figure). I'd say it's enough to knock off a star.
 It’s not as big as I thought it would be. It looks just like an Apple Watch. So far, I haven’t had any problems with it. Loving it a lot!! Get calls, texts, and other notifications. I ordered the all black. It comes with a small wristband and a large. I also bought the protection plan for 3 years because you never know... delivery was 1 day shipping!! You can also download extra apps on the watch. Worth the money, it looks great, and it does the job! Great for fitness! I recommend, it’s for sure much better than other fit bits.
 UPDATE 11/6/18 - Screen started going insane. First noticed it during a workout and thought the battery just died. Realized later there was an issue. Screen started gradually going away and fading into little green lines. I had not done any damage to my knowledge and had barely used it near water. FitBit support asked a lot of questions and for screenshots at first, but they eventually sent me a replacement. This happened around September, maybe a month into using it. So far, so good on my end now in November.<br/><br/>I'm a lifelong Fitbit user (Charge, Alta, Charge 2) but I was considering upgrading to the Apple Watch since I have an iPhone. I ultimately chose the Versa because I didn't think I needed that much technology on my wrist. I've had the Versa for a week and know I made a great decision. I like how you can decide which app notifications go to the watch. I also like having all the same tech as the Charge 2. The display is pretty and a nice touch. I'll update if things change.
 UPDATE: Had to return my product because it wouldn't sync with the fitbit app after only a month of use. I am overall pleased with the return process, which is why I allowed for a 2 star rating.<br/><br/>So far so good! Easy set up for the most part. I was kinda disappointed that it doesn't really have a texting option other than quick replies. But I guess there is supposed to be an update sometime soon for it to have texting. But in the meantime, it's working well and I love it. Can't say it's the most accurate thing in the world. But hey, what technology is perfect? I'll update after the texting gets updated and see if it changes the performance at all.
 Over the past 5 years, I have used probably half a dozen different units and accumulated some pretty impressive stats.  That all came to a crashing halt at the end of June.  The unit stopped charging all of a sudden.  I was on vacation at the time, so I had to wait until I returned in order to send it to Fitbit for "repair".  It took them A MONTH to "process" this, only to send back the same unit and replacement charger.  Now, the unit won't even pair with my phone app.  Multiple emails back and forth with Fitbit have proven to be useless and they have given me the runaround.  Frustrated, I finally gave up and said I want a refund.  Now, they tell me since it has been 45 days since the purchase (May 26, 2018), I have to return it through the original point of purchase.  Fitbit has their own store on Amazon and Amazon only allows returns up to 30 days, so you tell me??  I have been without this unit longer than I have had it in my possession working.
 This is hands down a really good multi-sport activity tracker. However I am comparing it to the Garmin Vivoactive HR and I feel it is not as versatile as it could have been. Yeah, yeah, I know, different company, different style, et. al.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback, if I may say so, is that you cannot be sure if the piece  you get has NFC or not, at least not according the description on the Fitbit's own website; but that is not a deal breaker. All in all, it is a good watch, a little on the pricey side.<br/><br/>The watch was bought for my wife as a replacement for her Garmin Vivoactive HR. The setup while uncomplicated does take at least 30mins -- to be frank, other than setting up your ID, password, and profile, there's very little that you have to do and the setup is flawless. The Garmin Vivoactive HR was a trifle bit complicated to setup especially with the phone (Samsung S7 Edge).<br/><br/>It does come with a good set of clock faces, apps, weather, notifications, text and calls, alarms, etc. All in all, the Fitbit is a good watch and will not disappoint the first time activity tracker user.
 I've read some negative reviews about the Versa but I haven't experienced any of those issues. I've owned many of the Fitbit models, from the first waistband model to the Versa. I find that it, for me, it counts the steps accurately and has great battery life (I charged it last night after wearing it for five days-- it has 20% charge left when I charged it). I have uploaded music to it (THAT did eat up the battery), have worn it to water aerobics class and walk an average of five miles a day.  I never had it count "phantom steps" while driving, even on rougher roads-- although it did add steps while using my TENS unit, but I would expect that since my arm jerks with each pulse it generates.  The only thing I find that it does not track well is stairs. It works by change in air pressure, so it will add to the stair count if a strong breeze hits it or, in my case, in the pool-- I just discounted the 125 flights it counted that day ;)
 this fitbit is great. i previously owned a blaze but this is much more comfortable! the lavender woven band is beautiful but it’s actually made of a hard, stiff material that irritates my skin. the way you change out the bands is kind of irritating and ruined my manicure but whatever. i still love this watch! i like the weather, i use pandora and it automatically syncs my latest 3 pandora stations whenever i dock it. the watch faces ar customizable, meaning you can change the color of the numbers on most of them. the little pet clock face is super cute but it kills my battery so i stick with the basic ones. very easy to set up. oh also, you can customize the order of the workouts, so like for me spinning shows up first. spinning isn’t on the default exercise list, but you can add it and a few others that don’t show up, and get rid of the workouts you’ll probably never do. this is definitely an upgrade from the blaze :)
 I have had 2 of these watches go bad in less then one year
 I noticed that Yelp hasn't updated their Fitbit app since March of 2018. That pretty much sums it up.<br/><br/>I upgraded from a Fitbit Alta HR. The good: the device feels sturdy and good on the wrist, it is simple to set up and has fantastic battery life. It records exercise and swimming well and the Coach videos are handy. The interface is simple and works well.<br/><br/>The bad: overall it feels pretty underwhelming coming from an Alta HR. The app store doesn't have much to offer. It's good for step and fitness tracking but it is no apple watch killer. Also, I noticed the weather app was never updated unless I opened the Fitbit app on my iPhone and then tried to use the app on the watch. It's possible Apple doesn't want to make it easy for Fitbit to sync with iPhones, but if you have an iPhone it's very problematic.
 I wanted to wait a full 90 days before posting my review. I'd really like to give it a 2.5, but it wasn't an option. 1) the battery absolutely doesn't last 4 days. 2) the step counter is COMPLETELY false-- how do I get steps for typing at my desk? 3) a $200 watch should have the option to find your $600 phone 4) I should be about to respond to texts with more than emojis on a $200 watch 5) serious synching issues exist. My favorites are the background screen options, menstruation tracker &amp; ability to keep my phone on silent at work &amp; know when I've been contacted on my cell.
 The watch is great. Love it. Support for things as basic as 'how do I load music from my computer to the watch' is non-existent so far. I followed the directions for other smart phones and am still working on it. That seems like basic information to get online on their own site quickly. That said- i love the watch and would reccomend it.
 Love this Versa special edition!!  It’s like owning an Apple Watch but in an exercise tracker. I think the extra 30 dollars for the special edition is well worth the money if you plan to use your tracker to pay for items at the store. Pretty easy to use. I have a problem finding all of the different types of workouts it offers. I jog in place a lot at home and it does have an option for jogging in place but I cannot find it again. Anybody?  Very well made product with so many accessories to jazz up the watch. There is way too much to get into so all in all a fabulous buy!!
 I bought this for my wife and she asked me to set it up for her.  There was a glitch installing the fitbit app on her iphone 6.  The install button did not display on the screen.  I called fitbit tech support and had trouble understanding the representative.  She asked for a call back phone number in case we got disconnected and then we got disconnected and she didn't call back.  Then I tried to call back and got a recorded message that they were closed and would be closed for 3 days because of the New Years holiday.  I thought they would call back on the day they reopened bit did not.  My son was able to get the app installed on my wife's iphone, so I didn't need to deal with a rep that I couldn't communicate with.  My wife said the watch is not very intuitive, but once she figured out she likes it.
 I upgraded from a FitBit HR2, and I love this Fitbit.  It takes a bit of playing with it to get all you want from it.  That is common with anything new that has this many features.  My daughter got one just before I did, and we are learning together.  I do like the way if feels on my arm as it not heavy at all.  The ability to change colors and faces is fun.  The clock face has so much information on it and is easy to set.  I haven't put any music on it, and I am not sure I will, but I like having the option.  The work-out aids are nice also.  It is easy to charge too.  I really love this FitBit and glad I got the upgraded one.
 I have a Fitbit Ionic as well, but wanted one that is a little more dressy. Since I don't use the integrated GPS super often this is perfect, it is much slimmer, works exactly the same as the Ionic in terms of the OS and the woven band is super comfortable and relatively quick drying so i don't even take it off in the shower.  The battery life is great (4-5 days, 3.5 if I work out and use my bluetooth headset every day for two hours), and I can still use my watch to pay since I ordered the special edition. I never really wanted an apple watch since I don't care about talking into my watch, and I want something that goes for a few days between charges. Since they ironed out the pesky Pandora updates and continue to improve the OS I can say that if you don't have a craving to take calls with your watch, want good battery life and an very easy to use phone app, this is a pretty great smart watch.
 I purchased this device in June 2018, by November the heart rate monitor has stopped working. After hours and days of trouble shooting with customer support, because I am out of the country, I cannot be covered by warranty. Granted this device was purchased in the United States. Never again, waste of money for this device. I tried this after having an Apple Watch because I liked the look and wanted to try something new. It's best to stick with the evil you know. At least i know Apple care would cover a faulty device.
 I LOVE my new Fitbit Versa watch!! I am so glad I spent the money and bought this one as opposed to others I was looking at! I love that it keeps track of my stairs I climb, steps, calories burned, and heart rate. I also love that I can input my foods daily in to see how I am doing as far as calories in and calories burned! I also love that I can have tunes on it as well! Makes my walks so much better!!
 The Versa is overall a good smartwatch. It's probably not as good overall as the Apple Watch, but it's not bad. The watch is pretty easy to use and syncs with my iphone 7. It doesn't sync well however with the PC app. It's pretty accurate for tracking walking/running. I also tried it swimming and it was pretty accurate with counting laps. The only issue with that is that it didn't keep my swimming recorded with my whole daily activity. It's somewhat limited on apps- Apple has more. It does offer more watch faces than Apple however. It's definitely cheaper- and if you're using it mainly as a watch &amp; a recorder for walking &amp; running, it's a better value than Apple. The Special Edition is nice as it comes with two sets of different bands (cloth &amp; black rubber) &amp; has both main sizes of bands. I'm happy with it overall, but I may switch to Apple.
 This is my first smart watch. I had a Charge 2 and replaced it with Versa. I like the watch (and look forward to the Sleep Score being released) but the key annoyance is it constantly disconnects from the Bluetooth, even when it is right next to my phone. So, I often don't get texts or phone calls on the watch, and sometimes it is a pain to sync. Hopefully, this will be addressed with software updates. If not, despite the positive features, I would wait until this problem is resolved before purchasing. I would have returned it except I got it at a very good sale price, so I will put up with the annoyance.<br/><br/>For another example, when I go to sync each morning to check on sleep stats, it often takes multiple tries and I often have to reboot the watch.
 I bought my versa a few months ago and started running into issues with it not logging my exercise.  It starts, but sometime during the exercise the exercise logging just goes away...  For example I did a 60 minute treadmill workout yesterday and it captured the 1st 10 minutes then then stopped logging.  After trying all sorts of fixes from the Fitbit support folks they swapped mine out for a new one (well they said it was going to be new but it was factory refurbished).  I've been using the new one for a few weeks and it was working okay, then all of a sudden I started running into the same issues.  They tell me it is not a known issue/bug, but I find it really surprising that I'd run into this issues with 2 different Versa watches if it were a fluke.  I think they have quality issues and a I incredibly disappointed with my experience.  I'm using an Android phone - Galaxy S9+.
 I love this Fitbit so much. Part of the appeal is that it looks like an apple watch  but sleeker! This is exactly what I wanted. Looks great in all types of settings. I dont mind that it doesnt have a GPS because I'd still need my phone while on a run anyway. Always have to have it on me. I love it so much.
 That’s really not a bad thing. It has all the features of an iWatch that I find important with WAY(an understatement) better battery life at only a fraction of the cost. Most people that I talk to who have iWatches tell me they charge it every night. I go on average 5 days between charges. It usually only takes about an hour to fully charge. When I do charge it, I do it while I’m relatively inactive (ie, like showering, watching a show, cooking, doing laundry). This allows me to always record my heart rate while sleeping giving me the most accurate RHR. Occasionally I have sync issues but it’s never taken me longer than a couple minutes to resolve. Usually I just restart my phone(iphone 8) or the watch itself. But I seem to experience things like this with everything electronic(my chromecast, my sena Bluetooth on my motorcycle helmet, aircraft avionics systems, etc) so I don’t really consider that a big deal. It’s just part of life with electronics, and if you have half a brain, you’ll resolve it. The watch stores quite a bit of info before it needs to sync. Sometimes I go a day or two before checking it and I’ve never ran out. As far as steps recording, it’s pretty darn accurate. Runners should appreciate it. Kinda hard to fool, but it sometimes happens. For cycling it works great too, keeps track of max speed, avg speed, max heart rate, avg heart rate, maps etc. A recent update, I noticed, prevents steps from being logged while in cycling mode.  My one minor gripe is that it does not connect to anything ANT+. It only connects to your phone. So no syncing data with your cycling computer. Maybe they’ll make an app for that(or already have one and I don’t know about it). It’s waterproof. Oh and the NFIC works great, I use it all the time. There’s also lots of after market goodies like bands, covers, and tempered glass screen protectors. I paid I think $200 or maybe $225 and I think it was worth every penny. Last thing, I’ve owned it for about 8 months as of writing this. I always intend to write long term reviews, but I often forgot. Glad I didn’t for this watch as I feel it’s a great product. Hope this helps some people make a decision.<br/><br/>P.s. It tells time.
 ok I had a blaze for almost 3 years before it died. I wanted to replace it with another fitbit. This is my third fitbit and by far my favorite. I love that you can add different apps to it. and change the clock faces. It is very interactive and user friendly.<br/><br/>The ONE complaint I have is that the heart rate monitor on this one wont read through my tattoo. After researching it sounds like that's a problem with this model. My Blaze heart rate monitor worked just fine not sure what was changed but it is kind of a bummer.
 I WISHED I NEVER BOUGHT A VERSA.<br/><br/>I used the Versa for almost 2 months. I wore it swimming (manufacture says it is waterproof) It DIED. I contacted Fitbit. I as per direction email them a VIDEO with a case number in the background of it not working even when I pushed the buttons as I was directed. Waited 1 day for their reply. Shipped it off as per directions. It will be a month soon since I had a working Versa.<br/><br/>The customer service people don’t help and take a really long time to respond.
 I bought this fit bit because it was advertised as accurate heart rate monitoring.  I need my heart rate monitored constantly because of a medical condition.  I am only speaking about the heart rate function....they rest of this watches perks were not important to me.....<br/>I checked this heart rate monitor against the following; A pulse oximeter, 2 blood pressure cuffs, and manually checking my heart rate the old fashion way with a watch that has a second hand. I must say that both  bp cuffs and my pulse ox were checked at my cardiologist office for accuracy.  This product was not ever close to my actual heart rate.<br/>If you are buying this product for heart rate monitoring, I would say, look elsewhere.
 It did arrive in a timely manner. (Thus the 2 Stars)  It was fairly easy and quick to set up.  Did have a problem with it finding the WiFi even when I was next to the receiver (as suggested if this is a problem) It never did sync on the last reset.  It took 3 times of resetting to factory defaults to get it to recognize and notify of texts and calls.  Worst of all, the step counter was WAY off.  The first day I wore it, it displayed 654 steps right after I got up.  Figured it just need to break in.  The next day, it started out with 120 steps out of bed and when went for a 15 minute walk, it showed 3500 steps, which was way off.  I was just in a Mall, with stops along the way.<br/><br/>I got this because it was a FitBit, which does have a good reputation.  My son has the Charge 2 and never had any problems.  I purchased this for the Smart Watch features as well as health tracking.  The Pulse function was correct but the BP was way off (checked it against regular test with equipment).  These are unnecessarily important, but I feel I could not trust any of the settings.  (I also made a mistake in purchasing an additional watch face via on-line and chalk it up to a lost purchase.)  I figured it would be okay, since I wanted the watch to work.  Sigh.  It did not.  If you only want a watch that looks nice, then get it.  If you want it for any Smart or tracking functions, buy something else.<br/><br/>I returned it for a refund and am trying another brand that got 75% 5-Star rating and 9% 1-Star.  I should have believed more of the negative reviews for this Versa.  I know others that have purchased the Ionic and are happy with that more expense model.  Didn't want to spend the extra (could have gotten an Apple 3 for the same price) and the size was larger.  I have a small wrist and the Versa looked better.  If you still want to buy this, then good luck.<br/><br/>Was very disappointed.  Fitbit, you need to work on this model for functions that WORK.
 Updating after my initial four star review.  I've had to of these Versas now, and both have lost their battery life after six months of use.  Fitbit was great about replacing the first one, and would probably replace this second one, but I'm done.  I feel Fitbit purposefully deploys products that will be dysfunctional after a year in hopes of getting you to buy a new device every year.  This product is so bad that it is driving me away from using Fitbit after 6 years of loyalty. I have over 15 million steps logged in on fitbit's but I'm going to go use a Withings now.
 Love it! Couple of things to note: the special edition comes with two sets of bands (One set woven, one set the athletic black bands).. Each set of bands comes with 3 pieces To make small or large fit. If you have another Fitbit you must first remove it from your app or the Versa may not update.<br/><br/>Took 1 star off because the heartrate monitor doesn’t work well for me. For the past two days my resting HR was read as 88 -100 when I was actually 74-77 but the HR monitors on any smart watches aren't perfect yet.
 Likes: The watch fits well. You can add multible apps and themes to it. The fitbit app for your phone is easy to work with once you get used to it. It has a super strong battery that lasts.<br/><br/>Dislikes: it takes time to get used to. Once you have a cover on the watch it won't fit into the docking station so you keep having to take the cover off. It comes preinstalled with some apps that not everyone will use or like.<br/><br/>Still, I like it a lot. So thanks!
 This is my first smartwatch and fitness tracker, so I have nothing to compare it to, but so far so good. I'm hoping Fitbit increases the number of apps available (specifically music apps) but it syncs great with Runkeeper and I like the ability to customize display and features.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa. I have had multiple Fitbits throughout the years. I love this product! I wear it every day and every night. It’s worth the money. Be sure to purchase screen protectors just to be extra safe. This product will change your life. Make you more active and aware of your every day activities. It even links through my Fitbit account to my Fitbit Scale! So I can track my weigh-loss progress as wells. You also can compete with friends through step competions, which I love &amp; am involved in daily.
 I had bought the Charge 2 for my mother who fears technology but loves watching the watch come on with a wrist turn. She has poor eyesight and so the size of the Charge 2 always bothered me. It's like they read my mind and the Versa has beautiful graphics and my mother (Who opened it early "by mistake") absolutely loves the new screen. The one disappointment is I was immediately prompted to buy $10 of really cool screen shots. Mom saw a Christmas one she had to have but it's not all that intricate and a few decent screen shots should come included for the price. Instead you get a few lousy ones and then are shown some that are not too bad and then it's $10 to proceed. I had barley finished unboxing. There may be free stuff out there. Mom was excited to wear her watch and the watch makes buying this upgrade a little too easy.
 Waste a money. I got mine in April and already at my 5th replacement. First time it broke down  when I was swimming (suppose to be water proof) then it took Fitbit over a month to send me a replacement. Now it’s giving me 180 heart rate when I’m sitting down, I’m apparently burning ~8000-10,000 calories for the past week now, and the latest it’s counting calories when I am not moving or when it’s on charge. I apparently walk 185,000 steps last night in my sleep.  3rd time, it just shut itself off and never turn back on. The 4th one has charging issue.<br/>This product is so bad, they didn’t even want me to ship back the 2nd and 3rd replacement to them. Don’t waste your money and time. There are better option out there  to track your fitness than this versa
 My wife had a Fitbit Charge HR that she loved but when it finally died I got her an Apple watch because she's an Apple person. She used it for a couple of weeks and found that the teeny-tiny icons were very difficult to see and use, and many of the apps weren't very useful to her. We returned that and got her this Fitbit Versa which she absolutely loves. It does everything she needs, is easy to see and navigate, holds a charge longer and was less expensive than the Apple watch. And she loves how it looks on her too! Would definitely recommend.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa. I was going between an AppleWatch and a Fitbit Versa. I feel I chose the right fit for me. Other than the fitness aspect, I love the sleep reports it offers, text and call notifications, that it connects to myfitness pal and the fact that it's water resistant up to 50 meters is a huge benefit to me. The design is sleek and attractive. I honestly love 99.9% of everything about it. My only wish is that it could connect to my Spotify as I don't like Pandora. Other than that I love it so far!
 It may be that I'm technically challenged. I decided on the Versa as it has a bigger face and I was hoping that I could read it better. But I find the stats are still to small. When I first set it up I was able to sync it with my phone and check the stats at any time. But I was receiving notices that it was using up the battery on my phone. I don't know if I did something to change that, but I stopped receiving notices and suddenly I realized that it was not constantly synced with my phone. I would have to put the watch on it's charger for it to sync and it would only sync to that moment. It would not count each step. I couldn't get the weather as it wasn't synced. I called Versa and spoke with Brenda for 1 hour 45 min. and by the time she was done attempting to help me my watch was totally deactivated and would not work at all. Versa kindly sent me another watch that I attached to my existing bands and charger and attempted to set up. I was not able to fully set it up &amp; continually sync with my phone. It's possible it's my phone, but I'm not happy with the $200 watch at all and plan to send it back as this is not appropriate for me at all.
 I am so in love with this fitbit, I had originally purchased the Charge 3 as I liked the features and didnt want something super bulky but after seeing the Versa in person it actually has a lower profile than the Charge 3, just not as narrow obviously.  I am so glad I bought the Versa, I love having the extra features and the color screen.  It has looks and function.  So far no issues at all yet but its only been a few weeks.  It seems fairly accurate, more so than the Charge 3 I had too.  I did end up swapping out the band but no complaints on that, it was easy to get on and off and I like the pin system.  Overall I love this fitbit and would definitely recommend.
 I had a Fitbit Blaze and was looking at the apple smart watches but I couldn’t even see the screen as everything was so small and crammed in. I realized that it wasn’t for me. I saw this smart watch and fell in love with it. It has everything that I am looking for and easy to use.<br/>I love the look and I don’t need my readers to look at everything.<br/>Extremely easy to set up. I’ve only owned for a two days so I can’t talk about the battery life yet.
 Loved this fit bit until today. I used to have the old fit bits that weren’t water proof, so I’ve become accustomed to taking the fit bit off for showers, baths, beach. But today I used it for swimming. (WHICH THERE IS EVEN A FEATURE FOR) after 25 mins of swimming in a pool that didn’t even go deeper than 5 feet, the fit bit versa died. Dead as can be and no resurrecting. What a disgrace to the company. I’ve never been so frustrated with a purchase that can live up to its label.
 I love this watch! Very comfortable, light weight, and fashionable! I am a tad disappointed in the strap b/c after 4 days it already started to fray at the end. See photos! I'm not deducting a star for that because the bands are so cheap and replaceable, who cares. and with this edition they give you two bands, in each size, it's hard to complain. I have had the blaze and charge in the past, and love fitbit. Of course this is my favorite, mostly because it is the least ugly one I've had! I feel like I can wear this to events (where I used to always remove them b/c they looked tacky). I also enjoy the wider variety of exercises applied to this device &amp; it's software (yoga, pilates, hiking, etc). A lot more specific and accurate! I love the screen, rose gold color, and software a ton on this model. Very pleased!
 Loved it at first but it died after 2 months they sent me one without a wristband, I spent hours trying to get the band on and it would not work. The support people in Mexico very unhelpful. Refused to send me one with the band on. Also the directions for starting the new one said I needed to de-activate the old one, which was impossible sine the old one was dead, I want my money back and the insurance money
 This Fitbit was exactly what I was looking for. A watch that would measure my steps, heart rate, exercise, and notify me of phone calls, emails, and messages.  Unfortunately, it stayed disconnected from my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone more than it was connected.  I tried many times to find the fix on the fitbit troubleshoot website.  It would fix it for a day and sometimes only a few minutes.  I really wish this worked like Fitbit advertises.
 If the Fitbit Versa worked completely I would probably love it.  However, I should be able to switch the screen for more functions by swiping my finger across it and that is not working.  I am now past the point that I can return it and for $199.00 I think this is a complete ripoff.  It wasn't until my daughter pointed out how all the functions worked that I knew mine was defective. I purchased a Charge 2 originally and loved it, thought this one would give me more of what I wanted, guess I was wrong.
 Love the Fitbit Versa.  I love everything about it.  Its light and very easy to check what you need to know.  I'm very pleased.
 I was hesitant in buying this, as I had the older fitbit band and I had several issues with it charging correctly. This charges perfectly. I wear it every single day. I love that I can get my phone alerts since I work in a facility that has a zero tolerance phone policy. I am very happy with this purchase. Have been using this watch for some time now.
 Love my new watch and wear it all the time.  Lightweight so I can keep it on longer.  It vibrates when a message or call comes to my IPhone so I can decide if I need to answer.  I never have been motivated by counting steps for exercise but I like that it makes me aware.  I really don’t like keeping a watch on during the night but this is so lightweight don’t notice it.  The sleep monitoring works great.  I know there are more functions I haven’t used yet.  People think it’s the more expensive Apple Watch and I love telling them I paid much less!
 The first one of these I received was defective.  Would not update with the initial update, so was useless.  But Amazon has a great return policy, so exchanged it, hoping the second one would work... and it did.<br/>So far, its worked great, records steps, heart rate, and workouts correctly.  Added a new, more feminine bad for my wife, and she loves it.<br/>Be sure to order it from a retailer that is willing to replace it easily if you get a defective one.  I guess it is a problem with these watches.
 Great fitness tracker for the price...and it alerts me for incoming phone calls and text messages. The battery life is great, too. I would recommend this smartwatch to anyone. Did I say easy to set up? Yes it was super easy!
 This thing is amazing.  It's the 3d fitbit I've owned and by far the best.  It tracks in great detail a variety of exercise functions, the "250 steps per hour" program is so much more user friendly than earlier FBs and the sleep function seems more reliable than prior experience.  So far,  after nearly a month, I've notice my daily "step count" exceeds 10000 quite routinely, such is the increased motivation caused by the capabilities of the Versa (and I've not even thought about accessing its music function)
 I got the Versa as a Christmas present and supposed "upgrade" from my Blaze...and I returned the Versa after 3 weeks. I loved my Blaze. After 2 years, it still did everything as described as both a fitness tracker (perfectly synced to my iPhone for the Fitbit and MyFitnessPal apps) and a smartwatch (received notifications without error). Because of my experience with the Blaze, I was excited to get the Versa.<br/>As a fitness tracker, it did fine. As a smartwatch and for syncing for anything other than steps, cals, and distance, it was garbage!<br/>Trying to sync was a nightmare out of the box. I had to restart the watch (and phone) twice before the Versa finally synced. For the first week, I felt like I was shutting down and restarting both the watch and my iPhone and toggling my phone's Bluetooth daily. I went through all the troubleshooting steps on Fitbit's website but they didn't fix the issue. I have since read a lot of comments on both Fitbit and Apple forums of the syncing issues with the Versa.<br/>Not sure if Android phones have similar issues but I definitely expected better from the Versa for the cost and it being marketed as an Apple Watch competitor. Definitely do your research before dropping this amount of money on the Versa...
 Bought the Forgot Versa. Spent 5 days updating its operating system. FINALLY a working Fitbit. 2 weeks late Versa failing to sync. Followed all the tech advice - no luck. Return Versa through Amazon. Figured the Ionic would be better - NOPE!. Cant even get its operating system updated. Stay away from these new fitbit models. They can not stay sync to the devices and constantly require updates back to factory setting and then re update to your phone with same lengthy operating system install.
 I have been looking for a smart watch with fitness tracking information when this was released. I am an avid Andriod user and wanted something that would work well with all of my current devices. I have previously owned versions of the FitBit but hated how work out they always looked.<br/><br/>Positives : Design. I love the look, and you can't immediately tell it is a fit bit! That is great! The bands change easily, push notifications make things simple and I love that I have one more way to pay for my coffee (starbucks app included)<br/><br/>Cons: Doesn't support spotify, only PAID pandora accounts. All other data has to be owned and coveted to compatible format to put on device, and then you need wireless headphones. The music feature is NOT the reason to buy this watch. The sync process with my phone is not seamless and I have had to mess with it way to often. Push notifications are not reliable because they might be late.<br/><br/>Overall for the price I like what it does,  The fitness aspect of the fitbit is in place with a little bit more of a classy look!
 Bought this Fitbit about 10 months ago and have had problems with it since I purchased it.  The Fitbit itself works, but it will not hold a charge.  I don't even get a 24 hour charge for it, at best 18 hours.  I purchased a new charger, have cleaned the connections and called for help from the company.  Every time I call, they tell me that I need to download updates and it will take care of the problems - I think that they just want to get me off the phone because they know that there is nothing that is going to address the problem - this is just a bad Fitbit and they don't want to admit it or replace it.  i bought it because you are supposed to get up to 4 days of charged power, which was the appeal.  Either don't buy this Fitbit or don't buy from this seller.  This Fitbit is a looser and nothing that I do is going to correct it, because I have tried and am sick of describing the problem and dealing with the Fitbit company.  Beware!!
 I love this watch.  Only one problem, I have a rash that I can’t get rid of that is right under where the green lights are.  I never wear my Fitbit in the pool or shower and I regularly clean the underside with alcohol.  I emailed Fitbit and they said it is incredibly unlikely that I am allergic to the light, but offered no other suggestions as to why this is happening.
 I'm generally happy with the Versa - I was looking for a waterproof tracker that I could wear in the pool and it fits the bill.  It's big and bulky on a small wrist but no worse that the Apple Watch.  I do have frequent issues getting the tracker to sync properly without having to reboot the tracker and my phone, sometimes more than once.
 So disappointed.  This would not connect to wifi, even when I had it sitting right next to the router.  I verified that my wifi matches the network requirements (and I use the exact same wifi and app to connect two other fitbit devices with no issues).  It was showing no wifi signal, even when the phone I'm using the app from shows a full signal from the same router.  Spent 6 hours setting up via bluetooth instead, but it froze up on one of the setup screens.  I tried to power off the device to restart it, but no matter how long I held the two buttons, the screen would eventually go dark but it would return right back to the same screen.  Wouldn't have been able to put music on it without a wifi connection.
 What can I say. LOVE MY WATCH. Its beautiful and easy to use.I use it for working out and for work. Love how you can change the face of the watch. I truly recommend this!. Extremely comfortable. Pulse is consistent to when i take it. Wish it also did blood pressure but hopefully they can add that in a update sometime.
 I have zero complaints about this Fitbit. By far the best one yet! The screen is awesome. All the features on the device itself are awesome. The fit is awesome (I have very small wrists and was worried it would look too big). My complaint is that I ordered the pink Fitbit with the purple woven band and Amazon sent me the gray Fitbit with the gray woven band. I checked my orders to be sure it wasn’t my fault and it was not. I, however, did not want to wait any longer to own this so I kept the gray one. I like it just fine, but was disappointed in Amazon. With as much as I shop on here, there are very few mistakes, so I still gave 5 stars.
 I purchased this watch because it holds music.  I wanted something I could use for workouts and for guided imagery to help with my migraines, as well as all the other tracking abilities of other fitbit devices.  Only thing I do not like is the rubberized watchband.  I was able to get a cloth band here on Amazon that looks and works just as well as the one sold on the Fitbit site for a much better price.  I have also purchased wireless earphones as well  protective glass coverings to help save the screen from damage here on Amazon.  So far all working great and  I love my Fitbit.
 Previous Charge 2 user for years and upgraded to Versa. Lots of potential but Fitbit needs to work on quality control and sending software updates to address issues.<br/><br/>I have bought and returned 2.<br/><br/>First one:<br/>Did not have an accurate heart rate monitor during workouts. It was consistently off by 50-80 bpm compared to Apple Watch. Additionally, the screen flickered in dim lighting.<br/><br/>Second one:<br/>Still not accurate heart rate monitor. Consistently off by 50-80bpm when measured and compared to Apple Watch. Also, the charger has pieces loose inside similar to rattling loose screws.<br/><br/>Pretty disappointing. Hopefully Fitbit will address quality control and inform consumers about plans to address software issues.
 Pretty decent little tracker with a few hang ups. I do wish the battery life was a little longer, typically only lasts 2-3 days at most. However, I use mine a lot for workouts. Not great for tracking flights of stairs. I can walk up 10 flights but it may only register 2, so that feature could use some improvement. Would also love to be able to respond with quick reply messages, android users are apparently able to do this, so hopefully it will be available to iPhone users soon.
 I love the features of this smart watch/fitness tracker. Some people complain about the size of the charger and that it doesn't sit flat, but I don't notice these issues. I know the bands are a bit "fiddly" to attach, but once your figure out the process, it's not bad (less "fiddly" than a lot of regular watches I have had in the past). I am just happy that the band is solidly attached. I used the payment method the other day for the first time and it worked! This has so many more features than my previous Fitbit Charge. I am glad I upgraded.
 Pros: cost, battery life, comfort<br/><br/>Cons: it would be nice if the device light up when a notification came through.  It would also be nice to clear a notification on the watch and not have to also clear it on the phone.  Also, if your phone is on do not disturb no notifications will come to your watch.<br/><br/>Overall, good for the price.
 I bought it Sept 11, 2018. I was very careful charging the Versa since the instructions stated you must not use a charger cord over 5 volts.  The last time I charged it, two days ago, it did not hold any charge and it was very very hot. It never turned on again. Im not sure what I can do. Amazon won't refund me and stated I must contact the manufacturer. Stopped working Nov 5. I think I preferred the misfit brand step tracker because it had a battery. You never had to recharge it, just change the battery 1-2 times a year.
 The new Fitbit Versa does exactly what I need it to. I deal with anxiety issues and actually bought this to help monitor my heart rate when I feel anxiety coming on in order to remind myself that no, I am in fact not dying of a heart attack. This helps me tremendously. The workout features are fantastic and the step count is accurate enough for 99% of people who aren't die-hard triathletes. I took off a combined one star because there is no built-in GP and the apps are so-so but the catalog seems to be expanding. I'm hoping to see this continue in order for Fitbit to even have a fraction of what Apple does on their watch. Overall, I'm happy with the Fitbit Versa, but do constantly question if I would be happier with an Apple Watch.
 I really like my Fitbit Versa, in that it motivates me, big time.  Really disappointed in the design of the band system<br/><br/>Updating 11/3/2018 - Versa is dead, won't really charge.  I've spent probably 20 or 30 hours the past month troubleshooting, and trying all sorts of suggestions.  I've switched actual charging units, done a factory reset multiple times.  Turns out this is not a unique problem with the Versa.  Even though it thinks it's charged when it starts up, it isn't.  It is still under warranty, however from what I understand it's likely the replacement they will send will do the same behaviour after a few weeks.  Stay tuned.
 Easy to use. Looks good on. Love everything about it except how it lights up when I lift my arm while sleeping. Maybe there’s a way to turn that feature off? It’s bright!
 Upgraded from the Fitbit Flex 2 because I wanted to start wearing a watch and needed something with the built in activity tracker, HR monitor and watch. Definitely getting what I paid for. Had zero issues out of the box. I read the instructions and made sure I unattached my flex 2 from my phone before doing anything and boom...Versa connected, updated and worked like a charm. been using for 8 days now and it does everything it says it does. If you're looking to get a smart watch and don't want to break the bank on something from Apple then go with the Versa which has almost all the same functions.
 My review won't mean much because I have had it very long. Like 2 weeks at this time. I had a gear s3 for a year and out of the blue ordered one of these. I liked it so much I ordered another 3 days latter for one of my neices. I charge it every Sunday. No bull I get 7 days out of it. I charge it in my car, takes about an hour. The only thing the gear S3 had as in advanage was the speaker/mic for calls. I would only get 3 days out of it and didn't have 24h heart rate. The Fitbit is also really light. I check it a few times a day to make sure it's still on.
 I purchased this to track my bike rides. It doesn't do that accurately. Steps seem okay. Call and email notifications work. It just won't do what I purchased it to do. I posted on the message board at Fit Bit Versa. No help. I've contacted tech support via FaceBook messenger and had a long dialogue with them. I've reset the phone and reset the app. I've read how a GPS works (as they asked me to do).  It's missing an average of two miles each ride I take. This just won't do it.<br/>I like the clock faces. I like the fit and feel. I just won't accept the inaccuracy.<br/>If it won't track a bike ride accurately, they need to remove that feature from the watch.
 Why pay for an Apple Watch when you could have a Fitbit Versa?  This watch does everything that the Apple does, including connecting to other smart audio devices including the one in my car. I don’t need to take my phone to the gym because it connects to my Bose headphones perfectly. Transferring music was easy and I wear it every day  except when I go to sleep. I highly recommend this watch to anyone who wants to keep track of their fitness stats.  One of the very best features of this watch is the battery life.  I could could go for three days without a charge.
 I love my Versa watch! I just upgraded from my Blaze. I bought the Special Edition for the band, but ended up not liking the band at all. It's rough and the fit isn't what I was looking for. The color is beautiful though!!! I changed out the band for the magnetic ones and now it's perfect. Versa is def an upgrade from the Blaze. Runs well, no issues. Love all the extra features!
 Many compliments on this watch and I love the functionality of it!! Not as bulky looking on my wrist as previous fitbit models. Looking forward to see what other apps come out for use on the device...it's a little sparse at the moment.<br/>Updated 7/14/18<br/>Love everything about this version of the Fitbit, except that the battery is needing charged every day now. Don't know why. The latest firmware is installed. I think Fitbit is working on a resolution but it hasn't worked for me. I also have an issue with seeing the actual text messages I recieve. It shows that I have a message but not the actual content of the message. Edited my rating to four stars.
 Let me start with saying I am a longtime smart watch owner.  Starting with the original Moto X 1st Gen (I owned two wearing out the first), a misfit Vapor,  a generic Chinese one, a Withings Activite Steel and a Nokia Steel HR, so I'm pretty confident in my ability to understand what they can offer.<br/> So  far I'm disappointed. This watch has made claims that don't live up. Fitbit pay doesn't support the AmEx card I have. The battery life only lasts 2 days (half of what they claim) and I have nearly everything disabled or set to manual and if I have music streaming, it only lasts a day. This is nearly the same life as my original Moto X, the predecessor of Android smartwatches. I expected much more from the Fitbit that boasts battery on all their watches.
 I've owned many Fitbits, and this one is the best yet.  It's the right size,  not too heavy and the heart rate monitor is fairly accurate. It gives me the notifications I like,  although I wish it would allow me to start &amp; stop my music or audio book,  but that is minor.<br/><br/>The band that comes with the watch is very comfortable and easy to take on and off. My husband also bought me a fancy band to change into for going to church or on a date.  It's easy to change (once you figure it out).<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this watch/Fitbit if you are looking for something new.
 I hesitated buying this item as some of the reviews said certain apps didn't work and true my notifications did not work. However...after a short live chat to a Fitbit rep we got everything up and running. I couldn't be more pleased. It's a nice watch and haven't taken it off except to charge batteries which is a breeze with the enclosed charger. It looks good on my small wrist with the small band. I got the gray canvas which is nice. I changed the clock face to one I liked more. It's pretty easy to operate for this old lady! Glad I followed my heart and bought this watch.
 I love the color and looks of this watch, but the apps still have a lot of bugs and it was difficult to download my music. The apps will work one day and not the next. I do love the ease of use, the different watch faces and being able to read my texts, monitor my heart rate and listen to music while working out.
 There are only two complaints I have.  I've owned mine for about 6 weeks.  I'm glad I ordered a cloth band with it because the vinyl band that it comes with was too small for my wrist.  I am large boned, and the overlap is less than an inch.  Not enough to slide up and out of the way when working on computers.  Secondly, I have not yet been able to disable the female app after setting it up and deciding not to use it.  I've been in contact with the company who gave me directions, but the info still shows on my band.  Usually I just ignore it, but it is annoying that something so personal is on my band.  App yes.  Band, no.
 So I've been using this since April. First couple of months I had no issues. Recently thou I've gotten a rash right under where the watch sits on my arm, not the band, whenever I wear the watch. I've tried switching out the originally sent band with other types(a leather band and a metal band), daily cleaning of the watch back with the same cleaner I use on my CPAP mask, and loosening the band so it sits differently on the wrist but still the rash reappears after a couple of days of wearing. It takes about a week to completely heal. What's the point of a fitness and sleep track watch if you can't wear it? I upgraded from a fitbit blaze that I had been wearing for over a year without a rash appearing. Disappointed.
 I spent an hour trying to put on the wristband. But after watching youtube videos, reading support articles, and contacting tech support (they said just keep on trying!); I gave up. To make matters worse, the other wristband fell OFF while I was trying to put the second one on.<br/><br/>A product should not be this difficult to assemble. Avoid.
 I love my fancy smartwatch, but I wanted something I could wear on the weekends and on vacations where I needed something more durable - this is JUST RIGHT! This watch is so lightweight, works well with the app, and I love looking at my sleep patterns. I like being able to check my text messages on the watch since I don't always have my phone nearby, and I can see who is calling. Overall, a great smartwatch with healthy features.
 This is the most frustrating piece of crap I've ever spent $200 on. Will not stay connected or pair to your phone so sometimes you might get a notification  but most of the time you won't. The instructions for it are confusing and the main reasons I bought it I can't use it for because of the pairing issue, so basically I spent $200 on a digital  time-telling device but of course in order to tell the time you have to look like an idiot shaking your wrist around to get the face to turn on. Oh and it would be awesome if I actually walked as much as it says i do.
 I’m a long time Fitbit user.  I waited for the Versa, because I wanted a waterproof watch.  I have very small wrists.  The Versa is thinner than its predecessors.  It’s still big, but it looks better on my wrist.  I’m happy with it.
 I had an HR for a long time, and it was great, no problems.  Thought I'd upgrade and considered the Versa and the Apple, but went with the Versa since I wanted to keep the data intact.  The first one wouldn't hold a charge longer than a day, the second one wouldn't track heart rate, the third one had something else wrong, at that point I gave up.<br/><br/>I'll give credit to the Fitbit team, other than asking that you go through the normal "diagnostic" steps each time, they were good about accepting the facts and shipping me a new Versa.  My guess was that the Versa just didn't have the bugs worked out.  I stepped back to a Charge 2, since it had been out for a while and I hoped the kinks were all worked out.  Had it for several months and it has been fine.  Would have preferred the Versa.  Too bad none of them worked.
 Things it does better than the Apple Watch:<br/>- Overall fitness tracking (including sleep tracking)<br/>- Short cuts any 2 apps of your choice.<br/>- 4 to 5 day battery life.<br/>- $200 more affordable.<br/>- Lighter, slimmer &amp; more comfortable.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Receives notifications (calls, texts, etc.) but can't reply to them.<br/>- Fewer apps available.
 I like ve the big display ad I’m visually impaired.  However, I paid for the special edition because it didn’t have the “rubber”  sports band - but a woven material band. After 2 weeks the ends of the band is fraying.  It is also not as easy to change the band as  they make it seem. A sighted friend took 20 minutes and finally got it.  I wish the activity reminder was larger so I could actually see how many steps I needed to complete.  I also wish the watch told you the percentage of battery charge remaining.  Still getting to know my way around the watch and what it does. For the price, it beats an Apple Watch.
 Comfortable, stylish, syncs perfectly with my Samsung phone. Biometrics are impressively accurate. I'm a doctor and have compared it to more sophiscated pulse monitors in the hospital, and it is spot on with the professional equipment. I like being able to read notifications on my wrist throughout the day. Looking forward to the firmware update which will enable quick reply to text messages.<br/>Cheaper than an Apple watch and in my opinion better for tracking my runs because of its biometrics and comfort.
 I’ve had a Fitbit of one style or another for over 5 years now. All have been consistently great quality and work great; in the couple instances where I’ve had a problem, Fitbit customer service has been amazing to work with.<br/>I’ve had the versa now for several months and am very impressed! The battery life is much better than previous styles. I lik3 that the band can be easily removed to wash it.
 I have used this for some time now and it have to say that I think I would be better off using the Alta or HR. I feel like this one has too many options that I don’t use. It may be good for some but got me, it was bigger than I’d like and too many unusable functions. I’m a big fan of Fitbit but I liked my Alta HR better (which I gave to my sister)
 Really nice upgrade from my Alta. All of the bells and whistles are really cool and useful. Synced perfectly with my app and held a charge for the four days as advertised. I did however return it because it was just too big on my wrist and I couldn’t find the right middle ground for tightness/looseness. I even bought two different bands and it was just never as comfortable as my old Alta. The face of the watch was as wide as my wrist and it always wanted to twist upward which drove me crazy. I still give it 5 stars because it’s a neat little device just didn’t agree with my tiny wrists.
 It is not swim proof. I’ve had it since 7/2018 and swam with it twice a week. In November 2018 it died suddenly. Fitbit replaced it. So I swam with it again about 2 times per week. It died just yesterday!! 3/11/19. So it’s only swim proof for 3-4 months. Cost way too much for that. Also it at times will not track exercises or sleep. Not good!
 The watch had really motivated me to keep active. Battery life averages 3 to 4 days. I like the hourly reminder of how many steps left to reach 250, in order too be considered active. Only draw back is that I'm having a hard time with the updates. Still can't figure out why it won't do the update. I'm not too crazy about how it keeps vibrating if I don't open the text message in my phone. Also if I read the message from my watch it still continues to vibrate letting me know there is a message if I don't read it from the phone.
 I purchased my Versa on Amazon back in April and was initially thrilled it worked great, by October it was no longer syncing. I contacted FitBit and was informed that my phone bo longer had app support. I have an LG g6 which isn't exactly ancient and I am running Android version 8.0.0 again the latest software update. I wish I was joking when I say that FitBit's customer service recommended that I switch to a different phone like and Apple or Samsung, I suppose that if I had wanted a paperweight I'd have purchased either of those brands. Upon asking if this problem would continue after uninstalling the app and return my fitbit back to factory settings I was told, yes. Now I have a glorified piece of digital junk waisting space in my dest drawer. I will NEVER purchase another FitBit product again.
 My battery has lasted 3 days so far and it's at 51% . It is water proof! I've took showers with it on.. washed dishes and all. I love my versa!! It's so light weight and way more thin then the fitbit blaze what I had before.
 The steps are accurate, the heart rate is accurate though sometimes during high heart rates it displays 0 and takes a while to catch up, but I assume the tracking is still accurate even if delayed. Bright screen you can read outdoors, a decent variety of watch faces, some useful applications you can add, the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is that the OS is surprisingly sluggish for being so simple. The best feature so far is the ability to download music directly to the device but you'll need bluetooth headphones in order to listen to them.
 This is s good product. I had no problem getting it set up although it took about half an hour. The screen has numerous options and is bright and clear.
 I upgraded! My Fitbit Charge HR was great. The Versa is AWESOME. It does so much. The band is comfortable, even when sleeping. I have the ability to play music, pay for my coffee, and track fitness with the touch of a button. It's user friendly, too. Set up was a breeze. The gray/silver Versa looks great in the office as well as the gym.
 I've wore a fit it for a couple years and this is my favorite one so far. I wore a blaze before I had this one and it feels like an upgrade from that. My only gripe about this watch is how stupid it is to remove the bands from it. I liked the blaze because I could take it apart from the band and slip it into my pocket easily at work since I do factory work and cannot wear a watch. You can still remove the bands but, it is kind of a pain to do so.
 Very disappointed.  The Versa has great new features, but fails at the functions my previous fitbits (blaze, charge hr) did flawlessly.  Sleep tracking currently doesn't work.  Floor counting is currently extremely inaccurate compared to the Blaze or Charge HR.  The 3rd party clock faces are awesome, but the forum moderators say don't use them if you find sleep tracking doesn't work.<br/><br/>Lots of comments in the fitbit Versa forum are being deleted, which stifles finding technical solutions or workarounds.  I returned my Versa when I noticed the forum posts being deleted.  Very disappointed.<br/><br/>I would buy the Versa again, but only if all the tracking problems are fixed.
 I had the fitbit Ionic. My husband wanted it and I agreed to let him have mine. It was only a couple of months old. The Versa is a little smaller whiff is what I needed. I love it. Perfect size for my wrist. I love the rose gold color and it works like the Ionic does. Easy to set up. The only negative thing I have to say about it is how the watch band goes on. It was so much easier on the Ionic. That one just snapped on and snapped off. This one it takes a little bit of time but I can get it. Very attractive-looking.Can be made to look dressy or casual. Depending on which band I use. (Which can be found on Amazon.) Comes with it's own easy to use charger.
 The Versa was a great buy. Works really great!!! I would definitely advise buying the Versa over the Ionic. Both my sons bought Ionics and they are a piece of garbage. One of the Ionics records steps not taken over night. The other one glitches on the exercise setting and erases all your exercise steps and heart rates for the session your in. Fitbit needs to either fix it or stop making it.
 I love amazon! I ordered my Fitbit on the day it was released and got it the same day!!! Loving my new Fitbit but it is pretty tricky to change the bands. That is why I took away one star. I have had the Fitbit charge HR and the Alta HR so this is my third one trying. I also am a Apple Watch owner. I’m ditching it all for this one! I love it the most because it is so lightweight and the best perk for me is that it’s waterproof!!! I live in Florida and go swimming and to water parks a lot so I was always disappointed I had to leave my other fitbits behind but now I’ll be able to wear it all the time!!! I’ve worn it since Monday when I got it to today (Thursday) and I still have 66% battery life left so I think it’s doing a great job. I can hardly get my Apple Watch to last a whole day and that’s just using it as a watch! So if you are a Fitbit lover you gotta upgrade and get this one it’s great!!!
 I wanted to update my review. Support suggested I contact them. I did so and went through about a day of "testing" my fitbit. They agreed the battery was bad and sent me a new one at no charge. It works great. My recommendation is to contact support if your battery doesn't last longer than a day.<br/><br/>My original rating was 2 stars. While the process I had to go through was painful, I am much happier with the fitbit and have adjusted it to 4 stars.<br/><br/>This is my old review:<br/>Ok, my old fitbit blaze died after about 1.5 years so I decided to get the versa. It looks great and feels like a quality product, but the battery life is terrible. I have to charge it every single day. This is without any additional apps on it, no streaming of music and with it optimized for performance. I turned off anytime sync so it syncs less as well as set some of features to minimize battery use. Even with that done, it won't last a full 24 hours. My blaze lasted 3-4 days without charging it. If I ever tried to use the features of this device, I expect it would last about 2-3 hours. While it is a nice device, I would never recommend it due to the battery issues.
 I was waiting for a waterproof version that I could wear kayaking.  The Versa has exceeded my expectations.  It works well on a river.  The other functions, including a stop watch, timer, workout interval timer, easy to set alarm, and step counter were to my surprise, easy to use and highly functional.  i especially like the vibration for notification.  I have a hard time hearing, especially on the river, or a noisy gym, or when I'm coaching soccer.  Beeps, Buzzers, and Whistles don't reach me.  The wrist vibration reaches me everytime.
 Beautiful piece with quality build and feel.  Like this better than Apple watch and Gear2 because of features, usability and that it is light on my wrist!  Now tracking Fitness is fun and rewarding without sacrificing features and look of high-end smart watch!
 Spoke with Fitbit Customer Service.  They confirmed that the device is defective and based on the warranty, they are sending me a new one.  THANK YOU Fitbit, for doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Not even 2 months and look at that screen!  It got worse as the day went on and now the display won't even come on.  So disappointed.  Contacted Fitbit support.  Looking at other fitness options, but hoping they can resolve.
 I used this every day for about 6 months... just the regular things, no music as i found that drained the battery too much.  After 6 months the battery life started going down.  Now it dies after about 9 hours.  If I put it on at 6 isn’t the morning, I can’t even wear it for a full day of work. I am so disappointed. We bought my husband the Ionic about 4 months before I got my versa and his is great!  Sometimes the time is off by a few minutes, but he syncs it and it is fine.  I wish I had looked at the warranty before I bought it.  45 days for the battery.  WHAT????  And yes, I did charge it to 100%.
 If you want a smart watch but don't want to spend the money on an iWatch or Samsung watch, this gives you a lot of smart watch functionality without the higher price.  It gives me alerts for texts, call, and email.  Also use it for the alarm function.  Battery duration is good, I can charge it about every 3 days.
 0 stars if I could. I bought my Versa on December 4 and just last night it stopped working altogether. FitBit will send me another one but this is such BULL for a fitness smart watch advertised as it is and I use it when I exercise, steam, sauna, etc.<br/><br/>It lasted 3 months. Boo!
 LOOOOOOVE IT! Def don’t use all day sync and you’ll get a good 4 days out of the battery. I haven’t played too much with apps except for music which is super. It looks great, i got a cute band which was super easy to change out, easily installed tempered glass cover and a case cover for fun changes. I can’t love without a Fitbit and this is the perfect cross between the Alta and a smart watch.
 I had a great first week really loving the watch and then suddenly it started having issues connecting. The watch will not connect with my phone anymore and I can no longer go into the "Clock Faces" and "Apps" section of the Fitbit app to view my currently installed items or even look for other items to install. It was working perfectly fine earlier today (and for the last week) but suddenly nothing but connection problems.  I've tried restarting both the phone and the device, turning bluetooth off and on.  I've unpaired and it and re-paired it multiple times.  I've uninstalled and re-installed the Fitbit app.  All did nothing.  After reading all the the 1 star reviews above I'm now regretting not listening to them.  I'm not even sure it's worth getting a replacement
 Haven’t had a Fitbit for years. Had an Apple Watch and it broke. I decided to give Fitbit another chance, way better price range. This watch gives me total Apple Watch vibes but I think I actually like this one better! Battery life is sooo much better and the accuracy of the steps is amaze! I have an iPhone XS..I can read messages/get notifications which is great, I never replied from my apple watch anyway. Very please with my purchase from amazon. Set up was so easy!
 I’ve had this for one day and suddenly it stops communicating with my phone. It keeps telli me to try and disable and turn back on my Bluetooth. Of done that a ton and even restarted my phone and it won’t sync. Super disappointed.
 What a piece of work this thing was! It never worked right out of the box, refused to sync, update, or even move off of the original “welcome” logo screen. I attempted to troubleshoot all possible avenues, but nothing worked. I ended up sending it back. An expensive waste of time.
 I just got this watch today and I’ve had it for a few hours and I LOVE it. It does so many amazing things and I think this is the extra boost I need to increase my fitness! I have not done a workout with it yet, but I will update this review when I do. So far I am in love, it looks gorgeous on the wrist and rose gold is amazing! If you are looking for the best fitness watch out there then I would stop here, it does some things the Apple Watch cannot and its a cheaper price!
 I've had it for a few weeks. Overall a pretty excellent device and does everything I had wanted over my Alta HR (lets you know how many steps left in the hour was a big plus). I wish there were more apps and a rating process for apps in the store. So far none of the water logging apps are very good. The better one, water logged crashes frequently and requires an uninstall/reinstall in order to get it to work for a day or 2, the other one won't even connect. At least one of the games crashes frequently. I suspect my app problems are due to the apps being optimized for the Ionic and not Versa
 I loved this Fitbit Versa. Since the day I got it I only removed to charge it. I was very pleased although I bought a different wristband with openings because I found the provided grey silicon a little hot for our Texas summer.<br/><br/>Yesterday evening put the Fitbit on its charger and this morning it was still dead. Thought, silly me, perhaps I put it on upside down, so I carefully returned it to its cradle. Few hours later, check it and nada, still dead as a doornail. I have been futzing with it for a while and it has again started charging, but I ask myself for how long. I shouldn’t be having this problem on a new Fitbit.<br/><br/>Am really disappointed.
 #1 -- There's no way in the world it can accurately display calories. It has no idea what I eat.<br/><br/>#2 -- I've been walking around for a few days, happily watching the step counter. This morning, I tried to make a measurement of the hall outside my apartment. It said 2 or 3 steps when I counted 10 or so. 10 for a quarter mile.<br/><br/>Returned. Going to try an Apple watch even though it can't monitor sleep, has to be charged every day, and costs an arm and a leg.
 This is simply an expensive watch.  The GPS will not stay connected long enough to utilize it while exercising.  Many others seem to have the same issue as noted in the forums.  I followed the suggested steps and it still will not maintain a connection.  I attempted to "chat" with a customer service rep from Fitbit.  It was a waste of time.  He did not know the Versa from other Fitbit products and could not give me any suggestions at all.  He told me the Versa had a built-in GPS, which of course it does not.  He did not offer me any troubleshooting steps, instead told me I had already performed them.  I had no problems with my Charge 2, so did not have to contact Customer Service.  Fitbit's customer service is so bad, I will never purchase another one.  I do have a copy of the chat transcript.
 I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. He has wanted a fitness tracker/watch for a while and he shopped many versions. He decided this was the one for him. He likes the feature where he can see his texts on the unit. He wishes the batter lasted longer than 4 days. This product works just like it is described.
 Having used a Charge 2 for over a year the Versa adds some nice touches. Fills out things like reply to texts, seeing emojis in texts adding other notifications like Twitter or whatever you want from your apps on your phone. Well done, Fitbit.
 I love, love, love this watch!  I went to Disney with my grand girlies and I wanted a watch to track my steps.  But it did more....much more.  Showed me my heart rate, showed text messages and I could even reply back.  I can also answer my phone (you cannot talk into the watch) but if your phone is close you can answer your phone and speak through your phone's speaker.  I have only had it a couple of days so I don't know everything this watch does.....but what I do know is I already love it!!!
 It's okay, it has a lot of features that does not work well or with my Samsung products. I have had to return it because notifications stopped working. I did receive a replacement in a timely manner, but, the replacement is having his own issues such as now it vibrates for no apparent reason, the screen turns a whitish color and the time disappears from the face. And today I noticed that it stopped tracking my steps for period of time. And I feel that battery drains quicker on this replacement then my the original.
 This is an excellent fitness tracker.<br/>The thing that I liked the least was my first one got very poor battery use, but I contacted fitbit and after doing a battery trial  that they suggested they sent me a new versa.<br/>I highly recommend this product.
 First the positive. I love my Fitbit.  I used to have a Gramin, this has so much more functionality. It does a good job of tracking my steps and heart rate. I love getting text and phone notifications on my wrist.<br/><br/>I don't like the quality. I just sent my third one back. Each one had a "black screen of death".  That tech support could not fix.  I am sorry I did not buy the extended warranty. I hope my next one dies before my one year warranty expires, so I can get maybe 15 mouths out of my $200 purchase.
 Only good for tracking steps. Very disappointed in the item. My phone rings and I get zero notification..I made sure all setting was turned on. I will call the support # and if it doesn't work it's getting returned. Watch looks nice but functionalitu blows
 So far, I am loving this new Versa! I had the ChargeHR before and I like this one much better. I like that you can change the face to fit your personality or needs. Tons to choose from. I also like that I get a reminder every hour to get my steps in. I am definitely getting more steps in due to that alone.<br/><br/>I ordered a couple of fancy bands to go with this, but they are just too difficult to attach. The simple bands are fine. I'm still trying to find a good screen protector. The IQ Shield ones are useless....they peel right off after a few days.
 I bought this to replace my dying Fitbit Flex (first gen) because I wanted a Fitbit that was both waterproof and included a watch. It’s been about 2 months, and so far, I am extremely happy with it.<br/><br/>Pros: chargesfrom 60/70% to full in 15-20 min, every other day. Easy to use. Alternate bands sold by multiple companies, waterproof!<br/><br/>Cons: bigger than the flex in every way, Pandora app requires premium account to work, no apply health, Yolanda Bluetooth scale, Pokémon Go, or Spotify compatability.
 I’m really enjoying this so far. I upgraded from the older Fitbit Alta. I do wish that it was easier to transfer music, but I didn’t really buy it for the music feature.<br/><br/>Update as of July 2018:<br/>I still enjoy my Fitbit, but the battery life is terrible. I have only ever drained and charged completely, so the battery life has deteriorated on its own. It definitely does not last 4 days as it claims. I’m lucky to get two full days out of it now. Kind of a bummer.
 Purchased as a value smart watch replacement for a Pebble Time. So far it’s been great, very clear display and notifications coming through nicely. Fitness app is so complete I’m sure it will help me stay fit as well. I never did use many apps so limits of this device don’t bother me at all. Battery is doing fine on third day so that’s going to be a winner too.
 After 6 months it constantly freezes, stops tracking workouts on its own, takes a long time to connect to phone GPS, and is frequently failing to sync. I followed the forums on Fitbit's support site but nothing solved the issue. Also, the band started to tear near the hole I use to secure the watch, I don't wear the watch tight I like to leave a little space for it to slightly move so don't know why it's tearing.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like the watch because of it's simplicity and the size of the watch itself. Other than the issues I mentioned above, this watch was great (when it worked).
 Bought this for my wife, which replaced her Charge 2. She absolutely loves it - setup was easy, it's easy to customize, it's comfortable, aesthetic, has loads of features, and has excellent battery life. I was particularly impressed with the improvements Fitbit has made since launching the Ionic end of last year, which I bought. The software is much less buggy, is much more user friendly, and improving every day. We love our Fitbit smart watches!
 So very disappointed with my Versa! Had an old Alta for years &amp; decided to treat myself to an upgrade. I could never update &amp; my Versa acted like it could never find my WIFI. Tried on my android, my husbands IPhone &amp; my mother's Ipad &amp; it would never download! After reading the reviews I've decided to return it &amp; just buy another brand that offers the same features. I'm sad as I loves my Alta but would like to have more now. I will never recommend Versa to anyone!
 Loving it so far! I was deciding between this and the Samsung gear sport, but remembering I don't have a Samsung phone I went with the Fitbit. I'm a hairstylist and busy all day so I mostly just wanted to be able to check my texts hands free and keep track of time and it's perfect for that. Not too big or small. I'm not the most athletic person so I haven't tested the exercising features yet, but the sleep and step tracking is kind of fun. Doesnt have as many features as the Samsung or Apple, but I didn't really think I needed all that anyway. (I didn't get the NFC version and it doesn't do voice to text or calling).
 I have a charge 2, which I like a lot. That is the reason why I decided to try this versa. Unfortunately I've had sync issues from the beginning, and now after only about month and a half it won't even sync. It does not link to Bluetooth it does not detect and I've tried it on three different phones. Big let down. Complete waste of funds.
 This will not stay synced. I was so excited to get this. My first and LAST fitbit purchase. I have a phone that is approved for this device and I have to manually sync it constantly. It will not connect on its own. If you do a little research, you will find that this is a very common problem with these devices.
 It's a POS. For the last three days I've spent most of my free time trying to get this thing to stay connected to my phone. I've tried everything I've been able to find in the forums and elsewhere online to no avail. It's a frustrating, buggy, poorly executed POS and I'll be returning it in the morning.
 The heart rate monitor isn't accurate.  It sometimes reads 50 bpm higher than your actual heart rate! Notifications rarely work. These are two known issues with the Versa if you read the Fitbit community forums.  When told about the issues I was having, Fitbit said it's a software glitch and they are working on it.  Others have been told the same months ago. Just search the Fitbit community forums and you will see.<br/><br/>I was also told there is no estimated  time frame for a fix. They wouldn't let me exchange the product for another watch because I didn't buy it from Fitbit directly, even though I am within the 1 yr manufacturer's warranty period. How can Fitbit not replace a defective product within the warranty period? They are admitting there's a problem.  Stay away from this product until they sort this out.
 After spending a great deal of money on a new FitBit Versa, I figured it would be a good idea to protect my investment with a screen protector. Within days, I struck the screen on something and my screen protector shattered, but my Versa was just fine. A minimal investment in these protectors can and does protect your smart watch and other expensive electronic devices. I will buy these over and over again for as long as I have my Versa. Very high quality product, excellent price, and great customer service.
 Finally got one that works! I love this. I always carry my phone for  music, so the connected GPS feature is fine. The different clock faces are cool. I can silence my phone calls, view messages, track walks and runs and other workouts, etc. Why pay nearly twice as much for an Apple product if your life doesn't require it!
 I've have had the Fitbit Flex for going on 3 years and I love it, but didn't love how all I saw were little dots which resembled 2,000 steps. You never really knew exactly how many steps you had. I also love the alert to get moving on the Versa!!! As I love the outdoors I am so happy that Fitbit now allows you to go back and forth between different Fitbits, as I have no desire to wear my Versa outside while doing lawn or garden work. This is so comparable to my daughters Apple watch and has some features hers does not.
 Initially she disliked it since she's not a technie, but it was pretty easy to use once set up.  I also paired it with a rose gold with rhinestone metal band to dress it up and it now she loves it!  Much cheaper than an Apple Watch, 4-day battery life, and water-proof too!
 I have an old Fitbit and the Fitbit Charge 2 so it was an easy decision for us to give this to my husband for his 80th birthday.  His thank you note to me and the kids said "I love this new watch! I monitor my heart rate during my walk in the morning and it helps me to keep my heart rate up at a reasonable point while I am doing my walk. Thanks guys I love it! "
 Upgraded from Fitbit HR ended up liking the black band better. Really cute and love all the clock face options.
 Probably the best fitness tracker out there. The only issue I had was that it's not compatible with my Google Pixel 2 so I have been having issues with the syncing process. Other than that, nice design, size and price.
 After debating and getting feedback from friends and family on whether to buy an Apple Watch or the Fitbit Versa, I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision! Even though I use other Apple products and all of my friends who have Apple Watches love them and the functionality and compatibility with the iPhone, I’ve found that the Versa works perfectly with my iPhone for the reason I bought the watch...for fitness tracking. And it’s less of an investment with on par, and, dare I say, BETTER fitness features than the Apple counterpart. Beyond the standard tracking for steps taken, calories burned, and heart rate monitoring, I love the exercise shortcuts, the built in coaching sessions, and the hourly reminders to get your steps in to meet your goals. The only thing that might be lacking if you’re looking for more “smart watch” features is the variety in additional apps...but hey, that’s what our phones are for, right?
 This watch works very well and has lots of options you can use.  the one thing is that it has no speaker.  It will notify you when you get a text or someone calls you, but you can not talk on this watch.  It holds a<br/>3 day charge for how I use it.  Someone else told me that he was able to run is for 5 days before he had to charge it.  I usually put it on a charger most every night so I don't think much about the battery.
 Love it!  So glad I upgraded!
 Very impressed with the Versa. It's the first fitbit that I can wear on the inside of my wrist without interrupting my ability to type. I also can enable seconds on the digital clock faces, which was what all the EMT/Paramedic/Nursing folks wanted in their watches for checking heartbeat and was never available on the economically-priced trackers.
 I am disappointed. I don’t trust the accuracy of my activity tracking. For example, I live in a two story house and make numerous trips up and down stairs every day. Yet, today it shows no use of the stairs. I’ve compared the sleep tracking with another device which seems more accurate and detailed.<br/><br/>I have small wrists and the face of the device almost completely covers my wrist. Too bulky.<br/><br/>I seldom return purchases but am considering sending this back.
 Been wearing this a full week now - absolutely in love. I wanted a good fitness tracker that would notify me if I was getting calls or texts, and this fit the bill perfectly. Works so well, charge lasts about 2 days for me and that’s with a lot of fiddling with it. I hiked in Malibu with it over the weekend and it did a great job tracking my fitness. I also started the run button on a hike to do the route and the GPS worked great. Couldn’t want anything else !
 I used to have a Fitbit and I loved it. I got an Apple Watch and didn’t like it and wanted to go back to Fitbit. The Versa is great because it’s lightweight and sleek. The Fitbit is more geared toward fitness, which is what I wanted. I do not care about all the apps that the Apple Watch offers.
 This was the biggest waste of money! I am so disappointed. When i ordered the watch I was suppose to have same day shipping, big surprise there was a delivery error so i didnt get it until the following day. It won't stay connected to any Wi-Fi for longer than 2-3 minutes, it won't sync to my phone, I can't add music to it and the screen won't always turn on. I had a cheap $20 smart watch that worked perfectly, save your money, this is complete garbage!
 If you’re considering this as a fitness tracker I think you should be aware. Two nights ago I went to bed and woke up the next morning and although the Versa was sitting on the table next to me it racked up about 30,000 steps between the remainder of the day yesterday and this morning around 5.<br/><br/>After googling a bit it appears this is common and the solution is to return it.
 Great fitness watch. Check out the description under product info. I had a Charge 2 and traded up for the Versa. I prefer the larger screen and thinner profile. It is waterproof, and has a few added functions that are more fun and useful. You can change the display for style and function. Easy to use and to toggle through functions.
 Love this little watch.  Graphics are awesome, health stats are great. Comfortable to wear even to bed.  Love it!
 This watch is packed with the features that I want.  It is really comfortable.  The battery life is unbelievable.  The only downside was the price, but better than the price on others that had features I don’t need or want.
 This is the best Fitbit so far. I’ve had the flex and the blaze just upgraded to the Versa, it has a really nice screen, and a good selection watch face styles.<br/>Really like the exercise app.
 Fitbit Versa Limited edition w/charcoal band is not worth additional price, at all! I have worn it one night and the band is already fraying on the end. Luckily it comes with a set of the plastic bands, too, but I could have saved money and bought the 'regular' version. Syncing to Verizon messaging app is still pending. I plan to update my review once I have figured out all the settings to get my apps synced the way I want.
 I had an apple watch and I didn't like it, I felt the fitness tracker part of it sucked. my friend told me about fit bit and I got this one right when it came out. I train for triathlons and running, biking and swimming are really important to me. I wanted a watch that would be able to accurately track these, while I was able to receive texts and other notifications at the same time. this watch does it all. If you are looking for a fitness tracker that is also a simple smart watch this one is for you. If you want a smart watch that can crapily track fitness the apple watch would be better you.
 When I got the phone it was great, I loved it.  But now it won't sink with my phone unless I unpair my car with my phone.  So I have a choice use my watch tracking software or have Bluetooth in my car.  This didn't happen until my return option<br/>expired.  I've gone to community boards and I'm not the only person experiencing this problem, so Fitbit knows about it.  I've called them and they told me I had to return it through Amazon.  But I'm outside my return window so I got several months service out of my $200 watch.  I won't be buying another Fitbit unless they fix this problem.<br/> AN update, yesterday I got a Notice of a software update on my fit bit my watch re synced at 9:30 yesterday morning and hasn't synked again since
 Update:  Not sure if this is how you update my previous review.  I took my Fitbit Versa Smart Watch to Best Buy and the sales clerk showed me how to move the screen.  I love my Fitbit Versa and give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I started wearing the Fitbit Versa and loved how light and it tracked my steps Aug. 6 and wore it during workout which it also tracked; however, I when I swipe for the screens it won't move to the other screens.  Who do I contact, is it stuck and is this common among others who have purchased the Fitbit Versa.  I need help!  Thanks!
 Getting used to this ‘fancy’ fitness smart watch, after happily using Fitbit ONE for years. Versa gives really useful reminders and motivation! I did find a problem where the synthetic strap has caused one, small rash-like spot on my wrist. Then I read online that a similar rash also has affected other fitness smart-watch wearers, including some using Fitbit. And I do wish the battery lasted longer! A full week charge would be great.
 terrible product. It works if you do anything but swim, but even if it’s you don’t swim, it’s unreliable and inconsistent with its tracking if you compare it to any other watch. And when you do swim, it breaks after the first time. Incredible. Got it for Christmas and works for one swim when swimming is my main sport. Also does not track any other exercise besides hiking, running, weightlifting, and “swimming”.
 Ok, I bought this in mar. Keep it a month.  Saw no hope for improvement cause it sucks, so I returned it and planned to buy it again when they fix it.  Well reading all these reviews I see that's not happening, so, next.  Such a shame, especially for all of u stuck w it.
 I really like the Versa and all it can do. However, it is not always accurate. It stated on Tuesday I rode my bike for 17 min. I was not even on my bike. I did move the bike out of my RV and locked it to a pole but that was last Thursday and Fitbit said I rode it on Tuesday. Have not ridden it for 2 weeks. Then I drove my RV 2100 miles and it was recorded on the Fitbit that I was climbing floors. Said I climbed over 300 floors in one day....ha! Love that it lets me know when I have a call coming in on my cell phone. Great features — alarms, different types of exercises, music, etc. Exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it.
 In love with my Fitbit Versa! Extremely comfortable! I wear it 24/7, even to bed and it never bothers me. The best part is how smooth the back is, it lays flat unlike some of the others. Also the woven band is great, very breathable and doesn’t stick to your skin. I’m not a fan of the silicone bands, although it does come with both woven and silicone. Buy this Fitbit, you’ll love it too!
 Of course this happens just past the 30 day warranty ... suddenly heart rate tracker quit working, about 5 days ago. I first noticed the sleep monitor quit tracking, then when I finally had some time to see what's going on, I realized it's the heart monitor not working &amp; the tracker (green lights on back) is just DEAD! I've tried everything, including a factory reset (suggested by fitbit live help) - still nothing! $200 down the friggen drain with NO HELP from Fitbit. Seems to be a common problem, this is BS &amp; not setting well with me...
 Face too large for a woman's wrist. This is size for a man. I LOVED THE LOOK. I even bought 3 other bands for dressing up. The face hung over my wrist. I knew I would catch it on something. Never charged or tried it. The band could be adjusted to fit. I wanted a larger face, but they should do what companies used to: same product marked Men and a bit smaller Women.  All this equality is back firing on women. We are not the same size. If a woman wanted to wear a larger one then she could order a man's size watch. at 1" it would be perfect.
 Upgrade from a Charge 2. Better in all respects and changing devices was easy. It's a great smartwatch.
 Once I figured out how to get the plastic strap off to change to a different band and how to add new watch faces, I absolutely love it. It gives so much information compared to my Alta. I watched several videos on how to change things up. The Fitbit directions are not very detailed. If I can learn how to use it, anyone can.
 Wanted to LOVE this Fitbit, but it’s just ok.  Still getting use to it so will update as I learn more.  Frustrating that the WiFi only connect to the lower WiFi speeds.  We have 5 business internet and it won’t connect to<br/>I have to have my phone at all times.  Fitbit has not been helpful and I spent 2 weeks back and forth with them on the issue.  I updated from my blaze cause it’s waterproof which to me is the only plus.  I’ll update after a couple months of use
 4.5 stars! I wish it was a little bit more interactive with my other apps, but I love all of the other features that are geared towards fitness (which is why I bought it!). It has great wrist straps that are easily interchangeable. The sleek, modern design is stylish enough for every day wear, while the fitness features built in are beasty enough to keep up with all of my workouts.
 I absolutely LOVE mine! Have had it a week and my only complaint is that the silicone band makes me wrist sweat, but that’s easily fixed by ordering a replacement band at some point. I really wanted an Apple Watch but this was cheaper, and I didn’t plan on connecting an Apple Watch to my phone plan for data, so the fit bit made more sense. No complaints! I can’t check social media or anything with it, but my phone is always on me anyway... lol
 When the Versa works, it works great. Unfortunately it’s a very unreliable device. After nine months the battery wouldn’t hold a charge for more than a few hours, and the replacement process has been brutal. This is the last time I buy a Fitbit device.
 I went from an apple watch to a versa. I got rid of my iphone, which is why I also decided to replace the apple watch. I had my apple watch for about 3 years. It did slow over time but was able to take a lot of rough use (e.g., banging around, dropping, etc.) This fitbit versa isn't made nearly as well. It does the job of tracking steps but I often have to reenter my passcode on the watch which is annoying. Also, the main reason for this review is how delicate the versa is. I hit it against my gas tank door and it flew off and cracked. The crack is pretty bad. I'm surprised at how easily it was to crack like that when my apple watch took worse falls and was fine. Also, the bands seem poorly made and manufactured as it was far too easy for it to fall off my wrist. Its a decent watch for the price but make sure you buy a screen protector becuase its delicate.
 I love it! It is super light and tracks everything I’d need to know. The bands are a little trickle to switch out but no big deal.
 The watch came as it looks.  Charging is easy. Long battery life.  I am on day 4 without charging it since the initial charge. Steps are quite accurate. The hourly step reminder is nice and motivating.  Sinks well with phone.  It has many clock faces to choose from. Great for tracking the exercise you choose..  Great motivational.  Will be getting the hubby one for Christmas.
 An awesome fitness tracker. Intuitive controls and useful features make this a very helpful tool in my daily life. I like how it is water resistant so you can run it under the tap to clean it. If I was gonna nitpick I would say that there arent a lot of apps for it and the clock faces glitch sometimes, but it is a new technology and I am sure it will be fixed.
 I ordered my Fitbit Versa on a Sunday morning using Amazon Prime and it was delivered on the same day in evening.  It serves it's purpose well.  I can customized it to remind me to move every hour, track my results, monitor my heart rate, sleep pattern - to name a few.  I love the 'coach' feature - helps with your workouts.  I also like that you can change the look of the face of the watch any time you feel like it.  There are so many tools to use that I am still learning about all the features.  Overall, well worth the price.
 I had my versa for 3 months and the screen stopped working. It just lit up white and completely blank. Fitbit sent me a replacement, and that one had only an 8 hour battery life from the day I got it. I called after two weeks and was sent another replacement. I had that one for 3 months and the same issue with the screen just happened again. I’m not even going to bother to get another replacement because odds are it won’t work right or it won’t last more than 3 months. I’m going to get an Apple Watch since I have an iPhone.
 Its a pretty good and accurate so far. I have using it for a month and see a daily usage of 25% of the battery. 2.75+ days of charge is easily available. I do not use it for sleep tracking though.
 I want to love this Versa but since I spend my winters in Arizona &amp; am unable to read anything but the time (&amp; that only if I hold it just right) while outside in the sunshine, it makes it almost pointless.<br/><br/>I have been happy with the various tracking features &amp; the ability to wear in the pool &amp; the battery life. I am seriously considering sending it back based on my inability to read it outside.
 I loved this watch and all of the features. However, after having the watch for less than 6 months the watch just stopped charging and would not turn on. I am very disappointed that something at this price would only be viable for less than half a year ... it’s just not feasible to buy a new smart watch 2 times a year.
 I love tracking my steps.  I had an old one and it got wet and stopped working. It seems like I stopped moving and now I find myself moving more and making an effort to move more.
 When they said I could get about 4 days of use out of this, I was not expecting that kind of battery life.  My last "Smart Watch" only would last about 1 maybe 1 and a 1/2 days.  I only wish that they would allow me to add a couple of custom activities within the menu to start from the Watch itself.  I tried to use Elliptical auto start from the App, but it doesn't always register that I'm on the Elliptical so it's easier to use the start from watch and tell it I'm using the Treadmill.
 This is the 3rd time I have purchased a fitbit and had the band break in the first month of wearing.  After number 2 I swore I would not purchase another but the Versa has features I really liked and I thought, surely by now the wristbands are better.  WRONG!!  To take advantage of the warranty...……….I am to return in original packaging, which of course I don't have, or something similar.  I am annoyed that I need to do the work here...……….sadly no more fitbit for me.
 Nice watch and a lot slimmer than my older fitbit
 Best Fitbit I have owned. Love that I can put a picture of my grandkids on the face.
 Bought in January 3 months ago. Suddenly my screen is shrunk to about half normal display size horizontally. Clock face unreadable. Have tried restarting and nothing has worked. Will update if I get it to work correctly.
 This Fitbit has all of the features I have been waiting for. It is worth the price difference from the Charge HR because it offers so many features. The battery life (so far...) has been great. Love my fitbit versa!
 I've had this for six months or so. I've had a Charge 2 and an Alta also. This is my favorite. I haven't had any problems with it, though I haven't tried swimming with it. I do get about four days battery. I use it for sleep tracking and jogging. It seems quite accurate.
 Received as a Christmas present.  Easy to set up and sync with IPhone.  Not a fashion statement but attractive and comfortable to wear.  Step counting and heartbeat seem to be accurate.  Sleep information very interesting and seems to mimic the sleep I have each night.  I had a Fitbit One for years.  It was carried in a pocket and did its job OK.  The Versa seems more accurate and useful.  I would recommend this product.
 love my fit bit a little bigger than I wanted as far as the face of the watch goes would be more on the lines of a mans watch size but it works out ok, it keeps me on track and is great with the notifications dont like the fact that you cannot download music from a smart phone and only download through your computer or their app purchase but I like the other features on the versa.
 Liked the look of it and seemed like I would have loved the features but unfortunately it wouldn't pair with my samsung s5. It kept giving me a bluetooth error no matter what troubleshooting I tried.
 I received the fitbit as described.<br/>I got everything working, seemed fine.<br/>I tried to put the larger band on but it won't click in.<br/>I have tried several times but it won't seem to lock in place. The smaller band works fine but is really too small for my wrist and I would like to be able to use the correct size but won't seem to lock in place.
 This is a nice fitness tracker and my daughter really liked it. But the heart rate monitor registers the heart rate too high. Apparently that’s an issue with these. The other thing she didn’t like was that it didn’t have and sos feature. What she did love was the look, the feel, the band (likes the band better than the Apple Watch), the different faces for the watch. The battery life is excellent. The apps are easy to use. For fitness it’s great.
 One of the reasons I wanted the fit bit versa besides tracking my steps was to also recieve text messages. I have tried everything suggested to me &amp; nothing works. I'm not happy that I paid $200 for a watch that doesn't do everything it is supposed to do.
 The Versa is a great watch.  I love that it is water proof.  I went from a Charge2 to a Versa.  Unfortunately, after 45 days the screen was cracked.  I have no clue how that happened.  Fitbit does not offer screen replacements so I had to purchase another Versa.  After reviewing the Fitbit community sections, it seems that this is a common problem.  Please make sure you purchase side protectors for your Versa.
 Awsome tracker i would not change it for nothing. I had the Fitbit HR and that was great but after doing some research the versa was the way to go.
 I am floored by 1. How good it looks and 2. How comfortable it is. It really looks like an Apple Watch and has some similar functionality. And as someone with sensitive skin, I was worried putting a watch on would be problematic, but it fits great. It’s very east to use for all the Fitbit type uses. I will say it’s not an Apple Watch and while it will tell you about texts and phone calls, that’s about it. But for what I need, it does everything all while it looks and feels comfortable. Also, I charge every morning while I shower/get ready and it basically gets to 100% so the battery life is pretty great too!
 I upgraded from the charge 2 - very happy I did.<br/>Pros:<br/>-way better heart rate monitor<br/>-light weight<br/>- good battery life<br/>-choose what notifications I get, change my music (even spotify!)<br/>- the running interface is way nicer and more accurate<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- not a lot of apps available yet<br/>- some clock faces cost $.99-$2 (not a lot but annoying)<br/>- changing wristbands is difficult<br/><br/>Wish: iPhone text replies<br/><br/>Overall: 4/5<br/>Would recommend to anyone for Fitbit upgrade or non-apple junkies for a smartwatch.
 I moved up from the Charge 2 and am never going back. I love the screen on the Versa, the coach that modifies it's workouts as you rate them, the personalization, everything! This was a dream of an upgrade. Thanks!
 I like the idea of it. Should be able to see your progress on it, instead of the app. Also in the advertising of it, it should be noted you need a paid subscription to pandora and deezer. Have had trouble syncing a few times and only received it three weeks ago. Love the look of it and can change the clock faces. Would I buy it again? No!!!!!!!!!!! Weather app WON’T sync either. Junk!!!!! All lemons or just this one???
 I bought this watch to use while running. Unfortunately, the Versa spends the majority of the time I'm out "connecting" to my phone's GPS, resulting in inaccurate statistics and general irritation on my part. Looked at some online forums to see if there's a fix, but instead found that I am far from alone in having this problem. Wasn't an issue with other smart watches with the same phone. Deal breaker. Sending it back.
 Had about two months and the heart rate monitor quit working.  Fitbit customer service has been horrible.  Searching the community forum makes this seem like a very common problem.  The only solution I could find was getting a replacement watch.  However, FITBIT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.
 I absolutely love my watch. It makes my life so much easier as a smart watch. I can easily screen calls and texts (and many other alerts) while I’m at work with out getting my phone out. This is great as I am a teacher and “no phones in class!” Is the rule. It is also fun to have challenges with other Fitbit users! Most people assume it’s an Apple Watch when they see it.
 GARBAGE!!!! Wish I could get my wasted day back!  Can't even wrap my head around d a product, garbage, and package it as "easy to use", garbage when you have to ha e a computer.  WHO HAS A COMPUTER FOR EASY UPLOADING IN 2019....ONLY GARBAGE!  Beyond irritated at this useless garbage! False advertising, easy download....for the 1990s!  Get in the NOW!
 I was very happy with my Vivofit except for the fact that I need a second hand on my watch for work so ended up wearing 2 things on my wrist during work hours. I know it’s a first world problem but...<br/>Switched to this for the clock face but found so much more to like about it. It is much more responsive with the Weight Watchers app and syncs with my gym’s app (which was not an option with the Vivofit).  Still getting used to it but like it so far.
 Purchased 4 months ago. After charging, it  will not turn on and very warm to the touch.  I called Fitbit and was told that because I bought this Fitbit Versa through Amazon I cannot get a refund.  They will only replace which I really dont want.
 Watch works well and very nice but that battery life does not last even a full 24 hours and hasn't since I received it, I thought I would give it some time and try and restart it but nothing has really made a difference. I know other people who have the same watch and DO NOT have this issue so it may just be mine.
 I love the notifications, the fact that I can read the time without my glasses at night  and all the clock screens to choose from.  Upgraded from a Charge 2.
 Love the design and ease of setup.  All of the functions are easy to use and access.  Band is comfortable and easy to adjust. Clasp is secure.  Transferring music takes several steps, but is simple once you have it figured out.  Music quality is very good.  Love the watch face choices.  The only con to the watch so far is the step count rising when I am driving on a bumpy road.
 My 3rd and best Fitbit so far. Apple doesn't own every breakthrough. These guys do a great job with no kool-aid drinking required.
 I adore this watch and wear it everyday. I would llngetting a few for Christmas presents to myfamily or friends.<br/>I wanted it for the reminders but most importantly my sleep apnea and monitor my sleep<br/>Design is cool and confortable
 The waterproof feature is good but you have to use buttons to use it under water.<br/>The bands are extremely easy to take of and easy to put back on. The trick is to use it toward the opposite end.<br/>Battery is long and charges fast<br/>The charger it comes with is not the best when the band is still on the Fitbit. I suggest taking them off or buying a 10$ hanging charger.<br/>Invest in screen protectors but good ones or better a bumper(case)
 It’s a replacement for my Fitbit Alta and I love my new Versa
 Great Fit , Lightweight . Band is comfortable.<br/>Bought for NFC ability . If you get it for that make sure your bank or card is on their list of acceptable payers.
 Really enjoying it so far! My only issue with it was the first night I had it I placed it on my side table and between midnight and 5am it accumulated over 16,000 steps... Apparently my sound machine and/or humidifier we’re vib at some frequency that made it think I was moving even though I didn’t have it on.<br/><br/>It tracks all my workouts well and seems to be pretty accurate with heart rate. I really enjoy the clockfaces and the “relax” app that has guided breathing
 I wish that it would do a little bit more than it did. For a FITBIT and not an apple watch it does let you read parts of messages when they come in. You can't respond though and that is a downfall. I have also noticed if I go a few rooms away from my phone it won't pick up messages and all of that. All the watch faces are pretty neat, but cost you when you get past the few that fitbit actually offers.
 I recent bought for myself and as a gift for a friend. We both love using it. I wear it everyday and never take it off. It is very comfortable and light on the wrist. I mainly use it for the track of heart rate in exercising. My friends uses it for running and tracking her path. My only issue is with the bands. We both want to be able to change the bands on the fly but it is so difficult to do!!
 This is a great fitness watch, especially compared to my old Alta. I had another iteration before the Alta, but I cannot recall what it was called; in any case it was much more basic than the Alta. So I've come a long way with Fitbit. I haven't even scratched the surface of it yet, but it has kept excellent track of my CrossFit workouts for the last week. Awesome watch! I especially love how I can change the display - since I'm a dork I chose the Star Trek LCARS display.
 I'm pretty disappointed. Even after uninstalling the apps that came on it and turning off email, calendar and majority of the other notifications, keeping the screen display on 10 seconds and brightness on auto.... my battery life is literally drained every other day. The "reply" is only with certain apps and are very limited, only 4 that you can program.
 I've had so many issues syncing my watch since I've had it that I even changed cell phones thinking it might help. My watch restarts randomly and occasionally it's turned itself off. I have repeated issues with the clock faces, even when I stick to the Fitbit created ones. I want so much to love it, but it's just not consistent enough for me. My husband ordered one in the last month, not a special edition, and his hasn't had any issues.
 I loved my Apple Watch series 3 but it wasn’t good with fitness. So I decided to buy a Fitbit Versa and I love it so I sold my Apple Watch! It does everything I was looking for. Heart rate, steps, calories, sleep! Amazing, best money spent!! I got the peach rose gold and it is an amazing color!
 So this is my first fitbit. I went from a samsung  gear gen 1 to this. It's super light. I even forget it's sometimes. The screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight, battery lasts about 3.5 days of normal operation. Even hahas built workouts which is so helpful. But there are a few cons. The fact i cant connect it to spotify is unfortunate hopefully they get a partnership and fix that. The other con is changing watch bands can be a bit of a headache but its a slot easier that having a bunch of screws to remove and loose
 Great fit and feel. I wish it were able to respond to messages and there were more apps. I expect more development soon. Until then, one star short of perfection.
 Purchased for my wife as a Birthday gift. She loves it and enjoys the detailed additional features as compared to her other FitBit watch. Many people compliment her for the watch's appearance. Easy to program and easy to see, many options.
 I was too anxious to get the versa i took the black instead of waiting for the silver /black. Good watch but text messages have a quirk.
 Use for heart rate as have a pacemaker and am real active.  Don't  want defib to go off.  Love the big pulse face. Love thats it waterproof ; I kayak a lot
 I have had it for 3 months. I loved it while it worked. After two months I couldn't use the touch screen. Three days ago it stopped working completely, after telling me I had gone up 95 flights of stairs in one day. (I was in the car for 14 hours that day...)<br/>Fitbit says I have to mail it to them, so they can make sure it doesn't work. They will send me a new one in a few weeks.
 I returned this because I could not get it to sync with my Android.  It was pretty which is why I have it 3 stars.
 Loved it!  FAst shipper!
 .... day four and it is a game changer! Began with flex and was enamored for three months but wanted more! I needed a watch and a more efficient charging detail so I upgraded. Yesterday I reached out to an old friend who lives a thousand miles away and we are planning a virtual run together! Plus I needed a time piece so I glad I made the purchase. Very easy to set up too!
 It’s light weight functional easy to use.  Nice features and apps.  I liked my Blaze.  I wanted the Iconic but at a $100 less, I am truly satisfied with Versa.
 Its sturdy and has worked great since the day I bought it. Ive had this guy for about a year now and its still goin strong and my face plate is not scrstched or broken to all hell. Its good stuff! I reccomend the buy if you were looking into buying the versa. Me and my girlfriend bought this versa watch.
 I love this. its amazing. I can track my sleep, workouts, and its nice. and get text messages. wonderful. I did find the band bothersome. i bought one that breaths more and its all better
 Thank you Fitbit for finally making a tracker that has a screen similar to Apple's small screen! I love fitbit and have an android but other screens have been so big on my small wrist. This one is perfect!!!!!
 I had the watch for 1 days and the battery died. I contacted Fitbit and they will send me a replacement. For that price this should not happen. Thankfully Fitbit will replace it right away without any fuss.
 I love it! Not a big fan of the band because it’s not breathable. I’ve ordered a different  band and that should do the trick
 Bought it as a gift for the wife and she thinks it's fantastic. And it's only gotten better with recent updates. Seems to work pretty smoothly, I personally liked the docking charger it came with. Bands swap out as expected. Simple to set up and use, no real complaints.
 Been using about 2 weeks!  Loving it so far!!  I absolutely love walking with music and NOT having to carry my phone. Had to purchase a set of blue tooth ear buds- as it doesn’t share without resetting...etc. but still happy
 This watch does almost everything I want. Unfortunately, you can't listen to music unless you have a paid subscription to Pandora or Deezer. The other option of loading your music requires that you have a PC with your music on it. If your computer of choice is a smartphone or tablet your out of luck.
 Years ago I bought one of the belt clip fitbits and lost it.  A lot of people were losing these and the company replaced it free of charge.  Later I bought a charge and when it failed a year later the company replaced it with no hassle.  This a great company! Versa is the best of their product line to date.  While it may not have all the features of other smart watches. It surpasses most as a fitness watch and works perfectly with both iPhone and Android.
 This a nice watch. Bought it for my wife and she loves it! Easy to set up. No issues at all on syncing. I was worried about some feedback on technical issues but it worked smoothly for me.
 Device’s connection via Bluetooth headphones is awful.  Audio skips all the time when you use this device to listen to music whilst running outside.  It seems almost every new house I run by causes the device to spend 30 seconds delivery choppy audio to my Headphones (connected via Bluetooth).  It gives and I have to resume playback when I get to a large open area without interference from homes’ wireless signal.  Unusable as a replacement for a music player during a run type workout.
 Was nervous it would be too big for a small wrist. It’s perfect size! Amazing all around
 Purchased as a gift for my wife who loves it, especially the convenience of NFC pay.  She did immediately swap out the band, however.
 I cannot get enough of my VERSA. I've had just about every model, but this one most definitely has blown all my other ones out of the water. The ability to set an alarm that doesn't wake my husband is invaluable. The only thing I would like to see would be Bluetooth music storage without having to have your phone while you are exercising.
 I loved my Fitbit Charge 2 but I noticed that my resting HR was usually off by give or take 3-5 bpm when compared to my PulseOx. I have tested my Versa HR against my PulseOx both while resting and after physical activity and it has been exact. I love the color on the screen and the various other capabilities that my Charge 2 didn't offer. So far I'm very happy with the Versa!
 This item is simple and sweet, it does exactly what I expected and wanted it to do. Setup is easy. Since I can operate the device well between the main button and screen I don't see a need for the two extra physical buttons. Battery life is good and lasts for about three days until I fully charge it in 45 minutes. the device is light, comfortable and not bulky. It looks good and modern. The app is a dream  as it is easy to use, plenty of useful tips, illustrates your data in useful ways, and best of all it encourages you to reach your set goals.
 Ordered the Fitbit Versa with lavender band. Received one with charcoal band...the watch itself is great...love that it tracks my swim and walks. Really like that it is waterproof. Still exploring it's capabilities.
 This product arrived as promised, it was a gift.  The day I presented the gift to the recipient I found out that  Best Buy had the same watch for $50.00 less!!  Lesson learned!
 Love this Smart Watch. It has so many features that I have been wanting to use. This replaces a previous FitBit I previously owned. This watch does so much more than before.  It follows my steps, stairs, heart rate, sleep time, water consumption, how many days of exercise and several other apps.
 This is the best Fitbit to date...not only does it link to Pandora to play music, but you can read and respond to your text messages, and it also lets you know when your phone is ringing and so much more...who needs an Apple Watch...not me!
 It keeps entangling on my wrist hair and hurts like hell as the hairs get pulled. It’s the strap design that’s faulty. There is a pin that protrudes out and hurts the wrist as it pulls the hair.<br/>It’s too big and doesn’t offer any advantage over the other Fitbit I had. At least not to me. I would have returned it, but too late for that.
 I like the Fitbit Vesa but the black band that came with mine is missing the pin and I'm unable to use it. I have had it a few weeks and just noticed it was missing when I tried to switch bands. One of the reasons I chose this option over some of the less expensive ones is because it came with 2 sets of bands. Disappointing.
 Excellent product.  A game changer for fitness devices.  Is it an Apple Watch?  Nope.  It’s much more focused on what it does best.  Monitors fitness activities. With some smart phone features.
 Interacts with my phone so I can get text messages, with partial message, appointment reminders, and who is calling.  Features can be turned off if not wanted.
 I’m loving the Versa. I’ve always had a FitBit until October and I bought a Gear Sport. It just wasn’t what I was hoping...it was bulky and felt heavy. The Versa is lightweight, small, and has all the options on it I was looking for. Best part is I can swim with it!!!  I will be upgrading my husband and son from the Blaze to Versa very soon!
 V.Good smart watch and fitness tracker...we loved it.
 The pin retainer pin holding for the watch band broke. Amazon referred me to Fitbit for help. Fitbit’s website only allows you to search FAQs, post your issue on their community board, or go to their store to purchase another watch.<br/>A new watch band isn’t even an option as part of the pin broke off in the watch body. This is a joke.
 Beat expectations for what a smart watch should do!  So far very happy over my Apple Watch and Garmin Vivoactive HR
 I guess I’m one of the few people that don’t have any issues in terms of setting up/installation and all other functions. The installation took like less than 20 mins for me, but I had like a strong stable WiFi connection. My watch arrived yesterday and I’m very satisfied at this point. I like how it tracks my sleep, steps, hear rate, etc...I think people who never had a smart watch would definitely love this Versa. One of the things that I really like about this watch is how it tracks your when you are asleep, wake, restlessness, etc... and in the app it has it all color-coded out, which is fantasic since I am a visual type of person. In addition, I think this watch is one the few that lets you have many options for your clock face.<br/>But I really do hope the battery will last at least a week (So far since yesterday afternoon - 7pm had around 94% of battery after installing it, now at 10am today, I have 81% battery).<br/><br/>To the people anticipating on buying this or just brought theirs: Make sure you have good stable connection to your WiFi and keep your phone nearby when installing it, then you shouldn’t have too much of an issue. Since I timed mine when I started setting up (cuz I was getting really nervous that I was going to be part of the majority that will have issues syncing and installing) it actually took like 20 mins to set up and installing it.
 I had to return my Versa. Tried repeatedly to sinc music to my wireless earbuds and headphones. So disappointed. Being able to have my music while exercising and leave my phone behind is why I bought the Versa. I will wait for it’s next generation to see if Fitbit can work the bugs out.
 This watch is very user friendly and accomplishes exactly what I want it to.  I use it a lot for tracking my exercise while running, and for tracking my sleep patterns.  I get about 4 days of use before I have to charge it again.  Does not seem to take long to recharge.  Very pleased with this watch.
 POS! Battery dies on it in shorter and shorter intervals... until one day.. you pick it up from the charger in the am at 100%... and by noon its dead! Oh SURE they will replace it... they did.. and in 2 months ITS DOING THE SAME THING!!!! Dont by one! It sucks! I've called 3 times... it's happened THREE TIMES.. and now... of course... the warranty is over.. and i have a piece of crap!
 Closest thing to a new pebble watch. Love it, best fitbit ever
 The Fitbit Versa worked well for awhile. But I am having battery issues lately. It charges to 100% in about 90 minutes and depletes to 0% by the end of the day. It is annoying to be having to charge it daily. I have changed my backlight setting, turned my quickview off and turned off all-day sync.
 Yo solo uso la función de contar los pasos q doy. Es liviano. El material es de primera calidad. Se puede cambiar el diseño del formato por diferentes y muy bonitos. Si necesitas saber cómo usarlo y le escribes al equipo de Fitbit online, te responden de inmediato y tratan de ayudarte full.
 I love Fitbit I own 7 products. I like the versa it’s great but I’ve already had to get a new one as the battery on it did not last that’s one thing that is a pain but Fitbit made it right and got me a new versa
 I had a Charge 2 and Loved it. It was time for a replacement and I loved the style and functions that the versa offered. I got it and it synced right away. The battery lasts me 4-5 days and charges really quickly. It tracks very accurately for me. Definitely recommend this!
 Best watch ever! I workout every day, am a landscaper and walk as well. Its as beautiful as they come. I pre ordered and saved for 2 months. I love my versa. Upgraded from the Alta. Like night and day. Thank you Fitbit! 💜💜💜
 Bought it for my mom and she loves it she's 75 years old and counts her steps every day great addition to her life...<br/><br/>She likes to wear classy watches all the time and was skeptical in this now she wears two watches this on one hand and her classy watch in the other
 This watch is great! It does everything I need. Only thing I don't like is on Apple there's no option to respond to texts but even my husband has android and said this is a limited feature.
 Love the look and the features. Much improved over the Blaze, especially now I can swim with it.
 It’s super comfortable to wear, works perfectly. I love it!
 When it works it works great.  Every so often it stops syncing with my phone. Sometimes shutting off and turning back on the Bluetooth works.  However, sometimes you have to reset it back to the factory settings when it starts losing time or you can't get it to sync at all. Unfortunately, when you reset your versa you lose some of the data.
 So far, I like everything about this watch!! It is comfortable, pretty, not over-priced. There are nice replacement bands and several free clock faces plus many more that you can purchase.  I am so glad I got it.
 My wife really loves it. The band it came with is very pretty but starts to show staining.
 I bought this on Oct 1st, and my watch dead on Nov 26th. I reached out to amazon support, they asked me if I need the money back or the watch replaced. I asked for a replacement, which was sent right next day. I am OK with my watch, I hope it lives a long life. Battery life is 5-6 days, sometimes not accurate about stairs, but fine overall.
 Love it, use the exercise options to time my workouts and keep track of my heart rate. Love the sleep tracking and availability of reading /replying to text and being able to see emails.
 El reloj en todas sus funciones es excelente, solo me llevé una decepción que fue que no te mide la distancia mientras corres....  Sólo  la marca cuando terminaste de correr. Como reloj para deporte es muy bueno,  pero si quieres ver la distancia que vas recorriendo O quieres programarte para Correr una distancia específica, lamentablemente no la marca
 Got for Christmas! Stopped working on February 13. Tried all the troubleshooting to no avail
 It's very stylish and light weight.  I love the relax option.  Syncing with my phone is extremely slow. The instructions on how to program or operate the Versa are trash so it's trial and error.  This device cost too much for that.
 I have had the Fitbit blaze and iwatch3 and I love the versa the best out of the 3. I use this primarily to track my macros , calories burned, and exercise. This does this AND I get notifications and and have my music, so it’s almost like the iwatch3 without being too busy ! It’s great!!
 I’m still finding new features on Versa but so far I’m loving it. I wondered if it would feel big on my wrist after upgrading from Charge 2. But it seems just the right size and actually lighter than Charge 2.
 Got this because I’ve been partners of the Fitbit family. Didn’t want to get the Apple Watch bc of cost. However, ONE MONTH in and the side buttons don’t work, won’t sync to my phone, and does NOT sync to WiFi easily. Currently in talks with the Fitbit company for repair. But I really Wish I’d bought the Apple Watch.
 Its perfect.  Works just like it is supposed to.  No issues at all.
 Its great when it syncs, but that is hardley ever without hours of messing with.  I have to unpair and repair, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app, and sometimes that works. its such a pain in the ass.  I havent been able to use the app for over a week now and spending about 6 hours a day trying to get it to sync again.  The time is not right on it so all of myself data is wrong anyway.  I would not recommen this watch!!!
 I'm revising my former one-star review of the Versa since it - finally - connected with the Bluetooth on my phone and started working. The interface is a bit obscure to start with but I'll probably get used to it. The charging system is excellent and so far the four-day claim for battery life seems realistic, though I've charged it every night so far. Four stars ... maybe another one later.
 Bought as a Mother's day present and she loves it.  She replaced the watch band but she has not stopped wearing it. Great apps built in and she has been tracking steps and HR.  For reference, I use a Garmin Vivovfit3 and love it but if I were in the market for another smartwatch this would be the top contender for me.
 I wish I knew before I ordered it that it was made of plastic, not metal. It feels cheap. Also, you have to push the button to see what time it is. If your hands are occupied, good luck finding out what time it is. I guess it's supposed to know when you turn your wrist to look at it, but that only works sporadically and sometimes when you don't even want it to. I'm keeping it and using it for the fitness part, but as a watch is useless.
 Fitbit has the worst customer service and do not live up to their product warranties. Do yourself a favor and buy an Apple Watch or anything other than a Fitbit. The material quality will not hold up to active use and when it breaks you are screwed because they will not fix it. Even in the 1st 30 days.
 It’s great! I’ve had a Fitbit before and felt I needed an upgrade. I love it! I love the Fitbit app both are user friendly.
 Love it. Works great battery lasts several days even with text announcements and all day sync on. I bought a new band, I didn't like the band, but that doesn't detract from the value.
 Had the Blaze and upgraded to the Versa. I like the improved features and accuracy. It does what I need it to do, and do it simply. The design is similar the Apple Watch, but at half the price. I love all the watch face options!!<br/><br/>Only con is that I've had bluetooth connectivity issues when pairing with my Google Pixel 2. It's finicky.
 Bought as a gift for our child. I know both Apple and Samsung Gear watches very well and I’m not going purchase either of them again. I’ll purchase this FitBit in the future because it is much more affordable and offers everything I need (text messages/notification, etc.). Plus FitBit does a much better job tracking health metrics I care about.
 Me and my bf decided to get the fitbit versa, we love them. They work great and track really well. There are so many cool things to do with it, they ever have workout they show you on the screen that you can do. We really like that we can challenge each other to reach our goals and see each others progress. It has really motivated us.
 I love my versa. Love detailed sleep tracking and music storage
 Thus fitbit isn't as accurate as my old Garmin. It has issues syncing and downloading music is nearly impossible. It says it can take 15 minutes to download 1 station but it takes over 8 hours, if it works! The one thing I like about fitbit is the app and contact you have with others to push yourself to workout more/challeges. Overall: I liked my Garmin more.
 Enjoying my first ever smart watch-wearable. Great to get notifications of phone calls and messages, really great to track sleep and steps. Haven't yet gone swimming or tried the coach, but will soon.
 This is great device, however the purple band, when wet from water, actually smells horrible. I've cleaned the band with alcohol and cotton swabs several times since noticing the odor, but it will not go away. Otherwise, I do enjoy my new Versa.
 I had a Surge for three years which I really liked but I had to replace it when the wristband broke. The Versa is more versatile and has better graphics but it is incredibly inaccurate. I wore the Surge and Versa together and the Versa is too sensitive (also counts a lot of steps while driving in a car - which the Surge didn't do) and the sensor for the stairwell is way too sensitive.<br/><br/>Update: Wristband cracked after just two months ...
 This is my 4th Fitbit product and each one has gotten better. I love the choices of faces (I currently have Star Trek TNG LCARS face). It offers great features like solid heart tracking, sleep tracking, silent alarms and apps. A worthy upgrade.
 This is my 3rd fitbit watch. I love all the apps, clock faces I will never get bored with this watch!!!
 So far so good. It counts my swim laps accurately. Step count is right on too.
 I had the charge 2 and it was pretty reliable for heart rate and calorie burn count. The versa is always way off. I also use the galaxy s9 health app to compare the heart rate count (the s9 sensors are pretty accurate) and the versa is always to high. dissapointing
 I’ve had this for about a week and love it so far. I used to rock the surge so it’s a definite upgrade. After I got past all the apps and settings I began to use it with ease. The touch screen is great and the standard features are awesome
 I love my Versa and I would have given it 5 stars but the battery life sucks, I have to charge it every day &amp;1/2. Other then that it is great and I am glad I bought it!!!
 Now I own 3 different Fitbits. The Versa, I love. I put 193 song on it and plays with Bluetooth earphones. It should be worn three fingers lengths from the wrist. The Small band was a little tight for me. I tried removing the small band and broke the pin but it came off. I would not get the large band back on.(It kept slipping off) I had to go to the jewelry store and he was able to get the new large band on the watch. I won't be changing the band in future.
 Great form factor. Looks great. Durable. Long lasting battery. It congratulates you on milestones and burning an amount of calories. It also reminds you to get more steps in. It’s a great Smart Watch. I really like it. It also syncs with My Fitness Pal. Provides a good overall view of your activity and helps remind you to move. For someone like me who has a desk job this is great.
 Nice watch.  Like the timer feature, knowing how many steps I am walking a day, tracking my heart beats.  I especially like the notifications feature for incoming calls and text.  I had the Blaze before but I have enjoyed the update features.
 I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it. She has small wrists and this watch fits her well. She wears it all day and even sleeps with it on. She does not shower with it on tho. All in all a good watch/fitness tracker.
 My first Fitbit was the Alta ( first generation), and I liked that but was missing out on some features that the others offered. I was excited to hear this one came out, great price and had everything I was looking for. Heart rate, and swim proof Text notifications etc. But this does even More! I like that I can have music on it, I don’t need to carry my phone with me at the gym. I even can have my gym membership card on it thru the barcode app. It’s comfortable to wear and is not bulky on my wrist. I am on my 4th day now wearing it now and battery life is at 42%.  If you are looking for a fitness tracker/smartwatch for a reasonable price I highly recommend the Versa
 Battery life was horrible. I wasn't even using the fitbit to its full capacity, just using it to calculate my steps. The battery last 24 hours' if that. Highly disappointed. I really wanted to love it, but it just was not a good product at all. Don't waste your money on this...
 Love that it is lightweight and does most of the things a smart watch does. Yet, your still using a Fitbit!<br/>Con one watch face you have to buy them if you want to change them to something else.
 Loving it so far... Only issue I'm having is that it's not as easy as previous models to change out the wristband...
 I purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day.  The screen stopped working in September.  She was provided a replacement and again, the screen just stopped working.  The backlight would glow, but no images on screen.  And, in their infinite wisdom, support asked  (both times) to go into the settings menu to restart the Versa.<br/><br/>Um, the screen isn't working??? Can't really navigate into settings so well.
 Easy to set up. Much more granular data and many more features than my Surge. I’m just learning to use it so my rating may improve with time. For example, it stopped tracking a workout yesterday before I was through. Not sure why, could easily have been me.
 I love *mostly* everything!<br/><br/>The steps are kind of off though being I hold my 6 month old a lot and just bouncing him or moving him around in front of me tracks as steps lol.<br/><br/>Also, it's really wide so it shifts and hurts my wrist a little bit.<br/><br/>But overall I like all the apps and use it daily, so nothing super bad. I'd purchase it again for sure!
 Love the waterproof Versa. So nice to wear without worry. Enjoy the different clock face options.
 The only thing that kinda annoys me is that the steps, calories counter is way off. You would think that a device this expensive would be more accurate sm. But the over all look and fit is perfect
 Love it so far. Some apps crash like the water but good so far
 Had to return. Looks feminine for a man. Had to switch to iconic even though it is also not the perfect one but looks better
 This Versa is a Ok product. But if you are looking for heart beat monitoring during workouts, this is not for you. It gives very random readings once the heart beats exceed 100 BPM. I tested my Versa unit against two pulse Oximeters and to my dismay, Versa records very random readings. for example while the Oximeters read 105 BPM, Versa will show 165 BPM.
 This watch is great. It has everything that I need from a smart watch without the price tag that you see for other watches. I get my phone call, voicemail and text notifications. It monitors my heart rate and how well I sleep. It has alarms and fitness work out plans. It’s a pretty amazing watch. There’s so much more that you can do with it, especially with the app on your phone.
 Works well.  I was looking for a smart watch that was reliable.  I had the Charge 2 previously and loved it,  but wanted more of the smart watch features.  The Versa fits that need.
 My dislike is that I cannot get my versa to sync or talk to my fitbit application. It keeps giving me errors and won't sync. I have removed it from my Bluetooth device list, changed the dongle to a different port and still won't connect or sync. Now it doesn't even see it. Can I exchange it for another NEW one?
 While I was reluctant to order, I am glad I did. I have had watch for a month and am very happy with purchase. Not sure why they call it "special edition"
 the Fitbit Versa is very comfortable and the features are great.  it is easy to use and the battery lasts for a few days (so awesome).  i've tracked walks, swimming, treadmill, random exercise,etc.
 Amazing! My blaze started to die sadly, I love having fitbits, so life without one was a no go. For my birthday I got the blaze and it was amazing.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>It’s August 1st and the hr feature died today, when the costumer service was contacted. They treated me like and idiot and at the end decided to replace it, but first I have to send mine back and be without it for over two weeks. Whe. I asked to at least get a different color because this is not the color I would have chose for myself, it was a gift. I was refused and pretty much implied it was my fault that it had broken, even though the only thing I did was put it to charge. I’m not happy about being without it for so long. Not pleased. It’s only a couple months old to be malfunctioning already.
 I purchased a Versa online at the end of April 2018 and started wearing it mid-May 2018. After the first week of wear I noticed a few scratches on the screen. I was surprised since this is a fitness tracker and is waterproof. I thought it would be more durable but it seems that the screen scratches with even the slightest touch of another object. I'm a housewife so there is just no reason for it to develop so many scratches so easily. I've never had such an expensive item (which was of course a mothers day gift) look so bad after such a short period of use (or ever really).<br/><br/>I immediately ordered a screen protector and called customer service. I was asked to send photos of the scratches. I couldn't get a clear photo of all of the scratches since it's a reflective black screen and you need light to see the scratches but I got a few. Customer service replied saying the deep scratches were due to cleaning. I then informed them that I'd only used a microfiber cloth to clean the screen so that explanation made no sense. Customer service then replied that it wasn't due to cleaning but wasn't covered by the warranty policy. I was also told that using a screen protector voided all warranty (in a recorded call with a supervisor between 4-5 p.m. CST on 6/8/2018 case #25168898). The supervisor also seemed to know that this is a common complaint as she eluded to them trying to develop a more durable screen. Customer service was a joke (not their fault, I'm sure they're reading from a script). They had all of the available information the first time I called but wasted my time having me send photos, emailing and calling only to eventually be told scratches aren't covered. The only valuable information I received was that screen protectors void the warranty.<br/><br/>I had a Fitbit Charge HR before the Versa and a Flex before that. I wore both for years and neither looked as bad after years of use as the Versa did after 3 weeks. Since I'd never had a Fitbit with a large screen I had no idea how prone to scratches they were and didn't see a warning in reviews. The product manual didn't indicate a problem and Fitbit doesn't sell screen protectors for the device so there was no indication it should be something consumers should worry about. If I had been alerted I would have never bought the Versa or would have purchased a screen protector from another manufacturer before wearing the device (even though it apparently voids the warranty).<br/><br/>As it is, Fitbit doesn't think it's a problem that a $200 fitness tracker is so delicate and after 3 weeks will look like you've been wearing it for years. I would not recommend this product because of horrible customer service policies and and because the product is cheaply made.
 I just upgraded from the charge 2 which I absolutely loved. I have to say this one is amazing.  Sooooo comfortable and the woven band is super comfortable and cute. Love the apps too and everything so far seems to be working perfectly but I am still navigating all the features.  This is my 4th Fitbit and is looking to be my favorite one so far. I haven't used with a workout but will very soon . Great upgrade Fitbit!
 I love it. I love the info it gives about my sleeping patterns and the different ways it motivates me to keep moving.
 Was really cool the first few days. It Would sync info to my phone all day. Did everything as advertised. Now I've had it 10 days. Might Sync once a day. After resetting Bluetooth several times and manually refreshing usually takes many tries and can't seem to get any support from the company. After a quick internet search it seems like a lot of people are having the same issue... I think I will return this faulty product.
 What I love best about this is that is it water proof! I have never been interested in buying a  smart watch because I would never need it for anything more than it's fitness feature. The Versa is the next best thing.
 LOVE this fitbit! I did not want an apple watch, just wanted it for fitness. It's nice because you still get notifications for incoming texts or call but it's not like wearing your phone on your wrist. This is perfect if you are looking for calories burned, steps taken and hear rate monitoring
 So far I'm very satisfied with the watch..  I believe counter is a little off due to my arm not being in motion when pushing shopping carts.  The pedometers I've worn on my ankles registered a higher step count; but is much better then the Samsung fitness app.
 Love this watch. No changing from Blaze to water resistant tracker anymore. Works great. Only drawback so far is that, like most of my previous trackers, it gets to where it doesn't want to automatically sync. You have to work with it to get the app to find it. Hoping they come out with a fix for this. Then would be perfect.
 My favorite Fitbit so far. Light weight and intuitive to use. The strap is annoying to change.
 I love it. Very comfortable. Love all the data that can be viewed. Only issue is if you want to download music via pandora it’s a paid subscription. I have to figure out how to download music from my computer. Also you can see texts but not respond to them via watch. Otherwise, it’s great
 Disappointed that this fit bits syncing functionality is terrible. It takes me multiple refreshes, restarting my Bluetooth and restarting the app to finally sync. Very frustrated as I have used all my Fitbit devices in the past for lifestyle, so updating data frequently is a must.
 Love my Fitbit Versa! Glad I bought it! Haven't learned all the settings yet but I'm a work in progress with technology @ 72 years of age! LOL
 I have had this product for less than a year, suppose to be waterproof, wet once and no longer, keeps the correct date and time. Will no longer sync. Since I ordered from Amazon I have no return policy. DO NOT PURCHASE!! Very expensive lesson for me to learn. Poor Quality.
 Love the improvement in easy charging and not being afraid of getting wet.  Added 3rd party screen protector glass and I'm much happier than my Blaze I previously had.
 Love it
 I’ve enjoyed my VERSA.  Have only had it a few days. Heart rate tracking is terrific. Have had tech issues regarding music from the app. And I have not bought the wireless headphones yet; so maybe it doesn’t matter
 It works great so far.
 Excellent fitness watch with some smart features..fitbit pay works great. Changing the straps is simple no issues here. Tracking pretty much on target so far.
 I'm glad I paid the extra money for the lavender band. It looks really pretty and I think it's more comfortable than the regular plastic band.
 Used today for 10 minutes.. its showing 21000 steps.. frustrating
 I wish this Fitbit had as much battery life as the Charge 2 but I knew what I was getting when I purchased it. I love the watch faces. I love the look and feel of the device. I haven’t seen any issues yet with it. It auto tracks my workouts, which is BEYOND helpful. I love the notifications. I like that I can go back and look at unread text messages.
 I tried two of the best Android watches and neither would maintain a connection with my iPhone over time. The Versa works perfectly and its dashboard is much easier to use. I loved my Charge 2, but my dog ate it - literally!<br/><br/>Oh, and the battery life on the Android watches is abysmal - barely a day...
 I’m so happy I purchased this Fit Bit over an Apple Watch. Easy to set up and has all the features that I was looking for. So nice that it also alerts every text and phone call that I receive. Definitely a keeper.
 Best Fitbit (and fitness tracker for that matter) I've owned so far. Really good build quality and I'm liking Fitbit's take on the smart watch concept.
 So far the fitbit versa has proved to be outstanding in everyway....
 Girlfriend loves her Versa, and I love my Ionic. I need the standalone GPS in case I go running without my phone. Girlfriend is amazed how well the female menstrual cycle tracker works. Sleep tracker is also a must
 Great product, the issue is with the charger. It does not come with a box to plug it into and the device is very finnicky for what it's plugged into. Multiple outlets with multiple boxes have been unsuccessful charging it, I've had success plugging the cord into my macbook
 I love the versa. I waited a long time to purchase a Fitbit/smartwatch and after researching I found the versa. I am so happy. It does everything as far as any of the fitness watches or smart watches are capable of right now and cost is super competive. Def worth it, esp if you are like me and looking for that extra 10% to add to your workout routine :)
 Liked it at first but now Bluetooth and Wi-fi won't stay connected. The heart rate monitor won't work. Pandora app won't play because Bluetooth won't stay connected. Just very aggravated with the whole thing. Tired of messing with it.
 Love this watch. All of fitbit versa functionality with a beautiful purple band and rose gold face. Easy to use. I get compliments on this watch all the time. Its technology at my fingertips while still being feminine and dainty looking.  Love it!!
 Practocally Useless. Even with cheaper price tag, it has got nothing on Apple watch series 1
 I do love this thing. I like that you can log different types of workouts. I like that it motivates you to keep moving. Love that I can put music on it and that I can swim with it. The one thing I didn't like is that while it comes with the charging cord it doesn't come with the block plug part, you think for that price it would be included.
 I love this watch.<br/>I initially started off in the Fitbit family with an Alta a few years ago, but due the lack of waterproofing then, I moved to the Garmin family. I saw the Versa and knew I wanted to transition back! And I couldn’t be happier!!! Waterproof, stylish, interchanging bands. Integrated apps are pretty good. Overall, would buy it agai !
 Very stylish and light weight watch. I had a Fitbit Surge before and it had issues with the straps. Fortunately they addressed this issue in their newer models by decoupling GPS antenna from the straps. I like the way you can change the watch faces to show stats on primary display at glance. Also hourly step goals reminder are nice. It reminds me to get up from my chair.
 Love it works great easy to connect I only use it for notifications though lol and I take it in the pool and shower
 Works fine but it won’t monitor my HR on my wrist with the tattoos... which is a big disappointment so I have to wear it on my opposite wrist which is uncomfortable. And it doesn’t always give me my notifications.
 I love my new fitbit Versa!<br/><br/>Update: Taking off a star because the screen scuff pretty easy. I've only worn my Versa one day and it already has scratches just from my blouse rubbing against it. Bummer :(<br/><br/>Im ordering a screen protector for next day delivery before the screen is completely dull.
 I can not review this item as it is a Christmas gift and has not been opened yet
 Not too happy with this Fitbit Versa special edition at this time. The instructions  says it should stay charged for 4 days the battery is lasting barely 2 days and is being used basically. I may be sending it back.
 This is a quality product with many features. It is able to connect to both iPhone and android phones. I love its versatility and functionality. Would highly recommend to anyone with any fitness goals.
 Over priced, under performing. Research carefully before you buy. I'm very dissatisfied with it. I'll update with more details later. Mine is basically an expensive plastic watch that has to be charged, not much good for anything else.
 great software update.
 If you are looking for ability to use fitbit wallet you are in for a big surprize - only special addition has that option. Disappointed. Otherwise could be a great alternative to apple competitors. Mine is going back! Period!
 Fitbit app would not recognize it. Spent entire day trying to get it to work
 Great fitbit for all around use. Switch out the bands easily for casual or work use. Keeps a good charge.
 Displays a ridiculous number of steps.  Not reliable in that way at all.  Makes me doubt everything else it records.  Took forever to get set up.  Way more than the half hour they say to allow.  Expected better.  😔
 Helps motivate me to move, I like getting notifications from text and incoming calls. Makes you feel like you have accomplished something to achieve your goals.<br/><br/>I am using it with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.
 Amazing! I had the blaze before and this is such a huge upgrade! I love that you can track everything you need on one screen when you’re working out, unlike the Blaze where I had to flip through screens to tell me work out stats. Much lighter and sleeker- people always ask me if I have an I-Watch. Great product!
 My 16 year old daughter loves this watch. She is on the Highschool swim team and loves keeping track of her exercise.
 This fit bit is not what they said, it counts steps when driving, I returned this product because it is totally useless. It may be good for the person who never drives or rides in a bumpy car.<br/>It's probably good for people who work from home and shop from home and who have no means of modern day travel.<br/>If you use modern day travel do not buy this product it will not be accurate.
 Got the versa after I cracked the screen on my blaze 2. Love the whole Fitbit line. The versa has all kinds of awesome features, my favorite being its water resistance and the ability to download apps like pandora, and answering or declining calls. It’s great.
 I have had my Versa for a little over a month.  The battery is so bad it won’t even last 8 hours without going completely drained.  Yes, I’m getting another replacement one since it is under warranty, however is the same issue going to happen and they keep sending me new ones until the warranty is out and I’m stuck having to purchase a new one?<br/><br/>When it did work.  I loved it.  Everything I wanted to track things.
 I love my Versa! I upgraded from the Charge HR. I love the relax mode, and seeing the stats in real time helps me reach my goals.<br/>My only complaint was that i didn’t realize I had to have the paid Pandora membership to utilize the music.
 Would not track sleep at all.  Looked online and saw numerous complaints about the same.  Had a Charge2 that has had no problems in two years.  Sent back for refund without difficulty
 The watch itself is in perfect working order. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I didn’t read the small print about making purchases with it. I got the regular versa not the special edition, and only the special edition comes with the NFC chip to make purchases from your watch. I was so excited for that tech and am let down that I got the wrong one.
 Totally awesome! You can choose from nearly 100 different screens. I had a blaze for over a year and loved it. So glad I upgraded.
 I like the look and features!! Just wish I could figure out how to work it correctly!!
 This thing is awesome. Love the app for iOS and Windows. Only been using it a few days but have fallen in love with the features.
 LOVE MY VERSA! A little bulky in size but it weighs next to nothing. Comfortable to wear 24-7. Would choose it again if I had to choose it all over again.
 This is my first review.  If you are looking to purchase the versa for purposes of tracking your heart rate I am just letting you know it is dramaticlly inaccurate.  I have monitored my heart rate with my chest strap and work out machines and there have been times where my heart rate was approximately off by 20 heart beats on my versa.  It has also counted steps inaccurately as well.  The other features are decent.
 So far I absolutely love it.  Bought a cheap version that broke after less than a month.  So glad I upgraded to the fitbit
 About a month after I receive it I had it on doing a shower the BPM it stop tracking my steps. This a waste of your money<br/>i do not wear.I will not buy another one bad
 I have had one since September and bought this one for my husband. It has helped me track my calorie intake as well as my workouts. This is a very useful tool in living a healthy lifestyle.
 Battery life is excellent!  I'm getting 4 days with constant notifications,  heart rate, phone calls,  steps etc.  I've tried the gear 2, tic watch pro, and the Apple 2...my biggest complaint was the battery life.  For $189 I'm very happy!
 I ordered one for Christmas, loved it so much I ordered my husband one for Valentine's Day!  I highly recommend the Versa I love how it's helping me stay on track with my goals and I love the app.
 Was a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He loves it however we are unable<br/>To get to get texts messages to appear on it... :-/ And that’s a bummer. :( Fabulous product otherwise.
 I was really disappointed in this Fitbit. It consistently counted steps while sitting and driving. I did multiple resets and it still didn't work right. For $200 I expected better quality. This will be the last Fitbit I'll ever buy.
 Loved the watch so much, I ended up getting one for 3 of my grown "kids" for their birthdays, and they love them
 Versa has exceeded my expectation. I love the simplicity of the operation system and its minimalist feel haha :D<br/>the battery life seems to last forever. Most importantly, you can use it with both android and iOS.
 Best fitbit so far. Love it. Great for my hikes and swims. I didn't like the band it came with so I bought a few different ones.
 Was an early birthday gift for my husband. some features are not very functional, but overall nice product and it looks good on him. He wears it every day. I hope he will move more and start to run and cycle again.
 Not sure if I will keep this. Syncing with my Samsung 9+ is a nightmare. Works sporadically and I find myself constantly having to reset the Fitbit, the app, Bluetooth......just is so annoying.
 It keeps me motivated!  It’s a wGch and more.  I meet my 10,000 steps easily. IlThe battery life is awesome!
 UPDATE- touch screen functionality has stopped working 😔. Help ticket opened...<br/><br/>Love it!  Wish I had gotten the special edition though so I could connect it to "apple pay" type feature
 Brought it as an xmas gift, works great and he loves it
 Why was the credit put in a 'gift card'?  I requested that the credit be applied to the original credit card that I used for the purchase.  I'm NOT happy with this situation.
 Love it.  So easy to set u.  In the app you can choose from many styles for your clock face preference!
 So far only complaint is battery life. Seems to run down quickly.  I loved my Blaze but lost it. Good features.
 In the short time I have had this I love it, tho not the colour of the strap, so bought an aftermarket one.  Love the Rose colour and glad I bought this one, as struggled to decide.
 I love it! I know there is a more current model, but I can't imagine needing anything more. I don't especially like the band the watch came with, so I found one that wasn't plastic, but I do like this color a lot.
 It was probably defective because I worked several hours trying everything but could never even get the  home screen<br/>to come up.  Got frustrated and sent it back and will not try ordering another one.
 Product is ok. I can’t find a good face that shows time, full date, Steps, battery and temperature.<br/>I purchased the silver gray one and I got a BABY BLUE band. Annoying.<br/>I keep reading reviews about step count and heart rate not being accurate.. will update
 Love the watch. Hate that it had many issues. Doesn't sync all the time and battery life isnt as good as it claims
 I don’t have problem with this watch though I returned it because it doesn’t monitor blood pressure. I later received a message that the refund was completed but it didn’t reflect on my account yet.
 Only had fitbit for 4 months and the buttons stopped working.
 My daughter loves it! Looks great!
 This is a wonderful fitness smart watch, and at a decent price too! It's not as fancy as an Apple Watch of course, but it is still very good for my purposes. Wonderful buy!
 Fits well to lifestyle
 Much easier to set up a connection to android than the Charge HR model.  Just followed connection instructions.  Time, stats etc easier to read.  The charging hardware appears more reliable.
 It gives me everything I needed. A good fitness tracker, ability to see all the notifications I need from my phone, and fulfills my desire to not have my phone on me at all times. Also you can add your Starbucks card to this one without without having the special addition. Worth it and I saved $30.
 My wife loves it so far. I'll give a more detailed review later as we get further into the setup.
 Have had no issues and the gray/silver looks so nice with everything. Got it to give as a gift and now after seeing it, testing it out I'm considering an upgrade from my Fitbit Flex 2.
 Love the step counter the most.<br/>I am disappointed that I have to pay $12.99/month to upgrade to Pandora Premium to listen
 I love my new Fitbit. I was a little apprehensive about the band getting dirty like the previous fitbit bands but this one is made with better material and it's such a beautiful pop of color with my outfits. I highly recommend.
 Very nce product. I had to get another since my first one would not sync. I had no problem getting my replacement. This one works just fine and really like it now.
 This is by far the worst device I have ever owned.  I purchased it about a month ago and am (THANK YOU AMAZON) returning it today.  Previously I had the Charge 2.  I decided to upgrade after shattering my Charge 2 screen.  I was looking forward to enhanced work out analytics as well as being able to receive text messages, notifications, etc.  As soon as I connected the Versa to my Samsung Galaxy S8 I noticed that my phone battery was draining very quickly and my phone was hot.  I contacted FitBit and went through some trouble shooting.  I could not keep the device synced with my phone.  If I did a sync I then had to go into Apps and do a force stop.  I have contacted FitBit about 6 times in the month that I have had this device.  Needless to say I was not able to use this device to receive texts, etc.  Last night the screen on the FitBit went BLACK and after a factory reset the device still remains black.  I contacted FitBit this morning and they offered to let me exchange for a new versa (would you like to trade your lemon in for another lemon? Um, no.).  This was after we spent ANOTHER 15 minutes trouble shooting the issue.  I politely explained that I did not want a new device.  They offered me a refurbished Charge 2 (seems like a fair swap, right?  Like when your brother breaks the cookie in half and takes the bigger piece).  I contacted Amazon and explained the issues.  They IMMEDIATELY offered a return!  This device is junk.
 Loving it!  Especially love that it's water proof, and more comfy than my old Charge HR (1st gen). Battery lasts a good amount of time and sync works better, even with my old android phone. Enjoying the apps and clock faces as a bonus.
 I really wanted to love this Fitbit.  It's absolutely beautiful -- I ordered it in the rose gold and lavender and it was well worth the upgrade. It felt good on the wrist, too, with a more comfortable band than my Charge HR, and even though it was larger and I was concerned about that, it didn't feel or look unreasonably bulky once on.  I loved the fact that it's waterproof, also -- that's one of the features that most inspired me to buy it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I just could not get it to work reasonably.  I was replacing my Charge HR because the band bubbled and broke after less than 4 months (and since it was a warranty replacement for the previous Charge HR, which did the same thing, Fitbit wouldn't replace it again.)  The Versa looked like a terrific alternative but it just wouldn't work half as well as the Charge HR.  The first problem was that the bluetooth connectivity was awful. Sometimes it would only connect once a day, sometimes even less.  Any time I tried to change a watch face or add an app, it would tell me it couldn't locate the Versa, and to please make sure that it was turned on and nearby -- this while I was holding my fully charged phone in the same hand that was wearing the fully charged Versa!  Sometimes it lost steps; for instance, I would look at my wrist and see that I had 7k steps or so, and then look at it an hour later and it'd say I had 1k, which made no sense at all.  Rarely would it actually connect to the internet so that I could actually have my data showing up on the scoreboard with family, which is the main reason I have a Fitbit instead of another brand. Also, the heartrate was wildly inaccurate -- it consistently reported a resting heart rate 30-40 beats above my normal, and even the most slight of exercise, like simply walking across a room to get a drink, always registered at 150+ bpm.  I tried every troubleshooting suggestion offered but nothing solved the persistent issues.  And just for good measure, I am concerned about durability issues as well, because the band started fraying when I had only worn it for a week.<br/><br/>After 3 weeks of trying to get it to work, I gave up and decided to send it back.  I found a replacement band kit for my supposedly non-replaceable-band Charge HR, and put a new band on in a tiny fraction of the time I had invested trying to get the Versa to work.  It's not waterproof, but it's functional, which is a huge improvement over the Versa.  Fortunately Amazon has a terrific return policy and and gave me absolutely 0 hassle about sending it back -- I was very glad I hadn't ordered directly from Fitbit, as I had considered doing, because during the troubleshooting process I discovered that a) I am far from alone in the problems I was experiencing and b) Fitbit made returns/exchanges very difficult.<br/><br/>I wish Fitbit would put half as much effort into quality control as into external design and snazzy marketing.
 Love the technology and larger face
 I have only had it a couple months and it is broken. Doesnt track HR anymore and the greenlight doesnt come on. Of course, 3 weeks past my return date!!!!I  have tried all the suggestions 3x at least.
 Love this watch.  I really wish they had more free faces on the app but I use the “layers” one and it looks great too.  This watch has been quite motivational as well.
 I love everything about my Fitbit Versa. The fitness tracker smart watch combo awesome!! It tracks my steps, workouts, sleep, water intake, calories burned, floors climbed, distance, weight loss and even has female health tracking. This was my mommy present to myself after giving birth to my 6th and last baby in June! Highly recommend!!
 I love the fit bit versa I used to work out mostly every day great to have  It’s a great watch as well
 Love, love, love! I wish I could receive text messages,  but other than that it is amazing.
 Does everything it says.  Love that I can wear it swimming in the pool or ocean.
 This watch is awesome! I recently upgraded from the Fitbit blaze, I'm pretty slow on having the latest tech haha I only upgraded because I washed my blaze in the laundry. This version is slightly smaller in size which I like. It has a ton of new things and its waterproof If you wanna leave it in your pocket to go through the wash!
 I got as a gift for my wife after a cheaper alternative turned out to be garbage. She likes it. you can customize the watch face and it tracks steps, sleep, heart rate, etc.
 I absolutely love the Fitbit Versa!! It’s a great looking smart watch and tracks everything I need and then some!
 Love it, fast shipment!
 Great watch. Has alot of exercise information and messages and other info on it
 I am very happy with my Fitbit so far although I will say I agree with other reviewers who had mentioned they had a harder time setting up the Versa compared to other Fitbit.
 Love my new Fitbit Versa!! Have been wanting a fitness tracker that works with android since iWatch was not compatible plus to pricey. Was surprised all the functions the Versa has. Very pleased with my purchase!! Can't beat the price, affordable!!
 I wish I would have gotten it sooner! Everything syncs with my Samsung Galaxy 8+ and works flawlessly. I synced wireless ear buds to it and get crystal clear music. I am so impressed!!! Wouldn't trade it!
 I love this watch , just as description, get 4 days out of Charge, like reminder every hour to step , love my face withgrowing flower as I move to full bloom when my day is done ....this watch is perfect ....I love it
 I bought this for my husband to help track his sleep and his movement (as a boss he hasn't moved as much in the last few years and the lack of exercise has caught up with him) works exactly as intended, easily syncs with his smart phone. He like that he can customize it.
 Love,love, love it!!! I still need to learn all of the advanced touches this one has!
 I love this Fitbit , Versa! I lost my Fitbit Alta Rafting down the Colorado river. I enjoy all this Versa has to offer. I would definitely buy it again
 Love it. I had the ionic but it was too bulky. The screen on the ionic was a little bit better but again also bulky. I'm happy with my versa, it's lightweight, perfect and looks beautiful.
 I LOVE this thing, I only wish I could figure out how on earth to respond to text from it! I know somewhere within the app and they are pre selected, just unsure how and where within the app. With time, as I just received it on Tuesday this week and haven't had much time to play with it. Alas, great product, great purchase, I am highly satisfied with this purchase and have had no issues so far.
 Its a Nicer watch than its previous model by Fitbit. The battery finishes faster than Charge 2 due to its smart notifications from Apps and having a color display May be. Also if listen music it drains the battery faster. But sometimes it doesn’t have quite a good connection with IPhone for its call and SMS notifications. It doesn’t stay connected always with the phone. Which was much better connection with a Charge 2 range. May be they can fix it soon. But the Watch doesn’t notify often about the calls and message’s. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.
 It's a great tracker! I love that it keeps track of everything for me! I can compare weeks to weeks and make sure that I am getting the steps that I need to!
 The Ionic I had before this burned my wrist... returned the Ionic for the Versa and have been in love ever since.
 It's defective.  Only 3 months and it's already white screened out on me!  Don't buy this!
 I recently started working out on a more regular basis and this item has been great. I also use the timer for other things such as timing for work and it has been greatly helpful in that sense as well.
 Like Most, the size. Least, being able to get to the screen with the time on it, easily. Over time, I'll see if I like it as well as my Blaze. This is my 3rd Fitbit. Love the Fitbit products, brand.
 Breaks like a china doll and isn’t able to be repaired. The screen protectors are awful so you’re pretty much stuck with a bare screen that’s just a matter of time before it cracks.
 I decided to upgrade from my charge2 because I was swimming etc. The versa miscounts steps, fails to give me all notifications and doesnt quite feel as secure as the charge. Im affraid it will fall off during heavy activity. I like the music feature but miscounting steps is a pain. Thats the easiest part of a fitness tracker but versa is missing the beat.
 Absolutely luv luv luv this Fitbit.  So easy to understand and so much fun to exercise with.  Link it to my fitpal app to keep track of all your nutriants, calories, carbs, exercise etc. Amazing.
 I first thought the frame was plastic because it was so light, but its actually aerospace grade aluminum. I really love it. I upgraded from the fitbit charge 2.
 Not an Apple Watch but does a great job at being a Fitbit tracker!
 I love my fitbit versa, the options for the clock face...has time with second hand, temp outside, shows battery kennel at all times along with steps &amp; heart rate
 This is my first Smartwatch/fitness tracker.  I love it!  It's pretty, comfortable and useful.  It took awhile to change the strap the first time I did it, but once you get the hang of it, it's no problem at all.
 No dislikes about it. Its perfect for someone who is trying to stay in shape and fun for someone who is trying to get into shape. Great for striving to have a healthier lifestyle.
 Love that it’s waterproof.  Hate that I need WiFi to synchronize.  This is horrible if you travel and need to reset the time on your watch...because you can’t instantaneously set it.
 Best fitbit so far! Waterproof - easy to wear and use. It doesn't always sync with my phone - sometimes takes it a while to connect. Easy to put music on and use with my Bluetooth headphones.
 This is soooo much better than the other brand I had!! Works amazingly!!!
 love the watch, but the band is ugly and definitely not worth the extra $30
 This new Fitbit has all the bells and whistles and looks really nice, too.  Received quickly and everything is just as advertised.  Would recommend to anyone.
 Love it. Battery (so far) lasts 4 days between charges. Only thing I wish is you didn't have to pay for Pandora to work on it but otherwise very happy with it
 I like it. I wish it had more capabilities but it works good for me.
 LOVE IT! Just wanted I wanted, and much cheaper than the Apple Watch!
 I got this for my mother she has a charge 2 and she really enjoyed it. So I got her this she wears it every single day and loves it.
 The Fitbit Versa is a wonderful instrument to keep up with your exercise activities. I use it every day and it keeps me motivated.
 Love my new Versa!  It has to be charged more often than my Alta, but the extra features make up for this!  Got a screen protector and 3-pack of other wrist bands as I want my Versa to go with me everywhere!
 Much easier to use and more functional than my previous Charge HR
 This watch gives me a rash. I’ve followed all the instructions from Fitbit (removing it periodically to let your skin breathe, frequent cleaning) but my wrist is covered in a red, angry rash. Other than that, it works well.
 Difficulty connecting to huawei honor 7 x, then when it did connect, it lost sync in about a day. A search in forums confirms the experience is common. High price for this plastic watch.
 Good
 I bought this to replace my older fitbit.  I am very happy with the purchase.  It looks nice and shows me lots of information on the face of the versa.  Very happy with the purchase.
 After having issues with my fitbit syncing with my Samsung note 8, I just learned that the app is currently not tested and approved on that phone. So that is why mine has on been connecting since I received it. Wish I would have know that it doesn't work on all android devices :(
 So far So Awesome, encourages you to get up and get going
 The watch stopped working after one week of using it. Also, when I was working out, the button to pause a workout was hit continuously because of its placement on the watch.
 great fit bit.  Perhaps this will be the first fit bit I've owned that doesn't fall apart at the band!
 The Versa bands are so bad to change, this rudimentary tabs to hook and pull are the worst.<br/>There are much better ways to solve this, as in the Fitbit Blaze or Apple Watch, but they didn't learn.
 Like it a lot for my Apple phone.
 Breeze to set up. Nice look and waterproof. Durability continues to be an issue with Fitbit products. Therefore I did purchase the protection plan. Hope this will last more than two years.
 Loving so far! It is so light weight! I can barely tell it’s there. It is very easy to use. I have gone running, done the dishes, and bathed my dogs with this watch on and no problems! Very thankful!
 Beautiful, sleek and comfortable. I am so happy with this, I used to own a fitbit blaze, this is so much less bulky and more feminine looking. I absolutely love it
 I love being reminded to be more active, the sleep report and the notifications from my emails, calls, and tact messages.
 I had a Blaze before my current Versa. The Versa is so much more flexible, easier to maneuver, and more readable then my Blaze. Also the battery seems to last longer.
 Love the fit, no instructions which sucks. Still trying to figure out all the bells and whistles. But overall happy with it the quality
 Wife loves it..
 Wiuld give it 5 stars but was missing half a band.
 Love this watch absolutely amazing. Still trying to learn how to do everything on it. So far everything has been petty staight forward.
 I am having a real problem with the wrist band -- it has come loose several times. I thought i lost it twicw but found it before anyone else does -  THE DESIGN TO INSTALL WRIST BAND  IS HORRIBLE
 I absolutely love mine. Works pretty much all the time and doesn’t hurt my wrist. Super happy with my purchase.
 Upgraded from the Charge 2 and I love it so far. I just reccomend being mindful of the third part watch faces you can use as some can really tank the battery life. One killed my fully charged Versa just overnight.
 after 2.5 Month, the battery will not charge, cleaned contacts, used two different chargers, and battery will not hold charge at all. as soon as it is removed from charging base, it will turn off completely.
 Didn’t care for the purple band that came with the special edition of the Versa.  It looked bad after a couple of weeks... I was not able to even install the black silicone band that also came with the Versa.  I have since ordered others bands that were easy to install.
 First Fitbit I have ever purchased and I am absolutely happy about my purchase.
 I absolutely love this Fitbit! It holds a charge for a long time, and it’s super fast to charge! I love the features, I hope it lasts a long time!
 love it more options then past fitbit
 My daughter absolutely loves this watch. She is an active 13 year old and this watch has kept up with her for the last 6 months or so
 Its waterproof, solid fitness tracker &amp; though fitbit is a couple years behind apple in the smartwatch department. They will catch up!
 Was for my wife, she loves it, looks good on her.
 I love this smartwatch! Does everything I need it to do, would like Spotify compatibility, which is why a star is subtracted.
 Had to return couple weeks after using. It was not charging anymore...<br/>I liked the watch but it doesn't last...
 I've owned more than a few and this is the best one so far. Love all the features, just wish we could make custom responses like the apple watch instead of quick replies.
 I upgraded to the versa from a charge 2 and I am so happy i did! I feel its so much more detailed and accurate!
 This is a great watch.  My wife loves this watch.  She tried the Apple watch which was defective and bought this instead.
 Excellent product, good price and fast shipping. thx.
 Great appearance. Light weight. Does NOT disappoint.  Excited about this. Still trying to figure out the notifications.
 Great product. Really useful for workout and steps. I love the interchangeable bands.
 Horribly inaccurate!!! I upgraded from an HR, big mistake. This watch is very inaccurate, I've been testing it for a month, says I walked up 24 flights of stairs, I did not climb even one flight, no inclines...nothing. It's a decent looking watch, but is extremely slow, even raising your hand to check the time is slower than the HR. If you're on the fence about upgrading....take my advice and wait for something better. This one is going back. Do your research before buying.....wished I would have waited.
 My battery no longer holds a charge for more than 24hrs.  It charges over night 100% in the morning around 7am and by 10pm in the evening it is 15% or lower and getting worse  . I thought it should last 3 full days .
 Bought it as a christmas present for my wife. It was the best value feature wise.  Elegant and practical. Mi wife loved it! Definitely earned a hallpass with this one!
 Husband loves it. Works well...looks good. Charge doesn't hold as long as a Garmin. Has a lot of extra fun features.
 Good watch. I prefer the iconic band remove/install process over the versa clip/tab
 So far so good, only have had for a week.
 Didn't charge at all.<br/>Had to return. I wish it was ok, but how can I manage if it doesn't charge at all? Sorry fitbit
 I like it, but the biggest downfall is it will not connect to Apple Music the same way the blaze did. It will only a download purchased songs, so if you pay for Apple Music - no songs or playlists will play. One of my favorite functions of the blaze; I was super disappointed.
 Great tech, band for frayed (no idea how to spell that) very quickly which pets my peeve as essential you pay more for the band that frays
 Love this fitbit.  I especially like the sleep tracker and check it every day.  It also keeps me moving when I haven't done 250 steps in an hour.  I'll get up and walk just to score that hour.  Used it for the first time today to track exercise.  It showed my highest bpm, calories burned, length of workout.  Haven't used the food and water tracker.
 Bought for my husband for anniversary, returned it thought cause he couldn't get audiobooks on it
 Gift recipient was not able to make it work, and she knows what she's doing... tried everything.  Now the return window has closed... we are out $200???
 That you don’t have to worry if it gets wet
 Love it, light weight and the new figures are fabulous. This is a must have, if you want a good fitness app ❤️💪🏽
 glad to have a fitbit again. this one does everything i wanted and is holding up rather well to my work life.
 Love the look. Especially the clock face I found. I'm on the go a lot &amp; sometimes forget what day of the week it is.  The only thing I'm having trouble with is getting it to recognize walking vs exercise.
 My other Fitbit was shot, great upgrade! Love it, motivates me!
 Bought this for my son.he loves it!
 I love the style of the Versa Special Edition Lavender. It’s both pretty and feminine. I was disappointed in the lack of strength on the gorilla glass. The glass scratches easily and I would advise placing a screen protector over it.
 Does what it’s supposed to. Problems syching with wifi and coosing a clockface that worked for me. Also, I do some workouts that it seems to have trouble recognizing.
 I got this as a gift. First I purchased a Apple Watch. But he wanted to stick with Fitbit. So I purchased him the Vera and he’s Quite Happy!
 Love the number of watch faces you can choose from!  Small form factor fits well as is less bulky than my last Fitbit watch.
 Beautiful smart watch that I got for my wife to track her running. She’s very happy with the functionality and the look. It does not scream fitness tracker - it’s more of an Apple Watch contender.
 I love this watch, it is so customizable, comfortable. Does so many cool things and has great battery life
 Very lightweight. Has many functions.
 Love it!  It took a while to get it to sync, but after speaking with customer support 3 times, I was able to get it to sync with my Motorola phone.  That's why four stars and not five!
 Cute &amp; easy to personalize.  Works well &amp; holds charge.  Won’t let me upgrade &amp; sync Pandora is only downfall
 This has so many features, the online community is amazing.  Everyone interested in motivating each other to be their best selves through diet, exercise &amp; healthy living.  Many are losing weight from the challenges including me! LOVE IT!!!
 This is seriously one of the best smart fitness monitor out there  very helpful and accurate really love it and the price is great!
 I got one for my wife and she loves it, so I had to get one for myself. So far it works perfect and I use it everyday. Thanks again.
 I've had it for 3 days, and it has already motivated me to be more active.  Love it.
 Didn't last 4 months. Takes a while to sync and sometimes didn't sync at all. I've had several Fitbits and this one has been the worst.
 I love this watch. I wish there was more responses I could text back but at least it has that option
 Love my Versa. Not too big and bulky. Having trouble connecting to WiFi but everything else is great
 Great product. Loved the style
 Product works well and as described. I like this updated version of the Fitbit, very nice display and easy to use.
 My old Fitbit Blaze died, since batteries cannot be replaced.  My new Versa seems fine, and I like that I can swim with it.  I shall check back ever 3 months.
 Cool
 Came quickly and as advertised...has a lot of cool features if you’re trying to keep track of fitness.
 Love the watch but hate how difficult it is to replace the bands!!  I like having a variety of bands but want to pull my hair out every time I change them.
 I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He had been wearing a Fitbit and a wrist watch.
 I love my versa however I wish It was compatible with my Nike run app that's the only reason why I am giving it a 4 star
 This watch died after 3.5 months of use. FitBit customer service was not helpful. They didn’t listen to the problem and had me do useless steps to no avail. I am now waiting for a replacement charger, which will more than likely not fix the dead screen. Should have bought an Apple Watch.
 I'm only giving this item 4 stars as the band broke exactly 1 month after purchase. I immediately called fitbit and a replacement is on the way. Hoping I don't have the same issue with band #2. Other than that I truly enjoy the tracker.
 Love it, great product
 My husband loves it.  Took longer than anticipated to sync everything because he had a different fitbit so all the information was transferred by fitbit to the new watch.  So don't panic, it took over 24 hours, which was okay, and everything is great.
 Fits great, comes with two different sized bands. It's high quality and helping me with my fitness goals.
 I was looking for a trusted smart watch that will fit my needs and this is it. Fitness is apart of my lifestyle so this is great to help me keep track. I have it for three days now and I enjoy it. I look foward to making new fitness goals and reaching them.
 Item came as described and have had no issues with it at all!!! love it! It looks so stylish!
 Was a Christmas gift for the hubs. He is in love! Said best watch ever!! Def recommend
 So far I really love the watch. Haven't had any issues. It's super light weight and I can actually sleep with it on.
 Love this fitbit! Works great.
 do not get this.  adds steps while it sits on the charger - customer support not good.  won't sync to my phone for message alerts, etc.  Was out of town and now my opportunity to return it has passed.  $200 paperweight
 Love it.. absolutely<br/>Motivate me.. totally<br/>Easy to use, accuracy is quite good and really comfortable<br/>4 days charging period but it's vary from my use to your use.
 I have had nothing but issues with this line of fitbit.  It doesn't sync like it should and it shut itself off and lost a whole day of tracking.
 Love the Fitbit Versa
 Love the ease of use, fast charging, clock face options and reminders to move. Also being able to get second charger for travel is great.
 Love the data it captures as far as activity.  Seems durable.  My first one died within a week but Fibit replaced within days.  I think it was just a bad battery.  I have been wearing this one for 3 days now and the battery is still at 51%.  Hopefully the battery issue has been resolved with the replacement.  Other than that its a great watch and value.
 No complaints. It’s everything I wanted
 My wife loved her alta but started having trouble keeping a charge after a few years.  She's loving the upgrade with the added features the Versa offers, well worth the extra cash.
 Really pleased with this product it’s just as described and more. Would purchase again!
 I love inspiration that you get from them I love him so much I got one for my husband to spell thanks Anna LOL
 The steps system works sometimes and doesn't others.  It sometimes counts driving as steps and doesn't reset at times.  Needs to be better for the money
 I love the message and motivational notifications! It is also very easy to set up and use! I wish it were possible to download the music from your iPhone... would be much more user- friendly!
 Works great  no problem
 Ordered my watch 3 weeks ago and loved it. Havent used all features yet but works great. No issues. Charge it every 3 to 4 days.
 This won't work if you don't have a Smart Phone, and it won't work on your Kindle tablet. It was a huge disappointment! I sent it back.
 Purchased as a gift. Appears to be well made and of good quality. Time will tell whether the user finds the functionality to be accurate and useful.
 A bit disappointed. Get it together, Fitbit!! I write that with love. I recently returned my (less than a month old) Ionic because it completely stopped syncing with my phone, out of the blue. I had really high hopes for the Versa, as I've been a Fitbit customer for years and I really love the software. Again, after less than a month's use, my battery lasts about 30 hours. This is advertised as having 4+ days of battery life. After doing a bit of digging, I've discovered that this is a problem lots of users are having. Apparently the "solution" is to turn off all of the apps/functions that make the Versa a smart watch... or to replace it for a unit that has a battery that isn't defective. Extremely disappointed - I wanted to love this, but I find it odd that I've had issues with my two new watches, both less than a month old - and completely different models. Currently contemplating switching to another smartwatch brand, since issues with FitBit seem to be the norm now - disappointed :(
 Absolutely love it!
 Nice watch. Really sturdy, I work on a tug boat with allot of physical labor and the watch has stood up excellent so far. The heart rate monitor seems really accurate and pared with the app it’s a great way to track exercise and daily physical activities.
 This was a birthday gift for wife.  She seems to really love it and uses it a lot. So I'm happy
 I’ve had this for less than 6 months for my versa to stop working. I wish I were suprised but I’ve had fitbit charge it didn’t last a year before the band ripped apart. I also had the blaze and it stopped charging.<br/>FITBITS ARE NOT MADE TO LAST! That’s crazy considering how much they cost.
 Scratches really easily, screen protector is a must..haven't tested if it's water proof and I probably never will.
 At first it was hard for me to get use to it. But now I can't sleep without it
 So far so good! Upgraded from the charge 2 loving the bigger screen and apps! Super bonus it’s lightweight and way more comfortable than my old one. Loving it!
 Had a few fitbits and this one is great. Waterproof and alerts love using it with my wireless headphones to workout. Battery life has been good and changeable watch face is fun
 Love it to track my activity. I can't get the notifications I've " costed" to go away.
 I also have the charge 2. They both have their pros and cons. The versa shows 30 flights of stairs every time I go to work. The charge 2 doesnt do that. The versa does count my steps more accurately.
 I like the size, the different features, such as texts &amp; notifications, as well as the variety of background colors
 GOOD!!
 Loves it!
 I love this watch it does everything that I wanted it to do all in one! Highly recommend
 This thing is so awesome! It has everything I could want in a smart watch.
 i purchased this as a gift for a love one and she absolutely loves it
 My old Fitbit got wet and no longer worked. Got this one because it is supposed to be water resistant. Hopefully this is true. So far so good.
 Bought for my dad and he loves it. As expected it synced easily with his devices and does as expected
 It’s great it helps me keep track of a lot of things. There are some issues with the notifications, even when they are on they don’t show up on my watch.
 I bought this to count laps while I swim and I couldn’t be happier. I saw some posts that it doesn’t work in water but I have not had any issues.
 Works Great.
 So far I love this watch.  I wear it everyday and I don’t really have to charge it often.
 It was a gift. It’s perfect for someone who’s trying to stay healthy
 This Versa watch worked for about a month. Now it will not charge or hold onto a charge. Even after having it on the charger all night sometimes it’s only at 1%-14%. The battery is dead most all the time even after being plugged in.  I’m very disappointed.
 Really wanted an IPhone but didn’t want to pay this price. This was a great alternative.
 Love the color , use it everyday
 Solicite dos productos y solamente llegó uno<br/>A quien me dirijo ?
 I'm a former Pebble user and I also have the Samsung Gear S3 and the Asus Zen watch. I love this Versa, very nice looking, great screen and the battery life seems good (4 + days). I do like the fitness features and the watch does pretty much what I want it to do which is text/call notifications, heart monitor and pedometer. I'll be wearing this over my S3 just because of the battery life. Just be aware, loading songs onto the watch takes a long time!
 I've had several smart watches, and 2 Fitbits (older models). The main reason I stopped wearing my watch and got one of these was the massive improvements to the charger, the intuitive improvements to the app, and the integration of all the data this thing can track.<br/><br/>It helps you track sleep (automatically, unlike most apps on your phone or the old Fitbits) and reminds you when to wind down if you want to achieve your goal. It reminds you to drink water. It even lets you get step by step workouts on your wrist if you have been making excuses about a gym membership!<br/><br/>Overall no, it's not going to make you healthier unless you use it to make yourself healthier. But this will actually prod you, which some of us need, to keep working towards that goal. Be it achieving weight loss, maintaining fitness, or just catching up from a stint of not taking the best care of yourself.<br/><br/>Insane battery life (I wear it all day and put it on the charger while I shower. It has yet to drop below 80%). Massive plus, because it gives me all my text/email notifications without all the extra integration of most smartwatch.
 It does a lot more then I thought it would it the best one so far I would recommend it to anyone who likes the Apple Watch look at about half the price.
 This is my second FitBit and I love it. I upgrade to a sleekly look.
 Works
 Love this watch I'm forever changing the watch face because there are so many to choose from.just cant decide on one. Good battery life .only had it a few weeks ago but so far loving it.
 The Versa works well and feels good on my wrist. It's the first fitness tracker I've owned that has a color display, and I'm very satisfied with it.
 Looks and works great. The heart rate sensor is very accurate and consistant.
 it does everything
 Doesn't count steps properly. Have 200 steps at home, then get into the car to go to work and by the time I get there, I have 6000+ steps. Can't even message the company about it because I don't have or want a Twitter account.
 Bought two of these for wife and my Christmas presents. Wife loves hers. these were upgrades from the charge 2.
 quick delivery. was given as a gift and she loves it.
 Fits. Stylish and got so many compliments for it. Must buy and worth the money.
 Fitbit stepped up their game with a much better step tracker and face/clock format. Battery life is leaps and bounds over previous models!
 Dose not sync with my phone all the time and takes a second for the Bluetooth headphones to connect
 Not a fan. I prefer the Ionic. It's a cuter version of the Ionic is my eyes. I'm so used to having a bigger watch and it feels too dainty to me. Also, the way you change the bands is annoying. It took me a while cause it wouldn't take. Don't think I'll keep this one and instead go back to what I loved.
 no comment is necessary. i returned the same day i received. very disappointed.
 Great product. I decided to upgrade as my charge 3 was dying. So glad I got this!
 Bought this as a gift for my Wife. She wears it all the time. The only issue is she can't get music added to it. It does not want to stay connected to our computers.
 i love the fit bit versa great watch with great features and so convenient i highly recommend it!
 Great as an activity tracker, not exactly what I expected in a smart watch. But I do enjoy it.
 Won't stay connected. Constantly losing Bluetooth connection, so I'm missing notifications all the time.
 Christmas gift for the father in law. We will see if he likes it n
 Nice, big screen, great display and functionality!
 I had the Fitbit Blaze for years but I am petite so it was huge on me. I was excited to try the new Versa and it does not disappoint! It's smaller, lighter and a huge improvement!
 I love it but it does stay charge long at all 1 day
 Useless because every time I work out, it pauses and doesn’t track my workout.
 Easy to use. Comfortable to wear. Can't say enough good things about it.
 Wife loves this - she had the blaze ,and this one blows it out of the water - literally
 Excellent product!  Loved purchasing on Amazon.  There were more choices of band colors then even at Best Buy!!
 The best FitBit yet. This is my third one and I absolutely love it.
 Tells me what to do all of the time. Similiar to wearing a robot that is your mom on your wrist - I aint mad at it.
 Great
 I love that it had several different clock face options and that it is easy to navigate
 I love this watch!
 Fitbit acquired Pebble and I was excited about this watch b/c it’s similar to the Pebble Time.  Overall, the design is incredible.  It’s lighter than an Apple Watch, narrow, and barely noticeable in terms of weight.  Battery life is reasonable.  I usually have 50%+ remaining after a full day when I charge in the AM.  Disappointed in the accuracy of the heart rate monitor compared to the HR Charge 2.  The versa consistently under reports HR during peak activity.  For example, it reported 120 bps during an eliptical session and my actual heart rate was closer to 167.  Fitbit still hasn’t mastered the ability to read HR with perspiration, but this seems like a step back as the HR Charge 2 was more effective (granted, it would just zero out about half the time).  Resting heart rate is also off compared to the Charge 2.  I tried different adjustments on the band form tight to loose, same result.  This seems to be a common issue as others report it in the forums, so beware if you’re purchasing this as a fitness tracker.  Really hoping this is a software issue that will be resolved with an update b/c I love the overall aesthetics of the watch compared to others.<br/><br/>A few other observations:<br/><br/>Apps - The App Store is underwhelming.  I didn’t expect much (or I would have gone with an Apple Watch), but it’s poorly organized and you can’t pay for 3rd party apps through the Fitbit app.  I had to visit a developer site to purchase a clock face.  The app categories are odd and disorganized.  If you’re a news junkie, they only offer NYT and a watered down version of Flipboard that only shows health stories.<br/><br/>Music/Pandora - Poorly designed.  It’s “Pandora” compatible, but only with a few “Fitbit” playlists.  I had to connect the watch to my desktop to access Pandora the first time, but music direct downloads over WiFi (seems unnecessary).  No easy support for podcasts.  The upload process for stored music/playlists in Apple Music is cumbersome.  It requires a desktop and a lot of patience :-). Fitbit really needs to rethink this feature.  It shouldn’t require a desktop.<br/><br/>Excercise - Again, the big killer here is HR inaccuracy.  The HR reading is off, so everything else is off as a result.  Fitbit also pulled the eliptical setting.  It would be nice to see more activities overall.  Again, really hoping this is software not hardware.  The watch is a dud if it’s hardware.<br/><br/>Special Edition - Spring for it.  It comes with 2 bands.  I was worried about the gray band (I’m a man), but I get compliments all the time.  It’s lightweight and it breathes incredibly well.  I still haven’t tried the NFC reader for CC payment.<br/><br/>As a fitness tracker, it’s a fail.  As a watch, it doesn’t compare to the Apple Watch.  Who wants a $225 digital watch that can just tell time?  Holding out for a few more days in hope of an update.
 Worst Fitbit product ever. Inaccurate sleep tracking. No screen replacement if breaks. Poor customer service.
 Doesn’t fit. Wrote much more detailed review on another color. One pin broke the 3rd day.
 I like this new Fitbit the only thing is touch screen sometimes gives problems
 Love it - easy fit, easy to charge and use. I like the various watch faces and that I can customize to my liking.
 World's best watch wear everyday very satisfied with it
 I love the watch but I had to send it off for a replacement not even having it for 2 weeks because the battery wouldn't charge. They are sending me a new one but it's taking forever, this shouldn't be an issue with a $200 device, my $25 device from China( like the Fitbit charge) works better. That's sad.
 Working great, gives good view of activity and sleep.
 Absolutely love it!!!! So glad I didn’t waste money on an Apple Watch. I love that I can track my exercises right from the Versa instead of having to go through the app on my phone.
 Love the functionality of this Fitbit, bought it to replace the Blaze.
 Loovvvveee it😍
 love my Fitbit Versa.  It does everything I need it to do, and it’s adorable.
 I like the weight of the watch.  Also,  the changeable face.
 Like look and feel but have had synching issues that I never had with my alta.
 I love it. It tracks to many steps but that’s expected.
 Great improvement over the Fitbit Charge HR--waterproof, and with many more functions.  And a battery that lasts longer.
 I upgraded from the Blaze, which I loved! On day 3 it's cracked. This will be my last Fitbit if a fitness tracker is this delicate.
 nice product
 Perfect to account for and report my daily activity. Have had various fitness tracking devices before.  This is the best so far.
 Love it for the features and size, but I feel it should be priced closer to $150.
 Second Versa received that has a defective band.  I’m not impressed with this product.  Fitbit states that it needs to be set up and then we can return it to them to be fixed.  This will be the third watch replacement!
 I love this fitbit.  Features are great
 Love the versa..
 Love it! I defiantly recommend. The qaulity is great. It fits perfect. No problems or complications with it. Very accuate results.
 Love it, I just love it!!! love all the settings and functions I just LOVE IT
 First one purchased was faulty.  Replacement has been awesome.  Bought it to swim in.  Love it!!!
 It’s a really great product and works really well on tracking your workouts. Only downside will have to be the battery life isn’t as well as they say. Had to reset my Fitbit because it was dying in one day. But once it was reset started working fine
 Love it! Long lasting battery 5ish days. Bright display. Viberates when I get text and calls.
 Seems like a pretty decent fitness watch, if you use it on its own, but Fitbit made a huge and very notable change with this generation of watches, that has thrown many long term users for a loop.<br/><br/>It is a common practice to have two watches, one for dailywear, and one for exercising.  I've been doing this for years.  First it was a ChargeHR for day to day, and a Surge for exercising.  Then when the ChargeHR died, I upgraded to a Blaze for every day use, keeping the Surge for exercise.  Recently I upgraded my Surge to the new Ionic for my exercises.  it is a great watch.  So great in fact, that suddenly my Blaze seemed a bit dated, and I was tempted to get a replacement day to day watch to replace it as well, which is when I got this Versa Special Edition, and that's when the problems started.<br/><br/>YOU CANNOT CURRENTLY HAVE MORE THAN ONE IONIC/VERSA attached to your Fitbit account at the same time.  If you already have one Ionic or Versa, when you try to add another Ionic or Versa, the app uninstalls the existing one, leaving just the new one on the account.<br/><br/>Oddly enough - however - you CAN have older watches like the Blaze, the Charge 2, etc. etc.  installed alongside a Ionic or Versa.  So, since the Versa is thus completely unfit for the purpose I bought it, it had to go back.  I returned it and am back to using my Blaze for daily use, switching to my Ionic for exercising.<br/><br/>I'll keep an eye on it though.  If Fitbit decides to fix this rather stupid limitation, I may just buy a Versa again.  It is a pretty nice watch.
 This broke in 7 Months. I was sad BC I did love all the features that came with it. Didn’t want to spend crazy money on an Apple Watch 😐
 I love everything about this watch! I use it for working out and just everyday use.
 I have owned several fitbits and this is by far my favorite.  I never miss a message or call.
 Absolutely the best. I'm never without it.
 It's useless, bluetooth and WiFi do not work, it's a junk clock.
 I like everything about this product switched to fit bit from garmin  because Versa is waterproof
 Since I installed the update on my Versa, I'm loving it again.  Before the update I'd charge it every night.  Now I charge it every 4 days.
 Bought one for mom for Christmas. She loves it! I didn’t know you could get text message and call alerts through it either so that was a bonus!
 Love it. Even the small wristband fits me. So far so good, I’ve only had it for a very short while. I’m tracking the days before I have to charge I’m on day 3 without a charge.
 Excellent unit, had one of the original Alta units this is a significant upgrade!
 My friend really enjoys her watch.  Always wears it.
 I bought it for my girl and she loved it!
 Great watch, works like it suppose to do and holds a good charge.
 As expected and described.
 I have been using my Fitbit Versa for a week now and really like it! I have been more motivated to "get my steps" in and drink enough water. The waterproof feature is great for summer! It is a little bulky with the black band but I have not tried any others.
 My great Mothers day gift. I love my versa fitbit😍 This arrived on time and packaged secured.
 Had difficulty connecting to the phone and steps do seem very inaccurate. Swing your are once and counts as two steps.
 Love it
 Great price. Beautiful on my wrist. Works great
 Totally loving this watch. It does everything I need. I love that I am able to swim with it.
 I've spent two days straight trying to install (overnight download) this device with no luck. We have followed every instruction from the Fitbit site with no luck. Not sure what else to do but to return it.
 Love it
 Wife loves it
 Love my new fitbit.  It was a gift for Mothers Day and I've used it every day since.
 I love this watch!!! Beautiful and amazing!
 It's what my great nephew asked for, and he's cool.
 This is my first fitbit device and I absolutely love it! It holds me accountable for walking.
 Excellent Product, works as advertised.
 One of the best Fitbit’s out there!  No issues.
 I loved the watch till it stopped syncing to my phone and then the face stopped working
 Easy to connect. So far so good.
 It has different clock faces you can choose from. It charges quickly
 My grandson love his gift
 Great product
 It's lightweight and I love it.
 Had it for a month and still working good
 Works as discribed fits good.
 Great gift , the wife loves it,  and its easy to use .
 Everything I expected and wanted
 Outstanding product.  The only reason for 4 stars is the battery life
 Battery life is pretty good
 Very nice price fast delivery
 Love this Fitbit Versa ! It is helping me in so many ways with exercising and learning about my sleeping patterns. The it has changed my life in positive ways 😃
 I love this for my work outs and motivation to get fitter everyday. Helps with my sleeping record.
 Love this watch. the only issue I have is that it takes forever to update my songs from pandora.
 was to much info. for my wife to figure out.
 Good Quality
 It's so cool. Pove that I can change the face
 My daughter loves it.
 Love, love, love it!!!!
 It works like it should.  The cloth band gets really dirty really fast.
 Too big for what it advertises! I went back to my Charge 2.  Too complex and not enough apps for my needs.  NOT paying for simple apps for a $200 watch.
 I really love the Fitbit versa. It is easy to use and tried valiantly to keep me on track!!
 works great
 will not hold a charge and now will not charge AT ALL.  Very frustrating for the cost of the watch!!
 Only had it a few days but love the new gadget. Have had several fitbits each one a little different.
 But really cool product
 Excelente.no le coloco 5 estrellas porque no tiene GPS y por ende es una limitante para saber con exactitud los metros recorridos
 Does the job. And is very attractive.
 I love it and all that it comes with apps and works  but I still having problems regarding how the music works.  Thank You...
 Great Purchase
 Not compatible with Spotify is a huge disappointment.
 i love this thing
 Easy to figure out how to use! Perfect to keep track of steps! Just wish the band was a bit smaller.
 Like the sleekness and ease of the versa. Dislike that the elliptical is not included in the excercise options
 Very nice fitness tracker - screen size makes it easier to see things. Really love the option of creating your own watch face.
 Seems accurate enough
 Love this watch. The color is beautiful. Steps are accurate.
 the device has compatibility issue with phones, company (Fit bit) has list of phones that device will only work with so buyer beware
 I love this Fitbit! I can wear it in the pool and shower. Has so many capabilities I can't list them all.
 Difficult to synchronize with Map My Ride.
 I loved my fitbit versa until it quit two months after I bought it.  I woke up and it appeared to have lost it charge, but it won't recharge.  Also, it wouldn't sync very well.
 very nice
 I had an Apple Watch and hated it. I pre ordered the VERSA and waited for it to arrive. I have LOVED it from day one. I love the battery life, it is so easy to use, and it is waterproof.
 Great smart watch! My wife loves it.
 The fit bit coach is great
 Battery life is great. About 5 days on one charge. Stays snug on my wrist even during intense exercise.
 Great product
 A+ wife loved it
 My wife loved it
 I 💜 my fitbit I use it for time and to keep with my daily steps I found it to be more accurate in keeping track of my steps better than my fitbit charger 2
 I love it
 Will be useful if I can ever get it synced and working.
 Helps keep me active and healthy!
 I had to take a star off because the initial setup did no go smoothly, it go hung during an update.  I had to call FITBIT to learn how to reset it.  How the bottom left and right buttons for 10 seconds
 Does not hold a charge. Now I’ve missed the window to return. Don’t go with this fitbit until they work out the issues.
 excellent gift … great complements
 Works as it should and looks great!
 Love it but it won’t track my bp
 I love this fitbit!! Very comfortable to wear and love all the features.
 Item is terribly malfunctioning. I will not wear it when sleeping and i will wake up with 31,000 steps before I even put it on at 6am. Where can I get this fixed?! Heart rate is also inaccurate and will tell me my heart rate is around 40 bps lower that actual HR.
 Definitely better than Apple!
 The Versa is awesome, I love it!! It’s very comfy. Love all the apps that work between the Fitbit app and the Versa.
 Was a beautiful fitness tracker with features I wanted and I couldn't wait to use it. Unfortunately it would not charge at all and had to return it.
 Love it. Upgraded to an ionic which I returned for syncing issues. This is perfect for me and love<br/>The way it looks and feels.
 I have been a fitbit user for almost 4 years! Started with Alta, upgraded to a upgraded to a Surge 2.5 years ago. The Versa is another snap up!! More stylish and much more applications!!
 Love it!
 Out of return window.  Unresponsive and will not track pulse.  Just over a month of use.  Horrible product and return window not long enough, they must know that it will only work days past the return date.
 Love it!!! Does everything I need
 She has really enjoyed using it and is still learning all of it's features.
 I like the fact it keeps me moving because I want to get the steps in every hour and not sit so long every day
 Great Features and Battery life for everything it does. Much better than my Alta.
 The Versa was great for a few months, and now it will not pair with my phone. I am so disappointed! The Versa is worthless. Honestly, I'm done with all Fitbit products. They are absolute garbage!
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO USE THIS PRODUCT AS ANYTHING BUT A GLORIFIED WATCH AND WEAR IT ANYWHERE BUT ON CARPETED FLOORS, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!<br/>I bought this two days ago as an upgrade to the Charge 2 which I had for over a year. I was home, sitting on a hardwood floor, and took my brand new Versa off of my wrist to readjust the band. It slipped from my hand and fell MAYBE two inches onto the hardwood. I picked it up, went to put it back on, and that’s when I noticed the massive crack in the screen. I WAS SHOCKED! How on earth can any product be marketed as a fitness product meant to be used during physical activity if it can’t even survive a tiny, tiny, tiny fall?!? My Charge 2 went through WAY worse and never got anything more than a slight scratch. And it gets worse: ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE (due to the product being made by inappropriate material for its marketed use) IS NOT COVERED BY THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY! So now I’m stuck with a watch that, if I do wear it again, will only remind me of the money I wasted. I’m completely outraged and shocked. The Versa is basically an Apple Watch. If you want an actual fitness/activity tracker that will survive every bump and bruise, and if you insist on giving Fitbit your money, get the Charge 2. However, I will not be purchasing anything from Fitbit ever again. A companys word is everything. If you market yourself and your products as one thing and they can’t preform accordingly, your word is broken and I don’t trust a single thing you sell. So I’ll give my money to a company with reliable products.
 Very good at tracking and very light, feels like I am not wearing anything on my wrist.
 Like the fact I can get it wet, and battery lasts a bit longer. And now it looks more like a watch
 Liked.  Recommended.
 Love it
 This was a gift and the person loves it. Great features for a good price
 I love this, it replaced a charge 2
 Worked right out of the box. Easy to set up. Wish we could buy extra charcoal bands.
 The watch is too large for my taste.
 Love this! It fits my fat wrist just fine!
 I loved it, excellent,
 Bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister. I already have one. We both love it!
 Battery life is great!  Apps are fun.  Watch is comfortable.  Love my Versa!
 Wife is super happy works really great
 Wife loves it
 Product Fitbit versa smart watch just enough on it to make it very wise choice
 Love it all
 Great
 Love it, not to much watch.
 Love
 I liked the Versa for a couple weeks BUT now it's not syncing with the app on my phone,  as it should,  unless I force a cold boot on the Versa everytime I want it to sync.  If it wasn't for that issue,  I would like it a lot.  Also,  don't flip the extra $30 for that fancy band.  It rubbed me raw,  so I'm using the cheap brand that comes with the tracker normally.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  After finally getting the syncing issue resolved (at least for the moment), it now will not graph my sleep at night.  I did all the things their support suggested i.e. moving up my arm,  changing sleep time by a minute, and still no detail data. I've had it since June 3rd 2018. Dropped it another star. Guess I'll start leaving it off at night.<br/><br/>Update: If you want a tracker that actually tracks which really takes your sleep patterns,  don't buy this model. I tried it again last night and it still won't do it. If I had it to do over, I'd go another way. That option worked less than 2 months.
 Love this watch. Traded up from Fitbit Alta and love all of the functions of this watch!
 Looks cheap
 Great purchase
 Perfectly works for me.
 Worked great
 Excellent battery life. Great upgrade from my fitbit charge hr.  Still getting used to the change in control
 Was quick delivery and exactly what we were looking for.
 Wife likes it
 I am really happy with this purchase!!
 Wife loved it
 Love the sleep monitoring the best
 Love it! Dont know how to use everything yet but it's doing exactly what I expected!
 Perfect
 Ya es el cuarto que me compro, y cada vez se ponen mejores
 Great. Just love it. Just wish it would come in different colors at the same price
 Great design and battery lasts for days
 Love my Versa!!
 Needs to be more user friendly!!
 Love my watch and it gets me walking and exercising more
 Amazing product Wife cant stop playing with it Loves it
 Like the slim style
 Does exactly what it is supposed to.
 Motivates to get in shape!
 Got it for my husband he loves it. He’s a mechanic so he’s rough on things and it’s holding up great
 I Love my versa watch
 This watch is exactly what I was looking for.
 Excelente smart watch
 Love it
 Just got it yesterday and can not get it to work!
 Love this fitness watch so far! It has many useful applications and the tracker is very accurate.
 I love the Versa it's perfect for my needs.
 I love my fitbit versa. The heart rate monitor is awesome. And now that I can store music on it makes it evendors better.
 Can't say I'm really satisfied with the watch. What I needed and wanted was a watch with 3+ day battery life, and something I can see notifications on without being disruptive in meetings etc (pulling my phone out).<br/><br/>On the battery, it exceeded my expectations. It says 4 day battery life, and it really delivers on that easily.<br/><br/>Notifications, not so much.<br/>- there is a delay in showing them<br/>- the responsiveness of the screen is really bad<br/>- dismissing notifications on your phone doesn't dismiss them on the watch, so I have to go in a few times a day to clear them<br/>- there are very few actions you can take on most notifications<br/><br/>Other positives on features that were/are not important to me, it's really light weight and comfortable. It also works really well as a fitness tracker. It has a standard watchband mechanism so changing them is easy and there is a huge variety.
 My husband tried to surprise me but it came to the house. And im so in loveeeee. Easy to do with the app. Great job fitbit
 Love this watch, comparable to the Apple Watch
 As described
 My wife loves it.
 I love the my fitbit. It's just what I need to keep track of my blood pressure.  The colored bands however,  are really hard for me to change. It looks easy but I'm just not getting it. It's probably me.
 I've had my versa for less than a year and have already had to replace it twice. Don't waste your money
 Excellent fitness tracker. When the most intuitive vibrant display in accurate sport watch hybrid fitness tracker.
 Reminds me of my old Pebble. I  think they have something good going on.
 Love it upgraded from the Charge 2
 Muy bueno
 Amazon Delivery services is a bit unreliable.  The product is good and simple to use
 LOVE IT!!
 I love it. It works well in all the ways it says in its description. I haven’t had any problems.
 Still trying to get it to work
 Had my 1st Fitbit for over 5 years, this is a great replacement.
 I love this watch!!!! Need!
 Love it! Much better than the bulkier ionic
 I LOVE THIS WATCH IT WORKS WELL
 Love the color the material how it works. O complaints
 He loved it for his birthday!!
 Tracks many forms of exercise
 Love it keeps up with all your excerises, sleep, food intake and more
 Tracking down the daily excise.
 Love this smart band
 Had a fit bit for years, love the new versa!
 Excited to learn what all this Versa will do. Love the alarm.
 Did not have a smart phone
 finally I found a tracker and a smartwatch that fit my needs. Perfect product. Battery life is awesome. Tracking very accurate.
 Great gift for my 12yo son!
 I love everything about it.
 Not able to use, watch will not sync.  Was covered under warranty and new watch on it's way.
 Gift
 I Love Love Love my New FitBit Versa!! It is so user friendly!
 Just to be clear: this is a light weight, chintzy watch, that is great for wearing all the time (lightweight), but relatively entry level if you are looking for a full on sports watch. I had it for about a day, but returned it since my primary use was going to be for running, etc., as opposed to counting steps, sleep tracking, etc.  Overall, a more affordable alternative to Apple Watch, without the GPS.
 Love that it’s waterproof!
 My wife loves this.
 Works great with the iphone 8. She says she loves it.
 The product doesn't work properly. Not charge after few hours charging.
 Great product.  Does all I need it to do.  Saved me a lot of $$$.
 I'm so sad, because I wanted to love the Versa! I loved the color (peach/rose), I loved how thin and lightweight it was. The screen had great graphics, was very bright and colorful.<br/>However, none of that mattered to me, because it wouldn't stay connected to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8). It set up fine, and downloaded fine, but after a few minutes, I stopped receiving notifications of calls and texts. I repeatedly tried to reconnect it to bluetooth, and get it to sync, and it just wouldn't do it. I think I had if for 5 days, and I could only get it to sync maybe 2 or 3 times, and only received notifications about 5% of the time.<br/>I ended up returning it and going back to my Charge. I hope Fitbit is able to fix this problem (which I discovered while I was researching/troubleshooting, is a very common issue), and I would happily, excitedly, enthusiastically, purchase the Versa again.<br/>Please get it fixed, Fitbit!
 Great product fast shipping
 Stopped working
 my daughter loves it
 At 4 months the heart rate monitor has stopped working. Very disappointed
 Nice watch with all functions needed for tracking fitness
 Very sleek, not oversized, waterproof watch. You can customize app layouts and change the bands easily.
 The watch is great bought one for a friend except the one I received was clearly returned and came with a scratch on the face of the watch. Trying to return it but the return label image doesn't show to print.
 Battery holds charge for days, easy to program. I like the notification capability &amp; the watchface options. Comfortable.
 I love this watch. It’s so much better than my surge.
 This is awesome!
 Like fitbits
 I upgraded to Versa from Charge 2 and am really happy. A bigger watch face, waterproof, swim tracking are cool features in this one.
 easy to install
 Es divino. Súper cómodo. El color es maravilloso. Estoy muy contenta con las funciones que tiene y el resto de sus utilidades.
 I love it so far, I will update my review in a couple weeks. Love that it can be in water, and has more info on screen and app. It’s great to get msgs on it while working out so I don’t have to deal with phone unless emergency. So far it’s awesome!
 Great product
 Best Fitbit by far!!!  LOVE it 😍
 Excellent, fitbit is one of the best smart watch in the market. I have a Blaze for almost. 3 years.
 It is a good divice
 Arrived quickly, easy to set up &amp; sync.  Excellent performance!
 Love the functionality of the watch.<br/>My only complaint is the battery does not last as long as expected.
 Great product. My wife loves. Works great so far.
 Keeps all my stats and is water resistant.
 I regret not just getting the Charge again. The watch it too cumbersome and the band in painful,
 No issues like people have said. We love our watches.
 I find it very useful.
 Love it!
 Wife loved it. Easy to use and pair to phone
 Great watch! Love it 😍
 Nothing special, the blaze is better.
 Nice works like fit bit
 12 day update:<br/>On day 10 I noticed white vertical lines starting to go through the screen. I will post a picture of them. About an hour or so later the whole screen went blank. It was still tracking my steps and heart rate but the screen no longer worked at all. The entire display broke. After 10 days of light use. I never even got the thing wet. I contacted Fitbit to try to figure out what was going on. They had no idea. I was required to email them a video of me putting the Versa on the charger and then tapping the screen to show it wasn't working (I guess so they knew I wasn't lying about it being broken???). After they determined that, yes, the Versa was broken, I would have to send it back to them and then they would send me a replacement. That would likely take 3-4 weeks. I asked if this was happening to other devices, trying to figure out if there really were bad batches because I have read a lot of bad reviews. I originally loved the Versa and honestly still want to but I can't believe it didn't even last two weeks.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/>I got the Versa to replace the Alta I lost last year. I couldn’t be happier with it. I love the way it looks and feels on my wrist (especially with it being so lightweight). I was afraid it would look too bulky or big on my small wrist but it looks amazing! It also feels very secure on my wrist which I’m happy about. I lost my Alta when it fell off of my wrist without me noticing. Doesn’t feel like there’s any chance that could happen with the Versa.<br/><br/>Set up for me was very quick – around 30 minutes (which is how long the Versa tells you it will take). Quick, easy, and ready to wear in less than an hour after unboxing it. My Versa came 70% - 80% charged already which was nice to see.<br/><br/>I read a lot of reviews from people complaining about the Fitbit logo on the screen but it’s honestly not that noticeable – at least to me it’s not.<br/><br/>The display is nice and clear. There are SO MANY watch faces you can choose from but not a huge app selection. I did buy the Versa for fitness purposes only so the lack of apps doesn’t bother me at all. It seems to track my steps and heart rate accurately which was my overall main concern.<br/><br/>Notifications look great. I have an iPhone 7 Plus and the notifications pop up immediately. Of course I can’t reply to texts or answer phone calls but that doesn’t bother me. I have my phone on me 90% of the time anyway. The notifications are helpful when I am at work and keep my phone on silent in my desk.<br/><br/>I’ve only had it for a day but I’m in love…especially with the lavender woven band. My mom liked it so much after seeing it that she ordered herself the same one. Will update this review if things start going downhill with it.
 Amazing! Works great! Can swim with it. Can track everything I need to know and pairs up with lots of apps
 Wife loves her HR and hope she loves the new one.
 Bought this as a gift for my mom.  She LOVES it
 Really love it
 Would be 5 stars if it weren't for syncing issues that a lot of people are having for months and Fitbit support refuses to acknowledge.
 I love the Fitbit I never take it off
 Can't text.  Screen glitchy.  Many software issues.
 Love this.
 Have had for a few days. Easy to set up and very comfortable to wear
 Nice!  HR monitor works well, sharp images males it easy to read outside.
 Love it!!
 Love the Fitbit Versa. I upgraded from an old fit bit. The only thing it’s missing for me, is the ability to parent with my Peloton bike.
 i can download any face to it. Battery life has been good.
 Worked great for 2 months!<br/><br/>Websearch "Fitbit versa firmware" for the truth.
 Is great watch..I love it 😍😍😍😍😍
 I love this versa, it works really well and I love paying with it. I just wish I didnt need Wi-Fi everytime there was an upgrade.
 Pretty cool but eats up a lot of battery power
 Love it! Such an awesome smart watch!!
 I love everything about this fitbit
 Gift to my husband!
 Hassle free and easy to use
 I don't dislike anything about my versa. I use it primarily as a pedometer but the other features are great too.
 Great product
 Best Fitbit yet.
 Does not work with Moto z6 phone, very disappointed with Fitbit.
 The only thing I would change is to have a longer battery life.  Otherwise great product.
 Exactly as described and very durable
 Love it
 Great product I’ve has it for six months now
 Best FitBit yet.  Upgrade from Charge, Charge 2, Blaze
 It works great! I have yet to have problems and have had it for about 3 or so months!
 I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.
 its working so far, its giving me more motivation to keep moving
 Love it
 Love the Fitbit functions and the added sleep waves, relax app, and options for watch faces.
 Love my Fitbit Versa!!
 Gift for mother she wears everyday
 Died in less than three months. Do not buy.
 Great purchase glad I got it
 I really like it for fitness wise. But if you want it for personal things too it’s not the best.
 Battery life is terrible I feel like I might have gotten a defective one 😭😭😭
 I like so much this Smartwatch
 It helps me manage my health
 Compared to the Charge 2 its not worth the money. Does not record events correctly.
 Better than I expected.
 Seems to lag on sinking and need an update.
 Steps are not accurate. It is counting steps even when I am typing something on my laptop keyboard.
 I have had some version of a Fitbit for the last 4 years and this is the best one they have yet! Super lightweight and waterproof I have nothing but good things to say about this watch. The variety of clock faces available is awesome! You get to see more of the text messages displayed in the device as opposed to the charge hr2 which only scrolls a portion. You can control the playback of music on your phone on this device if your using Bluetooth headphones! Only had it for about a week but so far it’s great!!
 I love this watch!  I do wish that you didn’t need to have the paid version of Pandora tonuae the Pandora app.
 Slim lines. Looks great. Many features. Stays charged for one week.
 I love that’s is waterproof. I love the apps on it, when I am going to workout and set it. Just love it,
 Awesome fitness tracker. Classy look.
 Wonderful price fast shipping works great totally recommend seller
 How big the face is!!<br/>Like how I can change the watch faces!!
 Great product my Wife wears it all the time
 I moved to this from my Charge 2. It is great so far.
 This Fitbit is easy to use, and great. I have the iPhone 7 and it has paired and worked perfectly with it!
 Hard to get it to sync with a new I Phone X. Must be done daily by resetting the Versa. Otherwise all is good.
 Awesome
 Touch screen stopped responding on day 30. I've contacted Amazon for a replacement, but after reading more reviews I'm thinking I should have just returned it.<br/>**UPDATE** A day after this review was posted I noticed moisture bubbles in the small window on the back of the watch where the HR monitor is. After letting it sit for a few days I noticed the  moisture was drying out and the touchscreen was becoming more responsive. I was finally able to do a factory reset. It then took 2 full days to update. Today, day 5 since it stopped working, it seems to be fine. I have worn it in the pool a handful of times, but unless mine is defective, it is not as water resistant as Fitbit claims.
 Love it so much I’m more motivated to move
 Stays dim longer than my old fit bit. Takes longer to see who is calling than the old one. Works good, may just be a learning curve.
 Love it
 Light weight and nice upgrades from the blaze
 It’s accurate and easy to manage.
 Great device.
 Love it
 Perfect 👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌😊
 My wife LOVED the Fitbit Versa when in arrived. Great size, fit, features, etc. Unfortunately, it wasn't able to stay connected to her phone (Motorola G6) or even mine (Motorola Z2 Force) for more than a few minutes. Sync's fine with her iPad but that's only beneficial to sync fitness tracking as you lose all smart watch functions (text and email notification, call notification, calendar sync, etc) without it paired to your phone.<br/>We found quite a few complaints in the Fitbit user forums from others with a variety of phones and their support doesn't offer much help if your phone isn't on their specific list of tested phones. Unfortunately, the list of support phones hasn't been updated in a long with with much more than newer iPhones.<br/>If Fitbit gets the sync fixed with more phones, my wife will definitely go back to the Versa and I likely would also.
 It’s a good useful tool for staying in shape
 I have had my Versa for about three weeks. When I first received it, it worked perfectly and I had no complaints. About a week in, notifications became spotty (I have an Android phone) and have not worked at all for a week now. I have been working with the Fitbit support folks to try to troubleshoot and resolve this issue but I am about ready to give up and return this. If you don't care about call/text notifications, then this is a nice product, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.
 Huge upgrade on my Fitbit Alta HR 😀👍
 Versa is not holding a charge. Charging daily. What to do ???
 Works perfectly, love it so far!
 Love it love it!!
 Great watch! I love it, is everything I expected
 Does everything and more that was expected!
 It's not working properly on my arm. It there anyway that I can exchange it for another Alta?
 My granddaughter loves it.
 There are a lot of things I like about the watch.  I had a Fitbit Charge 2 before and the battery life is comparable.  I like the clock face and being able to read steps, battery life, etc. all on one face.  The additional apps, however, don't do much for me.  I can only get the weather app to work on rare occasions; it continually tells me that I have to "sync the fitbit mobile app to update" whatever that means.  I have gone to the Accuweather App, then the Fitbit app on my phone and, sometimes, I get it to work but then the next time, it tells me to sync again.  After a while, I just quit using it. The timer and alarms are both intuitive but I have never been able to get the music thing to work.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm ok with it.  It just needs more work to make it easier to use.<br/><br/>Follow up on my review:  I bought this watch 3-1/2 months ago and have used if faithfully since.  My previous comments about the Accuweather App and the music thing still apply but some things continued to aggravate me.  I really liked that I could immediately see, in addition to the time, the steps, battery charge, miles; all things I was interested in.  However, after setting them, they would randomly go away and show something else, like activities, heart rate, etc. and every time I looked, I'd have to tap the applications to get back to what I wanted to review, ultimately, I just quit using them.  Why I finally quit using the Versa is because I was really interested in tracking my sleep.  I had no idea how random my sleep patterns were until I got a Fitbit Charge 2 and I assumed that a newer iteration of Fitbit would be an improvement.  I was wrong, the Fitbit Versa would just seem to quit working at random times during the night or would seem to go into a less inclusive mode.<br/><br/>At this point, I've returned to the Fitbit Charge 2 and, while a little more basic, is smaller, lighter, logs every step and does a MUCH better job of logging my sleep.
 Was a gift to my son in law
 1 week in and I love it
 Worked as expected but stopped after swimming in two feet of water.
 Display is failing in 7 months of daily use, no water sports.
 Good
 It's perfect! Does everything I want it to do and Not do!
 Love it!!
 Screen keeps flickering..not worth buying
 Still doesn’t count the elliptical steps
 The Fitbit Versa is perfect for exercise and it looks much better than I expected.
 Nice size,  really great apps, and love that I can listen to music without my phone!
 Very attractive, works well. Hot tub approved!
 Let's start off with the pros:<br/>1. Its lightweight.Not bulky, easy to sleep with when tracking your sleep<br/>2.You can easily view your messages and do a quick reply if applicalbe<br/>3. Battery life is about 4 days<br/>4. Connects to your Wireless headphones<br/><br/>Now let's get to the cons:<br/>1. Changing the bands is a nightmare<br/>I have 2 new bands that are still in their boxes, because I refuse to detach the skin from my fingernail each time.<br/>2. It randomly turns off in the middle of doing cardio. All of a sudden it decides to restart. It's been so bad to a point where its restarted 4 times in less than 15 minutes and this happens quite often.<br/>4. I have a subscription with spotify and the only options you have for music is deezer and pandora or downloading music from your computer. Who downloads music to their computer nowadays..so I had to purchase pandora... this is to connect your wireless headphones to listen to your music without carrying your phone while you go for a run.<br/><br/>To be honest they should've payed attention a bit more to detail instead of hurry up and getting it on the shelves.<br/>Let's just say I still wear my HR2 Fitbit.<br/>Kinda sad that I spent $200 for this.
 After a Fitbit Firmware update in early May, my Motorola Droid Z Play is no longer properly receiving notifications.  Fitbit admitted that is a firmware issue on the Fitbit Versa where they have issues with Android phones, and they are working on it.  It has been 5 weeks and no resolution.  Since it is over 30 days, I cannot return to Amazon, and Fitbit refuses to assist me with a return or replacement since they consider non-defective, and I didn't buy it directly from them.  I have been a loyal fan of Fitbit for 6 years and purchased 6 devices from them , but I was very unhappy with their service response on this issue.  I pre-ordered this watch and it worked wonderfully for 2 weeks until their software update, and now the notifications do not work.
 great buy
 Thought it tracked your sleep as in how good you sleep or how bad but it just says when you were asleep
 Love that iis waterproof
 I got the Versa as a replacement for my Alta AR and it was a success!
 Love it! Love it! Does everything I expect it to !
 Very nice watch
 Fits great. Lots of accessories available and the customizable watch faves are fun.
 So far so good. Love the sleep tracking.
 I like the variety of watch faces and now the waterproof swim tracker.
 Love it!
 This is an amazing little watch that feels and looks great, but PLEASE do your research before buying it.<br/><br/>I thought my phone would work with it but boy was I wrong. After dozens of attempts, uninstalling and reinstalling apps, and power cycling both it and my phone I have had no luck with getting it to connect.<br/><br/>This is going to have to get returned. And judging by the forum posts I've seen, many many people are experiencing the same problem.
 It’s nice but my girlfriend has the Samsung gear and it does a lot more than the versa does. You have to go to the app to do stuff as with the Samsung gear you can do it right from the watch itself. You have to subscribe to pandora and pay for it with the versa also. I don’t like that at all.
 Amazing product
 My first Fitbit. I love it.
 Mother's day present for wife.  She loved it.
 Item arrived scratched.you can see the dent.
 Great !
 It’s awesome!!! Way better than charge2!!  Thank you!! 👍👍PK
 I researched smart watch options for several months before I chose the Versa. I liked the look of it plus I wanted more of a fitness tracker with a few smart watch bells.<br/><br/>Setup was easy, the look and fit was exactly what I expected and wanted. I'm giving this device a 1 star because the core function of step counting is terribly inaccurate. It counts several hundred steps when I drive even if just going a few miles away. I've tried everything - wearing it on my dominant hand, changing app settings, creating a driving activity that you turn on and off during travel which is just annoying. I reset the watch twice. Still same results.<br/><br/>I'm returning because a key feature like step counting should work properly. I'm very disappointed because this is a great product in theory. Fitbit hopefully will work out the bugs.
 The app is not easy to use. I have had trouble syncing my Versa with the app. I am very frustrated with it.
 Nice looking very time consuming to down load music if you have a mac Update: while on vacation the versa stopped working. I received it on the may 12th and on the 19th it stopped working, It froze and would not respond to touch control. I thought it might be low on battery power so I put it on the charger. It was at 55%. I let it charge until it was at 100%. It still would not respond to touch the screen would just flicker and not do anything. When it finally did come on it was periodically at best. It would work for a minute or two then freeze again. I thought it may be the heat. I was outside most of the day the high temp was 95 degrees. This is advertised as a sports watch 95 degrees should not have an effect on the versa this temp is normal in the west this time of year. If heat is a factor Fitbit has some work to do fixing the issue. I also thought maybe it can't handle the music and information at the same tome. If this is the case Fitbit needs to fix the bugs in the programing so this does not happen. Frustrated with the versa I'm sending it back.
 My son love it!
 Awesome watch with nice deal
 Love the features!!
 Good fitness watch
 Easy to use.
 I like it but the font is too little
 It is a great product.
 Happy with it.
 Summary: This watch went bonkers after about four days, so it was returned.  It has a lot of potential, with nice looks and price point.  It just feels like they released this too early, before getting all of the hardware/software bugs ironed out.  Very disappointed.  It will take a long time for me to look at a fitbit again.<br/><br/>Pros:  Very good looking and stylish.  Lots of potential.  Good price point.<br/>Cons: It took a few days to find a watch face that delivered the data I wanted and to get used to working with it in general.  After four days, I started receiving "watch error" messages.  Changed the watch face as the message recommended.  Shortly after, still getting the same error message.  Then it started going into reboot loops.  Then the HR sensor seemed to stop.  Sorry, this should work well out of the box, with little effort on my part.  I'm not here to beta test a product, so it was returned.
 Versatility is the Versa!
 Best fitness watch
 Good product
 Let me start by saying that I would buy this again, but I can not in good faith give it a 5 star review. This product has two significant deficiencies, each of which cost it a star in my book. Of the two issues the first will affect every user but the second is a bigger deal to me personally.<br/>1. The out of box experience is terrible. You literally can not use the watch to tell time, track steps, or perform any other task until the device firmware is updated. This takes a significant amount of time during which the app suggests that you have the watch charging and your phone close by.<br/>2. It does not autodetect certain activities well. The one that burns me most of the time is riding a motorcycle (I commute more or less daily by MC). on my 20 minute commute I usually rack up 35+ flights of stairs and 1500+ steps. There are two workarounds for this issue suggested by Fitbit, first take the watch off and put it in your pocket or luggage, I've found this to be &lt; 50% effective. The other is to log the activity as exercise after the fact. This is has been 90% effective for me. Fitbit seems to know about the issue and has not chosen to fix it.
 It was just what I expected based on the online description  very happy with it
 Crap.
 Love it!!!
 Me encanto el reloj, superó mis expectativas
 I graduated from through three different Garmin's, and moved to Fitbit blaze.  Really like the FItbit blaze, and now the Versa is even better.  So happy I made the move. Looks very similar to the blaze, but it is smoother, and more streamlined.  I'm happy to see a golf app, although I've not been able to download courses for some reason.  And the waterproof part will be great, since we do a lot of fishing, I will feel much better knowing it's waterproof!
 Poor. Band. Nice. Watch
 I've owned almost every iteration of Fitbit and while this device is one of the more aesthetically attractive Fitbits, its bike and walking GPS using an Android (Samsung S7) is absolutely useless. The Bluetooth connection stops intermittently and tracking is totally inaccurate. When I parallel track with only my Runkeeper app on the phone, tracking is perfect, so its not the phone. Apparently this is known, but the Fitbit Support forum doesn't offer any effective fix. For this reason alone its going back. Battery life was not bad and overall its a pretty design, but if a fitness tracker doesn't track your fitness activities, its not worth it.
 👍🏽👌🏾🤙🏽
 I wish ai could give a higher rating because I do like this Smartwatch.  Tracking seems very accurate while exercising.  However, there are a couple of significant issues.<br/><br/>It counts steps while driving and the only cures are, turn it off while driving or track an activity and then delete it.<br/><br/>The sleep monitor is sketchy at best. It gave a sleep report for a night that I didn’t wear it. The response on how to fixit, “Turn it off and on several times.”<br/><br/>With modern technology as advanced as it is, it looks like Fitbit swung and missed on some of the applications for this watch.  Not as expensive as an Apple Watch, but at $200 I expected more.  It now feels like I can only use it while exercising.  Very disappointed!
 I really wanted to love this watch! It does everything advertised but it is constantly dropping the connection with my phone for no apparent reason. A quick google search and I now see this is a common issue for the Versa. It will loose connection even while I have the watch on my wrist and my phone in my hand.
 I love it. So happy with all of the features.
 
 Has more data and easy to use, had a hard time resetting my password
 I have been using the charge forever. I swim frequently so I upgraded to the Versa. After about 3 weeks it died while I was on vacation. I sent it back on Jun27th, it arrived July 6th and today is July 13th and no one can seem to find it. I am really really disappointed. I use my fit bit for everything. I lost $50 starbucks card on the watch and the watch is nowhere in the fitbit return system. Representatives keep telling me to be patient but I spent a week trying to fix it prior to sending it back. UPDATE: its now 4 months later and I have had 3 replacements since then. The watch is not water proof and you can not do laps with it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
 Originally gave the watch one star because it stopped syncing.<br/><br/>After several days of experimentation, it appears that you have to close (i.e. kill) the app and restart it. If you do that, communication is restored. I seem to have to do that about every 12-18 hours.<br/><br/>My guess is that this is a bug in a new release of the app pushed out in the past three weeks or so (about when my watch started having problems with communication.) Symptoms include inability to sync, showing "Connecting" through an entire workout (i.e. never getting any GPS data from the phone), and no notifications.<br/><br/>Bringing up the task list in Android and hitting "X" for the Fitbit app, then reopening the app causes an immediate sync on my phone. GPS works during workouts, and I start getting notifications again. About 12-18 hours later, everything stops.
 Too many defects. Water seal is a culprit. I purchased Versa at launch. It was great at first, but within a month it broke, screen became finicky and eventually went out of function. I noticed that it happened after I got under heavy rain. My version of Versa was on backorder, so I had to wait for replacement for a whooping 5 weeks. Once replacement arrived it was working fine, that until I took it to the pool. Low and behold, after few pool sessions battery of the replacement Versa started to drain rapidly. Fitbit offers yet another replacement with no guarantee that it won't be faulty again.
 I really wanted to love this watch, but I guess I got a dud. The first day I wore it, the versa showed that i climbed 20 flights of stairs when i hadn't climbed any. Every day since it still show phantom stair climbing. The heart rate monitor stopped working yesterday and now it just says null. I had 92% battery life yesterday afternoon and only 20% this morning. The sleep monitoring seems to stop around 3am every day, and I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>Again, I was so excited about this watch and i wanted to love it. I think they rushed it to market.
 I was very excited about some of the features the Versa has, like holds up to 300 songs, and instant reply to texts, only to find out that's only if you use Android or Google products.  As is very often the case, the Versa is not very compatible with Apple or IOS.  I blame Apple, since they want you to buy the Apple Watch.  However, I like the Fitbit App, and wanted to stay with that.  I haven't given up on finding a way to upload songs from iTunes, but so far it has been very frustrating.  Everything else on the Versa is great.  There are tons of watch faces to choose from, and you can see entire texts and emoticons, which I couldn't do on the Fitbit Charge 2.  Also, this might be due to the much bigger display size, but it seems easier to read in sunlight.
 When the watch works, I love it. However, most of the time it will not sync. I have read about the problem on many sites and most people have had to return and get a new one. Here is where I have an issue, since i bought through Amazon, my time to return expired in 30 days. My problems started on about day 35. If i would have bought at best buy, I could have return it with 45 days.<br/>Bottom line, due to possibility of ongoing issues with this watch, DO NOT buy on Amazon!
 Wow
 Love the watch, but it is a work in progress. There were sync and bluetooth issues which supposedly have been fixed by Fitbit. Now the real problem is it burns through the battery and needs charging every day. Otherwise, it is a good watch, but I miss my Pebble.
 The big face
 Difficult to navigate the different controls and features. Apps aren't as easy to add either. Very little instructions with this. Been af Fitbit user for a long time. Getting used to it but not as user friendly as it's hoped. Love the bands. They better for the small wrist I have. All other Fitbit I was on the next to last or last hole on a small. This was a good improvement. Send more accurate in steps with. Love the fact they went back to water restaurant/proof to include swimming and the addition of swimming and bicycling tracking options
 Fitbit needs to do something about this device.  Ever since I bought it, the watch randomly logs steps and exercise in the middle of the night and when it is on the charger.  Last month, I had it on the charger for about an hour and it logged me over 8,000 steps.  Last night when I was sleeping it logged me over 1,000 steps.  It does this whenever it feels like it and nobody at Fitbit has bothered to reach out or help me and admit that it is the product's fault. Their customer service continues to say that I am causing these steps to happen.  I will be seeking a full refund and returning this product.
 It is a nice looking watch, but that is about it.  Sure it tracks steps and sleep, but that is about it as the functionality goes.  I cannot get it to sync to my phone as a bluetooth audio device.  I have tried repeatedly.  It took about 5 tries for it to sync to my Pandora account, which I had to upgrade to Premium to use....so big waste there.  The notifications stink.  They all pile up - there is no on time syncing so that the message displays and vibrates when the message arrives.  I am really tempted to return it.  $250 (with tax) hardly justifies the minimal functionality of this watch.  Pretty disappointed.  Great, light concept, but missing great functionality and simplicity.  Very frustrating.
 I did return this.  The canvas band felt very cheap and papery.  It wasn’t easy to change out the band.  The pin was hard to get in the holes when placing different band.  The advertised usage of Pandora doesn't let you know that you actually have to pay for it.  Also to turn the screen on with turning your wrist, doesn't always work.  I wanted to really love it
 I was in love with my Fitbit Versa.... for the 5 days that it worked. Now, my Fitbit stopped giving me ANY notifications of calls/texts (even though my phone is not set to "do not disturb"), my Fitbit stopped syncing ALL information with my phone (so I can't see any steps, post-workout analysis, sleep info, etc.), and my Fitbit will not connect to my phone to use the GPS feature to track my runs. My Fitbit app says there's a new update available, but every time I try to download it, it says "searching" and never comes up.<br/><br/>I am extremely disappointed. I was so excited for this product and paid a lot of money for it. Fitbit, can you help me out? I have confidence this is not how your device should be functioning - maybe you gave me a bad one? Otherwise I may just need to turn to Apple's watch (even though I was so pumped for your watch).
 Cannot get the wifi to connect to watch.  It was working on 10 hrs of trying to update versa and never finished thru Bluetooth  either. Talked with technical support and tried everything.  It's a sharp looking watch, but useless.
 Skipped over ionic for the better design. Love it!
 I love fit bit and have had one for 4 years. Just got the new verse and I’m not all that impressed thus far. I really am disappointed that there is no gps built into the watch itself... I bought it for the pandora music streaming capabilities with no phone necessary while running. Then when I found out couldn’t use gps without phone, I’m on verge of returning. Even when I was running with just the headphones and watch connected, the Bluetooth interference was horrible, kept breaking the music up... so for now I say hold off on this product.
 According to Fitbit the Versa isn't compatible with the Google Pixel 2XL but I haven't had any problems with it. I'm very happy with it. I use it more as a smartwatch -  it vibrates when I receive texts, messages, phone calls, etc. I don't know how I survived without it.  I do like the fitness part but that is secondary. I also like the appearance. It is the smallest, nicest smart watch I was able to find. I have a very small wrist so it was important that the watch wasn't bigger than my wrist.
 The Pixel 2 is not supported on the Versa and I feel this wasn't accurately represented up front. I asked support when it might be supported or if it's even being worked on and they didn't give a direct answer - only said they are always working on making their app compatible with as many devices as possible and don't have a time frame. I backed the Pebble Time 2 when Fitbit bought them and crushed my Pebble Time 2 dreams and this is exactly the watch I want but I need it to work with my phone. I returned it but I'd like to get it again when Pixel 2 is supported.
 Bought the fitbit versa for my wifes birthday. The device is fine, but the biggest issue I have is the straps, I had to adhust the staro based on thw size so I had to remove the small size strap but putting back the straps has been very painful and the design is so poor. I ended up hurting couple of fingers because of the pin and the.aliding you have to do to get the strap in place. I wneet ri the dorums, see a lot of gorror stories with the strap, tried the videos but still not able.to get it in, asked few others for help, they struggled as well . What can be done, can.someone help, or.privide a replacement, I paid 200 dollars for this...
 Hated this watch, returned it.<br/><br/>Couldn't read most of the text messages (i.e. if it was longer than a few words, it would cut it off) and it would constantly re-alert me all day about previous messages despite repeatedly clearing them.  Not a fan that I had to connect it to my computer (vs phone) to get music on it.  Didn't try the pay feature.
 Love it. I’ve had FitBits for years and this is by far my favorite.
 The only reason why I got this watch is to record fitness data.  It has a lot of software glitches.  On one day, it will say you're active, on the other it will say you didn't take a single step.  I walk about 20K steps per day.  On a day when I walk 20K steps and bike ride 14 miles, it will say I didn't get out of bed or move at all
 This thing sucks. It has crashed numerous times, and now keeps asking me to enter a code for an app that I don't see installed. I think it might very well have been hacked. No way to get a refund so, once again, I'm stuck with a crappy FitBit device that is effectively bricked. Not sure how stupid I am to buy three devices in a row that turned out to be worthless.<br/><br/>NEVER AGAIN!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK DANGIT!!!!!!
 My Fitbit quit reading my heartbeat after 3 months and won’t hold a charge for a whole day. Got on the phone with product support and wasted an hour of my time trying to trouble shoot. What a hassle. I’m hoping I get a refund soon. I’ve gone through the proper steps I’m supposed to to get a solution. Still haven’t heard back.
 Really disappointed. Tried the coach app on my new versa and it crashed towards the end.... It's cute and I like the idea of it. It just irritates me that I'm already having problems with it freezing.
 I really liked it for the first 2 weeks, then the battery stopped holding a charge. I'd fully charge it for hours, till it reached 100%. but then 6 hours later, it would stop working due to a 0% battery. I'm in the process of returning it and getting a refund. Maybe I'll try one of their other models.
 I love my new FitBit Versa! I had a Charge HR before and it was so finicky about syncing up to the app. I don't have any problems with my Versa! It's lightweight and comfortable to wear, and lots of options for clock faces, including designing your own with a couple little clock face options.
 There was a lot to like about this little watch.  Unfortunately, it stopped receiving notifications.  Tried restarting, unpairing, and all of the other suggestions from fitbit.  If I can't rely on it to send notifications, what good is the watch?  I won't be trying a factory reset: if we have to do that after only a few weeks of use, might as well return it.
 So far this is nice. A lot of clock faces to choose from is nice. I have showered with it with no issues.
 I wracked up over 20,000 steps while it spent the day on the charger. When sitting in the same location off the charger it did not calculate any steps. This is expected. Plug in the charger and it thinks it is walking. Continues to count steps obviously not being taken. This is the first fitbit I have owned that was a total disappointment.
 Overall nice.<br/>Complaints.<br/>Horrible watch band. I have a large forearm.<br/>Charger needs a weighted base as it doesn’t sit flat when watch is attached.
 I love it! I’ve been using fitbit’s for years. This one is the best so far.. the shipping was super fast
 Very nice features but stops working in the middle of workouts and has trouble syncing in the morning.
 Love it! Ive only had it for two days and I dont know how i lived my life without it up till now!
 I like that I can’t use it as a credit card  I like the fact that I can wear it in water  Only had it for a week
 Known problem on the versa and ionic with inaccurate heart rate readings.  They don’t know when a fix will be available.  Do not buy until they fix it.  Give them a call before purchasing and see if the update has occurred yet.  Wife loves the watch and the app, but worthless until they fix it
 Sent it back , it didn’t work as well as they described it. Alerts didn’t show up you had to push the side button to see it , would show the time when you turned your wrist ( sometimes it did ) but most of the time you had to push the button. When playing music as you ran it seem to skip some . Overall just wasn’t working like I thought it would
 It took 6 days to get here which is pretty bad considering it was a prime item. And putting on the large band is nearly impossible. But the watch it’s self is good.
 Not easy to set up, I still can’t get it to sync to my Pandora or get my text messages. Oh and if you want to change the wrist band prepare yourself for extreme frustration because it’s the biggest hassle. I miss my Blaze where I could just pop the face out , 2 seconds. Not happening with the Versa.
 Terrible watch.<br/>Very inaccurate.<br/>I slept with watch on and I woke up to 6 flights of stairs walked.<br/>The step counter is completely wrong and it counts steps even if you are sitting. As long as you are making motions with your hand (when I was making jewelry or eating or flipping book pages and typing on my Mac) it counts it as steps.<br/><br/>I called customer service and wasted 40min of my life listening to stupid excuses about changes in atmospheric pressures etc. How stupid they think you are?<br/>Guy tells me that pressure changes when taking an elevator can confuse the watch and make it count as flights. Really? Who in NYC doesn’t take elevator? What is the watch good for then? Shouldn’t watch know I cannot possibly run up the stairs as fast as the elevator? And never mind in this instance I was sleeping and barely moving.<br/><br/>Calorie count is off too. I tried it for few days. I am big on cardio and I train for Marathon. This watch shows me on average 180 cal less in a hour than my oooooold polar watch and Garmin triwatch. I am looking to replace these as new things are on market but this watch is shamelessly overpriced and behind.<br/><br/>Another issue is the heart rate. Half of the time is was same as my other two watch but often it dropped from 165 to 112 and it took half a minute to get back up. This happened multiple times. Extremely frustrating as my interval training completely depends on my heart rate.<br/>I made the watch tighter to see if it helps. Nothing. I tried even more till my fingers start to tingle and still useless.<br/><br/>Calls and messages either don’t show up at all or with big delay. I got message at 9am and watch buzzed me around 4pm about it.<br/><br/>Should you need to adjust something on the watch or see your results then good luck! You need the app on your phone to do 95% of everything. And good luck uploading and syncing your results.<br/><br/>Putting the lavender color strap on is easy if you have smaller fingers and short nails. Rubber band is thicker and much harder to put on.<br/><br/>Over all I am very disappointed in this watch. Released way too soon with too many bugs. Probably to please investors and start making $$$ asap.<br/>With so many smart watches out there it’s a shame they didn’t learn anything.<br/><br/>I liked the design and fit. And option to turn it into stylish watch during my run arounds. But that doesn’t even deserve that one star.
 I LOVE this watch, BUT it hates my Android, Samsung Galaxy 8.....will not sync. Very sad, returned it.  Will buy again when they fix the app to accept my phone.
 I love this watch EXCEPT it never syncs. It has been 2 weeks and nothing I do troubleshooting wise has fixed the issue. I don't want to return it but I am also beyond frustrated with these continuous syncing issues
 Just as described! Thank you!
 It fits well, my wife loves it and it does everything she wants it to do. Fitbit has really upped thier game with this new smart watch.
 Another hit by FitBit
 If you do a lot of outdoor running and rely on a GPS to track your runs this is not the Fitbit you want. Other than that it's great.
 Very disappointed that Amazon did not reveal that the Fitbit 45 day return option does not apply to Fitbit's purchased  on  Amazon.<br/>. That is very bad and should be corrected - also that Fitbit does not function on older iPhones.  I think you owe me a credit or refund.<br/> I do not want to keep it and my wife is very unhappy with it. We are both Senior citizens - this was intended for a big anniversary. Put it right Amazon.
 Received on 4/20. So not even two months (7 weeks) later, The Versa will not charge. It's clean, it's connected, different usb ports were tried - it just will not charge which renders it UNUSABLE. Pretty crappy to get 7 weeks use for $230. I'm furious!
 You can't actually control your music from the versa other than the volume. Fitbit support walked me through several troubleshooting attempts and then confirmed this is an issue they've been working on fixing, hopefully it is resolved soon.  Pretty basic for a smartwatch. I wish it was compatible with more apps.
 Updating my review to state that I'm really liking the watch overall, definitely the best fitbit I've had yet.  Still want improvements to the music syncing, but the other aspects of the tracker are all top notch.<br/><br/>.................................................................................<br/><br/>It's day one and I may update this review as I spend more time with it, but I have to say my initial thoughts are not that positive.  It's certainly a nice looking tracker and the best looking Fitbit that I've had yet, but I'm already questioning the accuracy of the heart rate monitor and counts.  I'm also very disappointed in the horrible methodology by which you get music onto the watch.  They presume that what ever system your music is stored on has both bluetooth and wireless simultaneously.  I keep my music library on a desktop and has bluetooth for my keyboard and mouse, but I had done away with using the desktop for Fitbit syncing a long time ago since smart phones are more than capable of doing the job.  Luckily I still had the little Fitbit dongle and could get the watch to communicate with the desktop app.  And also luckily, I have a wireless card in the desktop as well.<br/><br/>But then the Desktop app is somehow picking up on playlists and such from five or more years ago - the last time I used Itunes to manage my media library.  It's not seeing any current playlists.  I have a 10,000+ library of music, and it takes FOREVER to load everything for me to choose what songs I actually want to load.  I guess I have too much music, but the app eventually crashes before syncing anything.  They really need to allow the device to be seen as storage via the USB charging dock so that a user can simply drop whatever music they want onto the device.<br/><br/>I'm hoping third party developers come up with better options because music directly on the watch was a big selling point for me.
 Never have I ever had a smart watch or a Fitbit product. In 3 days of research I found this Versa would be the perfect fit for me. I decided to start the return process the same day I received it and bought a Samsung Gear Sport instead.<br/><br/>The size of it was great on my wrist, the special edition band was very comfortable.  However, the touch screen on this only worked a quarter of the time. I tried washing my hands, doing a reboot, a hard reset...nothing worked. Sometimes the whole screen would glitch out and I hadn't even touched it.<br/><br/>I don't generally write reviews but I feel that Fitbit still has work to do on these touch screens. It seems many buyers have had the same issue with the touch screen not working as it should. In spending this kind of money the item should work as it says.
 will update shortly, bought as a gift.<br/><br/>I gave it as a gift and she loved it. Have some great features and will prefer over apple watch
 Doesn't sync and has now stopped pairing with my phone altogether.
 Love it!!!
 I love the colors on the screen and the look. I am not impressed with the fact that my steps are exaggerated from bumps on the road while driving. It also is not automatically detecting walks as it should. I had a Blaze previously and it worked great. I wish I would have kept it.
 Bad band connections.  Changing band doesn't help.  Can't connect to phone with Bluetooth.
 was a gift they love it no issues
 The steps aren't accurate and I can no longer use the weather app for some reason.  I still haven't figured out how to get the music on there because Deezer can't for whatever reason use my credit card, the same one I use for everything else.
 broke within the first week
 Going to give this thing about another week, but if it doesn't start sinking consistently I will be returning.
 So far,  I hate it. I've had it for two days. It doesn't track sleep properly, won't load watch faces to allow me to replace one that expired yesterday,  so now i just have a big "24 hour trial over" message,  and the strap is a pain.
 Got the watch yesterday and it's done nothing but restart over and over again since connecting it. Have been in contact with support and they were not much help. I've gone through all the steps to fix my problems and none have worked. If hard restarting, factory resetting and customer support can't help then what will short of a software update? I've seen that quite a few other people have had the same problems with no resolution so I doubt fitbit are on their game about this issue. So I tried to factory reset my device one more time in the hopes that it would resolve the issue and now I have a bricked device that displays a screen saying resync and try again. I have tried to resync my device and am no longer able to connect to it with my phone or resync in any way. I've tried restarting the device manually and nothing helps. This is on top of the issue I've had since purchase of my watch restarting constantly and not tracking sleep or activity in its entirety. I have been asked to take a video of the restarting process "so that I can be helped further" but it happens at random and I'm not going to sit around for an hour or two waiting with my phone out for this to occur. That's kinda ridiculous on top of the fact that I'm no longer able to do this because my device is now bricked to the screen with a big red X on it. Due to these reasons I'm going to return this device to Amazon and I don't believe I'll be getting another.
 Update. Train wreck. Is the best way to describe it. The first watch I had seemed to loose data and burn my arm. I kept the watch dry and clean as well are set it numerous times. . However,the problems  persisted. After contacting fitbit customer service, I was told there was no way their watch could burn my skin nor did it have any glitches causing the lost data. So Amazon sent a replacement.  After three days of having the replacement it began having the same issues. Save yourself time and money and just buy a Polar or Garmin. By far, Fitbit has the worst customer service ever.<br/><br/>Original review:Unlike the originally blaze which this one is the predecessor to, you can no longer connector to  your phone and stream music.  You have to pay for a subscription to Pandora to syn it. The apps are not useful from the device itself unless you go onto your phone set it up prior. It has a very light weight feel. I get about two fills days out of a fully charged battery.  Overall, it's  nice for the price.
 Not impressed. My older, much cheaper Fitbit was more accurate. This one doesn’t count steps or counts too many. Burping my baby adds steps. It’s super annoying to have to take off every time I burp my baby just to get an accurate-ish read for the day. A lot of the cool features like Pandora and Coach you have to upgrade and pay additional money for.  When I’m doing the running workout it auto-pauses unless you adjust the setting every time you use it. And the auto pause is not accurate. It starts and stops all the time for now reason. Not worth the price. Buy one of the older models. They worked better.
