 Pretty well designed product my only issue is that it's really a iPhone 6s Plus case being sold as 7 plus. You can see on the bottom of the case the opening for the headphone jack that is different than the speaker opening on the right. No headphone jack on the 7 plus. Hopefully it will hold my 7 plus as advertised and not block any speaker sounds because of the different openings...we'll see on Friday...<br/><br/>Interesting that company did not put a single photo of phone bottom on product page.
 Great Case.. I Loved It!!!<br/>The quality of the case is excellent. I was very happy after getting the back case. I just wanted the case before getting the phone Iphone 7 Plus.<br/>The best thing was i got a tempered glass free with the case which was like a cherry on the cake.
 First and foremost, I do not get paid to write reviews.<br/><br/>****Update****<br/>I tried to return the item, but the manufacturer requires me to pay for return shipping, plus pay a restocking fee that they don't disclose upfront. This is one shady company and one that I cannot recommend. I now own a worthless phone case that does NOT fit an iPhone 7 Plus. Stay away from this product!<br/><br/>The iPhone 7 Plus case does NOT fit. I had high hopes for this case as I love the desert tan and tactical look. However, after receiving the case (which took a week), and trying to install it numerous times, the power button is misplaced by a few millimeters. This issue causes the power button on the phone to be pressed down at all times, which means my phone is always trying to turn off or I'm randomly taking screenshots.<br/><br/>Since the company is probably well aware of the issue from the numerous bad reviews, they've chosen not to correct the molds to create the case and continue to sell this case. Or the other possibility is that this case is really for the 6 Plus and they knowingly put the wrong product to try and make a product.<br/><br/>The look is cool, but I was never able to use the case because of the placement of their power button. I'm hopeful the company will accept my return.
 I have always used Otterbox and tried Zizo because of price. This is a nice solid case... claims 12 foot drop protection, though that hasn’t happened to me.  The case does not fit properly on my iPhone 8plus (it only shows 6+ and 7 on the box).  It is very difficult to get the case on, almost to the point where you’re afraid to tear the buttons off… but I did get it on. I’m just afraid that, because I like to take my case off and clean up the phone a few times a year that things may get damaged.  Also, because I’m right-handed I have to put the phone in (and take it out) of the holder backwards (the clip holder slot is designed on the wrong side). It seems to lock in solidly into the belt clip holder.  Another thing, because of the ribs on the backside of the case you cannot use a wireless charger, nor can you use a magnetic holder.
 This case is amazing and the seller is top notch, you can't beat the quality of this case for the price, I plan on getting the 7 plus the day of it's release and wanted to have case ready for it and I'm extremely happy I choose this one, it's exactly as advertised and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to protect their phone! I purchased a life proof case the day I purchased my iPhone 6 and everyone said I sounded muffled so i eventually took it off then eventually destroyed my phone over time, I can't say for sure if this case will have that muffled problem but I'm almost 100% it won't be like that because this case doesn't fully case your phone like life proof and that's why I choose it, this case is built tough and covers your phone except the screen but it comes with a tempered glass protector which should work a lot better than the $100 life proof case I purchased for my 6, overall I'm very satisfied and can't wait to try it out
 This is a very good case for the money paid for it. It costs less then half that of an otter box and it's less bulky and essentially does the same thing. I had one on my iPhone se and I just purchased another one when I upgraded to the 7plus. The clip don't last long but even just the case in itself is worth the money. I would encourage you to buy it if your reading this. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>*update 3-3-2018<br/>Just bought another one due to the extreme abuse the old case took. The case wasn’t destroyed dispite being run over by a car, a forklift (my own negligence) and dropping it from 15 ft. It was covered in so much dirt, grime and oil it was time for a new one. The screen protector from the last case only had a hairline crack in it so I didn’t bother changing it. For $25 bucks you aren’t getting any better.
 First off, I am not sure why several people have said that this is actually an iPhone 6 Plus case...I also have a 6 Plus and the case is very different.  This case has been redesigned specifically for the iPhone 7 Plus!  See the photo for comparison.<br/><br/>Now, onto THIS case...As always, Zizo has built an awesome case at a great price!  The case is solid and the tempered glass screen protector is a nice addition to the package.  I've had a plethora of phone cases over the years and other comparable cases will cost you $75-$100+...this is truly the best protective case for the money!
 I returned the product. It didn't fit the 7 plus. The lock screen button was permanently pressed and my phone kept bringing up the power off screen.<br/><br/>Case looked cool and came with everything it said it would but it was just to snug on the phone and I don't want to have to break in the case. Secondly, you can tell they didn't put forth much, if any, in redesigning the case from 6plus to 7plus. It still had the headphone jack.<br/><br/>Overall, I chose the case because of their past reviews, look, and thin yet protective features. You guys really dropped the ball though, just seems lazy not to make a new case for the 7plus instead of just renaming the product. Tried to pull a fast one and that's not good business. If you really care about the product and it's customers (sending out personal letters to get reviews, being a family company, etc) you would have redesigned the case and taken a little bit more care in production. It's not the family owned company mentality I'm used to, most families would take more pride in their work especially for new products.
 Pros:<br/>A really slick looking case! The black with red piping looks AMAZING with my gloss black iPhone 7 Plus.<br/>It's very sturdy and solid. It seems like it will hold up to a lot of punishment if need be.<br/>The raised ridges on the back and sides help with grip and it doesn't slip out of my hand<br/>The screen protector is actually quite nice and I was impressed that it came with the lint wipe and other parts to set it correctly.<br/>My belt clip seems sturdy enough (though I've seen reviews where it broke) but I'm not going to use it anyway.<br/>Cons:<br/>As others have stated, the gasket fits tight and the molding that touches the power button is about a millimeter too thick. It does indeed depress the power button and my phone was trying to power itself down the second I put it on. However, this is an EASY fix. I took an X-Acto knife (sharp hobby knife) and pushed the gasket inside out to gently shave and trim the plastic down, just the bit that touches the power button. It worked like a charm and now it performs fine. That being said, this is not a problem customers should have right out of the box.<br/>The flip-out stand, while handy, is incredibly tight and mine cannot be pulled out with just my fingernails alone. I need a coin to pop it open. I suppose the flip-side is that it does not open by itself and it's not a feature I use very often anyway so it really doesn't bother me.<br/>Wrap-up:<br/>All in all, a fantastic case after a little modification. I can't give 5 stars though because it shouldn't need modification out of the box. I would actually buy it again though because to me the fix was very easy and I really like the case. Honestly I'd like to try another color as well because it looks THAT good! :)
 You don’t pay $20 to get an item which is not designed for your phone / model. I have an iPhone 8plus and the item which was delivered is surely not made for the latest model. It may be a correct fit for iPhone 7plus , but not the iPhone 8plus. Attaching a photo of the back which shows that the Apple logo is not aligned with the cut made at the back. I didn’t even try to put on the screen protector / lanyard present in the pack. Keeping the package intact, planning to return soon.<br/>Edit: P.S., just found out that the case is for iPhone 7Plus and photo is attached herewith! Wise advise, someone needs to be careful enough before buying this, because the listing is misleading!
 Exactly what I ordered. Product was reasonable and came on time as shown in order. I will use zizo again in the future.
 I purchased this case thinking it would be of the same build quality as the previous Zizo cases I have purchased, but sadly I was VERY wrong and I will list some of the issues below.<br/><br/>1: The kickstand broke the very first time I tried to use it. You can tell by the look and feel of the stand that it is of VERY cheap quality and built.<br/><br/>2: the hole/circle where the Apple logo is seen through the case is WAY to big and completely off center. The IPhone 8 Plus has the apple logo a little farther down on the phone and this bigger hole is supposed to accommodate that logo while still being able to work with the IPhone 6 &amp; 7 plus as well, but unfortunately it looks absolutely horrible on my 7 plus with the logo off center in the case.<br/><br/>3: The build quality feels VERY cheap all the way around and is not worth the cash even if it were only 5 bucks.. I’ve had cheaper cases in the past that I used for years, but this is one of the absolute worst I have ever purchased.<br/><br/>4: the lip of the case BARELY RISES ABOVE THE PHONE SCREEN AND HENCE WHY THEY INCLUDED A TEMPERED GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR, AS YOU WILL BE REPLACING A BROKEN TEMPERED GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR VERY OFTEN !!<br/><br/>I’m packing this thing up and preparing for a return right after this review ! I am so disappointed with this case and was so looking forward to getting it, oh well, guess it’s back to Otter Box..
 Great sturdy case. I had trouble with first case I ordered the on button was sticking. Customer service replaced it immediately at no cost and fast shipping. I think it was just a lemon because the new one is perfect. Hard to find nice heavy duty cases at such reasonable price. Definitely order this brand again.
 I would advise you to NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I recently purchased this item for the 2nd time in less than 6 months. My first holster broke, and without knowing if it was mybl error or a defect I purchased a second one. The second holster broke in the same exact spot 38 days after I received it. I contacted Zizo and I was told that they would replace most recent purchase but not my original one (no reason was given as to why), however I would be subject to paying $6 for S&amp;H. When I finally received the information to replace my item I noticed that they were only replacing the holster, however as I have come to learn the holsters and the cases are NOT interchangeable, so when I contacted them about that I was told that they have changed their holsters and if the replacement doesn't fit my case that I would have to purchase a new case. BUYER BEWARE.
 I love this case! I read the reviews before I got it and decided to take a chance. Some of the reviews said that the case holds the power button down, switching the phone on and off. This is only true if you don’t make sure the rubber from the inner layer is through the hole on the hard, outer layer. It is hard to put the case together the first time, but if you take your time and think about it, it’s no biggie. I like the sturdiness of this case and that it comes with a screen protector. I haven’t dropped my phone with the case yet, (knock on wood!) but I feel good about it. The rubber ridges on the back are awesome for grip, especially since I upgraded to the much bigger plus and I have small hands. I don’t use the lanyard, I think it’s a little silly. This case feels good in your hands, is good looking, and seems to be tough!
 I think the idea is a good one -- a "military-grade" case with a kickstand and lanyard. But after going through THREE of these, and only getting to use one of them because the first two were out-of-the-box fails, I certainly can't recommend it. I would love to hear from the company about the various failures (kickstand, wrong glass protector shipped, flimsy belt bracket), but given their apparently selectively applied warranty, I'm not even sure the Bolt series is covered by it. The two fails included the incorrect protective glass cover (replaced by Amazon), the defective belt bracket (fell apart out of the box, replaced by Amazon), and now with the third, the kickstand has fallen off and the flimsy lanyard is about worn through (past the Amazon return window.) The third photo below shows the kickstand, which cracked initially after being used the second time. It has since fallen off. (photo 4). Just to be safe, we've never even used the belt clip for fear that it would break, so it's still pristine. :) The first two photos simply show the wear on the lanyard in only a couple of months, simply from hanging from my wife's neck. In spite of the return window, I would ask Amazon (or Zizo) to either issue a refund or, worst case, send one more of these things that perhaps has been tested before shipping. In the meantime, we're shopping around for another case, obviously made by another manufacturer.
 Very nicely made product , and it doesn't look cheap !! And it seems durable For the I phone 7 but the 7 plus ( Bought it twice ) it keeps on pushing the power button , as if the case is too tight or maybe the button on the case is defective .. not sure
 Nice case for my 7plus.  I researched several cases and chose this one for price, features, and overall protection.  I have had a small issue with the on/off button being very stubborn but it has loosened up and all is working fine.  The case included a glass protector and it fits perfectly.  My phone is protected without a tremendous amount of bulk and I love the lanyard loop. Really happy with my decision.
 The case is good quality and protects as well as high dollar survivor cases. It comes with a tempered glass screen protector as well. I did have an issue where the power button kept getting pushed because the case was a little to tight, I just cut off some of the excess on the inside where it pushes too hard.
 Thank You Guys For This Excellent Cover Case. I don't usually leave Reviews, But I'm so Happy with this Cover Protector That I Would Like to Share My Opinion About This Great Product  I've Been Looking for Something Like This Sleek Case It is Extremely Well Made It Has Heavy-Duty Hard Shell Which Protects your Phone against Drops and It Has a Detachable Holster Clip So you Can Hang it to your Belt Which Makes Your Phone Looks Stylish and Draws anybody's attention. Besides that It has a Durable Kickstand so you can place your Phone on any Surface and Watch Movies; To top it all off It comes With A Tempered Glass Screen Protector Which unlike Other Brands I've tried in the past Prevents Your Phone's Screen against Scratches or fingerprints and I Forgot to mention It also has a Built-in Key Chain Holder and a lace so you Could hang it off your Neck. It Is Lightweight and Heavy Duty It Comes In different Nice Colors; I Ordered The Green Bolt Color But I'm SO Satisfied with the Quality of the Case that I'm going to Order a Second One (Blue one). Before They Run out. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT to Anybody Who Wants The BEST IN DESIGN &amp; PROTECTION 4 Your IPHONE.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/iPhone-7-Plus-Case-Zizo-Bolt-Cover-with-33mm-9H-Tempered-Glass-Screen-Protector-Heavy-Duty-Armor-Military-Grade-Kickstand-Holster-Belt-Clip/dp/B01KX0JQ4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iPhone 7 Plus Case, Zizo Bolt Cover with  .33mm 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector] Heavy Duty Armor  Military Grade] Kickstand Holster Belt Clip</a>
 I purchased this product from Amazon Warehouse Deals, which was only about $4.00 less than the original price.  I received the item with only the case, and it was cracked on the kickstand and scraped in the front left side.  The holster, the screen protector and anything else that was to be in the box was missing.  What disappointed me the most was that it had an "Inspected" orange sticker that  from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  I've been an #1 Amazon fan for a long time.  Lately however, there's been constant problems with their merchandise. I had a heating pad that had to be replaced 3 times because it would not heat.
 I didn’t find too much of an issue with this case, but I could tell just by looking it over that is was orignialy designed for the 6 plus. The case still had space for a headphone jack. Anyway, back on topic. I returned the case for 2 reasons.<br/><br/> 1: I couldn’t get my phone inside easily, and<br/> 2: I felt the case I had already remained superior by comparison.<br/><br/>Most cases out there come in two layers that separate for easy installation, or in nearly all situations the only way for installation to happen.<br/><br/>This one does not. It’s made into one piece bound by 4 immovable clips on the back. It does have a stand on the back for easy viewing, but it feels super cheap like I  could break it without even trying.<br/><br/>I’m sure it’s a good case, but over all I felt more secure with my original case which is thicker, and has a better border around the screen, and has a better more substantial clip/stand on the back.<br/><br/>Also, just a tip. Don’t buy tempered glass from the cell phone shop. It’s way over priced. Something about $40 $50 dollars for tempered glass not but a few sheets of paper in thickness doesn’t quite add up. Go for Otter Box Alpha Glass on Amazon instead. Only cost me $7.99, and I’m pretty sure it’s a Prime item.
 Does not work on 7plus. Depresses power button permanently. I've reached out in the question area to see if anything can be done- I've taken it off and on 5 times now with no traction. This is the rose gold color. I have no idea how this product has over 2k reviews at an average of 4 stars. I rely on reviews to vet purchases and I'm bummed it didn't work out this time because it's a pain to return things! I don't write reviews often, but a 4 star rating is not appropriate for an item that does not function.
 It provides excellent protection, however I installed a tinted tempered glass screen protector too. The way that the case fits the iPhone 8 causes the screen protector to have huge air bubbles underneath it now. I tried using the phone without the case for a couple of days to make sure that the screen protector had a sufficient amount of time to properly adhere to the screen, but the problem remained.  The problem makes it extremely difficult to type on the phone and makes for an extremely frustrating experience to the point of wanting to chuck the phone across the room in a small fit of rage. The case came with a tempered glass screen protector, so I don't understand how this should be an issue in its design, but it certainly seems to be that way. I have since ordered an Otterbox replacement on an Amazon Black Friday deal where I have faith that the replacement will resolve my problem. I sure wish the Trident Aegis were available for the iPhone 8, but it seems that they no longer make current phone cases. They were always reliable, but would break a little after a couple of years of use thus requiring replacement if you kept the phone long term.
 Very rugged case. I like it better than the pelican case I had. No lip at the bottom so I can unlock the phone way easier. The back has ridges which almost act like a hand grip. They also include a glass protector as well. It was hard to get the phone in but I am thankful for this. Hard to get the phone in to me means snug fit. Kickstand is another feature I like. I do wish it held the phone vertical and not just horizontal but hey we can’t get it all.<br/>Update - holster clip broke less then 30 days after delivery. This was a bummer. Tried to get it replaced and was offered coupon for a discounted price on new holster and had to document order and photo of defective parts. They did not stand by their products for more then 30 days. So use caution as anything that goes wrong with it as it is not backed by the company after 30 days.  Still like the case but dislike the customer satisfaction and backing of their own products. Won’t buy for them for these reasons.
 Call me, Beep me, If you ever want to bolt me! This case was indescribable because it is just super protective. All of my friends got these cases as a whole and got a promotional discount. That way I can change the color to whatever I want
 I bought this case because my other case kept coming apart while attaching to the belt clip, resulting in phone dropping-among other things. This case is very tight, was very difficult to remove from the shell and equally difficult to put the phone with case into the shell.  Thought I would break it before i could actually use it.  Design could use some improvements.<br/><br/>The other reason is that it came with glass, supposedly anti-fingerprint; EPIC FAIL. Smudges like crazy, after an hour makes it look like you used the phone with Vaseline on your finger tips.  The glass also causes issues with the screen as pressing in one place causes something else to happen in a different part of the screen, OR my fingers grew 5x fatter after installing the glass.  Last thing about the glass, made sure phone glass was clean and no dust bits or other foreign objects on the glass, but the glass does not seal/adhere very well at the edges.<br/><br/>Would not ever recommend this case to my friends...or get the case but buy seperate glass, which I ordered yesterday.
 So far so good.  I really like the way this case looks.  It feels good in the hands. I am only giving it 4 stars because I am noticing one thing at the moment.  I think the power button does not seem to work well on the case at the moment.  I think that might change once it is broken it.  But I should mention that.  I like the belt clip.  And I plan to use the lanyard at some point.<br/><br/>FOLLOW UP--The issue described above with the power button was probably just a break-in period.  But two weeks later and the power button works fine.  This is a really cool case.  I am most happy with it.  I especially like the lanyard options.<br/><br/>ONE IMPORTANT NOTE--I expected the grey part of this case to be chrome-like.  This is a flat grey.
 I was very surprise at the quality of this case coming from Amazon.  I have always been satisfied with what I buy through Amazon, but not this time.<br/><br/>I was very excited when it came in the mail, as I always am when I order through Amazon.  I used to use Wish.com which is very big mistake.  Quality there is so bad, it should be illegal.  Photos are a misrepresentation.  Quality is horrible.  When my case in the mail I opened it immediately only to find Wish.com quality.  It felt cheap to the touch.  The holster clip broke off my side within the first hour of use.  The clip broke like a potato chip.  The kick stand is still intact because I rarely use that in fear of it snapping off.  I wish I had not thrown the broken clip pieces away in anger.  I would have loved to present a photo with this rating.  I would send it back but I gravely need a case because I use my phone on the job.  I am not worried dropping it in this case but I would feel much more confident with a new and better one.<br/><br/>All in all I do not recommend this product.  :-(
 I was impressed at first. The case fits perfectly and I liked it. I use the clip on holster than came with it. Very awkward getting the phone clipped into belt holster and removing it in daily use. In any case the holster broke in half when i say down in a Omni hotel lobby chair with half of it flying across room hitting a lady sitting in chair about 8 feet away.  I was freaked and embarrassed, but no harm to her.  It apparently hung on arm rest as I sat down and no way should that have happened. Now I have a phone case but no holster. If you only need case this is fine, but if you want it to be able to buckle to belt it sucks.
 I've had the case on my phone for less than a week and the color on the side where the lock button is located is already starting to fade from my thumb being against it (see photo). The volume-up button has to be pushed as hard as possible to get it to function correctly because the case doesn't seem to fit properly over there, looking like it has a bulge from a defect in manufacturing (see photo). The kickstand already seems like the pins that keep it in place and allow it to slide are ready to break at any moment (see photo). The black button-looking objects on the back of the case serve no purpose that I'm aware of other than to make the case slide if it's placed on a hard surface like a table or countertop, making it easy to be accidentally sent flying if you bump it. Also, the 3 curved parts of the back of the case that stick out about 1/8 of an inch make my magnetic navigation mount absolutely useless (see photo). The quality of the case just seems to be like it was made in a Chinese sweat shop.<br/><br/>The tempered glass screen protector is good quality and was easy to install. Also, this case is definitely the newer iteration that is made specifically for the iPhone 7 Plus with backwards-compatibility to the 6/6S Plus model as well. I personally don't use the holster so I can not vouch for its quality. It seems to be decent enough. Looks very similar to the Otterbox holsters.<br/><br/>I also saw on Zizo's website that they accept returns for 30 days, but they only issue a refund in the form of a store credit which is ridiculous, so I will keep the case because it does seem like it will protect from drops better than my other cases, and the price was okay, but I will not use it on my phone regularly. It will be the case I use when I go hiking or do some type of outdoor activity that will put the phone at a greater risk for falling.
 Was riding my motorcycle when i did a stupid thing- i was using my phone for Waze and had the phone in a pouch in front of me.  The phone was not secure enough and the phone bounced out on to the road.  Fortunately it was not a high traffic area. Of course, at the moment,  my safety, the bike and traffic safety had become the priority, i had written the phone off. I calmly pulled over and proceeded to look back but the ground was not a very bike kickstand friendly,  so i had another dilemma i didn't feel at all good about runny back to get my phone until i stabilized the bike.  The first couple drivers saw immediately the situation, slowed down and safely drove over the phone.  Of course the last driver did not,  instead of looking at the road they gazed at me and ran right over the phone.  To my pleasant surprise when i picked up the phone and it was still working.  The glass was was cracked but not like you would have thought. It was still intact ! If it would have landed face down the screen might have survived.  The only hot pressure point ,is the phone case kick stand which leaves a weak point in the case,  if you like to run over your phone like me.  It left a very tiny mark on the back of the case. I wonder to if had the screen protector on, it would have been great to know how much help it would have given the screen. Since i went to all the trouble to do this research fo Zizo.  I highly recommend this product !!!  I will miss my case kickstand till i replace it  but i am not complaining.  Thanks Zizo.
 I now have two of these cases. Other than a slight hiccup with the first one constantly restarting my phone, I am very happy. The fix was to simply swap out one interior (rubber) case for the other. Now they both work. The Red pictured here is very nice looking. Almost metallic in appearance. I also noticed an Orange case. I purchased it and it now lives on my main phone. I had originally looked at Otterbox cases, but their color palette of late is horrible. I needed a color that shouts "I'm over here" when I'm looking for it, and the Orange does just that. The screen saver does it's job and is very easy to install as I give it over to a friend to do. I am far to OCD to install anything that involves dust or fingerprints. The included lanyard is a nice touch. Not my thing. The belt clip works well and seems as solid as the twice as expensive Otterbox.<br/>All in all, a great case at a fair price.<br/>UPDATE: Upon further orders the power button issue has resurfaced.  I bought two more units for friends that admired my orange one. One in sand/green and the other in black/red. Neither unit allow the proper use of the power button. The inner "rubber" is just to stiff and/or the molds are wearing out. The volume buttons are fine, but the power button is either always depressed or unmovable. I was able to save one unit by using an exacto knife and slicing the inner liner right next to the button. This fixed the issue on the Black/red one. I wouldn't suggest this unless your pretty comfortable with sharp instruments. I suspect the same fix will work on the sand/green unit.  I will lower my star rating accordingly because without the fix, the units are pretty much useless. I still love my orange one and the recipient of the fixed unit is thrilled. Now if Zizo makes a fix, I'll be glad to up the star rating to my original 5. But for now, out of the box, it's a 3.
 This case is extremely sturdy and versatile. Not only does it look great and much more expensive than it was, it has a lot of options to suit what you need. From the kickstand to the keychain attachment that clips your phone in and out of a keychain(optional of course). Then the holster and clip that I will not be using but it's nice to have so many options for the cost. I purchased the rose gold and it looks EXACTLY like the photo. I have had many phone cases over the years and they are rarely the exact shade of the picture. Not always disappointing but it's nice to get what you purchased.
 I have bought similar product few days back, which was good but this one for 7 plus was really bad.<br/><br/>a) the outer shell is hard which is good for protection but addiing to phone is tough.<br/>b) inner shell is good but the buttons were so hard I mean crazy HARD that I could not put it. When i did my phone hung and kept restarting due to pressed restart phone button on right side of the inner shell.<br/>I dont know if its a design the previous case of 6 plus was great but this was hope less.<br/>only thing useful was tempered glass<br/><br/>I definitely want a case from the seller its not worth buying when only tempered glass will fit.
 So about two and a half weeks ago, I purchased this case to replace the case that I had been using for the past two years, that was finally starting to crap out on me. It seemed to have decent reviews, so I pulled the trigger thinking, "Worst case, this $20ish case should last me at least a few months (hopefully longer, but whatever). Right?"...Wrong.<br/><br/>The package showed up promptly just a couple of days later. So on that note...Good job?<br/><br/>I rip open the package and make quick work of trying to apply my phone's new cocoon. I apply the screen protector, which went on easy enough, and I thought to myself, "Golly gee! I have never actually used a screen protector, and yet I have never actually cracked a screen in all the years that I have had phones, so now there is no chance in hell that I will ever crack my screen now!! Right?!"....At this point, Ron Howard's voice cuts through the air saying something along the lines of, "Rivalbrew483 was wrong...again."<br/><br/>So now it is time to apply the case. Let me tell you...this thing was not easy to get on. Finally after multiple bouts of swearing, I finally get this thing on. At this time, one thing become immediately apparent...my phone keeps trying to turn itself off. I eventually realize that this case is not fitting well, and it is actually holding down my lock button. After a few minutes of adjustment, I finally get it to stop, however, now I realize that my lock button doesn't work at all. A few more attempts at adjusting the case, and several more f-bombs later, all is right in the world.<br/><br/>*Cue Ron again....<br/>"Or so he thought."<br/>...thanks Ron.<br/><br/>Well a week goes by, and all is fine, until I start to notice parts of the case are beginning to crack. At this point, my new case makes quick work of giving up on life, and much like my diet that I started on New Years Day, it fell apart with great haste. The part that covers the top of the phone, was the first to go. Once this broke off, it left both top corners of my phone completely exposed, and vulnerable. ...Poor little corners.<br/><br/>Not even a day or so later, the bottom started to come off. "Now no corner is safe from the dangers of asphalt poisoning." I thought to myself.<br/><br/>"Rivalbrew483, was right.." ...I think by this point, you should have a pretty good idea that I am saying that in Ron's voice.<br/><br/>Sure enough, earlier today, I went to retrieve my phone from my pocket, and upon emergence from the warm depths of my Carhartt work pants, my phone lept from my ninja-like grasp.<br/> *Cue profanity and slow-mo fall sequence...<br/><br/>As I retrieved my phone after its' recent battle with rapid deceleration syndrome, it becomes quite apparent that my sweet innocent phone has now been touched by the harsh properties of gravity. It now sports multiple scratches and indentations where it made impact, and it a sweet set cracks that stretch from the corner to about half way down the screen on the opposite side of the phone. (For clarity's sake...I still had the case on my phone, despite it not being fully intact, and I still had the screen protector on. Unfortunately, screen protectors don't protect against corner impact...because that is what the case is for.)<br/><br/>tl:dr<br/>Bought this case. Case fell apart and left my phone unprotected. Phone is now depressing to look at.
 The case arrived promptly and in new condition. The case does not fit the 8 plus properly! The main problem is the volume control. I think the volume buttons on the case do not line up exactly with the phone, making function difficult to control. Either I have to press hard with no response, or the pressure is so sensitive that it turns the volume all the way up. The tight case even turned the volume up without pressing on the button. It also means that the camera function will randomly take photos, or bursts of photos without actually pressing the volume control.<br/><br/>The tempered glass protection fits well. However, the first time I tried the belt clip, the plastic clip broke off the phone holder.  Very disappointing for having only opened the box only 10 minutes ago. (attached image)
 Amazing case with sub par glass screen protector.  This is the ultimate case to keep your iPhone 7 Plus safe from drops a little bit thick tho.  It fits perfect on the iPhone 7 Plus.  But it is a pain in the ass to get the case on and off but since the phone has a built in battery there really is no reason to take it on and off.  Even tho the glass screen protector in my opinion was sub par I recommend this case it is worth the money just for the case alone.  The case does have the cutout for an aux port but who cares the case still looks amazing.  Definitely try out the screen protector it came with I am thinking I got a dud or something so don't judge it just off my experience.
 Purchased the case for iPhone 7 Plus in December 2016 and I was very happy after trying two other cases which I ended up returning. One problem I encounter was that the full glass screen protector that I had with the other case does not work with this case. The case will lift up the full screen protector from the phone. Solution was easy since Zizo case comes with a smaller size screen protector that leave a few mm of the edge of the screen uncovered. That is not a problem at all since the case covered the edge of the screen and the phone very well. I was ready to rate the case a five stars. Fast forward 3 and half months later to March 2017, the sturdy belt clip latch that secured the case to the belt clip broke. Now I have a well protected case that I can not used anymore since my shirt or pant pockets are too small to carry the iPhone 7 plus. Reading from the manufacturer website, 1 year warranty is only from direct purchase from the website and not from other resellers. I will contact the manufacturer and see if their support and warranty works with amazon.com. I will update my experience in a few weeks. For the mean time, I will look at other cases and see if there is a better one.
 Just got the case today and really like it. Fits my 7 plus perfectly. There are two openings at the bottom for the speakers. However on the left side the opening is shaped differently. It's to fit the headphones for 6 plus. I read somewhere on here from a response from the company that this allows for backwards compatibility with the 6 plus. I'm guessing the hole at the top of the case above the camera is for looks?<br/><br/>The quality is very good and it feels durable. It holds nicely in your hand. Not sure if I will use the tempered glass but glad they offered it.<br/><br/>EDIT: I decided to put on the tempered glass. It's much better than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Now the only con that I have, which is also the reason I didn't give it five stars, is that I'm unable to pop out the stand with my fingers. I have to use tweasers. The stand is very secure in there which is good, but as of now I can't physically pull it out. Maybe after using for a while I'll be able to.<br/><br/>Other than that I would reccommend.
 I liked the feel of the case right away. It may be a bit heavy, but I’m ok with that. But there are problems -  I was very disappointed to see the front rim so low around the face.  It's almost flush with the face.  This is a deal breaker for me!  I purchased this case because of the pictures of the product  :/  I need more lip around the front rim to help protect the face of my phone. ...  So, now, another issue is - the 2 pieces do not snap or pop together at the top lanyard corner.  The molding of the hard plastic has a rough edge AND the soft liner corner has a pucker =  the 2 pieces won’t fit together without using a very thin “blade” to coax the inner liner over the outer.  (Think shoehorn).  Also, it’s easy to see the powdered type paint job is very thin...  Anyway, I’m not sure what to do at this point - do I file the area a bit and super glue the pieces (and hope they don’t melt)?  I used my fingernail to try to smooth the edge...  Or just put up with the ill-fitted corner?  I have not contacted the store yet, what a hassle...  Where’s quality control???  Or is this what 20 bucks gets nowadays??  Oh, and the inside of the kickstand has a rough spot, ...and is not flush with the inside liner.  This will be a rub spot on the back of my phone.  Sheesh, I guess I'm sending it back
 Bulky and poor quality. The clip broke off after only a month and a half of use. After contacting the seller Zizo, I was told they only warranty for one month.<br/>If i could give no stars I would. It is not about the money, it is about the reliability and quality of the product. Cellphone cases/clip holster are not considered "disposable" items. It is the second time the clip broke in the same spot. I normally don't give bad reviews but I'm very disappointed with the product and with Zizo customer services.
 The case fit the phone fine, but the power button gave me some problems.  it was not responsive enough when trying to screen shot.  I had to remove the case and put it back on 4 times before it sat right on the power button.  phone was randomly shutting off until I put it back on for the fourth time.  Material is cheap.  I had it for 3 days on my phone and pieces broke off.  The company was very quick to replace broken parts when I reported it, but the kick stand broke way to easily.  not worth the price.
 I purchased one of these 7 plus cases over a year ago and it held up well. The belt clip finally broke recently which I did not expect it to last forever anyway. Now to the current purchase...<br/>I decided to get a new case to mix up the color. After about an hour with the phone clipped to my belt, the clip split along the pin at the hinge when I went to pull off the first time. The case is fine but for the purchase to include the clip, I expect more than 1 use! I used the previous clip nearly everyday for over a year before it broke!<br/>Pros:<br/>-The case has a nice feel and grip.<br/>-The case is actually pretty slender keeping the already large phone from feeling oversized.<br/>-The red has a surprising almost metallic luster and looks amazing.<br/>-The side buttons are very easy to use with nearly no resistance.<br/>Cons:<br/>-The belt clip broke after one outing, light use (cheaper plastic from previous purchase).<br/>-Previously came with 2 screen protectors, now 1 (not sure why the change but also feels flimsier and no instructions were included).<br/><br/>Beware of the high rating-<br/>The quality should not have gone down but did from fall 2016 to spring 2018. I paid the same amount in 2016 for overall a better quality product all around - clip lasted over a year with heavy use, case held up, and the glass screen protector was thicker. I like the case but the real purchase here is for the clip and kickstand so a disappointment for the extremely fast break.
 12/5/16 Update. I broke the belt clip. Not sure how it got broken, but I busted to corner off the bottom and it won't hold the phone. I ordered a new full case when it arrived, the belt clip with the new phone was also broken. I returned that case for a refund. Thank you Amazon! I ordered the Zizo Proton case but my timing was bad and it's taking a long time arrive and it's still not here.<br/><br/>I dropped my review rating by one star, not because I broke the belt clip but because the phone case can only be held in the belt clip in one direction due to the case design and lanyard thing is an annoying pain.<br/><br/>Original review - According to the lads at my local Sprint store, I had one of the first of the Apple iPhone 7 plus models to arrive this week in my area. I bought the Zizo case a month ago for the 7 plus thinking the phone would show up sooner - wrong. On the positive side, at least I didn't get suckered into buying a Samsung Fire Phone.<br/><br/>Wisecracks aside, I'll review the Zizo case comparing it to my former iPhone 6 case, the Fre from Lifeproof.<br/><br/>Out of the box, the overall Zizo quality is excellent. The actual case is a one piece slip on heavy duty polymer/rubber. The separate tempered glass screen comes with a cleaning wipe, drying cloth and is easy to install and remove if needed.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/> - Price - $18 all in, $71 less than the proposed but as of 10/12/16 but still unavailable Lifeproof Fre case for the 7 plus<br/> - Quality and design of the Zizo are both excellent, providing that long term submersibility isn't a key feature for you. Recall that the new 7's are "water resistant" and the Zizo cases are build on that premise.<br/> - The buttons work well for both volume and for on/off. The lightning port is uncovered as are the speaker and dual camera lenses (only on the 7 plus) but there is a LOT of case thickness between the lenses and any surface. If you catch the lenses square and hard on a countertop corner, you'll have trouble but that's likely with any case<br/> - The tempered glass is simple to install and leaves a cutout area for the front mic and the main fingerprint reader.<br/> - The horizontal flip out stand is handy and works well<br/> - The belt clip is solid and holds the phone securely<br/><br/>Con<br/> - Not sure what the idea is behind the lanyard and lanyard attachment point on the case. Maybe if you're female with an enormous purse this acts as a lifeline for finding it. For me it's sort of a nuisance because I have to reverse the way I put the phone in the case which then forces me to flip the phone around to access the fingerprint reader. I'll get used to it, but I have no plans to ever use the lanyard.<br/><br/>Summary - Unlike the Lifeproof Fre, you have no gasket to mess around with or get damaged, nothing to unscrew or flip open to access power port. If you are not aware, the 7 plus does NOT have a headphone port and Apple supplies a midget converter cord (like 2 inches long) for using corded headphones with the lightning port. The overall combination of simplicity, utilitarian design and LOW price make the Zizo a hit for me.<br/><br/>The Lifeproof Fre sort of annoyed me from day one with the easy to damage gasket, silly screw in headphone converter cord and their awful belt clip. Yeah, it was waterproof but only for a limited time period until the gasket broke or the thin cover on the fingerprint reader tore off. To their credit, Lifeproof replaced my case twice over the years for free and I found a far better aftermarket belt clip but as I mentioned, it all added to an annoying experience on a super premium priced product. For $18, the Zizo case rocks and I like it so far. Updates as I gain more experience are in the works. Hope that helps!
 Device: iPhone 7 Plus.  This case looks sleek, and gets complements, but that is where the pros end.  The quality and design of this case is lackluster.  To begin with, the designers thought adding a tab on the upper left corner of the case would make this more versatile.  It doesn’t.  It only makes it more tedious to clip the phone onto the holster; due to it only fitting one way.  The area with the tab will not fit the “hooks” or “feet” of the holster.  This results in fumbling with your phone trying to clip it into place.  I even dropped my phone twice because of it.  Thankfully, it does its job protecting from impact, but the screen protector is just a flimsy sheet, that does not even cover the entire screen. The lanyard that is included which hooks into aforementioned tab is useless and reminiscent of 90’s era electrical gadgets whose lanyards caused more problems than they solved.  Nobody is walking around with their phones looped around their wrists!  Oh and speaking of the holster/clip it broke on me the second day of use.  Absolutely atrocious build quality.  Please see my pics for better explanation of the cumbersome lanyard tab, and poorly implemented belt holster.  It almost feels like the holster was an after thought.  There is also a kickstand to hold your phone vertical for viewing, but it is very difficult to unlatch, and at one point I even popped it out of it’s tabs.  I stopped using it then because it feels like it will eventually break.  All in all, if you want solid protection, with a seemless holster, stick with Otter, or Life proof
 I received the case a couple days ago. The first thing I noticed was the box had stickers on it that said it was for the iPhone 7S Plus(see pictures). When I opened the box I noticed at the bottom of the case one of the cutouts is larger, presumably for a headphone jack, but the iPhone 7 Plus doesn't have one.<br/><br/>The quality of the product isn't horrible but I've sent it back because I'm looking for an iPhone 7 specific case, and feel a little misled. This appears to be a generic iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone 7S Plus(the sticker says so!) case.
 While waiting for the arrival of the Lifeproof cases I needed something to protect my phone in the mean time. This seemed like a good case, but I did not particularly care for it.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1) the sleep/wake button on the case protruded too far in and held the button all the way down on the phone causing the phone to power off. (I have since shaved it down with a razor blade to alleviate the problem)<br/><br/>2)the back of the case doesn't fit very well together as parts of the different layers stick up more than others causing snags on clothing<br/><br/>3) the kickstand is IMPOSSIBLE to get out without using some sort of prying device. I pushed my fingernail to the limit before succumbing to defeat and using my keys.<br/><br/>4) the belt clip isn't really usable for right handed use as it orients the phone backwards on your hip. If you rotate the clip 180 degrees you then have to insert the phone from the bottom of the clip which makes me weary about wearing it.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>1) the glass screen protecter is nice and has a good real feel to it. (It doesn't however cover the entire screen. There is a small gap between screen. Protector and case)<br/><br/>Ultimately the case does the job but I was use it only temporarily.<br/><br/>(I did not contact the seller with any concerns)
 I ordered the Zizo iPhone 8-plus Red/Black Case. I shoehorn my iPh8+ in there and forego the “Tempered Glass Screen Protector” since I had a glass screen protector applied at the Apple Store. The cutout on the back of the case is location appropriate for the Camera and Flash and keep them raised up off a flat surface. The Apple logo cutout is located appropriately. The cutouts at the bottom edge of the case appear to accommodate the Microphone, Lightning Connection and the Speaker. The On-Off button is operating and effectual under the case-button. There is a size and location appropriate cut-out for the Ringer switch.  The case buttons for Volume Up and Down both operate correctly. It also appears that wireless charging is operable. If this iPh8+ is truly water-resistant, as advertised, then this is a good iPh8+ case!
 Case and holder access well designed. Unlike other cases, this case gives direct access to the phone buttons. Holder clips onto your belt and stays!<br/>After a few days of use, the part of the belt clip used in releasing the phone from the case broke due to a simple design failure. I explained the problem to the Seller so their design and fabrication can be corrected, and asked for a replacement. So far, they have said "we are sorry." No indication of a willingness to replace the case. Cannot recommend this case.
 We ordered both the orange and blue cases with black trim and both of us LOVE this case.  It's oddly light, but still a sturdier case.  It has awesome features like the kickstand or the clip on cover.  The ports all fit in the case perfectly and the phone, camera, audio, etc. all still perform as they did without the case.  While it came with a screen protector I decided to take a gamble and instead of installing the one provided, I ordered a privacy screen protector, and would say you could pretty much select any alternate screen protector you might desire.  I'm sure the one that came with it would be just fine.  I love all the options on this case - so far its my favorite case I've owned.... I love the hard cover you can add if you know you'll be throwing your phone in a bag with keys or other item that might scratch it, even with the hard cover and thin clip it still fits in my pants pocket quite well, and I love the option of the strap that comes with it.  While I don't have on the wrist strap full-time, it will come in handy next time I'm worried about dangling my phone over the railing of a cruise ship or scenic overlook.  The wrist strap attaches to the main base case, not the hard shell cover for extra security.  Oh yeah.... and one important thing I was searching for was to ensure I didn't lose the ability to charge my phone wirelessly on a qi wireless charger.  We have several different qi chargers around the house and this phone case works perfectly with all of them - I haven't even had any problems with the extra "height" or alignment - and definitely no problems with thickness.  I can't think of anything bad to tell you about this case.
 I needed a case that offered a good amount of protection and was easy to hang on to, and had a belt clip holder. This offered all, this is my second one, my first one i finally broke, I was wearing the belt holder but was holding my phone in my hand when I walked quickly past some racks in my garage and one of the hooks that hold the phone in the belt holder caught the rack and nearly stopped my in my tracks, but broke the hook off, i had been using the case for over a year doing all sorts of things Im sure your not supposed to do with it, like hanging it on my camel back chest strap with the video recording while I ride down a single track mountain bike trail, or clipping it to a tree branch to record a group of us riding by, and many other convenient used that case comes in handy for. It is easy to hang on to which I really like, and very durable, the screen protector is great and has done a great job protecting mine when things didn't go quite as planned (whoops) so with that said, not only would I purchase this again, but I have purchased it again, and would do it again :-)
 Absolutely the BEST case! I freaking LOVE it!<br/>Awesome feel, soft and great feel to the touch. It has the shock absorbing layer and nice strong protection exactly where needed. LIGHT and no excessive bulk, unusual in the heavy duty cases. Love the lanyard, really excellent. The loop for the lanyard will accommodate a key ring or carabiner too. This is actually my FAVORITE feature! There is a kickstand in both the cover, and another in the belt clip. The stand in the belt clip swivels for landscape or portrait. Another feature I love is the belt clip can be over the face of the phone or the backside. The glass screen protector is a bonus feature, but also the only thing I didn't find stellar... I think I'll upgrade to a matte screen protector, but that's such a minor complaint that I can't give it less of a star.<br/>Super pleased with this case! My husband has one of their droid cases, and is equally excellent!<br/>----UPDATE----<br/>So after just a few uses the belt clip kickstand lock cracked! The package arrived with minor damage, but everything seemed intact when I opened it... but in retrospect I think this may be the cause of the failure.<br/>Still love the case though.

The rose gold matches the color of the phone perfectly and has a nice sleek style. The kick stand is a little difficult to flip out, but with the nudge of a pen, screwdriver, nail file or other object can get it out with small effort. It was a bit difficult to get the cover on initially with the layered cover.<br/><br/>The phone has a lanyard and belt clip and actually came with a tempered glass screen cover too. My only hope would be there would be a bit more rubber padding around the screen and on the back of the case for a little more protection. Overall super happy with the item!
 Perfect case, well made and the price is unbeatable. Way cooler design than otterbox.  All the right features. Love the belt clip because the iPhone 7 plus is too big for my pocket.
 I purchased this for my husband's phone and he really liked it however, after having it a short time the clip on the holster broke.  He was getting in on the passenger side of our car, had the holster on (side to side vs upright) when it got caught on the pillar that separates the front seat from the back, breaking the clip off.  My son did the exact same thing a few days before.  They can however, order just the holster from Zizo directly for a reasonable price.  Other than this "snag" he really liked the case.
 This is a relatively sturdy case, nothing to say there. However, the so called glass ( a glorified cheap plastic ) does not even cover the entire screen, does not get into the case grooves, and much less to protect from dust or lint. You can forget water splashing. The only good thing about this is that is relatively cheap, but don't expect a real or decent screen protection.<br/>Would I buy it again ? absolutely not !
 I BOUGHT THIS CASE FOR THE MILITARY LOOKS AND PERCEIVED RUGGEDNESS. APPARENTLY THE KICKSTAND WHICH IS THE MAIN FUNCTION I NEEDED THIS CASE FOR WAS BUILT IN POORLY AND IT SIMPLY CRACKED AS I LIFTED IT UP. WILL BE ASKING FOR A REPLACEMENT. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. I SUGGEST THEY CONSIDER IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE KICKSTAND IN FUTURE UPGRADES. GIVING IT 1 STAR SINCE IT FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THE PRIMARY REASON FOR PURCHASE.
 My case arrived and all looked good till I got to the protection glass, a small section would not stick near the lower right.  I contacted the vendor through the Amazon tab.  I wanted to known if they had an easy fix not a big deal and to date I received no response.  The glass protective screen has now cracked across the entire piece.  Sadly based on the email response and the glass cracking only weeks into my purchase I wont give it more than one.  I previously had this brand case on another phone with no problems.<br/><br/>2/28/18 my inquiry about my original issue was never answered to this day.
 I was eagerly waiting for my new Bolt Case. I love the fact that you can secure a lanyard to it, very handy! The clip is also handy to watch videos but somewhat flimsy, I have stopped using it, afraid to break it. However, my biggest disappointment with this car, is that a piece broke off, and this without the case/phone even falling on the ground. Simply by it hitting a hard surface from my mattress to the wooden side board of the bed (15cm lower than the mattress). Whaaaaaat. And this is supposed to protect my expensive iPhone 7plus, are you kidding me? I am so disappointed. Plus I live in Bali and I can't get these cases here, I had this one brought over by a friend who flew from the States. So big big disappointment here! I won't buy from this company ever again nor will I recommend it. I now have to find a much more solid alternative!
 My husband (finally) upgraded to an iPhone 7 plus. He had (I'm ashamed to say) an iPhone 5 and protected it with a very expensive Otter Box. After purchasing his 7, we went to Walmart. The kid in the electronics department talked him into buying an Otter Box-like case for $70. When I caught up to him and found it was $70, we went directly to the return department. While in line, I searched Amazon and found this protective case for &lt;$18. It's a steal at that price.<br/>It does take a little more time to arrive than other prime items we've purchased before but well worth the wait.<br/>The $70 Walmart case didn't include a belt clip or protective screen cover. Both items are included in the Zizo case.<br/>My husband is completely satisfied with this case. Just be careful when putting on the screen protector. You can easily leave fingerprints between the screen and the screen protector.
 Awesome sturdy case! I was able to fit my sons 6s+ as well as my 8+. (Sticker on the package says it fits 6+ - 7+)<br/><br/>The bottom of the case has a cutout for a headphone plug and is also long enough to accommodate for the 8+’s longer speaker. The cutout for the camera is more than enough for the 6s+ Rear camera lense and just enough for the 8+ camera lense. The power button also works great on both devices. Also, came with a tempered glass screen protector, lanyard and belt clip that snaps directly into the case for extra security.<br/><br/>Only downfall is the case will not work for magnetic car mounts due to the case’s rigid, contoured surface.<br/><br/>Update: after only a little over 3 months of usage this case has ripped. (See pictures)
 I Liked the case &amp; it seemed to be of good quality until hinged clip on the belt holster broke off when I unlatched it to answer the phone, which i've had for only 4 months &amp; 3 to 5 days of use. I don't use my phone nearly as much as probably most people do, I put the phone back in the holster each time I finish using it &amp; the phone case clips back into place in the holster as designed to do. I think the holster hinge clip needs to be made of a little better material or designed differently, maybe a little bit of a design flaw, which they sell the belt holster separately without having to buy the phone case, funny but that tells me a little something !  ZIZO say's it don't have any warranty but to take a picture &amp; send it to them, which I did. They sent back a reply implying I don't take care of my things &amp; this is apart of it,  Furthermore, these cases are not indestructible. Over the course of months if not taken care of properly they will deteriorate due to wear tear and stress. If you have any other claims please feel free to email me and I would love to help you. :)<br/><br/>Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kevin<br/><br/>I believe ZIZO's customer service STINKS<br/><br/>BOB H
 Good quality<br/>Got this for 8 Plus .<br/>Apple logo is not centered in the back . May be its was not designed for 8 Plus.<br/>Other than that looks good.<br/><br/>Update after 3 months<br/>hard to take the case out and put it back<br/>stand broke in 1 month<br/>screen broke when my kid dropped the phone from 2.5 ft on a hard floor ( luckily i had extra layer of screen on top)
 Holster broke immediately. Paid $17.99 - You have to pay $6.50 to return it - and they charge you a restocking fee. By the time you pay all the fees, you're in the hole on this garbage! Disgusting! Absolutely disgusting! There is nothing "Military Grade" about this cheap plastic garbage! Get over yourself! And don't attach "Military Grade" ANYTHING to this piece of garbage!<br/><br/>Seriously, don't waste your money.
 This phone case provides more than adequate protection for the iphone. It looks good too.<br/>I found myself utilizing the the kickstand on the case quite a bit...nice feature.<br/><br/>I would have giving it 5 stars but, the on/off button pad does not line up with the button on the phone making it difficult to turn off or put in sleep mode...a bit of a pain<br/><br/>Edit: 5/26/17- after months of use, I finally reached the point of frustration with this case that I pulled it off my phone and "body slammed" it into the trash can.<br/>The sleep/wake button was extremely sensitive. While watching video, if you touched anywhere near the button it would go into sleep mode.<br/>Volume buttons became useless.<br/>Kick stand broke for no apparent reason.
 So, I thought this was going to be electric blue like in the picture but sadly it is more of a metallic/navy blue.  That said, everything else about the case is awesome.  I LOVE the kickstand.  It is wide and it is located in the center of the back which means it actually stands up (unlike other cases I've tested).  It is substantial without being too overly bulky.  It has a substantial screen lip so you can place it face down, and the included screen protector is glass and of nice quality.  It does not have an oleophobic (oil-resistant) coating like the more expensive ones which is genuinely helpful, but I cannot complain since it was included with the case.  The hip holster is nicely done as well.  It is sturdy enough that I have put my phone on my hip during two different jogs without incident.  All in all, this is a fantastic case and I am very pleased with it, I simply wish the color more closely matched the case shown here.  While it was clearly made prior to the iphone 7's release (there are comical holes on the top and lower back where they thought sensors / ports would be, it fits perfectly otherwise.  I will also mention that the port cutout on the bottom left is enlarged so you could put this on a 6S plus that still has a headphone jack no problem.
 I only gave it 4 stars because this is a case for the 6s Plus, it has a cut out of the audio jack which everyone knows the iPhone 7+ doesn't have. One cut out is larger than the other.  The description of the case is misleading, advertising the case exclusively for the iPhone 7+.  However, I still like the case even though the cut outs aren't for the model 7+.  I was looking for a tough and reliable case with belt-clip holder so, I went first on YouTube to see how it would perform on some of the most outrages, ridiculous torture the case could handle.  I was sold!  I like the fact that it comes with a belt clip holder, because; my iPhone 6s Plus was stolen from a restaurant where I was eating.  Now I have the iPhone 7+ attached to my hip everywhere I go.  The case comes with tempered glass too and with all the necessary accessories e.g.(stickers to take off the dust off the iPhone screen and to place on the screen to measure) before you install it.  If that wasn't enough, the back of the case has a stand that you can pull out when you're watching videos, totally amazing!!!!  For the price, you can't beat it!!!!!!!  I haven't had a problem yet with the back stand breaking like some other customers.
 Love this case!  While not small, it is very easy to hold and not as boxy as other drop cases. The ability to wear it on a lanyard around my neck is a great bonus. The colors are great. My husband has the orange and it's handsome. I have the gray and it is rather non-descript but sometimes you'd like your phone to blend in.  The little kickstand that pulls out is almost indestructible. I often use it as a little handle when I am reading in bed. I find only one fault with this case: that the lanyard attaches on the wrong end of the phone - should I want to read a text while on the lanyard, the phone is upside down and you have to unclip it from the lanyard to use. Put that attachment on a bottom corner and the case would be perfect.  Easy to hold. Protective. Attractive.<br/><br/>MY ONLY COMPLAINT:  Wish the attachment position for the lanyard was on a bottom corner.  If I pick up my phone while on the lanyard to read or talk, the phone is upside down.  Twisting the phone makes the lanyard too short to use effectively.
 I love my Zizo case for my iPhone 7+. The buttons are easily accessible. The tempered glass accessory is perfectly placed. The lanyard is nice and long and fits around my neck. The case kick stand is a bit difficult to release, but I'd rather have it tight than constantly flipping open/closed. I would like for the removable cover to be front or rear attaching. Not sure why it was designed to just be a front cover. Since it's not ambidextrous I will most likely rarely use the cover. Which is sort of a downer. The case grip is smooth but textured enough so as to not slip out of my hands. I've had many iPhones and competitor cases over the years and this phone case fits better than cases I've purchased in the past.  The case rim is nice and tight. I don't anticipate it getting loose or allowed debris to sneak between the case and my phone. The color choices are minimal, but I didn't mind that. I use my 7+ to watch movies and didn't want a colorful cases to take away from my movie experience. The black case is not reflective so it works perfect for my needs. The girth of the case is super slim! That makes me very happy!! Since my phone is already extra large, buying other cases could have made my phone too bulky to fit in my pocket or wallet. Not with this case. I will be recommending this cases to everyone.
 There's a jack on this case which everybody knows the new iPhone 7 plus doesn't have one (so the case isn't made for the 7 plus even though it fits) but it isn't a big of a deal because it doesn't cover the speakers but besides that the case is really good so for that I will give it a four star
 Very poor quality did not fit phone correctly the case would hold down the power button and turn the phone off I will be returning this case
 I think this is a great case, slim fit to the phone and not bulky! I got the new iPhone7 Plus and the belt holster is great for putting backwards in your front pockets of your jeans, it doesn't allow the phone to slide down into your pocket. Happy customer here! I would recommend!
 NO WAY this junk is MIL rated. Bought this case two days ago and was super excited to get it and try it out. literally 30 mins ago my son opened the kickstand and right away the guide fell off because one of the prongs snapped (Picture 2). When I tried to close the kickstand, it too fell off (Picture 1)...RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!! So disappointed. Extremely poor quality construction. The pictures are photoshopped as the blue case I purchased is dark blue and not the vibrant blue shown. The tempered glass is a stick-on and results in air bubbles despite following the instructions. My prior case, which was half the price, was much better. This case looks cool, but skip it - total junk. Zizo should have focused their money on quality construction instead of dumping it into getting MIL rated to a 12 foot drop. I do not know too many people who drop their phone from 12 feet.
 Very disappointed. I purchased this about 5 days ago. It’s advertised very well with its “military grade drop test” in the product tag line.<br/><br/>The material is a hard plastic with a light rubber grip around the edge. It’s a sleek design but the material is too rigid to withstand any serious impact. The “tempered glass” screen protector chipped in my pocket on day two, so I had to remove it.<br/>The actual hip clip is also disappointing. After it snapped in two pieces yesterday so I decided to write a review about this.<br/>The kick stand is alright if you have a very flat smooth surface, but other than that there really isn’t a good selling point on this case. It’ll probably be the next thing to break... Over all I’m very disappointed in the product itself. I guess you get what you pay for...I’ll be purchasing a different case very soon. I wouldn’t trust this thing to withstand an impact from 3 feet.. let alone 12..
 This thing is a piece of crap! I do NOT recommend buying this. Tried giving 0 stars, but the scale wouldn’t let me submit this without selecting a star. I have an iPhone 8 Plus. It offers everything I wanted, but nothing has held up...NOTHING! The frame barely lines the screen so there’s not much of a bumper, they’re practically level with one another. I looked past this thinking I was just used to bulkier styles. The plastic screen cover has 3 cracks in it in different places. The bracket that props the kickstand out just snapped off. And last night the lanyard broke at the plastic connection in a way that my husband can’t even figure out. This has all happened in less than 30 days.
 I have always been a fan of Otterbox but, when you wrap the Defender around a phone the size of the iPhone 8 Plus, it feels more like a tablet than a phone. I wanted something more compact and this Zizo Bold fits the bill nicely. I also wanted something that would survive a drop. I have never broken a screen and hope to continue that streak.<br/><br/>The ridges in the case make it easy to hold. I was unaware of the stand on the back when I purchased it. That is a nice feature that will make it easy for me to stream movies while I'm working.<br/><br/>It has a place on the case where one could attach the phone to a lariat and wear it around the neck. A lightweight lariat is included. That will be a handy feature at times when the weight of my phone in my pants pocket, under the influence of gravity, can make for an awkward situation.<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect from the protective screen. I'm accustomed to having them attach to the case. This one attached directly to the screen. It seems sturdy and I expect it to do a good job.<br/><br/>I think this is going to work out very well for me.
 Update, a year later: I have dropped this phone SO MANY TIMES. Today it fell from a 5 foot file cabinet onto a concrete floor. Zero damage. I will be buying another Zizo case next time I upgrade.<br/><br/>I was carrying my toddler out the door. He grabbed my phone and *threw* it from the height of my shoulder onto the concrete sidewalk. It hit smack on the corner, which everyone knows means shattered phone screen. But this awesome case protected it completely. It's as though nothing happened in terms of appearance or functionality. I'll admit I sort of hate the lanyard attachment at the top and I gave up on the kickstand altogether. But I bought this hoping it would protect my phone, and for the performance I saw around its primary functionality I'll live with *meh* kickstands and needless lanyard loops all day long and twice on Sunday.
 Update: Bought this case in Oct. 2017.  It is less than a year and the case kickstand is broken. This is with little use. The case itself held up on but I’m disappointed the kickstand broke so soon. Especially since that was a big reason for the purchase.<br/><br/>Other than that I am still glad I tried this case out.<br/><br/>I am using this on my iPhone 7plus.<br/><br/>The case is not bulky at all. It comes with tempered glass for extra protection.<br/><br/>The only thing I don’t care for is the place that is for attaching a lanyard or something. It makes it to where you can only put your phone in the belt clip one way.<br/><br/>Other than that it is a great case.
 Horrible case. Broke the clip on day 1. With everything ongoing with a hurricane Matthew it totally broke the entire outside of it and now within a month I need a new case where my last one (not this bran) lasted two+ years.
 Few parts. Easy to assemble. Adds some noticeable additional weight to the phone. Like the provided top left-side ring hook and like the optional bright colors for visibility. Have not dropped the phone yet and hope it never happens so I cannot rate the impact protection, but it did have good ratings. Do not know if the tempered glass screen protector makes me feel comfortable regarding screen protection, but all other phone protectors use similar covers and have good ratings. My average day is in low light dirty mechanical surroundings and at high elevations. The protection case does add to the already large size of the phone. If you use the phone for normal activity the provided belt holder clip should be fine. If your work activity is similar to mine I would recommend getting an X-Large Nite Ize Sideways Clip Case. It provides good protection and the phone with protector fits in the case. One last recommendation. When cleaning your phone lens for the tempered glass protector application, MAKE SURE everything is SUPER clean. DO NOT get any kind of dust or fibers on the lens prior to application. IT WILL BE VERY noticeable.
 I wanted to like this case, but as mentioned by everyone else, it left me wanting to buy something else. The case was clearly made for an iPhone 7 (as others have mentioned with the mic port cutout), but that's not why I'm giving it two stars.<br/>It's a cheap case. I loved the built-in kickstand, however, I've had mine for 12 days and it broke already. I have been VERY careful with it and there is no reason it should've already broken. It's just cheap plastic.<br/>I recommend looking elsewhere, especially if you're wanting a case with a built-in kickstand.
 Was hoping this case works great like for the 6 and 6s plus. Instead, none of the buttons on the case lines up with the phone. The back hole doesn’t even line up on the back phone logo. The case constantly applies pressure on the power button, making the phone wanting to turn off or randomly taking screenshots. Contacted Zizo and was advised that the wrong mold was used to make the 8 plus case.  Too bad though. Really liked the brand and case.
 Arrived earlier than expected.  Make sure to have the phone turned off because it is incredibly hard to get the case on and if you press down on the buttons on both sides of your phone you can accidentally send out an emergency call.  I had to use a screwdriver to pry the case on over the phone.  The area to shut off your phone is cover by the inner rubber case and when you depress this area no matter how hard I push I cannot get the phone to shut off, very disappointing.  The glass lens does not cover the phone glass cover 100% so there is an area there for dust, dirt and grim to collect between the case and the protective glass.  Would not recommend this product.
 This case is an incredible value. I had a checklist in mind when I was researching cases. The features that were important to me were the kickstand and the included tempered glass screen protector. That narrowed my choices do an considerably and I went with this one because the great price and the reviews. This case does everything it's supposed to do and it looks good doing it. The rubberized material is comfortable in the hand and it just feels like a high quality solid build. It's not the only heavy or bulky and it protects the phone in all the right places. I laughed when I saw the included lanyard because hanging a 7 Plus on it would be like walking around with a cinder block hanging from my neck but, surprisingly, I've used it on quite a few occasions. The lanyard has a great quick release feature, making it quite easy to take pictures briefly and then secure the phone again easily. I have not seen another case that has all of the features of this one at this price point. Couldn't be happier with it.
 I bought this for my Iphone 8 plus and the grip is wonderful, the protection is solid, the quality of the materials including the screen protector is really good... but it fits the phone so incredibly snug that it is difficult to put the phone in and take it out. I like to clean my phone out of the case on a routine basis and it is not easy to take the phone out or put it into the case. If you don't take your phone out of the case often and you need ultimate protection, then this case should be at the top of your list.
 I love these cases for my iPhone. Sturdy, have not broken a phone when dropped, flung or squished, kick stand can break if phone falls from more than 3 feet and it is open. First year of buying this was great. Second phone and 2nd case bought from this company was slightly different. The case was warped at the bottom near the home button, there was a gap, it did not fit snug and was verified to be the correct case for phone. I was only offered a $5 rebate check instead of a replacement case. I will not be buying this case again with my next new phone. Despite less than par customer service, the case serves its purpose.
 I saw this case advertised on many different sites, loved the look, and figured I'd try it out. When I received the case I was excited, but shortly after installing I was highly disappointed.<br/><br/>The first issue was the installation. The outer plastic case is very stiff, thin and is a pain in the rear to remove. Once I got the two apart I put the inner rubber piece onto my phone. Next I tried putting the outer plastic case on and once again it was a pain to get it over the volume or power buttons(considering which side you started with).<br/><br/>Once I got the case installed I was really pleased with the appearance of the case. It has a great look and very tough appearance. I started checking the button functionality and soon realized the power button wasn't getting the response it should. I found that if I touched the case, anywhere near the power button, that it would turn the phone on/off. I pulled the outer case off, once again a pain(seeing a trend here), to see if for some reason it didn't seat correctly. I put everything back on and it was still exhibiting the same issues as before. On the back of the phone, I found the plastic case wasn't seated well enough onto the rubber and it was causing the entire side to flex out. \<br/><br/>My second issue was with the kickstand on the back of the case. Once I had the case installed, I tried to pull the kickstand out and it wouldn't budge. I don't have the longest fingernails to get under the clip, but this thing was locked it tight as hell. After fiddling around with it for a bit, I had to grab a flat head screwdriver to pry this thing out. I figured maybe it was in a bind and the first time was tough. So I clipped it back into the case and had just as tough of a time getting it out the second time. This was the final straw to encourage me to box it up and send it back.<br/><br/>Just during the installation the outer plastic shell stretched enough to start causing issues right out of the gate. Then I had issues with the kickstand as well. Maybe this one incident was a fluke  but I was not pleased at all with the functionality of the case. On a positive note, I will say the appearance of the case is amazing and it does have a rugged appeal. The belt holster was also nice and seemed to be compact and sturdy enough to withstand some punishment.<br/><br/>Overall I'm very displeased and will not purchase another case from this company. They don't seem to be engineered well and not worth the money. Hopefully they make some changes and get these working better.
 A case not just designed for the 7-Plus but at least the 6-Plus as well.  Seems to provide decent shock protection, and has an attractive appearance.  The features I did not care for are related to how it attaches to the belt clip:  First, you cannot turn the phone around (screen out) and snap it in place - it is just loose.  Second, to snap the phone onto the belt clip, the screen has to be face down, and also the top of the phone can face only one direction, you cannot flip it around because the cord attachment prevents you from doing this.  At the price point this is a good buy for the protection it affords, but there are other (better) option that offers superior protection, is specifically designed for the iPhone 7-Plus, provides more robust protection and will attach to the belt clip in all 4 different configurations.
 It says it is for the 8 plus online but the packaging says 7 plus and that really what it was made for. The glass protection is not large enough to cover all of the 8plus screen and now there is a gap between the edge of the case and the glass cover. Leaves it open for particles and moisture to get the the phone. Not a good idea. I am going to get something else but now that I used this I am not sure I can return it. The case itself is nice and the belt holster seems to be built strong. It’s really to bad it is not really made for the 8 plus.
 This Zizo Bolt case is made to fit my iPhone 7 Plus very snug like a glove. The quality is excellent and I love the glass screen protector. The key to not breaking the glass during installation is PATIENCE. If you see it is not straight enough as you apply it, GENTLY pull it back off and try again. The holster clip holds the phone very secure. I recently had to purchase a whole new case with belt clip because they have altered the location of the locking phone clip from where my older case was located.
 Unfortunately I am having the same problem many did with the power button... let me just say putting the case on itself was very difficult it's very tight fitting I had to get help, once I finally got it on the power button seems to be getting pressed because of the tight fit I want to go ahead and return it but I'm honestly scared to take it off in fear my power button might get riped out! Other than that the packaging it came in was great it came with all  accessories that were promised so I'm very happy with that! It's a very nice design plus the color is great also I purchased the rose gold and it is identical to the iPhone rose gold not that cheap looking off gold color. In all it's not a bad case very sturdy and seems like it will get the job done hah<br/>I WAS NOT GIVEN ANYTHING IN RETURN FOR MY REVIEW I AM A REAL CUSTOMER!!!!
 I really like this phone case. I am constantly dropping my phone. This case has helped decrease my screen protector needs! Which is great, but I don’t use the stand on the back to watch my phone ever. I will be the annoying person who clicks it a million times. But it fell off within a month. I now have it glued into place so it doesn’t pop anymore but I didn’t like the way my case looked without that piece. I’m certain if your handy this could be something you fix easily. I’m lazy and clumsy so I don’t care to much. Well worth the price in my opinion.
 i really like the case.  in the short time i have had it i find it to be crafted very nice.  it doesn't bulk up the phone like other cases do,  it has an attractive look and design.  the only drawbacks i find is that i would like to see more of the 'accent' color.  that is the reason i purchase the bright color case is if i were to drop the phone in a dark environment i could easily see it with the brighter color.  i like the 'stand' on the case to watch whatever so i don't have to hold the phone.  also it would be nice if the case was designed to be able to 'lock' into the belt holder in any position and along with the screen facing out if wanted.  as the one i purchased can only 'lock' in the belt carrier in one position only.<br/>overall i do like the case and i would recommend this case to my friends.
 Case is somewhat bulky, but protects well. I didn't experience the power button alignment issue that others seem to be having. However, after about six months, the kickstand fell apart. I couldn't find any warranty information on Amazon, but after contacting the company, I found that you only have 30 days to get a replacement if you order from Amazon. So, after half a year, my case has a large missing piece that I'd like to use yet cannot. The case itself is sturdy and the screen protector is good, but now I have to buy a new case when cases I've bought for previous phones from other manufacturers last the lifetime of the phone.<br/><br/>When I buy my replacement, it won't be another Zizo.
 This case is affordable, has a kickstand, the clip has a secure kickstand feature as well.  The feel is a little slick, but still has a good grip.  Color is good but the quick release lanyard/loop is an add on feature that an old dude like me can’t bring myself to attach.  Not cumbersome in and out of pockets.  Time will tell if the slick becomes more tactile.<br/><br/>Update.  Hey this thing is crumbing fast.  Went to flip the ringer back on a couple days ago and lost some plastic.  Then went to actually use the stand today and dang it...not only did mechanism fail it was completely unseated.  I liked this case, I was gonna get another one and maybe one for my son,too.  I mean, what would you do?  This was on my 6S Plus I got new and still in great shape.  Case. Not so much
 I love the case, the coustomer service is absolutely amazing. I first received my first case and the holster for the phone the little button that kept the clip on was broken. I got in touch with them and they sent me a new holster at no charge. I would suggest to them they need to redesign the plastic clip that holds the belt clip to the holster. It’s just to brittle of material I inspected the broken peices and they seem like they are Made of ABS plastic which is a fragile plastic I could be wrong but for a part that requires movement and spring a PVC part or even a peice that’s metal would be cost effective. Metal parts they sell the exact part that would make this product a replacement for any otter box case. Also when putting your phone in the case it’s importanr to move the rubber around so the phone fits in perfectly otherwise the power button will be pressed but it’s easy to do and it just requires a lot of time. So far my phone has dropped about 5 feet and there is no damage to the phone or the case. The kickstand after a few movements gets easier to use and is really handy. The lanyard also a great addition be sure to install the lanyard with the metal ring and not the he detachable part. The detetachanle part is likely meant for a stylus or possibly something like a “Tile”.
 I like. Dropped phone a couple times already, no damage. Love the bright orange, makes it easy to locate, but the texturing and lines make it look just like a basketball in person. Kickstand is a little hard to pop out, but that means it won't flop out when not needed. Still fits in a back pocket, but I don't wear skinny jeans, it might not if you do. What I am saying is its pretty big, but I don't like small phones or cases. The back also has a lot of texture, I prefer textured cases for the grip. Find myself rubbing the seams or the rivet heads. Only negative I noticed was the apple logo is not entered in the cutout. I don't care, but some people might.
 This case is great very strong , it is a great protection for the phone but the only down side was the glass protector which it was design for I phone 7plus it doesn’t work for 8 plus it is just a bit small for the iPhone 8plus , when I got the item I was going to send it back but then I decide it to stay with it because I like it the rest of the case I love the color and the facts that is very good case for my expensive iPhone 8+ so now you got at least 4 star instead of 5 but if the glass would have fit more closer i would have giving you high 5
 Just got my IPhone 7+ today, after having this case sitting around for almost 3 weeks.  Amazon compared to Apple.<br/>Anyway, this is a nice case overall.  It seems pretty rugged overall, but i guess the first time it is dropped we will see on that.  The red is a bit duller than I wanted, but still a nice shade of red.  Good value for the money<br/><br/>The only bitch I have out this case is the button overlays could be better cutout a little deeper/better.  The plastic power button would not even depress the power button on the iPhone when you pressed.  After looking at it a bit, I determined it was just too stiff to properly depress the actual button on the phone.  I removed the phone and cut with a exacto knife the top and bottom of the plastic button on the case a bit.  Really just sliced it along 2 of the four edges.  Then the plastic case button was free enough to move and depress the button on the phone.  So still happy with this case.
 I ordered six different cases with different levels of protection. I like this one the best for the grip and aesthetics. It is a little heavy but is understandable with the amount of protection case provides my phone. I probably will not use the belt clip.  I find that when I sit down any belt clip ultimately catchers on a chair or the arm of the couch or something and It may breakI was going to give it only four stars because of the weight but added protection to the phone as weight so I cannot be unfair and only give it four stars because of weight because of weight. I feel my phone is secure now
 First let me say that I am a HUGE believer in a case being useless if it doesn’t maintain clicky buttons. Why put a case on your phone if it doesn’t feel like your phone you paid hundreds of dollars for? That is the first thing I love about this case. The buttons still feel great. The screen protector also is quality and went on without bubbles (just be very careful). Finally I think it looks great and is slimmer than the otterbox defender but just as protective and cheaper! I got the blue and black version and am very happy with it. If I could make a request I would ask that they make the camera cutout fit more closely to the actual modular, instead of a large whole, but I know that is just so it will also fit an 8plus. (I have a 7 plus). Overall, after trying many many cases I have settled on this one and am very happy!
 First one was the wrong part. Asked to return and it will cost me more than $6.00 to return. Received the one I just ordered, is the right part, however the holster is clumsy and difficult to put the phone back into. I really hate this product, poor design. I would like to return it also, but not worth the cost to return. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
 Case looks nice but was badly engineered. Cheap plastic and hard rubber. The lock button on the case doesn't work, it results in the phone case being unusable, so it was money straight down the drain
 It's an awesome product but apparently isn't made for iphone 6 anymore. I ordered by clicking "order again" without reading clearly enough the size and therefore must return. But I have one on my phone now I'll have to try to clean up as the softer rubber parts at the corners have darkened from use/dirt and won't wash clean (the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5). On the lookout now for something as well made and similarly priced since Zizo no longer accommodates my particular phone.
 I wanted to give this a 5 star but...the power down button on this does not really connect with my new Iphone 8plus.  The other buttons work and align perfectly.  The tempered glass is outstanding.  The feel and lightweight is great.  I purchases the gray and white combo.  I love the color and this case does feel like it will withstand some abuse.  I am always careful with my phones and have never broken any of them.  This is how...I buy good quality cases.  I wish the power button aligned better with my new beautiful phone.  I have to return this one and keep looking.  I think it probably made for the 7 plus only.
 This is a rebranded iPhone 6 Plus case that does not operate the side power button. It is misleading to sell this as an iPhone 7 Plus case. I was originally upset because it would not operate the power button. I am lowing the rating by an additional star because the textured back is pealing off after less than a month of use. The case design is a good idea but the quality is very poor.
 Looking at the case I was thinking it would have a much more comfortable feel.  It would have been easy to do if the ribs were of a softer material, but it's a hard plastic and doesn't do much for comfort.  On the other hand it has protected my phone during falls and the ridges to make it hard to accidentally drop.  The plastic on the belt clip broke right away, although I had only been planning on using that to clip onto a holder in my car so it wasn't a big deal, could be a deal-breaker for some though.
 Neon green stripe with black for iPhone 7 plus. Nice color combo. First thing I did not want was the hokey belt clip, so with two screwdrivers popped that horrible thing off. What is left is the plastic piece to go over the glass with a hole in it from clip. Sticker on it covers hole. The plastic cover tho is a hairline too short to the right edge and the plastic cover could potentially touch glass. Plan on putting in purse so it will be ok. Just wanted an extra layer of glass protection. The back cover piece is nice and soft touch. Kickstand is ok but don't expect it to last long since it's only plastic. Buttons fit well on 7plus phone and no fit problems. You cannot flip the plastic cover over and snap on other side as the clip is slightly off from the divots to catch the clip shut.  Now the gold one we also ordered you can put the plastic glass cover on either side. Maybe they figured it out on the newer colors to center the divots for the plastic cover to be on either front or back. Yes overall it is an acceptable cover for iPhone 7 plus. It looks huge and bulky but it's actually pretty slim.
 I was immediately disappointed when I first used it. To my dismay the phone will only load face in the holster. Each time I use it whether I answer a call or access an app the phone has to be removed from the holster--a royal inconvenience. I have ordered another unit (after making sure the phone will load face in or out.) It's a shame too as this appears to be a well constructed and robust unit. What was its designer thinking by limiting the way the phone can be placed in the holster?
 Over all I was moderately pleased with the case. The screen protector was easy to install and the phone was relatively easy to get in the case.<br/><br/>That's when the problem started. The case fits so tight that the rubber of the case was keeping the sleep wake button on the side of my new iPhone 7 depressed so in essence I couldn't put my phone to sleep. This was a significant problem as I go long periods without being able to chg my phone so once I was done with it. I couldn't put the phone to sleep before putting it back in my pocket.<br/><br/>I didn't have the time to return the case and chose another so in an effort to make it work I've cut the rubber sleep wake button out completely and have to put the tip of my finger down in the hole to put my phone to sleep.<br/><br/>I'll probably be shopping for another case in the near future.
 So refreshing to find such quality and flawless design in a fair-priced product.  This is not some cheaply made gizmo; it is a very solid, protective and functional phone case that I am pleased to use and own.  You get your $'s worth here with Zizo Bolt.  Nothing left to say except I can see me buying only Zizo stuff for any phone I acquire in the future.  In fact, I'm going to their website to see what other products they make.
 4 stars is plenty. Fits snug, also fits 6+.. some of the rubber bumpers have already fallen off, like mute and volume... but poor design., other than that, color selection is spot on. Camera and light is not affected, the phone sits inside the case and is not flush so laying face down your good. The belt clip only goes on one way, takes time getting used too, reason is they have a lanyard you can clip to the phone but it's molded to the case corner., why they can't design it to be more discrete is beyond me.  Then if you take the belt clip off your belt and play with your phone. You CAN NOT clip your phone to your case. The holes used to secure your phone simply do not line up, which is mind blowing.... so you get to hold onto 2 things vs 1.... I will see how long it last as friends give it 2 months..
 I needed a case in a hurry to protect my new phone. A quick search showed this case as a good deal. With prime shipping it showed up on time. But once I got it...<br/><br/>Pros. Gives some level of protection. Looks good in the picture. Very well priced once you factor in the tempered glass screen protector.<br/><br/>Cons. Doesn't fit iphone 7 plus as well as it should. I'm not too hung up on aesthetics, but the injection molding process is either a hit or miss. This one is close to a hit... Close. It is physically hard to get to case off, and on. I wasn't sure I wouldn't damage the phone just getting the phone in and out of the case. The softer cover is not very pliable, and after wrestling the outer hard plastic shell on. I noticed little things like the power button was held down. Took the case off and on a dozen times to make sure it was positioned correctly. I came at it from every angle making sure it wasn't just me. Finally I just ended up taking my dremel and sanding down the inside of the power button about .02"/.51mm. It's still tight, but at least it isn't constantly holding the button down now. The volume buttons felt good, but the hard shell doesn't meet up with the soft shell very well at that point. Also the hard plastic shell by the Apple logo is ill fitting. One side sticks up, the other down. I had to bend it back and forth, tweaking it here and there to improve fit. The kick stand has a very positive snap holding it down when not in use. So positive in fact that it is a pain to open it back up. Lastly, the holster is not omnidirectional. The phone only locks in to it one way, and that sucks. \<br/><br/>All in all, for just under $20 it will work until I can replace it with something better.
 4/5 stars.<br/>Reasons: Great case, love how it is set up, love the color orientation, etc. Built in kickstand is a nice feature too. Protects the phone pretty good.<br/>Downsides: Case doesn't allow for items such as the magic mount pads to be placed on it, and  case is too thick for magic mount to work through it. Also, if the device gets hot, so does the case. And when the case gets hot, it gets hot and will retain that heat for a while, not really allowing the phone to cool. All Zizo cases (from amazon or the website as long as it's sold by zizo) have a limited lifetime warranty for manufacturer defects. Well, unfortunately, both Zizo bolt cases (1 for iPhone 6, one for iPhone 7+) have had their kickstands break. My iPhone 6 zizo bolt cases kickstand broke no joke after 3 uses. It wasn't built good at all. my iPhone 7+ case lasted way longer and was built better, but it still broke within a month. Both times were manufacturer defects as both times the little metal rod snapped. When I contacted Zizo about it, they said it wasn't covered under warranty. So much for a warranty at all. That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. Want it for protection? That's what the 4/5 is for. Don't bother with the extras as they won't warranty it.
 Bought this before getting the iPhone 7. Did a lot of research on cases. So glad I picked this one. First it has a really cool look to it. Second is how thin it is. Third as how easy to was to install on the new phone. This came with the screen protector and that was a cinch to put on too. Finally,  is the belt clip is outstanding it really secures my phone at work. You will not be disappointed on buying this product.
 This item looks great!  But that’s about where the pros end. Cons. Kickstand is upside down, so when you use it the volume buttons are down and unusable. You can only clip the phone into the holster screen in because there are no holes for clip on the other side and the lanyard hoop is in the way also. They say it passes a military drop test, maybe. But the clip on the holster that snaps the phone in broke after four months. There website says “most” of there products carry a 1 year warranty, but their “military tough “ model only has a 90 day warranty. They would not replace it or let me return it. Not a happy shopper. Spend a few extra bucks and go another route.
 Being from the Military I thought this case was going to be perfect. I was wrong I should have went with an otterbox. So far the kickstand has fallen off and I dropped my phone from less the 4 feet it landed on the back and now I have all these colored lines all over my phone. So it did not work for impact protection it still created a pressure crack from inside the screen. So needless to say Im out $200 because I have to replace my screen now or use my deductible for a refurb phone. I wanted to like this case but it is not worth it.
 The case where the camera is isn’t large enough and u should add a camera lense protector so the camera has no chance of scratching since yesterday I barely bumped my camera and now it is shattered .the case was extremely hard to get on where the side buttons are my husbands case is still not all the way on where the left double side button .the only reason I’m not returning the case is because I figure a tiny bit of protection is better than none . I will be getting a Otterbox for out I phone 8 plus phone .the reason I got this case is because it say military drop tested and the style is amazing and Otterbox had nothing I wanted .when I purchase a product I read reviews and I look for durability first and style second .it seems this case only has style as for me at this moment I can’t say on much else since I only had the case for a few days I wil be giving a second review
 I have two new iPhones - iPhone 8 &amp; iPhone 8 Plus. Ordered these cases from Amazon. When they came no listing for iPhone 8 &amp; iPhone 8 Plus on the package????? - Only iPhone 7 &amp; 7 Plus. Went ahead and tried both cases. Now the iPhone side buttons (left and right) will not function when inside the cases! Apparently there is some slight differences in the 7 &amp; 8 series. Should have listened to the reviews as others had mentioned this. Will be returning both unless you have a solution?
 ...many friends tell me is a bulky case, my answer is the my iphone 7 plus is a large cell phone itself, so it's not the case that makes it seem big, if you care for miniatures you should choose another cellular any way. Now about protection it offers, it is bullet proof !!! has the potential to cover the glass if need be which you can remove if you want to reduce size (i never do it), absolutely attractive colors, came with a 9h hard protection screen cover, and after almost a year using it not only my cell phone is preserved brand new, but the case it self has not even a scratch on it, though it was drooped several times down. All buttons operate well (you just have to push them with more pressure than normal) and all in all I very satisfied with this case, I would buy it again with no hesitation at all.
 I've read a ton of reviews on this case, here's mine.  Fast shipping , arrived no issues. Color (rose gold) true to picture.  I purchased for my iPhone 6+s and descriptor when shopping said it fit ipone6+s but after purchase descriptor read for iPhone 7/8 (possibly issue with description coding on website) so I was a little concerned.  it arrived in box labeled for iPhone 6+s.  install tempered glass faceplate, removed belt clip from frame, literally snapped phone in then snapped belt clip on.  all of above took maybe five minutes with no issues.  all access points line up and external buttons work flawlessly.  hole to display apple logo on back of phone is ever so slightly off (you'd need a micrometer and it's not to the left or right, it's a smidge high of center, MORE THAN ACCEPTABLE).  I'll be giving it a wear test tonight at work (heavy physical work in 0-F degree temps, will post my followup field test later.  So far, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  Extremely happy with purchase.
 Haven't tried dropping my brand new phone yet to test that, but installation was pretty easy. I like the non-slip feel to the case and the nice color. The case feels and looks pretty durable. One thing I would say is that the included tempered glass screen cover was 1-2mm short on all edges. It covers the entire video portion of the front, but not the entire glass part so an edge is visible. Not a big deal for me, just pointing it out.<br/><br/>What did bug me though was that the short length of the  included lanyard and position of the lanyard loop on the top left, makes it essentially unusable. Hanging around your neck, the strap will be across your field of vision, and you aren't able to hold the phone at a comfortable distances from your face. I swapped that out for a hand lanyard I had from an old camera I wasn't using, and that works much better. I think if there were a lanyard loop on the bottom right corner, and a longer neck lanyard, that would be an improvement. Or an additional shorter wrist lanyard. One of the selling points of this case was the lanyard attachment for that added security.
 Item looks really nice. However, it arrived damaged. The sliding piece in order to be able to hold the case up in order to view video etc. was broken. By the time I finally tried to install and realized it was broken, it was @ Day 27-28. I emailed them, and got a response saying that it could take 72 hours for a response. They then waited until Day 30-31 to respond, and told me it was past the time, and they wouldn’t replace. Good price but super disappointing. Seems like it would be a good product, at a great price if it hadn’t been broken. Poor customer service
 The glass protector and case have done an amazing job protecting my phone. I wasn't expecting this level of protection from a brand I had never heard of before. The Iphone 7 plus fits perfectly, and the glass protector was easy to install. The kick stand for watching movies has been of some use, but if you don't use it, you don't notice it... the only annoying part is the attachment for the lanyard.. I would think a large phone like this would be too heavy to carry comfortably around my neck.<br/><br/>Update : the area between the mute switch and the volume control broke for no apparent reason. I emailed the seller, and the company. Since I have owned the case more than 30 days they will not replace the case or help me out in anyway. I should have put the money I spent on this case towards an otter box.
 I've owned Lifeproof &amp; Otterbox iPhone cases in the past and paid a fair amount of money for them. I preordered an iPhone 7+ and needed a case for it before its arrival. I did a lot of research (sometimes I over research things). After reading several reviews and watching a lot of YouTube videos, I decided on the Zizo Bolt. What a great value this case is. The phone fits into the case snugly and the power and volume control buttons match up perfectly. Just by holding this case in your hand, you know it's a quality product. The included screen protector is a surprise considering the price. At Verizon, they charge over $40 for a screen protector. Maybe it's a better protector, I don't know.  That said, I paid half that price for the case and screen protector. The kickstand is a nice touch. It's difficult to get the kickstand out at first but after a few repetitions, it loosens up. Overall, a great case with a unique style.
 Not a fan of this case at all. It's strange because I had the Zizo Bolt Cover for my iphone 6 plus previously. This one however seems to be a complete miss. When putting my phone into it, it constantly shuts it off because of holding down the sleep/wake button. The case itself looks wonderful, but does not perform how I expected it to. I had to return it unfortunately, I was really looking forward to having another bolt cover for my 7 Plus. :(
 I got this case and when I put it on my iPhone 7 Plus it didn't fit it was to small. It's so tight that the case makes the phone turn on and off by itself, so I think this case is not designed for iPhone 7 Plus
 I was all gassed to get this and I came with a screen protector!! Big up on that but this has a holster cop and a clip to keep the holster clip open??? Well that broke! How idk then the pin on the clip came out son now it’s useless and I’m back to putting the phone in my pocket which is what I was tryin to get away from...I gotta send this back👎🏿
 Cool looking but the red plastic is so hard the rt side button to lock the phone didn't work. Tried cutting 2 and then 3 of 4 thin areas free around that button to just use as a pivot hinge but ended up removing the right side button cover entirely leaving her a hole to put her fingernail into.  Also, the screen protection glass is considerably smaller and literally floats/slides around the screen. It doesn't even touch the case or edge of the phone screen.  Thumbs down to that.  I do like the corner thingy for the neck lanyard  they do include a thin one.]  With so many other cases that are typically cheaper, I'd have thought this would have been of better design.
 I’ve had one of these for a year and a half now but I lost the top cover with the clip on it. I ordered a new one And unfortunately when I put it on my belt clip for the first time at Broke immediately. I suspect it came broken from the factory since I couldn’t find any of the broken pieces anywhere. Very disappointed however I did order a new on broke immediately. I suspect it came broken from the factory since I couldn’t find any of the broken pieces anywhere. Very disappointed however I did order Another one since my first one lasted so long and it was so well-built. We’ll see what happens with the replacement.
 Okay, having a joyous ride on my recumbent Carrie e-bike and hear dragging sounds. My iPhone in Zizi case came out pocket and was dragging, without front cover. Reeled iPhone in, stopped...can’t find a scratch, divot or smudge. That was an asphalt drag and phone safe, case safe crazy cool. Great case, well had copy of this case on past iPhone and did kill the little kickstand.. Who cares though when an asphalt drag protected an expensive Apple phone. Love the case, Amazon power to our bucks and being a Prine Member. All the gold standard!
 This phone case arrived faster than expected and I was very surprised at the quality. It was expertly packaged, something I'd expect for a case costing much more. The installation instructions for the case and screen protector were simple. As in previous reviews, I did have an issue with the power button inadvertently shutting off the phone. I shaved down the inside of the button with a pocket knife &amp; now it works perfectly. The case fits like a glove, feels good in your hand, &amp; doesn't slide off smooth surfaces. Overall, it's a fantastic case. I don't understand how they sell it so cheap, but it goes to show the mark-up the big name brands have.
 I bought the case because it seemed to be durable, it is not at all.  I still have it in my phone - it is in pieces and pieces are missing. The kick stand is worthless and poorly made, flimsy.  The plastic is broken or cracked on all sides. Now...I am rough on a phone, 2-4 foot drops sometimes. BUT...this case advertises that it is able to withstand this rough treatment.  As you can see in the pictures it is broken everywhere.  I will say the case is damaged...my phone is not.  30 day warranty...I emailed the seller and they told me to contact the manufacturer. WOW....customer service is no longer available, they just want your money.
 Initially if you do your homework and pick out the correct size for your phone nothing should go wrong. Well, the clear shield had a hair or some fuzzy line running in the lower half and it appeared UNDER the clear screen. Shouldn't be a problem to peel up and wipe it...well, the line was imbedded in the plastic during its process of forming, so I had to buy another one. Maybe you should include sandpaper instead of an alcoholic wipe.<br/>Otherwise, OK
 But it is a nice case for the money.  Two days after buying it and placing on phone with their screen protector, I dropped the phone 3 feet on to my laminate floor (corner landing).  The screen protector cracked quite a bit, so I guess it did protect the screen, however, I was surprised the shock still carried into the phone so much when the corners should have enough shock protection to handle this.  I am now not rally confident that this will protect my phone with just the main case on (might start using the clip cover as well).
 I have only had this case since April of 2018 and I bought 2 cases.  The have both broken.  I had some damage to the case after I have dropped my phone it was on the back and it ended up being sharp.  The other case the stand broke off and he also ened up with the case breaking as well and this is after haveing them for about 5 months.  One of the phones ended up with a broken screen and we were not happy about that at all.  But the other phone was ok.
 The colors are very vibrant and awesome, and the material feels very strong and durable. However, I guess the case that I received wasn’t manufactured correctly. It took me almost ten minutes to get it on my iPhone 8 Plus, and then even longer to take it back off because it was smashing the volume and lock buttons down. It looked like the button covers weren’t molded for my phone, and I couldn’t control my phone buttons through them. It really seems like an awesome case to rely on, but I got the one mess-up ):
 After much research and deliberating I chose the orange Zizo cover for my new iPhone 7 plus. I am SO happy with my choice! I like that it feels substantial in my grip and the color makes it easy to find. The phone seemed too thin and slippery before and I felt like I was about to drop it!! It seems to be designed properly for the 7plus...I know some reviews said it wasn't in regard to the outlets. Maybe they updated that. My only issue I had was all my fault. I twisted the clip on the outside black case part thinking it would rotate and it broke off. Oops. But when on the phone, that black holder covered the camera lens so I probably would never have used it anyway. I'm all about taking pictures at a moments notice!  My favorite part is the ability to have a lanyard attached to it. It allows me to carry my phone when on a dog walk without fearing I will drop it when I lean over and clean up after him. I carry it by the lanyard much more than I expected I would.  I'm planning on replacing the included one with an Auburn lanyard so it matches my orange cover perfectly!! My older sons have already looked into getting one themselves. So that's probably the greatest review of all!
 I just received my phone case this afternoon. It got here really fast and was packaged very well. I bought the rose gold color and I think it’s really pretty. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is because one of the tiny pins from the kick stand flew off the 1st time I tried to use it. Not a big deal though...probably wouldn’t have used it much anyway. Overall I think this is a good product and would recommend it to anyone needing a good, sturdy &amp; protective phone case.
 I have owned a number of these and have bought them for family members. This one has been the worst . It started cracking from the belt clip holder hooks and then broke at that point so without a fall the orange hard casing is just breaking off .
 I’ve had mine for 6 months and it’s as new.  The package came with a tempered glass screen protector.  My phone has been dropped so many times I’ve lost count.  Just the other day, I dropped my phone and hit one of my kids’ toys.  The tempered glass broke but my phone remains intact.  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone.  This is an excellent product with great quality.
 Received the case today on a Sunday, great shipping I must say, the case fits IPhone 7+ perfect has a good lip for screen protection and the volume and power buttons are very tactile to press, not stiff which is surprising in a heavy duty protective case. Has great grip as well, packaging also included a Zizo branded lanyard which I did not expect but is great. Also came with a glass screen protector, I personally do not use them but is great for those that do. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and for the price and quality you just can't beat it.
 I've always gone with otterbox since I bought my first iPhone many years ago. With small kids, it's crucial to have a case that is impact resistant and helps shatterproof the screen. Over the past couple of years, that company has been truly challenged by only a couple (in my eyes) that could measure up to their standards. Well, just as it appears that otterbox is skimping on some essentials and really dating themselves, this company- Zizo- is picking up those who otterbox has been left wanting. I'm one of those such customers. I really appreciate the lighter weight with the same protection and the texture I've been looking for. There could be more variety and colors, but I will wait as they claim to be progressive. The one thing I don't like is the stand on the back- it's near impossible to release it without some sort of special tool. This is quite frustrating and could be easily remedied with some sort of access slot/port for a finger. Hoping they will update the next case to fix it. Also, some new and interesting texturing and colors are much needed. LOVE that tempered glass is included!! Just waiting for my jet black 7plus to arrive in 2 days and can fit the case to the phone. I've been trying it out on my 6 plus in the meantime and it fits this one great.
 I purchased this case in white for my iPhone 8 plus after my husband bought one in black for his 7 plus months ago and it has held up well.  It fits the 8 plus perfectly, BUT the the molding on the volume buttons on the inner case were warped slightly and also made differently than the black case.  The white case did not have the little slits cut in the case next to the volume buttons which made the volume up extremely difficult to push.  The warping on the volume down button made it keep the volume down pressed continually which meant the sleep button would not work because you can’t use the sleep button and shut your phone off while pushing a volume button.  So it was essentially useless as shipped. Note I did put my 8 plus in my husbands black case and everything worked perfectly so the problem was not the slight difference between the 7 and the 8.  We were able to get the white one working with some modifications.  We had to heat and remold the plastic to the proper shape and also cut slits to make the buttons pushable so at least we avoided the hassle of returning it.  As a case I do love it now that it works but the quality inconsistency was frustrating.
 It took a lot for me to only give this case only 1 Star, I had this case for my 6 Plus and loved it! I had the same case for 2 years and it still looked great! I upgraded to a 8 Plus so I logically opted to get the same case, figures that this was the only time I didn’t check reviews! I just opened the package and was pleased that nothing apparent had changed. I turned my phone off so I wouldn’t activate SOS and put the case on, that’s when the power and volume button issue became apparent.<br/> I’m really bummed out because I love this case, but I can’t deal with button issues. I may just return it and modify my 6 Plus case, I was using it until this case came in and other than the camera being blocked it was functional.<br/> Sorry for the bad review, but it’s close isn’t cutting it. If the issue is resolved I’ll be back!
 I was desperate to get a protective cover on my new iPhone 7 plus. Normally, I would purchase a Griffin survivor but they are not available yet for this phone. So, when I spotted this cover, I decided to try it even though I would prefer a waterproof case. I ordered the white and the gold not knowing which color I wanted. I put the white cover on my new phone and it fits perfectly. The case does not have a feminine appearance to it but neither does the Griffin. I love having the strap that allows me to carry the phone hanging from around my neck when I move through the house. This is especially good for me as I am handicapped and in a wheel chair. I would give this five stars except the clip attachment doesn't work well. It covers the face of the phone and I will not use it.
 I have had the opportunity to use this case on my new iPhone 7plus for a couple of weeks to evaluate it. As a past otter box user and fan, I am very please with this purchase! I decided to try this case because of the color, kick stand and price. This case is very functional. The phone does not protrude to far from my side when on its belt clip. This is important to me because it does not get pushed off my belt when I sit down at my desk on sit in an airline seat. The kick stand is nice to watch movies while sitting on a flight with the food tray down or prop on my desk while I work to catch a text without having to constantly unclip. The material and design of the case keeps the phone from slipping out of my hands by accident. I love the bright color because it helps me not forget my phone in my vehicle when I get out because the interior is black and the phone does not blend in to the interior color. I have not dropped the phone yet to evaluate how impact resistance it is because it does not slip out of your hand as easily because of the spiral design. I would highly recommend this case. When it is time to replace the case on any of my family's phones, I will buy them this case. Great case for the price!
 Thank you for making a case that is good quality and affordable. I gave a four star because the first one I ordered had a cracked screen protector. I received credit back and returned product. I've had the second now for two weeks and like it very much. The one con is the kickstand, it's hard to open once locked into place and if u don't move the support arm while closing the kickstand it stick and I could see this breaking in the future. All in all im satisfied with the price and product and would recommend buying.<br/><br/>Update: pin in case came out halfway had to push back in with pliers and screwdriver. would recommend bending end on pin the sticks out of hinge clip. this will keep the pin from sliding out easily.
 The case itself has held up great and has protected my phone I have dropped my phone several times and it has not been damaged<br/>The pull out stand on the back of the case has not held up the pin holding the stand at the top has pull through on both side and will not stay in  It pops out on it's on getting caught on clothing and on the pouch I keep my phone in while working.<br/>Good case but bad design on the stand the stand has broken off completely didn't last a year of use. I'll be looking for a better case probably go back to Otterbox.
 This is the best clip-on case I have had for my iPhone 7+. The case is not as bulky as the Otter and other cases I have had. The phone case fits securely on the clip-on.<br/>I like having a clip-on because the phone is always accessible.  When the phone is in my purse or fanny pack it’s hard to reach before the caller hangs up. If it’s clipped on, I always know where the phone is.<br/><br/>I am changing my review As the holster broke again. This one only lasted from May until September 6.<br/><br/>This is the third Zizo I have had.  I took one star away because this the second time part of the clip on broke off.  I am outside the majority of the day working on our 10 acres or hiking.<br/><br/>I would buy again in spite this issue.
 This is the second case I have ordered.  Same case, for a new (family member) phone.  I had no problems with the case I ordered for my phone but, with this one, the screen cover would not stay in place.  There was no way to receive a replacement screen cover, so my options were to send back the entire case, and order a new one, or just find another way to replace the screen cover.  Very frustrating to have a new phone in the hands of my teenager but not have full protection on the phone.  Especially since I ordered the case ahead of time so we would have it ready for the phone.<br/><br/>Note:  I have had no problems with the case on my phone, except that the piece on the back used for propping up the phone snapped off.  The case is a pretty good case but there should be a way to get a replacement part rather than having to send back the whole case.  I could not find a way to contact the shipper directly.
 It’s very sold material. Tough to put on. I can only imagine how tough it will be to take it off. This not good protection for the phone my iPhone. My phone fell off my lap as I was getting out my car and the screen cracked. This only a decent purchase for show only not for protection.
 I love these cases , had a life proof , don't waste your money , get a sizo , for a fraction of the price you get a really superior product , looks much more stylish with multiple color choices, has a  kickstand , better grip , and comes with clip and is very sturdy , my last sizo withstood me falling on It from the back of a moving truck , that's 230 lbs 6ft up onto concrete and not a scratch on the phone , I didn't fair so well , I usually don't leave reviews but I back this product that much , get one , you will not be disappointed
 So far great, I bought this case because Otterbox did not have the case for my I phone 8 plus available before my new phone was delivered. Easy install, it works with magnetic charging mat ( big Plus) ,DOES ITS JOB! I had the phone in this case ,and in less than 48 hours of owning the phone dropped it 3 times...no damage to phone! Color almost matches my phone color (I don’t really care about those things) kick stand a plus though I have not used it yet. Don’t know about the belt clip won’t use it.Bottom line DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO AT A BETTER PRICE THAN OTTER BOX
 I have an iPhone 7 Plus. The Zizo phone case itself is nice. I like sleek design so that my phone isn't all bulky. I've had similar cases so I know by looking at and holding this one that drop-protection is covered. Easy to get your phone in by simply sliding in one corner and applying pressure around phone to slip the rest of it in. No hassle.<br/><br/>The included glass screen protector is NOT for an iPhone 7 Plus. The glass is too wide and not long enough as shown in the picture. Trying to make this included screen protector work "to get by" is not even an option. I'll assume it's an employee oversight oversight as the case and holster are perfect.<br/><br/>All in all the pro's of this case and holster are outstanding. Heavy duty belt clip, sleek/protective case with no "sticky" rubber to stick to your pockets if you don't use the holster and it has a kickstand. Excellent coloring as well. I chose Gold and it was true to what was pictured. 4-Stars because of the screen protector being a bust.
 Bought this for my husband as he works in construction. He is up and down ladders and around heavy equipment. He loved the design and color of the case. It is lighter than the 'other' case he had before, and much more affordable! It came quickly (love Prime!!) and he is very happy with it! The seller emailed me and asked how we like it. He said they are a small second generation family run business... I LOVE that, as we are a small family owned business as well, in construction. Great case! Great price! And it will definitely protect my hubby's new 7 plus!
 My son uses my phone a lot  to watch videos where my back screen cracked. I immediately looked at Amazon to check which one would be best to protect my phone. I kept coming back to this one. So far, it’s been really durable. My son hasn’t dropped my phone yet but it seems like this will be my last phone case. My only problem was I thought I purchased and ordered a red one but when I opened my package, I was kinda disappointed that it’s black (just preference). It has nothing to do with the case. I wasn’t sure if I could return it but it works fine. It’s just too manly for a girly girl like me.
 I had a case that I bought from Verizon,for $50.00 and no one was able to hear me on the phone. I was a nice case but not very friendly to my phone. A friend suggested ths case which I love I maight add it was much cheaper also much more attractive, has a kickstand which previous did not. well worth the money arrived quickly good packaging. Would highly recommend this case and I will buy again. also the case was recommended by the Verizon associate. So once again they do what is best for their bottom line and not their customers.  if I can find the case for the case I replaced I will list so no one else makes the same mistake.
 I love it!  When I 1st bot the phone, the only case they had was this monstrous box type cover. I was disappointed, but I almost bot it due to my being impatient. Luckily I held off.  So I then I searched Amazon &amp; this was the perfect one for me! It has a kickstand &amp; a belt clip which was a must. I don't always carry a purse &amp; am against putting my phone in my pocket. An added bonus, a tempered glass, a strap long enuf for U to wear around ur neck &amp; loop on the case where U can loop the strap thru were all included!  To top it off the price was so low I wanted to stock up, but it's so durable I doubt it if I'll ever need another.  The only thing that could have been better, is if the kickstand would work vertically, too. TY Zizo!
 I LOVE this case!  It's identical to the Otterbox cases I've had before but significantly cheaper (in price, not quality).  Not to mention, it already comes with a piece of tempered glass to install that is normally an additional expense with the Otter cases.  I don't really use the belt buckle style clip, so I can't comment on that much.  The military OD green/camo color is by far the coolest case I've had, and I also ordered the bright orange case as a back up.  Pretty crazy I can have two cases for cheaper than one otter box.  I've already dropped my phone down the concrete stairs once and then it fell out of my pocket while I was sitting down and neither the case nor screen is damaged in the slightest.  The ports are easy to access and you don't have pieces of the case you have to bend or peel to get to them.  The flip stand on the back was a little difficult to open initially but after a few times it opens and closes (snaps back in place) very easily.  I will be sticking with this case and probably ordering the red and black one as well.  Great job Zizo, wonderful case.
 I had a black version of this case and really liked it. However the clip on cover fell off my car roof and snapped a lug off on the road.<br/>I then purchased this red version.<br/>Arrived fairly quickly- am in New Zealand so a fair distance to come!<br/>I found that this case was really difficult to get on my phone. Whereas the black one wasn't.<br/>The clip on cover clips on, but is slightly loose- it won't fall off, but it's a bit rattly, not a big deal!<br/>I ended up deciding to remove it. Well- that was as difficult as putting it on. I was afraid the phone might bend too much or the buttons be damaged. They weren't and the phone is fine.<br/>I won't put that case back On Though.<br/>It's pretty and looks good on and is wickedky good protection for the phone, if you're leaving the phone in it forever, it'll be fine. But if like myself, you some times like a change of case, you might want to consider alternatives.
 Bought this for my Husband. He is a truck driver so he needed something durable. This phone case is very durable. It is a little bulky for women to use. It is made of hard material. It does come with a case which is easy to use. He has no problem from unlatching the phone from the case when it is clipped on his side. The corners is made of silicone material so if you drop it it will bounce and not crack or scratch the screen. He has dropped his phone a couple of times and with this case on it just bounced once. It did protect the phone and screen. With the drop it didn't even scratch the case. Highly recommend to anyone that needs a heavy duty stylish case.
 I think this would be an exceptional case except for the protruding loop on the edge, which as close as i can determine is to be used to attach the lanyard that came with the phone.  I find it hard to believe anyone is going to walk around with a phone hanging from their neck.  The protrusion makes it very uncomfortable to hold.  I wouldn't recommend it for this reason.
 This case broke in 20 days of having it, I never drop it during this time period. The color it starting to fade also the quality if not that great the Black clip doesn't even fit the  phone case to use it. They have 30 day warranty and they wait until reply back a week after the first email I sent them. Then claimed it was out of the warranty period referred me to there webstie to buy a new case which is $24.99 ($25.00).DON'T BUY THE GARBAGE
 Overall this is an awesome case. I’ve had it now for over 6 months and it’s protect my phone from fall countless times. I did modify the case by removing the part where the lanyard attaches to. I would have given this case a 5 star review if it wasn’t for the stand on the back braking. Other than that it does what it’s supposed to do protect your phone.
 I didn't think this case would be great because it's so inexpensive, but I like it more than the expensive one I bought!  I love the texture on the back.  My fingers rest naturally in the grooves, and my grip is strong on the phone.  I haven't used the clip at all and won't use it, but I really like the case.
 My husband ordered one for his iPhone. It came when it was supposed to.  The packaging was fine.  The product itself is really nice. It is lightweight but not cheaply made. I like the design and REALLY love the stand that is integrated with the phone cover. That was really cool.  So much so that I ordered one for my iPhone in the rose gold/black combo. I am excited to get it in a couple of days.  I may even get one for my son as you can’t beat the price.
 Great value for the money!  Bought this for my iPhone 7+ and liked it so much I bought another for my iPhone X.  Fit was great and protects well.  I’m not normally someone that would use the belt clip but it looks so good and holds the phone so well I changed my mind.  The clear screen protector wasn’t as high quality as others I’ve bought separately, but still fits well and was a nice added bonus.
 I purchased this case on Sept 11. On On October 22, I tried to set the phone up with the kickstand (which is a great feature) but soon realized that the hard case had cracked as you can see in the pictures simply from trying to set the kickstand. Not sure what is meant by "Military Grade Drop Tested" but this case is not that by any means...
 Nice looking and feeling case. Glass screen protector is awesome and the whole package is a great deal. However, I wound up with a defective case. The lock button on my iPhone 7 will not function with the case. The inner softer plastic inside the case arrived warped and would not line up with the lock button. I had to cut out the plastic peice and use a dremel tool to make the hole a bit bigger. However, for the price I can't complain too much. I never contacted the seller to resolve this as I needed a case and didn't want the hassle of shipping it back. Seems like it would be a good product though if everything is ok when it arrives. If it hadn't been for the issue I would have given this a 5 star review.
 I actually brought the case for my fiancé, because he was in need of a case for his phone. I know he wanted a great case as good as the outter box, so I hopped on amazon and started searching. As I was searching I came across the Zizo case, I liked it because it looked like an secure phone case. Once I showed it to my fiancé he took a look at the pictures even the video, and he agreed as well not to mention when we scrolled through the colors he was blown away. Lol. So we ordered it, when we got it the way it was packaged it was packaged so well like it was several cases in this package. He opened it and he was super grateful and happy. We loved the product because the phone case wasn't just a slip on phone case this phone case had a front and a back case that has a phone stand connected to it as well as a secure tempered glass, a belt clip oh and not to mention a key chain. I truly believe it was worth it and the case had much more to offer then a outter box case. My fiancé is enjoying his new case and we thank you guys for creating such a product.
 The iPhone Case looks great! It came early. I can't wait to order my new phone this coming Saturday. It is not thick or thin, but durable as stated. The price was reasonable for a clip and kick stand with a stylish look.
 I got this for my new Iphone 8plus.  My husband has one of these cases on his Samsung 8plus and it has worked great.  Which is why I bought one for my phone.  However, when I got it on my phone it would not work the side buttons correctly.  All it would do is shut my phone down.  I was very disappointed since we love it so much on my husbands phone.  Sent it back and went with another case.  If you can fix the issue with the buttons it would be great.
 This is a long overdue rating on this case....Was a bit hestitant to buy just on reviews only, but the quality looked decent and for the price getting a case and a glass screen protector were hard to pass up.<br/><br/>I was not dissapointed. Everything came in a nice box and had simple intructions for setup. Was a bit concerned about how tight the fit was to get my iPhone 7 Plus in, but once in it was snug and felt really secure. The case feels solid, and looks and feels tough. If your looking for a slim case, this is not it. It's built rugged, exactly what I wanted, solid but not as bulky as some of the other cases out there.<br/><br/>The lanyard that comes with it is pretty good, but I fly paragliders and rigged a line with mini carabiners to keep the phone secured to my radio harness when flying...it's perfect!<br/><br/>Liked it so much I bought the Samsung S8 version for a friend as a gift and he's stoked!<br/><br/>Nice to find a solid product at a decent price. Very happy with Zizo's products!!!
 I'm thrilled with this case's Heavy-Duty Hard Shell, Holster Clip, Tempered Glass Screen Protector, and Kickstand. Other cases have a plastic cover for a screen protector but I don't like the slight gap those have between the screen &amp; cover which interferes with the touch screen. This Glass Screen Protector adheres directly to the screen so there is no gap. Other people have posted problems with the case not fitting an Iphone 8+ properly or the power button not lining up but the case I have fits perfectly. I did have a problem with the holster breaking at the hinge but Victor responded quickly to my problem, requested a photo of the damage, and is promptly sending me a new holster. I'm impressed with Zizo customer service via email and should have a turn-around time of less than a week for a replacement holster. They thought of everything you would want in a case and even included a Key Chain Holder and a lanyard so you can hang it off your neck. I highly recommend this case!
 Very nice case and very sturdy!!
 First of all I ordered this product for the design, color and protection that is advertised. I got exactly what I paid for and I couldn't be happier to say that the Zizo bolt series is the case that I trust with my 800 dollar phone!! But like most other reviews I had power button problems with this case, no big deal I just used my knife to cut the excess rubber on the inside that was holding down the power button on my phone. And it stayed great.. that's a big issue that Zizo needs to fix but other than that, this is my first choice for protection and style
 Had to order it a second time. This first time I received an item completely different than what it should have been. I can see that is is due to packing in a plastic baggie and anyone could switch the bags from different items. For the phone case itself, unless you modify it, you cannot use it on a 7 plus. As others have said, it fits too tight on the power button and it constantly powers on/ off and there is no way to stop that other than cutting out the black rubber piece on the phone case that engages the power button. I used a pocket knife and was able to cleanly cut away the black rubber. The power button now sits fairly deep into the case, but I'm OK with that. I did the same for the volume up/ down buttons. I like the colored part of the case, it seems like it will protect the phone and also keep it from slipping out of my hand, which is why I bought it mainly. So, if you don't mind modifying the case and removing the rubber buttons that engage the phone buttons it is acceptable.
 I like everything about this case. This is not the first one I purchased. Even though it wasn't for me, I brought it for first my boyfriend, cause he drops stuff . And this recent one, is for my nephew who also drops hos phone. I must say, this is a very sturdy case. I told my nephew that this should keep his iPhone 8plus safe.
 As far as being effective I have been happy with it.  The support stand only lasted a couple months on both phones and the cover on mine is now completely coming apart after 8 months.  That seats it has kept my phone safe and done it’s job.  I run a farm so I am tough on cases.  Most have lasted longer than this but I do like the textured back for a good grip though it also holds dirt.
 Looks and feels good. However! My wife bought me a bolt case for my iPhone 8 Plus. I am severely disappointed. The logo on the back is partially hidden and the buttons are so stiff that I had to use an exacto knife to cut them out so I could use my phone while the case is on. Also, the stand is so stiff I’ve almost broken a fingernail trying to use it. You will not be getting good reviews from me. I will be posting this on many platforms. Extremely disappointed because I have to make do until I find a better case.
 I previously purchased a Zizo case for a Galaxy Note 7, and was very happy with it. It fit well, functioned well and provided armor protection for the phone.<br/>The iPhone 7 Plus case was a total disappointment and found its way to the round file. Reasons: case was much bulkier with ridges going around the side. The green to tan parts of the case did not fit well. There were gaps and rises between them and they couldI easily be separated. Not at all the quality of the Note 7 case which had tight seamless layers. Agree with a previous post that this case was not designed for the 7 Plus, but is a 6 Plus carry-over.
 I bought this case once in the fall. I loved it. It has a kickstand, comes with a lanyard to connect and hang around your neck. It's a sturdy case. However, the kickstand broke after a few months. I thought it was because I just used it so much and/or was rough with it. I bought a second one and was extremely careful with the kickstand, but this one broke within weeks! I am very disappointed. It has so much potential.
 I bought 2 first one was hard to use power button on my I phone. I played with it trying to free it up but no luck. I ordered another because the case looked well made it's slim and works in the charging dock. No problem power button works flawlessly as well as other buttons. I'm even going to keep the other case because I loose belt clips all the time , and for the price it's well worth it. One tough case . Looks good And feels good. Don't waiste your money on anything more expensive ( big names)
 Fits my iPhone 8 Plus perfectly.  Made out of a tough plastic that should be very durable.  I haven't dropped the phone yet, but I'm confident it will protect against most spills.  Comes with a belt-clip holster (which I haven't felt the need for yet) and a lanyard.  The lanyard is suprisingly useful, and I can wrap it around the phone to provide an extra measure of protection for the screen when the phone is lying about.  Great case, highly recommended!
 This was a gift for my husband. He is hard on his phones and cases. He has already dropped his phone with this case, and everything was fine. He said this case even makes it easier to hold his phone, because it is not all smooth on the back like some cases. He does not use the belt clip, but it is a nice extra.
 I'm happy with this case! Didn't think I would use it, but the kickstand is nice. It is a tight fit but once it is on, it seems to protect my phone well. 4 stars for good product, design, &amp; company. I'm holding out on the 5th star because my glass protector didn't hold up. It chipped after I put my phone in my pocket that had some keys in it. I replaced the glass cover with Mr. Shield's 9H. I bought this case for the case not the screen protector so if asked, yes I would buy again. Love the look! This is a great buy.
 Great workmanship, heavy duty, and looks super cute. My adult son loves it. Cosmetic wise, is very attractive. The price is more affordable than what I was able to find in any mall, here in Colorado, delivered right to my home.  I have the reputation for being super picky and even I love this product.  I leave very few reviews, but here I am leaving one for this product.
 My friend bought one of these and I liked it well enough to buy one for myself. I'm not a big fan of the tether loop but it's not a deal breaker. I especially love the kick stand, but it only works in landscape mode. It would be nice for the kickstand to also work in portrait mode.  I've also noticed that when on speakerphone on a phone call, if you prop the phone up vertically, the case muffles the sound for both parties. Again, not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>EDIT: I bought a second case in a different color. The buttons on the new one (volume &amp; power) are so hard to push I went back to my old case. Lowered to 3 stars.
 I love this case. I’ve had it for 2 years and am what you might call accident-prone. My phone falls on the ground daily and is still in one piece. Some think it’s too bulky but I actually like that theee is something to grip (less chance of slipping out of my hand). I would definitely recommend and you can’t beat the price.
 My family and I all have I phones. Everyone knows the price of said phone. We used to use the Otter Box. I tried the Zizo case once because of the slim fit and bold colors unlike the Bulky dull colors Otter Box. We absolutely love them. I’ve since bought several dozen more for family members and all my children. I’m a contractor I drop and abuse my phone. I’ve never broken or damaged my phone with this case. There affordable and effective! Best case out there. You can not go wrong with this case!
 This case is amazing!! I didn’t expect the producers to care so much about their product. I was absolutely shocked when they included a dust absorber, cleaning cloth and moist toilette, guiding stickers, and a free tempered glass for such an affordable price. The case came preassembled which made it so easy to put on. The kick stand at the back is a bit hard to open I usually have To leave it halfway closed so it doesn’t get stuck, but after opening it so many times it seems to be loosening up comfortably. The buttons still work great, the volume buttons are a bit tougher to use but it’s still very doable and well worth the effort for the protection you get. I got the white color and it matches so beautifully with my white phone. Not to mention the material of the case is smooth yet textured so it makes holding my phone very nice and comfy. Makes me wish I was sponsored by the company haha.
 I have had this for a few months.  I am photographer and use it only for photo shoots and weddings.  I would use it full time if it were more durable like my Otterbox Defender.  I also wish the ring was at the other end of the phone so when it is on your neck and you look at your phone the lanyard is not in the way.  The lanyard string broke almost immediately.  I purchased a separate and much more durable one to replace it.
 The kickstand on this recent IPhone case purchase Fractured well before a good-long life of use...less than two months. The case itself I happened to prefer because it replace the exact same brand/model I enjoyed for over a year. Coincidentally, a broken kickstand compelled me to replace the IPhone case two months ago, yet this time I rarely used it. I fracture appeared a week ago, and then the kickstand just fell off the case when lifting the phone from the table. This is way too soon for plastic to fail.
 Great value for the price paid. I like the item but would recommend two improvements. 1) a slightly more “grippy” material would be perfect. Especially on the models for the larger phones (7s+ etc). 2) if the notches for the case were moved up a bit to allow the phone to be secured in the holster either screen in or screen out. Both are minor and should not stop you from purchasing this case. Including the glass screen protector is a great touch. I’m pretty careful with my phones, so, I hope never to use this drop-tested case in real life. After using Otterbox cases on my previous devices, this was a nice change/alternative to the sometimes bulky Otterboxes.
 For the price point I personally feel it's not worth it. I was disappointed with the quality and finish of the product but I'm not sending it back because it's going to cost me more that it's worth :(<br/>I bought this especially to use in the gym but the clip at the back is too tight and doesn't turn.  The case doesn't have a rubbery feel it's more plastic and I think if it were to drop accidentally it wud not absorb the shock as effectively as my last case....now I am looking for a better case :( $30 inc shipping down the drain !!!
 The case itself is fairly sturdy. I notice it seems to be refitted as a 7 plus case from a 6 plus, but this is not much of an issue. Callers do complain about hearing me when put on speaker, but I'm not sure if this is a fault of the case or my own phone/self. The case is slimmer than other "heavy duty" cases and can still slide into a back pocket alright. There were problems with tightness of cover over the power button, but its nothing a little breaking in couldn't fix. The holster I received was a lemon, it doesn't fit with the phone, made upside down and the notches don't align. Personally I was most upset with this because I specifically was looking for a phone case with a holster. Alternatively, it came with a lanyard with a clip for the phone to hang around the neck, the string on the clip broke fairly quickly, but the case did indeed protect the phone when it did drop which is what really matters. I can replace it with a sturdier lanyard I own. The kickstand took some effort to pop out with a knife, edges are a bit rough and cause it to get stuck, but was able to sand down the edges myself for a better fit. Cosmetically the colors match great, I like the texture of the case, it helps provide a good grip. It also came with a free screen protector. Less bang for the buck than I anticipated, but it didn't put a big hole in my pocket, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
 I don't normally review things at all, but this case warranted it and unfortunately not in a good way. Pros. Fits the 8 phone plus perfectly, I don't know if the other users are having severe operator error or not. The look I like especially being a soldier. I don't expect it to be HUMVEE proof especially when my lifeproof case wasn't. Easy on and off case. Cons- The kickstand which admittedly was a huge selling point for me, broke my second time using it, given it could have been my own issue, but the plastic is super cheap and super easy to break. The husband will attempt a superglue life save tonight. The tempered glass does get smudged easily, but the cloth that comes with it wipes them away
 Decent build quality. I got the blue, completely different shade of blue than what was shown in the pics, the blue goes more towards a darker blue, not the electric cobalt like blue that's shown. Apple logo on back is not protected at all.  Has cut out for the smart connector that didn't make it on the phone, so it's another open spot on the case. Has cut out for earphone jack that doesn't exist on the 7+. Seems to me they produced this case off of rumors.  Takes a bit of muscle to get the plastic over the inner case, but once on it does hold the phone firmly. The screen protector is a fingerprint magnet... the kickstand is nice if you can get it out, I need something stronger than my fingernail to get it out. However, good grip, good look/design to the case. Cut out for charging port is a good size, accepted my 3rd party charger. I do think it will protect the phone well from drops that are not direct hits to the screen. Nice size lip to protect the phone face down. I am indifferent about the lanyard hole. In all, a alright case that will protect. I'll put a screen protector on the back of the phone to protect the openings.
 Very nice case. I got this for my mom who constantly drops her phone. So far it has protected it very well. Love the belt clip, only one thing,  phone clips into belt holder very tightly, which is a good thing, except when you want to take a picture quickly. It takes a little effort to get it out and it’s not quick and it’s actually easier to just unclip from your pants but the holder covers the camera lens. Would’ve been nice if it didn’t.
 My husband is very disappointed with this product.  The holster clip broke within the first hour of wearing it.  It got caught on the truck door and broke.  The stand broke the first time it was used.  The grey plastic cover broke around the volume buttons after being dropped twice.
 Finally got my iphone 7 plus and put the case on and it fits perfectly. The case is sturdy and feels like my phone is well protected. The raised lips around camera is pretty high so good protection there as well. Love the rose gold color. It actually has a metallic finish to it. My husband ordered a black/orange one and the finish is different, more matte looking but is also very nice. Because of the metallic finish, I was afraid it might get scratches easily but so far I haven't noticed any scratches yet. Some people complained about the kickstand is hard to pull off but for me that's not the case. It comes out easy enough and I have short nails. It does feel a bit filmsy but I've been pulling it in and out a lot (just because LOL) and it's doing fine.<br/><br/>The only thing that I don't like is the hole for the strap or charm on the top left. It would look more sleek without it. Other than that I really like this case. Also comes with a screen protector which was easy to apply though on my husband's phone it causes a bubble that we can't get rid of.
 I ordered this case prior to the arrival of my new iPhone 7 Plus. I'm a firm believer of putting a phone in a case right out of the box. This case is industrial strength with the extra features of a stand on the back, a lanyard, and a cover/clip for the front of the phone (the one item I haven't used yet). The red color is awesome as well. I would give 5 stars except the included tempered glass screen protector had cracks all over it, so not usable. I'm keeping the case as it's great, but since went to Best Buy for a ZAGG HD Glass + cover.
 This case has protected my iPhone 8+ from a stairwell fall. Must have hit almost half a dozen times before coming to a rest. However, the kickstand is not very well constructed and didn't last very long. If that doesn't matter to you, this case will do the job. Great holster construction. Just too bulky for me. The leash accessory is a nice feature, too, but I don't use it because it gets caught on anything close by. Probably won't buy again for the low quality kickstand and the power/volume buttons are extremely difficult to push with this case.
 I really like this case, I almost didn't buy it because I read from other buyers that the apple logo is not center perfectly for the iPhone 8 plus in the back, but I though I needed for work so I don't care, but it is perfectly center maybe they fixed it, I don't know but it is centered, I like the quality of the material, the way it looks I got the the black gray, the tempered glass is easy to place it on the front and the price you can't beat this.
 The case that was pictured was not what I received; cutouts were for Iphone 6S Plus NOT Iphone 7Plus.  I'm really tired of these manufacturers relabeling their 6S products as 7S in an attempt to sell them.  the iPhone 7 Plus DOES not need a cutout for a headphone jack.  that is what I received.  Also, the plastic bag that the container came in had been already opened and then taped shut - which leads me to believe that someone else returned this.  Just received today and it's going back.  So disappointed :-(
 I have always been an Otterbox guy from the IPhone 3 days.  Having a 6S Plus I was tired of the bulky Defender and bought this really liking the styling, aparent durability and kickstand  as never thought I would use a kickstand but I found myself using it a lot.  The kickstand broke within 2 months and the outer case cracked  within 3 months and broke into pieces soon after.  I am still using it with just the black inner case which also looked pretty cool against the gold phone and it’s working ok  until I can figure out what my next case is.
 The product came broken. Tempered glass piece was shattered. The edges of the case, on the front, don’t go very high over the edges of the phone, so without the tempered glass, it worries me that it will break.<br/>The clip is not super easy to use, but does work. The case seems to fit right on the phone (iPhone 7plus). Looks cool. Will be returning due to broken tempered glass.
 I didn’t have this case for a month and the kickstand started coming off and I had never even used it. After that happened I noticed after never dropping the phone that a piece was chip off on the corner and then it spread across the back of the case. How can I keep my phone secure if the case is crumbling around it.
 This is the second case I purchased this week, and will be the last. This case just feels good in the hand, the ridges help with grip, and the detachable belt clip is perfect for keeping in my purse, and adds extra drop-protection.<br/><br/>It also comes with an attachable lanyard, which I replaced with a shorter version for my wrist. The one it came with is good for the neck, but not comfortable when weighted by a phone.<br/><br/>The kickstand in the back FEELS flimsy, but works as intended and has lasted through my constant opening and closing of it without problem.<br/><br/>I will come back to this brand for my next phone, I’m sure, especially at this price.
 Perfect for the iPhone 8+ Sadly I purchased the wrong case previously, and because I just got the phone itself, didn't know I had the wrong case, and currently can't return it. HOWEVER, the case is exactly what I need for my phone. Thanks.
 I like this case but it has a couple weaknesses.  1. The kickstand is difficult to unlatch from the case.  I don’t have long fingernails so I have to use something with a solid point to get this to break loose.<br/>2. After about a year of use, the hinge for the kickstand has broken.  I think this has a two year warranty but it’s just a hassle to box it up and run to the post office to return it.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I like the overall design with the ribbed case.  This makes it easy to grip.  I like the various color schemes as well.  The case fits well and all the buttons work perfectly.<br/><br/>If they would come up with a more robust and easier to use kickstand I would buy another.
 The product power button has to be pushed way to hard to use without damaging my iPhone 8 plus. I contacted the customer service and was told that sorry. "Unfortunately it has been past our 30 day warranty period.<br/>Our suggestion would be to contact the manufacturer, ZizoWireless.com, regarding this issue. They should be able to help you out!<br/><br/>Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns.

 My husband bought this. He usually breaks all of his holders. This one is holding up pretty well. Taking the phone off the holder is a little odd. You have to push the tab on the side. I think if he were to drop his phone (which he's prone to do) it would just bounce and be fine.
 Well made product... this is my third. They are very strong... I don't replace these because I haven't needed to, i make multiple purchase because I want to change colors of my case. They are all in perfect condition and protect my phone extremely well. they also wash up like new with a little soap and water. They last forever. Great Price, Great product. Small company... Lets make these guys rich! Definitely order one or more.
 My case starting off chipping in the corners. Next it started cracking around my volume buttons. Eventually cracked where the stand is. Overall not good quality material. Not durable. Would of at least liked for it to last me a year or more. Only last me a few months.
 I ordered this case based off a few reviews, because the case I actually had on my IPhone 5S has not been made available as of now for the IPhone 7 plus. In general I like the look of the caser and it feels good in the hand. The tempered glass protector is a plus, but could be larger to actually cover the screen right up to where it meets the case. The one issue that I had when I received the case is that the power button on the black insert will not function correctly. It will actually hold pressure on the power button where it just randomly will request to power of the phone. To turn the screen off I just have to let it time out.  The case is labeled as an IPhone 7. The holster is actually labeled for the IPhone 6 Plus, but fits tight. I contacted Zizo Customer Service via there website and explained the issue about the power button on a Friday evening. I was surprised  to receive a reply back so quick from Danielle about the issue. She explained she would send a replacement and I did not need to return the original. While waiting for the replacement my original case had deformed on the volume button side of the case. The outer shell is actually warping away from the black insert. The new case arrived and I compared it side by side with my original Zizo Bolt Case. I noticed that there were differences between the two cases even thought they had the same part # and UPC. The replacement case and holster were both labeled for the IPhone 7 plus. The replacement case has the same exact issue with the power button as the original. In addition, the holster labeled as a IPhone 7 plus case for the replacement case does not securely hold the phone. The slots in the side of the case are actually in a different location as compared to the original case I ordered. I tried swapping pieces around between cases to see if I could make things work. Not sure if it's a quality control issue or a different supplier making the case now. Still had the same issues. The only reason I am giving this case two stars is because customer service was quick and efficient with trying to address the issue. I guess I will just have to use this until the case I want is brought to market.
 I had bought 3 of these cases.  2 have been great, but from reading other reviews the side buttons don't always work right (on/off and up/down volume) So the cases that have work right it is a great case for the price, just beware of defective ones.
 Material quality was lacking, I had to cut our the covers for the buttons on side because they could NOT be depressed enough to contact phone buttons. So far it seems durable, but it will only fit in the holder one way and that is upside down and backward from what I normally insert phone to belt holder.
 I just got my iPhone 7 Plus and purchased this case. Unfortunately, it seems that this is must actually be an iPhone 6 Plus case that they are reselling for iPhone 7 Plus.<br/>  The iPhone 7 Plus no longer has a headphone jack, but this case still has the cutout (see photo) for that hole. The volume up/down buttons on the left side of the phone work fine. However, the on/off button on the right side of the phone never functioned correctly. It was like it was constantly half-way pushed down, as it would keep taking photos of my screen and try to turn the phone completely off.<br/>  I sent the case back and tried a second case, thinking maybe it was a defective product. Unfortunately, the second case had the exact same issues as the first.<br/><br/>My advice, don't buy this unless you are purchasing it for an iPhone 6 Plus.
 This is the 3rd Zizo Bolt cover I've bought.  After my first one came in I was impressed by its quality and affordable price.  In anticipation of our iPhone 7 plus phones coming in from AT&amp;T by mail (pre-order) my wife was concerned that the $19 case wouldn't be enough protection (she's broken Otter Box cases). She bought a Otter box Commuter case.  When she compared the two cases she decided to return the expensive one and she LOVES her Zizo Bolt cover.  I saved a bunch of money and these cases are NICE!!!
 This is my second Zizo case.  I bought one for my 6 plus and loved it so much I bought another one when I upgraded to the 7 plus.  I've dropped my phone several times with no damage to my phone.  This case not only has a belt clip, but also a lanyard!!!  I love that there are multiple ways to make sure I do t lose track of my phone, especially when traveling.  I used the lanyard in Austrailia and it allowed me to have my phone ready and available for photos while not having to worry about dropping it or losing it.  The flip out viewing stand is another plus.  You can use it without the belt clip to watch videos without having to hold or prop up your phone.  It isn't waterproof, but now that the iPhone is water resistant, that is not an issue.  I was very skeptical at first and have always been an Otterbox user but this case met or exceeded all my expectations.  I would definitely recommend it.
 The case looks great, very sturdy and comes with a screen protector, which is why I chose it.<br/>It fits very tightly, too tightly it seems. I am having thr same problem as other reviewers with the power/sleep button becoming inoperable when the hard outter shell is installed. Works great while just the softer inner liner is on. The button also activated at random when i had it on my phone holder in my car from pressure on the outter case, not kn the button.<br/>The supplied holster also broke almost immediately when I tried to rotate the clip. It was very stiff to the point Inhad to double check it was supposed to rotate before I tried too hard. Second click and one of the tabs broke off.<br/>Great looking, I assume great protection but very poor functionality. I will not be buying another
 This case is the best case for its buck. I have owned otter box, and even though this isn’t otter box, it’s a lot more sleek, and protects just as well. With the exception of water damage, but Sone of us have water resistant phones, so this is the case for you, however my current case came defective, but this is my second case. My first case was great but I broke the carrying Clíp.
 This case fits my iPhone 7 Plus perfectly!  I bought this case with the lanyard so that I could take my phone downhill skiing, and to be confident that I could not drop my phone while texting from the chairlift to find my friends on the mountain.  I also love the "kickstand" - - I used that to prop up my phone to watch a movie on an airplane, and it worked great.  I really like the "rugged" and "grippy" feel of this case, and I plan to use the holster (which is included with this case) while doing geologic field work.
 I have bought two now. My boss likes it other than the lanyard hook (not needed in his day in and day out). Purchased another for one of the (plumber) guys in the field and haven't heard any issues. If this case proves to work well in the field for him then I will eventually replace all of the otterbox cases with this case. The otterbox has that plastic cover on the face of the phone and causes too much dirt and cloudiness. I did have to purchase a separate tempered glass cover because the one that came with this case shattered within a few days of use. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars. I wouldn't let that deter you though from purchasing this case. Just find a better tempered glass cover. Hopefully, crossing fingers, the clip doesn't break as easy as I have heard. To be continued ....
 I just received the Zizo Bolt Military Grade case and so far I am completely satisfied with the protective case. Since I haven't had any drop accidents with it I can't comment on the functionality and drop test rating but compared to a Palican iPhone 7 plus case this product was about half the price.
 Works for 8 Plus, but clearly not made for the 8 Plus. Protection seems to be great, but the case does not line up great with Apple logo (rear).  Really had to force the phone in the case, almost too tight of a fit. Good grip/feel to the case. I've had for one day only, so cannot give accurate review on protection.
 The casing for the phone itself is great quality. It definitely exceeds specs. However, the quality of the belt clip leaves much to be desired. It broke on me within two days. It’s snapped right where it joins to the case but on the part that sits against your pants not the phone, meaning the moving jaw of the clip.  As I said, the case it’s self or the phone is excellent quality, however, the clip case it’s self leaves a lot to be desired. For the price, I doubt I’ll be able to get it replaced without having to buy a whole new case just to get the clip which is why I gave it a rating of 3. The phone case itself with all of the 3. I give a 0 to the belt clip.
 I ordered the 7 case not the 7 plus, but that was an error on amazon and not the product.<br/>The product itself is very good. I was looking for a durable case with some grip on the sides so the new phone didn't feel like it was going to fall out of my hands. When I opened the package up, it's nicely put together with a lot of extras, case, lanyard, belt clip,tempered glass protector, microfiber wipe, alcohol prep, and a full prep sheet to make it easy to put the screen protector on it.<br/>When I fitted the phone into the case it fits nice and snug. Then I tried it into the belt clip, that also was nice however the swivel clip snapped in two pieces so now the belt clip is useless. I guess other customers who have left reviews have had the same issue.<br/>The screen protector is nice, I'll have to play with mine more, it doesn't seem to want to lineup right on top and bottom cutouts. I may have to get another protector. Other then that I like the case.
 Case is of average build quaility.  Within one week of having it there is a section in the back that felt like it was coming lose and required me pressing it back in place.  The kick stand is extremely hard to open at first and the internal support has already snapped from normal use.  It is a good price point for the case which feels Strong in general but you are getting what you pay for and if looking for real quality probably better to pay the higher price.
 got my case in the mail last Friday.  Was excited to find out that it came with a screen protector included for the price.  I have been looking for a case for quite a while.  I was refusing to spend the money on an Otterbox, because its just the name making them expensive.  It was a little difficult to put on the phone, but that means its a good tight fit, which will protect my phone from damage in the long run.  If my wife hadnt already bought an otterbox, I would be ordering a second one of these for her...
 I love the case, not the first Zizo case I’ve had, I am a little disappointed in the included screen protector. It was great for about 3 days, now it’s starting to have bubbles underneath it... I might look into something else, a shame. I loved Zizo.<br/><br/>Update: I contacted customer service, after proving my issue, the have shipped me a new tempered glass screen protector. 5 star customer service, 5 star case... I will order again for every phone I have.
 The case is okay a little hard to put phone in but fits nice and tight. The kick stand on the holster worked for about a week now don’t work won’t stay open.. I can see it protecting my phone from damage but holster that it sits in has a lot to be desired it’s not very durable
 Case is tough as nails, just as advertised. Only thing is the neck strap attachment to the phone case clip is not up to speed. It failed to keep snapped into the case resulting in a dropped phone! Thank goodness the case held up with my new iphone7. I lost trust in the neck strap snap on piece. Other than that I would have given 5 Stars.
 El producto es de muy mala calidad, como se puede apreciar en la imágenes adjunta la pieza que se utiliza para colocar de forma horizontal el equipo se rompió con el peso del equipo y eso para mi es inaceptable ya que antes de poner el producto a la venta se le debe de hacer barias pruebas, en las imágenes 3 y 4 se aprecian las malas terminaciones del producto. he comprado barios covers y me han salido excelentes por ende no entiendo que les paso, espero que este sea un caso aislado.
 Opened the stand on the case and the sliding piece that glides the stand broke off the very first time I opened it. I bought the case for an iPhone 8+. The plastic bag in which the case box came in had a label on it stating it was for an iPhone 8+ but the label on the box itself did not list an iPhone 8+ as one of the models it was suitable for. I tried placing my iPhone 8+ in the case and the case was too small.
 The cover is so stiff I thought I was going to break my phone trying to get it on. can’t turn your phone off button it’s so still. My 02
 Bought this cover for my son's iPhone7+. I received the packaged opened, with the tempered glass missing, yet with the adhesive backing, and wipes for adhering the glass to the phone. The case arrived well, but obviously in an all rabbled package. The quality of the case is OK. One major I issue I found is that the lock button of the i7plus activates all the time. I had to shave some material off the case in order to prevent that from happening. Thus, because of the aforementioned experiences, I would not buy this product again nor recommend it.
 I am a serial phone killer.  It's not the life I chose, it chose me.  This phone case changed all that.  My phone and I will have a long life together...at least until the next up date.<br/>Seriously, this case is full of little design features that will protect your investment.  my only suggestion is that the designers would add a sticker on the tempered glass cover that says something like "this side to phone face".  My dumb butt flipped it over and put finger prints all over the sticky side.  sigh.<br/>If you want to protect your phone without spending another fortune,,,this case is for you.  Highly, HIGHLY recommend.
 Although I initially liked it because of it's military colors the case is just badly designed for the iPhone 7 Plus. It's like this case went through so many concepts without any revisions. There's holes in the case that have no meaning (holes for headphone ports) and it's too tight fitting (my phone will lock or go to the shut off screen because the power button is being held down.) The belt clip thing only covers the screen so when not in use you can't even clip it to the back so you can continue using your phone, you have to place it down somewhere which can lead to potentially leaving it behind and or losing the piece.
 Great case: good feel, strong material, not entirely too bulky (it is a large phone after all).  Only drawback is the button for the power was a little too snug and was pressing against the power button without releasing; really tight fitting case.  Took a thin crafting blade and loosened this one button by making a slit on the long sides of the power button on the case.  Popped the phone back in and it works like a charm; this was the little extra room it needed.  But sure to get a screen cover as the case does not enclose the phone 100%
 My wife and I both got this cases when we got our new iPhone 8 Plus’.Within two weeks my wife’s “stand” was broken and thankfully we had tempered glass because the edges did not provide sufficient protection. We both had a pour glass cover break. So needless to say we were not happy with these cases and we both reordered the unicorn beatle which lasted the entire time we had our iPhone 7’s. And they are still on our iPhone 7’s.
 Works a bit better than otter box on 5s.  I’m on 8+ and it has two nubs to lock onto phone on the clip portion. Don’t like on my right side having the phone facing towards my back... I’m right handed.<br/><br/>Real truth is if it lasts more than the 6 months an otter box works until their belt clip snaps.
 I love the look and feel of the case! But.....<br/><br/> The integrated stand did not hold up after only 14 days. The stand came off and the sliding cross support corners broke and left the most practical feature useless. Now it's like any other phone case.<br/>  The front edges around the face of the phone have practically no clearance to take the impact in case of a drop that lands face down. The phone screen will take the brunt of the drop.<br/>  Withdrew any recommendations I initially gave to friends about the case.
 Durability of the case is excellent.  The button to press the poweron/off on the top right side needs a very strong pressure to operate actual button on the iPhone 7+.  The stand is very handy but difficult to release from the case.  Biggest problem is the clip. Only held on by the two edges and difficult to cradle when not looking and without the phone gets caught and hung up.  The corner of the clip caught on a sliding door while walking through without my phone being in the cradle and busted in half after only a week of use.  The cradle should actually be a tray all the way across to alleviate both my issues.
 I would love to give this a better review. However, the stand on the back of the blue case (which was one of the selling points for me) was broken out of the box. The edges of the glass screen protector (another selling point) would not adhere to the phone. I bought two cases; one blue and one red.  All of the problems occurred with the blue one.  Some of the better features though is the black screen protector with the clip fits on the back of the phone and the clip operates like a pop socket.  I do like that the case itself feels durable and the colors are vibrant. However I just cannot give this more than two or three stars because of the flaws right out of the box.
 This case is pretty much useless.  The fitnent of the case is bad.  As soon as I put the case on I found out.  The power button on the case was so tight it would just hold the power button down on my phone.  It kept trying to turn my phone off making it so I couldn't do anything at all with my phone.  The only good part of this case is the screen protector.  I put it on my phone and love it so that's why this got a 2 star.
 Phone case looks great. You can, though, feel the cheapness of the material. The kick stand broke about a week in, actually six days since I received it Monday of this week. The clip feels and looks really cheap too (the one you clip to your pants and/or shorts). All in all it will protect your phone like it is supposed to and will also look badass. I don’t recommend anything anymore, so if you want to try it go ahead. Let your view be the decision on if it is a good case.
 This is a high quality protective case. I work in a manufacturing field and these cases have protected my cellular devices for years. I've purchased multiple Zizo products and my phone looks like it came out of the box when I first got it. Highly recommend this product.
 Case is very good overall and seems like it would protect my phone well during mishaps.  Only downside is that the surface isn’t very ‘sticky’.  This also applies to the end of the kickstand.  Unfortunately this allows the phone to slide a little too easily for my liking.  However, it is less slippery than the normal surface of the iPhone so net win in my book.  The various textures and grooves can make holding the phone easier as well.
 The stand is novel but I never think to use it. That on me. The quality of the case itself is much less than companies like otter box but that’s expected for the price. The lighter color ones show dirt and grime pretty quickly and make for a muted gross looking case instead of the vibrant case that initially comes from the box. Mine cracked after not too long but it’s protecred my screen from repeated drops so I can’t complain much in that department.
 The product is exactly what I expected, durable and stylish without the bulky look of an OtterBox. The company responded to questions and provided information to educate me on phone cases for iPhones, as I am an Android phone owner. Would definitely purchase from seller again!
 I bought the orange case. In about 3 months I dropped the ph in Walmart. About 3 feet. Phone is OK. One the left side I noticed on the left side where the turn up and down volume buttons are have been broken away. Cheaply made and not durable for impact. It did protect my ph for an average drop. Moving on to a different heavy duty case. Would not recommend.
 The back stand always breaks off. This the 2 I purchase and it just breaks off. Very annoyed over all. I thought it was me because I use very frequently but I’m not applying any pressure to it. NEVER BUYING AGAIN.
 I ordered a rose gold &amp; black case. Instead I received a red and black case mainly red which I actually ended up liking. The belt clip didn’t actually fit the case. So it’s definitely a return. I had previously ordered through them maybe 1&amp;1/2 years ago for the same case rose gold and black. Durability wise was good for dropping it. The kick stand on the on the initial first order broke right away and the belt clip stopped holding shortly after. The red one I just received due to their mess up recently is way worse. The clip doesn’t fit the phone at all. Its also a different design for the older 5&amp;6 series. On top of that is was not what I ordered.

I love it’s look and feel. I love the stand and the strap. I love the screen protector that it comes with. Although I can only review from experience so I can’t really comment on its durability as I haven’t dropped it yet. And since I’m only reviewing because they keep nagging me for feedback I can only state what I’ve experienced and so far I freakin’ love it.
 Had the red Zizo for 2 years. Wonderful product . Lasted threw many many drops and falls and spills. However bought a new one to replace my one case. This one has already cracked. After using it reasonably gentle for a 2 months . No hard falls . Just a lousy carpet drop .
 Like the case. And it have ports @ the bottom case if you would like to use it with your IPhone 6.
 I was impressed by the shipping time of my case. When received it, I put my new phone in the case and it fit great. I opened up the stand on the back to set it upright on the table to take a picture and the clip broke right off. The pins and the plastic were broken. I haven’t had time to contact the seller.<br/>The case seems nice and solid but little fold out stand on the back, not so much.<br/>Part 2,<br/>I received a new case after the saw my review of this the first time. Same thing happened again. The little kick stand on the back of the case was broken when I opened it to take a picture. I would recommend buying something else.
 I have had this case for just over 30 and the company is refusing my refund/return. This case is garbage, the kick stand on the back doesn’t last. The tabs wear out quickly and the stand won’t stay shut. Now the kick stand is just coming apart. The case is no better for protecting you phone than something cheaper. Especially how poor the customer service is I wouldn’t recommend this case. Is you need a case with a kickstand stand THIS ISNT THE CASE TO PURCHASE I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!!!
 I originally obtained the product as a replacement for the otter box for iPhone 8 Plus. It was a tad cheaper and the color scheme I liked.<br/>The product has limited coverage for the screen only basic screen protector<br/>It is difficult to fit phone in cover and after 30 min of attempts I was still not able to make the rubber and plastic around the phone smooth enough to seal<br/>After installing the protection cannot wirelessly charge phone<br/>The clip is flimsy made out of poor material<br/>In summary, get an otter box, I bought one at a local store 24 h after getting this insult to modern technology
 Just got my new case for my new iPhone and love it. The cas fits nicely and looks great and feels very comfortable in my hands. Like the little stand on the back and that it came with a belt clip and a screen protector. I like how the case doesn’t add a lot of bulk to my phone. The case has a spot on top to hook up the neat little landyard that came with the case or one of your favorites. I like the case so much that I got a red and back one.
 I phone 8+ case seems to be pretty rugged, although I haven’t dropped my phone yet. I’m guessing it will protect the phone pretty well. Also the case came with premium tempered glass,bonus! Also the carrying case has a hip clip if you won’t to wear on the hip. All in all your not going to go wrong with this case. Also has a kickstand to watch videos.
 The first 5 minutes I had it I tried pulling out the kick stand. The little tab that slides broke as I was opening it gently. It’s VERY thin and flimsy at the tabs. I can still use stand a little bit it’s not very strong. Not happy with quality of that.  I like the look of the case although I wish it was a little less slick and more sticky so doesn’t slide around so easy. Not worth $18 I paid for it. More like $5
 Durable case and functional. stand works well as well as the belt clip. Case can be used with or without belt clip.<br/>Only con is when installing phone in case the edge of the case wanted to flip down inside;therefore, not fitting exactly right and leaving a rough looking edge. With a few more attempts and a credit card used as a wedge or blocking device I was able to place phone inside case without the rough edge folding inward.
 I really like the look of this case. It seems like it will protect it next time I drop my $900 phone. However, I have a iPhone 7 plus When I put the case on the volume and power buttons were pressing permanently. I took it off and using an exact knife I trimmed the bumps off on the inside of the case. The iPhone 7 plus buttons already protrude a little. Once I trimmed the inside bumps it fits and works well. If you not able to do this you might want to look else where. But if you can do this I love owning this case. It is one of the best looking cases out there. The corners are the most important part and these seem well designed. It is easy to grip and the snap on belt clip holder works great. The phone feels secure and is easy to remove and insert.
 So far I love this case! I especially love the loop that I can use to tether my phone with. I would give this case five stars but the stand is a little hard to pull out to use and I am a little hesitating to use it regularly bc it does not inspire confidence. That’s said I am glad that I made the purchase and you really can’t beat the price, or at least that’s what my wife thoughtnwhennintoldnher the cost. Love the color too!
 A nice case for the money. I don't know if it was me but I was unable to use the on/off button on the right side. It could have been that I didn't align everything perfectly. I did not want to apply too much pressure to the phone. The included screen was for the smaller 8 phone.
 The only actual disappointment that I had when I received this case was that I thought it was going to be silver looking like the picture but it was only gray no shine. The case itself is really good I have dropped my phone and it's well protected. It's also really good that it brings the gorilla glass because my phone is usually in my backpack or pockets and share the space with my keys.
 The case is extremely durable without being too bulky. I have gold and I love it. My only complaints are the hole for the Apple logo on the back is off center on the iPhone 8 Plus. I believe this is because it was originally made for the IPhone 7 Plus, and because the phones have the same dimensions, Zizo  didn’t make a separate case for the 8 plus. The Apple logo will be towards the bottom of the hole on the back, with it very slightly covering the bottom of the Apple. Other than that, the lanyard corner is annoying. It is a good phone case, and I’d recommend if you want something cool, extremely durable without being too bulky, and the tempered glass shield is better quality than most.
 I bought this for my iPhone 7 plus and it does not fit well at all. The button that turns it on and off kept turning it off and I would have to take the case off in order to turn it back on. Probably works well with other phones but I wouldn't recommend it for the 7Plus.  But it is attractive and looks to be heavy duty.
 So the product has a great look.  Now to get to the issues.  The finish work on the case is where the problems start.  The molding process they could have finished the clean up a lot better.  There is a lot of rough edges around the case.  If it wasn't something that was going to be in your hands I guess it would be ok, but it makes it rough and not that comfortable. I ended up taking a knife and scraping the edges off of all the molding marks.  This in turn took the tan color off and showed the under color of the product.  Not so good.  Next its two pieces put together with 4 rubber like rivets.  You would think everything would fit nice and flush.  Nope.  the two pieces of mine has a nice gap on the top that no matter what just keeps popping up.  I figure I will just put glue on it or something sometime.  I mean, What do you expect yugo vs porsch right?  but if they put a little more quality control into this it would be a pretty nice case.
 I had my phone in this case in the visor above my head in my car. I turned the corner and accelerated to about 40 mph as I watched my phone fall out of the visor. I tried to catch the phone as it tumbled off the dash, onto the steering wheel and out the window into the street. I watched it tumble and flip as it finally came to stop in the lane. I stopped my car and ran back as two cars ran it over. I saw one Car drive both right side front and back tires over it. Screen down.<br/><br/>No damage to my phone or my screen. NONE! I have multiple cases and used to switch them out every so often. After this I am not taking this case off of my phone.<br/><br/>Good job with this case guys. 5 stars.
 I've always bought zizo cases but this one was rough around the edges like it been dragged across the Amazon warehouse till it got a buyer. Would still buy it again. Wireless charging compatible, pop socket not so much unless u put it at the very bottom or get a small one that fits around the grooves.
 So long story short... I normally break phones within 30-60 days of having them after I purchase a new phone. I bought this case the same day I got my new IPhone 8+ But received it the next day. It has saved my phone time and time again. I have gotten many compliments as well for the look and style. But it is definitely a durable and great quality case. I will definitely by another one if I want to change color or get a new one.
 I just got this case a few days ago. I like the style and the red is pretty cool looking. I use the kickstand to watch movies on the patio after dark. I am very careful with my iPhones: haven't drop one in years. For that reason, I can't say how much the case will actually protect the phone. But it certainly looks like it will provide adequate protection.<br/><br/>I'm happy with this case and I've had plenty of expensive cases with less style. I have no doubt that this case will protect my phone just as well as anything else costing much more.
 Like all smartphone owners I have dropped my phone on the carpet before however this gem not only cracked my screen but also the case on back is starting to crack Do Not purchase without CAREFULL considerations
 I love this phone case so far..I have only had it about a week but it’s very durable and I like the design. Looks exactly like the picture. The only issue I have is the kickstand in the back is hard to get open, it hurts my fingers when prying it open. It’s easy to close, and holds my phone up perfectly so I can watch YouTube while I’m doing dishes etc. i would buy another and recommend it to friends/family! 👍🏻
 Looks great. It was very hard to get my phone into the case. When I finally put it in the case the buttons did not work on it. So I could not turn it on and off or the volume buttons did not work.
 Junk. Belt clip broke within 3 hours of use. Almost lost my phone bcz it fell out. Not happy at all with this product.<br/><br/>EDIT: I reached out to Zizo and they responded the same day that they are shipping out a replacement. Very kind, very fast. They did a good job.<br/><br/>EDIT: The replacement holster does not fit the case. The locking tab does not line up so the phone will not stay in the holster. It's too bad because this could be a nice case if the entire package could be used together. Still awaiting resolution from Zizo.
 The desert tan zizo bolt case is awesome though<br/>It is great soft rubber and hard rubber casing the kick stand is OK I'm satisfaction overall I really love the the iPhone 7 plus case the belt clip is on the weak side it i feel that the belt clip would not be great for some one that use's  belt clips it is great buy for the cell phone case it self I posted all the many photo's for you guys to see to help make your decision there is YouTube video out there to if you need further information
 Im going to return this product . The sides button are not working . Is weird because i bought the same case , different color for my husband , and the side buttons are working perfectly fine . It looks that where the side buttons are is not attached to the case . I’m going to ask for a replacement because I really like it
 I work as a custodian at a university. I cracked my previous phone using cheaper cases and  I needed a case that could stand up to the chemicals we use at work and being splashed with water. This case fits the bill! I love that I can clip it onto my belt and not worry about it. Being able to access the lightning port while being completely encased is an added bonus. It’s also a breeze to unclip it and use the stand to watch streaming movies.I just wish they had more fashionable colors but overall I’m happy with this purchase.
 My last case was very similar to this. I like the matte finish, it adds some grip to the case. The outer case is quite firm and hard to install, getting the buttons through the access holes requires some effort. The buttons are really firm too, but they do the job. We have a two-year-old, so having a case equipped with a kickstand for movies is a must. All around this case looks good and provides a good level of protection.
 Overall I like this case. My only problems are with the design. I had an extremely difficult time getting my phone into the hard shell once the soft shell was on. The side buttons would not properly line up on the phone once in the hard shell. This meant taking it on and off several times to get it right, and risk possibly damaging the phone. The clip takes some work to get the phone seated correctly when your wearing it, which means dropping your phone if you're not careful. Fortunately, it seems well made to protect the phone from just such drops. I have some scratch marks on the case from trying to get the phone in and back out of the case. I was going to send it back, but now that it is on correctly, it will do the protection job nicely. I will not be taking it back out of this case until I am ready to trade the phone in due to the degree of difficulty in getting it in there in the first place!
 This is a really, solid case. It has a nice, matte (kind of) feel to it. I really love the laynard and the belt clip that comes with this case. Also a screen protector? That's a real extra bonus.<br/><br/> The only thing about this case is it's EXTREMELY hard to put on. If you like changing the look of your phone DO NOT buy this. It will be extremely frustrating for you. You put this on, you're going to keep it on. Also, the bottom of mine has a cutout for the headphone jack, but it said 7 plus? It doesn't bother me, but it might for some of you.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this case. It's definitely worth the money.
 This case is durable however after I applied the screen protector and put the case on, the case actually lifts the corners of the screen protector.  I tried a couple times to see if maybe I put it on wrong but it happen every time. Because of this issue it brought me to another issue. I tried taking out the first, silicone layer of the phone case to see if maybe the screen protector issue would disappear and found it extremely difficult to seperate the two pieces. I finally had to take a pen and push the lock button in to get them seperated and as I'm following along the edge, the plastic layer slices me! Btw this method didn't prevent the screen protector from lifting so it was pointless. And another thing the kickstand is made cheap so it's hard to get open and closed and it feels like it will snap off. Durability is good but as for working with a screen protector, don't get it and don't use the kickstand often either.
 The thing didn’t last two days without the phone stand breaking just opening it up. Thing is junk. I should have known better and just ordered another Otter Box. I went for the cheaper price. I won’t ever do it again, because you do get what you pay for no doubt!
 This case has a modern distinctive design, holster if needed and even tempered glass included.<br/>There is a pull out on the back of the case if you need a stand for the phone so you can view the screen without holding it.  There is a loop on the top edge where you can attach a key ring if needed.<br/>For all these features the price makes it a no brainer.  There are plenty of color choices as well.<br/>Just pick a color and buy it.
 Wish I could give it more stars for the color combo which is unique and hard to find. However, as others have stated in their reviews, the power button gets depressed when the phone is inserted correctly into this case making this a non-functioning case. Hopefully they can get this critical design flaw resolved as it otherwise looks to be an excellent case.
 iPhone 8 Plus does not reliably charge on induction charger while in case!  Still have to take phone out to ensure charge.  Also the clip lasted all of two (2) weeks with very light use.  Looks great but it is unfortunately a piece of crap.  Looking for new case now.
 This doesn’t work for me.  Once you put the case on the iPhone you can’t adjust the volume or turn the iPhone off, no matter how hard you press those buttons.  I’m taking it back.
 Everything seems to be good. My only complaint would be that the tempered glass seems a bit small around the edges. It fits fine around the home button and the ear speaker. The case feels sturdy enough.
 Great case. Well protected, great design. The belt clip only goes on one way and is a struggle to get the phone on to it and off of it some times. Dropped the phone while in the case and never broke the phone so it keeps the phone protected. The 3 Star Rating is because of the button setup. I kept catching the power button and vibrate button every time I tried to use the buttons for volume up and down or power they wouldn't actually hit the buttons on the phone. I finally cut the buttons out of the case and just used the phones buttons. The button setup needs some serious work to make this a 5 star case.
 Works like a charm. Easy to assemble, comfortable to hold, and does the job. So far my wife hasn't broken her phone, and that is a good sign. Only reason for the ding on a star is the kick stand is a pain to pop out. It took me getting a screw driver to pop it out the first time. After that, it has been manageable but still difficult to pop out. Maybe just a bad one?
 The case seems very sturdy and I do like this kickstand feature built into the back.. Two things that I do not like are the Fact that phone can only be inserted into the case things down. And second, the tab that allows you to attach a lanyard is that the top of the case and should be at the bottom. This will allow you to lift the phone while it is hanging around your neck and be in the right position for usage, not upside down!
 This product is a piece of crap. I bought this for my husband thinking that it would be a durable phone case. Haven’t even had it 2 months and it is falling apart. The clip for holding the phone to the belt clip broke only after a few days. The kickstand broke as well. The covering on the case is cracking and falling off. Majorly disappointed in this product. Will not recommend or buy again.
 Love this case BUT I had the exact same series for a Galaxy S9 that you could place phone in holster from either direction. Now this one I got for the iPhone 8PLUS you can only place it in holster one direction and when wearing on right side the phone is in to where I have to rotate it when taking it out. Would be perfect if you could snap it in from either side.
 Perfect for sports, hiking, snow shoeing etc. Wear around your neck, has a stand to stand it up and durable.
 I purchased a rose colored iPhone 7/8 cover thinking it was for a 7/8 plus. I gave it to my daughter.  I then purchased the correct 7/8 plus rose colored cover.  The plus cover looks like a matte camel color.  Compared to the first  same zizo 7/8 cover I bought.  My wife which I bought the plus cover for is very disappointed when she sees the difference.  We love the protection but the difference in color is very disappointing.  And the stand was actually hot glued together, when we opened it the small part fell off and wouldn’t go back together.
 Product is nice. I like the design and get regular compliments on the xoxo products I have purchased. The "rose gold" bolt I bought for my daughter is a little more copper than rose imo and it's not as girly as I was shopping for but it is an excellent product beside.
 I hunt and climb trees and needed a durable case with a lanyard attachment. These cases have been great for me. Used them on an iPhone 7 and a 7 plus.<br/><br/>I don’t use the original wrist strap. I tied a stronger piece of shock cord to mine. I clip it onto backpacks,/ackets etc.<br/>Also great when riding in boats or fishing
 I like the texture and look of the case.  I dropped it 1 star because at first I couldn't get any of the buttons to work.  (Power or Volume).  I read some of the other reviews and played around with it and found that the Power Button was pressing against the button on the phone and so that made the volume buttons not work.  I took some sandpaper and sanded it down a little bit and all 3 buttons started working again.<br/>Also the circle in the back, is not centered around the apple symbol, and in fact some of the logo is outside of the circle (Unlike photo).  It's more of a annoyance than anything.<br/><br/>Seems to work with QI charging. Screen protector seems decent.
 This is a good sturdy case, and I like the necklace loop, but the loop is hooked on the top, so you're looking at your phone upside down!  Put the loop on the bottom so you pick up your phone and it is oriented the correct way.
 Very nice case. I needed a new case and actually thought of spending $50 on another Otterbox case. I’m glad I didn’t. For me, the only cons are, one, how snug it is, this being hard to put on, and take off. And two, the logo on the back is it protected by anything. My otterbox protected it well. Still flawless after two years.
 Very rugged case with very wimpy kickstand that only works landscape... but not for very long, because mine is now broken after a month of very little use.  Looking for another case that has more rugged kickstand that works both ways...
 I thought the case was turning the phone on also, after reading some of the reviews, but when I removed the case I found the phone (iPhone 7 Plus) still kept turning on when I moved it. Started looking in Settings and found the Raise to Wake option was on. Turned it off and now the phone doesn't do that, even in the case. Great case! I like the lanyard. The screen cover is a little too narrow and leaves one thin edge of the screen uncovered.
 Nice case, love the color as it matches my new phone. Kick stand takes a few uses to get it to lossen up a bit. I dont use the belt clip.<br/><br/>Only issue i have with this product is the tempered glass cracked on me even before I could put it on my phone. The little piece that suppose to pull the film off broke off and when i tried to get it off otherwise it cracked. This was a big reason why I chose this particular case. Very bummed about it.
 This is the best phone case I've ever had. It's as good as an Otter box if not better but much more streamlined and fashionable. I got the Rose color to match my IPhone. I have 2 phones, my personal and my work phone which has the Otter box. My profession doesn't allow the convenience of a purse so the clip on feature is a plus. This phone comes with a lanyard that I wasn't sure I would use. I use it everyday! I loop it thru my belt loop to add as extra security. The only thing that I would like to see different is for the makers to have a hole for the camera lens on the clip holder. The case itself does. It would just be faster for those unexpected picture moments!
 I bought this case for my iPhone 8 Plus, because I liked the look of it on Amazon’s site. It looks and feels great in person. It was easy to install, and it comes with a nice bonus, a nice tempered glass screen protector that installs perfectly with no bubbles. The charging port is nice and wide so one can use any third party charging cable with no issues. Great deal.
 So far, I LOVE this case. I thought the black ridges were going to be raised higher than they actually are. I was pleasantly surprised that they aren’t. I really like that I can hold the phone at a slight slant and the phone won’t slide out of my hand because of the ridges. Love the color even more in person. Still slim enough to put in my pocket. So glad I decided on this one.
 The case is well made and fits well. I use a auxiliary battery and a car mount that uses a magnet to secure them. The texture on the back is not compatible with them. If you don't use them the case and belt clip work fine.<br/><br/>That is NOT why I gave the case a 2 star rating. its the screen protector. It is so thick and unresponsive that it make the phone almost unusable. I ordered a different case and protector and went back to using me old phone till it arrived.<br/><br/>I have the encased case and their screen protector and it is working fine
 Fast delivery. Sturdy case. I would definitely recommend this
 After two months of light use the kickstand broke. I've owned Zizo products in the past and haven't had an issue. Pretty bummed.
 Good strong case, only 4 stars because I’m right handed and with the lanyard hoop located where it is, I have to turn the phone around just to clip it in the holster, almost like it is designed for left hand people only. I like the case but, I will keep it as a backup, so most likely I will never use it since I work construction and the otter box defender held up for 2+ years on my iPhone 6. This case is just not exactly what I want, but it definitely is a good tough case!
 2 issues - the first one on my end - I thought I’d ordered a black one, undoubtedly I didn’t. Got a blue one. Wasn’t that big a deal and my fault so I moved on.<br/>Second issue - owned 2 days, gently set up the back kickstand to gently set on my dinner table, hinge crumbled in my hands. Disappointed. Owned a similar product for much cheaper that lasted several months. Will probably go back.
 I like this case. It provides good protection. I like he stand built in to the case. The belt clip is slightly cumbersome but is convenient when I don’t have a pocket my phone will fit into. The string that comes with it broke within a day or two so don’t count on that to be very helpful. Also the case is extremely difficult to get on an iPhone 8. I did it but I’ll probably have to crack the case to get it back off. Overall I’m happy with this case.
 Just received it today and opened the package 15 minutes ago. I have to say the case is really nice and is good price especially with the screen protector; however, I adjusted the holster clip by spinning it.. one click and it broke right off. Pretty thin, cheap piece of plastic. I ordered this case specifically because I needed the holster but not sure now it can be trusted. :(
 I was very skeptical after reading reviews that said it kept on shutting off because the off button was too tight against the case. I received my case today and put it on my IPhone 7 plus. I was relieved although it was difficult to apply because of the tightness and I had to use a small flat head to get it on but I am pleased to say they must have heard the complaints about the off button and also fixed the case for the speakers with two holes. My phone looks and feels beautiful and now I have to go and return my $59 Otter box (gladly) because I paid less than half the cost of my Otter and got a better product. Thank you for offering such a quality case for such a great price that included the glass and kick stand, mind blowing to have such a great deal. Highly recommend for IPhone 7 plus! 🤗
 This case has withstood countless drops of various heights and angles. I haven't chucked it off a bridge, and you shouldn't throw $500+ anywhere unless you are comfortable with losing it anyway. The screen protector did crack and I am not happy that this is an iPhone 6+ case labeled as an iPhone 7+ case (it has the headphone slot and yes that matters to me). I have had this case since a couple weeks after the iPhone 7 launch, and I would probably go for a simpler design and buy a quality screen protector if I had to do it over again.
 However, the BIG Disappointment was in the built in Easel Back!!  :(  The smaller, (approximately 1"), piece that locks the easel in place is too fragile ... I have already broke 3 of them!!!  The part should be a metal stamping!!!  I contacted the manufacturer and they do not have the small parts!!!
 Pretty good so far..excellent if you have a toddler that takes ur phone and dropp it all the time... .this is my 2nd time choosing this military protector  I bought it for my Apple 7 plus last year .. and this month for my Apple 8plus
 bought it for my dad who just got his first smart phone after being forced to join the 21st century since AT&amp;T was going to stop their 3G service.<br/>My dad was very scared he would ruin his new, very expensive phone so I bought him this.<br/>It came with a lanyard and a clip. Very useful and he has not dropped his phone yet.
 This is garbage, the kick stand didn’t last 1 day, I will not be ordering anymore of these.
 The phone case doesn't fit correctly for the iPhone 8 plus. It holds down the power button and continuously turns it off. Tried to return it and am getting charged for shipping and a restocking fee - when the item is defective and should not be restocked. Not impressed and won't ever purchase from this company again.
 I have used this case and cover since September 2018. Within a month the belt clip rotating mechanism broke and I used fast setting epoxy glue to fix it. last month on an international trip the side of the case where the clip is broke and the phone is no longer secure. I have written tot he company twice and got case numbers by no response. I would no recommend this case as the materials are poor and the company unresponsive.
 This is only getting two stars because I bought two and the person (who has an iPhone 7 Plus) likes it. I however, do not. It does NOT fit my iPhone 8 Plus. And the “kickstand” in the back is VERY HARD to get out on both cases. I emailed the company about the “kickstand” and they said that it just takes some “wearing into” for it to come out easier. I’m not happy about this and unfortunately I have already thrown my box away so it cannot be returned.
 “Military Grade” only if you have an army of pansies. The stand broke off after 3 months and a week. I feel like I purchased a crappy mercenary for $20. I should’ve bought another Otterbox, but I was being cheap. Lesson learned.<br/>Company responded quickly to my email to try and steal more cash with a further purchase of an additional phone case with a “lifetime guarantee”. Please advise, they’ll be bankrupt before fall.
 My son loves this phone case.  It is very sturdy and stylish.  The price point is excellent.  The little "kickstand" on the back of the case broke after a few days, but my son is not the most gentle handler of his things.
 Love these phone cases, they are cheap, look good and do a relatively good job of protecting your phone. I have destroyed two of these cases (and I am on my 7-8th ballistic glass protector) so far, but I am very hard on phones and cases....so far it has kept my phone looking good. Lots of color combos as well and the price is right.
 Perfect case!! Bought for my husband who was displeased with the last case I bought him bc the  clip broke in 2 weeks. This one is very sturdy and  has the glass screen protector as well. He loves the ruby red color, and it looks sort of metallic!!!! Awesome.
 I bought the white/gray one. The white has almost completely rubbed off; looks terrible. Also, BIG problem with the Power Button, as others have written. Impossible to pull out the stand by finger only, must always use a tool to pry it open.
 Less than two weeks and the clip broke.  Pass, pass, pass!  Even with cheaper ones you get a solid 6 months to a year.  I purchased it for my boyfriends because the clip is more secure for his medical scrubs.  The case is decent but for him, we’ll have to find another one.  The clip is so necessary. Bummer!
 I swear by these cases for my phone. I never had an issue with these cases or the screen protectors that come with it. Although I will say, replace your case if it cracks, breaks, etc. I had broken the top left part of my case and was going to replace it the day I dropped my phone from a ladder. I know if I had chnaged it to the new one, it wouldn’t have cracked my phone. It only cracked where I broke the piece off on the case.  It wasn’t the cases fault. This is probably like my 6th case, because I like changing th colors and never have an issue
 Verrrrrrry disappointed! I was looking forward to this sturdy case and holster, and my iPhone 8 + did fit in it, but none of the buttons worked at all! I wrestled it off my phone to double-check everything was lined up; it was, but pressing on the buttons generated absolutely no visible movement toward the buttons inside the case. It was as if they were hard-shell plastic. Sending it straight back.
 I like it. I like the texture and the raised gripping surfaces - great for a sweaty hand and fingers. The rear prop-stand is neat but the angle is too shallow. Also would be cool to engineer it to flip around to front of phone to prop it for picture taking. The only problem I have is it is snug around the power button and sometimes just gripping the phone near the power button activates it. Although, over time, this is loosening up.
 I really do like the case.  It is what I wanted and expected. I like the color, it is the same as my IPhone 7 Plus.  I would have rated it 5 star except I would have like to be able to use the belt clip on the front and the back of the phone, so the screen would be available on top, without having to take the back(belt clip) off to use the phone.  My case for my IPhone 6 Plus was able to do this
 I'm right handed, and the reason I list this is as follows.  Because of the tether loop in the top left hand corner, the phone has to go into the holster only one way.  As it's on my right hip, the phone is facing my backside.  Natural movement of taking it out of the case means the phone is upside down.  To correct this, I have to wear the holster upside down (release clip facing the ground).  The orange plastic shell is not a tight fit, the cut out on the back has a spot or two that is not flush with the rubber case.  I have thought about super-gluing it down but so far I have not.  Lastly, the power button is too snug, when pressing it on the case you almost do not feel any movement.  It feels like you are not pushing the button, sometimes it registers with the phone and sometimes it doesn't.
 Looks like the photo and fits the iPhone 7 Plus perfectly. Has a decent bumper edge so it protects the screen. Easy to put on, seems durable and has a sturdy stand. I did accidently drop my phone and it did its job. The belt clip, loop/lanyard works. I didn't use the screen proctector, but seen that the glass covers the camera and the protector had the hole on top of the speaker instead (where there is no camera). Only reason why I didn't give this product 5 stars...Without the screen proctector I give it 5 stars. Good buy and looks like it'll last a good while.
 I love this case. It’s my second one. (I switched to a plus.) I dropped my old phone more times than I would like to admit, so SO many times. The phones was never any worse for wear. The kickstand is a great feature. It’s a little stiff at first and I actually popped mine out completely and was pissed/bummed because I had already thrown away the packaging. Luckily, with a few deep breathes I was able to figure out how to get it back into place! If I’m being honest I’ve already dropped this new one too and seems like this case is just as sturdy and protective as my last one.
 This case just doesn't fit iPhone 7 Plus. You cannot press the power and the volume buttons once you put the case on.<br/><br/>On the box, the stick says "For iPhone 7S Plus". I don't even know there is a iPhone 7S Plus. I am returning the product without question.
 This case more than met my expectations.  Otterbox seems to have cornered the market on tough cases, but this Zizo case is proof that there are quality alternatives to the non sheep purchasers of the world.  Effort was clearly put into the styling making it stand out from the generic appearance of so many others.  The tempered glass screen protector and belt clip are nice free included additions, as is the built in kickstand on the back of the case.<br/><br/>Speaking of the kickstand if I had to voice a complaint about anything, it would be that the kickstand is quite difficult to pull away from the case at times.  With that being said, however, I'll gladly take that over a kickstand that keeps popping out when not wanted.<br/><br/>Save yourself some money over the more well known options, and be just as happy, if not happier!
 Love the case! Very sturdy and holds my IPhone 7+ tighter than Gorilla Glue. Comes with everything you could possibly need including a new screen cover.<br/>The only con I have is that the picture makes it look more metallic but in all actuality it’s just plain grey/black. Nice case nonetheless. Definitely would recommend and buy again
 Good case and seems protective. I work in the utility construction field and needed a very protective case. I bought a cheap one for my last phone and shattered my sceen when I dropped it. I’ve dropped this phone a handful of times but this new case has served me well.  I like the grip to it so it doesn’t slide out of my uniform pocket. My only complaint is it is extremely difficult to get on and off.
 This cover fits my phone well and looks great.  The blue color really stands out and has a quality soft texture to it that is grippy but seems to slide well in and out of my pocket.  The stand is convenient and the side buttons work great and the hole in the case where the charger cable sticks through is large enough to accommodate after market chargers.
 I LOVED THIS CASE WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED IT BECAUSE IT LOOKED GREAT. BUT, BE AWARE IT WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR PHONE. I SAT IN A CHAIR(NOT FAR OFF THE GROUND), MY PHONE FELL OUT OF MY POCKET AND THE FACE OF MY NEW IPHONE CRACKED. I AM NOW LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CASE AND I WILL THROW THIS ONE AWAY. IT DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR PHONE!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
 Really upset, the description is misleading. I receive an iPhone 7 case instead of an iPhone 7 Plus. On the box there's a barcode that says iPhone 7 Plus, and then there's a tag on it that says iPhone 7 and indeed was the wrong size case. I was reading reviews from other's having the same problem and I took a chance and my surprise, I am definitely not buying it from this brand again. Case itself was nice and well descriptive in how it looks but receiving the wrong phone case it has no words for it.
 I like the case, feels sturdy and not as bulky as others I tried. Have experienced the hard to press buttons, and other issues mentioned by others; but, what bothers me the most is, it seems the case designers are left handed, as the case must be fit on your left side to make it adequate for using the phone properly (without having to switch hands, or flip the phone.) I am right handed, and frankly, get tired of having to rotate the phone every time I try to use it - just for that reason, looking for another case. Why such a poor option in design? If the lanyard was essential for the product's marketability, the phone enclosure should have been designed with the lanyard holder at the top center of the case, with the indentations for the retaining clip in both lateral sides - that would have made it with a better design, and greater usability for all users - not just for those left handed (what were they thinking?)
 Immediately after unboxing and trying out the kickstand, it broke. Right in half and the slide that the support arm uses, the ends brok off. VERY fragile material. Returned it. New kickstand shattered into 4 pieces. I’m going on about 1 1/2 months with the second (still broken) one. Phone belt clip thing is great. Case itself seems like it won’t be worth a damn in a few months because what started out as decently durable feeling material, has quickly become softer with little wear. Probably going to try and return this one too. -___-
 1 star because the description is incorrect and needs to be fix.<br/>Case is nice and what my husband really and we paid extra for next day shipping. However, it states in the description for iPhone 8/7 plus and he has the 8plus and doesn’t fit phone. Plus, we had to pay to return the item. That’s always a bad review because it should always be free to return incorrect shipped items.
 I’ve only had the case for 2 days and the little kickstand is already broken. Don’t care for the black hole at the top for the cord. The material seems like it will stand up to many drops. Doesn’t make the phone super bulky like the otter boxes. Comes with a piece of glass. Only other thing I would change is the four black spots on the back of the case make it slippery don’t think they are needed. Other then that I think it would be a decent case.
 Honest one of the best phone cases I’ve ever owned, it just feels good to hold and never feels like it’s gonna fall out of my hands. Small enough to not make a bulge in ur pocket but  sturdy enough to feel comfortable to drop, on recommendation is to get a impact screen protector Incase u slam the front screen. But u don’t need to worry about the screen if u drop the phone because the case wraps over the top edge of the screen. Honestly one of the best cases I’ve ever had owning it for almost a year.
 love this case but the kickstand was flimsy and eventually a piece broke off so now it doesnt stand open. You cant see where its broken but it was a nice feature to have and I miss it.  i will probably order again so I can have that and compared to some other phone cases this was a very good price.
 I first ordered this case two years ago and it was great. Held up and protected my phone. I always had used otter box in the past. Recently the stand broke so I ordered a new one, thinking I would get the same life out of the new one. Unfortunately, the stand broke after only a couple of days. Now I am going to have to find another type/brand of case.
 Do NOT buy this product. My phone has survived multiple drops throughout the last two years, the MINUTE I put my phone in my pocket the screen shattered., protector be damned. I want a full refund, and apology for costing me a new $900 phone.<br/>Pissed in  Arizona
 Great case! Probably one of the best (especially for the price). Could use a little more cushion/shock absorption around the front and edges - and it would be PERFECT. I purchased a similar one for my phone (this one is for my son's phone) and mine has much better protection. Can't complain, though. Great case and price - the kickstand and lanyard are an extra bonus!
 This case didn't work for me. The power button on the case would not work on my phone and if it did I would have to push around the button or the front or back of the case. The concept is cool and texture and looks different I would not order this for the iPhone 7 plus. It's made for the 6 plus because of the headphone jack cut out. It has the dual camera cutout but I would not recommend for iPhone 7 plus users.
 The case is ok, its hard to get the phone out, once you get it in, and when I tried to get it out I was worried I was going to crack the glass on the back of my iPhone. The glass screen protector had a manufacturing defect....a small bubble in the adhesive on the back of the glass made it look like I had a speck of dust, but when I took it off, It was a small bubble. The case itself is pretty good, Its sturdy and has a raised lip, but Zizo could add some felt or something like that on the inside of the rubber where the back of the phone contacts the rubber.
 I have dropped my phone so many times and this military-grade case takes all the impact of each fall cushioning my phone so it doesn't get damaged. And I love the option that I can cover the screen or not depending on what I'm doing.
 Very good case at a fair price. Many other cases are priced at what the vendor seems to be the max they can charge for an item; these folks charge a fair and decent price for what the merchandise is. Installs fairly easy and seems to effectively protect the device. The shape and style of the case, matched with the materials used in its construction, present excellent grip and ergonomic qualities.  It comes with a lanyard that has a quick-disconnect that seems a bit weak and untrustworthy; given the weight of the case, phone, belt clip, and protective glass..  However, if you opt to forego the lanyard, you cannot find a more durable case out there.
 The positives- Good protection, easy to access controls and works well with the speakers. I also use the kickstand often and it work great but is somewhat hard to pull out. I have not used the belt clip because the iPhone 7 Plus is pretty bulky.<br/>Negative- I had to file down the power button nub on the interior to get it to work well. It would power on and off with the lightest touch. After I filed it down it has been great.
 I bought the red and black, it looks good on my red iPhone. Case has good grip. I thought the lanyard would be in the way of handling phone and wondered why any one would need one a lanyard. The day after I got my case, I seen a commercial of someone taking pictures from a swinging bridge over a river. Right then, I thought I would never do that without a lanyard, or insurance. The place for the lanyard attachment actual acts as additional grip. My thoughts were why don't they have this on both top corners. The only complaint, is they belt clip, I am rough on phones, and a leather and metal clip would be better. I have never had a phone case with belt clip make from plastic that I didn't break.
 Found that it was really hard to get my iphone inside the case.  This case has an interior rubber lining.  Once assembled, the volume buttons worked fine, but the rubber covering on the power button didn't function.  After putting it in and out of the case a couple times, I couldn't get the iphone power button to work.  So finally I just used a knife to cut out a large square hole where the power button is.  its ugly, but it works.
 The case is really nice and it feels solid, great kickstand and holster. It is a bit difficult getting the phone in the case but once it's on its great. Disappointed with the screen protector as no matter what it wouldn't stick to the screen completely almost as if there was not enough adhesive and yes the screen was cleaned to perfection before applying it.
 Amazing case I have the tan color for 8 plus. It has a gear leather feel and kick stand to watch movies at work haha. I would have loved a more of a flat surface for the magnet I wanted to use it with for my car but doesn’t stick as the surface is not flat.
 I have an iPhone 8 Plus and ordered this. It’s designed specifically for an iPhone 7 Plus and will fit your iPhone 8 Plus if you put in a little work. Take out the silicone inside cover before putting it into the hard plastic sleeve. I had to cut out the silicone volume and power buttons to get it to fit and then super glue them back to the inside lips of the hard case. Works perfect since I did this and the case is tight and has a unique disign. Very pleased after modifications.
 Just received my Zizo iPhone 7+ case. First thought. Very cool looking.  Like the feel In the hands. Very lightweight and durable. Had a difficult time putting on the hard case, but I got it.<br/>Ok now my dislikes. The clip will only allow you to install the phone one way. Guess it's do to the  lanyard loop. Not a big deal. What I really am not liking is the power button cover. It will not allow me to turn off the phone when I am done. I press and press. Wiggled it, nothing. Tried to take a screen shot. Nope. Would not let me. Tried to hard reset it. Nope. The power button cover would not allow me to use it. Did some  modifications so now it work. What kind of modification you ask,?  I cut the cover off. It don't look right but it works.
 Phone case broke around the silent switch in less than three months and a couple weeks later the kick stand broke off.  Now it continues to crack in other places. I’ve never dropped the phone and I only taken it off the phone one other time.  I like the way it looks on phone I thought about buying another one but it still cracking I’m not sure if it’s just a problem with this case but  I would to get another one and have the same problem.
 UPDATE after a year and a half: accidentally dropped my phone in the laundry machine a couple months ago and it survived a full wash cycle!! The screen protector came off (which I replaced for $3 from Amazon) but the phone still works PERFECTLY - 10/10 reccomend<br/><br/>I really do like this case. It's super lightweight and it comes with a lanyard that I have attached to the corner. I didn't want to spend a lot on a new phone case as I usually go for an Otterbox and Zizo was a perfect fit. The blue color is also A LOT more muted than it appears here--more of a midnight blue than this neon color. It looks and feels really good. I've also dropped my phone a couple of times since putting on the case and no damage has been done!! Definitely recommend it
 LOVE! As a long time otterbox user I decided to get my head out of the sand and look around for a case for my new 8 Plus. I’m officially in love. So much so that I ordered another one for a friend! The case fits perfectly and is not as thick or clumsy as my previous case. It’s got a very useful stand and actually I didn’t know it also came with a lanyard! Bonus! Nice to attach a wristlet of your choice too. Highly recommended from a very satisfied customer. I got white- no problems with dirt.
 Protect ’s phone very well  and the stand in the back is very convenient, but the holdster doesn’t last very long,after a few months of breaks and you can no longer use it and if you drop the phone while the stand is open I will break off very easily.
 Love this thing. Rugged, easy to hold, easy to insert into clip. I did not see myself using the clip but I gave it a go and haven’t stopped using it. The screen protector is great as well.

Very difficult to put on/take off also. Very disappointing!
 We received this case and it was described as being compatible with the iPhone 8s. When it arrived, the packaging was not sealed; indicating it had been opened and returned before. Tempered glass screen protector was missing. Case went on the phone but it took A LOT of effort and elbow grease. The case was so tight that it was constantly pressing on the buttons on the side; causing the phone to continuously cut off and try to dial SOS Emergency calls. Sent back the same day it was received so we could get a refund.
 I bought my first case earlier this year and I overall liked it. After almost five months the belt clip broke. I wear it on my duty belt, I am a police officer, and it goes through a lot. I did not mind that it only lasted as long as it did so I bought another case, I could not find just a clip. That one lasted four days. I mailed it back today.<br/>The case is really good. I have dropped my phone numerous times with no damage at all. So if your looking for a good case buy this one. If you need a belt clip shop for something else.
 Took me all of two minutes to snap the tempered glass protector. No where in the item description does it say that it should be applied in a static free room. After having to lift the glass a half dozen times to clean and realign it cracked. Also the case it's self would be great if the power button was accessible. The case is too tight and continuously presses against it.
 Of all the cases on all the mobile phones I've owned over the years, the Zizo is my favorite.<br/>This case is sturdy, functional and attractive. The texture provides a great grip - whether I'm texting, taking photos or just scrolling through my news feed, I don't worry about it slipping from my hands.  The slim construction doesn't add much bulk - phone still drops comfortably into my back pocket.
 My husband ordered this case to go on his new iPhone after his last phone was damaged in an Otterbox.  As soon as he took it out of the box and started looking it over the little piece of plastic connecting the belt clip snapped in two making the clip unusable.  He was looking forward to having this feature and didn't get to use it at all.  Yes, he can exchange it, but he has to send the broken case back before they'll send a replacement instead of sending him the replacement first and then letting him mail back the broken one.  It's just a hassle really.  Otherwise it's a nice looking case.
 Kickstand on case broke first time I put cover on phone. Used for a week or so, then the fake bolts on the back feel out.
 Honestly don't drop the money. I have had mine for just over a month and it has fallen apart. The kickstand is flimsy and snapped right off the bat. Now the corners are chipping.<br/><br/>All that being said maybe I got a bad one but will never know. I reached out for help and was ignored.
 Bought this for my husband's new iphone and he's a fireman... and very hard on a phone. This case has so far proved to be very durable. Just be sure and put the protective screen on it that comes with it.
 Bought this for my husband. He breaks phones and cases very often.  I’ve tried everything. This case fits great. Easy to put the phone into. He has dropped his phone in this case about 10 times in the past couple of weeks and it has stayed safe. No damage to the case either. I would highly recommend to anyone who needs extra protection.  The case cover and belt/pocket clip is also very handy!
 I purchased the rose color for my iPhone 7 plus. The case fits snugly, all buttons are accessible. Screen protector was easy to put on. I would have gave 5 stars however the clip case attachment doesn't fit on onto the case at all.<br/>Also my case came with a detachable lanyard. The kick stand in the back of the case probably won't hold up long with repeated use and it's difficult to open, I'll rarely use it. Really wish the clip case part would have it.
 Very sturdy and easy to hold. The kickstand was very tight and I thought I was going to break a fingernail getting it out. Wish this was a bit easier, but I supposed over time it will loosen up. Love how the package comes with an included screen protector. The belt clip is a nice addition and covers the screen as well.
 I was super excited about this case.  The design is nice and colorful.  I like that I can clip it to my waste or attach the neck string.  Unfortunately, the stand that pops out broke immediately, the piece that braces the stand flap broke off so now the stand isn’t usable.  Thankfully I can just keep t closed and it doesn’t affect the appearance, but I’m disappointed in the product overall because of that.  I gave it 3 stars because it broke easily, but comes with several benefits- like the screen protector, neck strap, and hip clip.
 I bought this for my husband and it broke after a couple months of use.  It’s supposed to be very durable so I don’t understand how it broke the way it did. I contacted the seller who said they could not help me and I had to go to the manufacturer.  I have tried reaching the manufacturer who will not respond to me.  Very disappointed.
 This is a great case!! My husband is actually the person who uses this case, he LOVES that it is very protective, lightweight and that it has a durable belt clip! We purchased the first case for his iPhone 6s Plus and he loved it so much that we purchased another one for his new iPhone 8 Plus. His first case was in gray and the new one is in black. Thanks for much such a great product!!
 Thinner than the otter box Defender case . Dropped it many times already and cracked the protective screen but the phone was protected. I just got another screen protector...a few times ... yes , I am a bit clumsy .
 I have always been a Otterbox fan.This case is a winner I'll use a ZIZO from know on.The Finnish is outstanding how ever the only complaint I have is the power button on my IPhone 7 plus does not work properly with the case installed and after installing several times still not working correctly but that is just a little inconvenance . I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars but I don't want to send it back and not have a case on it anyway great product and it didn't break the bank.
 DON'T Buy If You Have an iPhone 7 Plus!  Should have trusted the negative reviews.  Case is made for the 6 Plus (as evidenced by the aux cutout at the bottom).  The side power button is just continuously depressed as soon as you put the phone in the case.  You CANNOT operate your 7 Plus with this case!  It's utterly ridiculous that it's being sold as a 7 Plus compatible case!!!  Just...wow.
 I have dropped my phone so many times. This case has saved me. I have 3 little kids that like to steal my phone, so it gets abused. I love being able to use the kickstand to prop it up and watch things while cooking.  love the color.
 Amazing product!<br/>Even though it’s advertised for IPhone 7 Plus, 6s Plus, and 6 plus; It “Will fit your IPhone 8 Plus”.<br/>It comes with a tempered glass, and A hard extra cover for your belt buckle, which works great!
 This is the third case I’ve ordered, not bc of some flaw or not being happy with the performance. The opposite actually. I’ve just got a few for different color options. I think this is the best case I’ve ever owned. I work at a very physically demanding place and I put my phone through a lot of abuse but I don’t have a scratch on it bc of this case. Ive banged it up. Dropped it from many different heights. And I don’t have a scratch on my phone. This case is awesome and I’d highly recommend you get it if you’re known to put your phone through all kinds of potentially damaging/breaking conditions.
 Negative: I bought this case because the stand looked like there was some quality to it. I thought that all aspects of a "military grade" product was tested, The stand broke in TWO days of having it through normal use. It is a thing piece of plastic holding the stand to the case, I will probably go back to Otter Box if they continue with the design flaw.<br/><br/>Positive: The case does curve to your hand. It feels great when i am holding it. I've dropped a few times and it performed as described.
 Don't waste your money. Case comes quick and is packaged nice and that's the only reason for three stars. The power button does not line up with the phone. Either you cant lock the phone or it will press on the power button and prompt the phone to shut off. Spend your money on the I-Blason case or the UAG case. They are similar in cost if not the same cost and are far better
 Overall this is a great product. Only reason I don't give it 5-stars is that the clips that holds the phone to the cradle can easily break. Had to buy two of these... The robust iPhone protector and glass shield is great. It has ensured my iPhone would survive the many crashes it has experienced. The holder, however, needs more design work to be considered reliable for the long term.
 This case looks super protective and safe, and awesome... but its more for office use. It cannot actually withstand damage as it appears. If you want to look like a badass while out on the town, then go home and crochet, get this case. Just don't actually drop it. The case is more delicate than the phone.
 This is a good quality case except for a couple of small things. The package stated it was for iphone 6 and 7 plus, it didn't mention 8 plus and it fits very tight. Tighter in fact than my husband's Zizo Bolt on his LG V30. The only other thing is I wish Zizo would ditch the silly lanyard protrusion as it looks atrocious. Also, the three raised ridges on the back of the case make wireless charging difficult because the phone doesn't lay flush on the charger, just the ridges. Other than that the case seems well made and I just hope they improve future models.
 Best cases ever, but there are a couple of things that hopefully get changed.  The first thing is that I love the fact that there are two stands one on the holster and one on the case itself, however the one on the case can be hard to operated.  I often have to use my knife to pop it out for use.  Maybe in the future there will be a better way to release it.
 I bought this case for my new iPhone 8+ and just received it today. The case is very nice however it presses extremely hard on the lock button causing the phone to want to turn off every 5 seconds. It’s a very tight fit and a little difficult to get on the phone. I was forced to cut out the lock button protector on the case with a razor blade but now I can’t reach the button at all Lol. So just keep in mind it may not fit 100% properly. Other than that everything is nice quality
 The case has every feature claimed and if it were not for one thing, I'd give it a five.  The problem with the case that I received is that the right side button does not work properly.  When you press the button, you can not feel the switch clicking.  This is because the case button is constantly applying pressure to the underlying switch.  A slight error in tolerance the molding process can cause this.  The volume buttons on the left work just fine and these are created the same way as the button on the right.  The bottom line is that if you are lucky enough to get a case with all the buttons working - its a great case. I'll be returning mine for an exchange.
 Case advertised for iPhone 8 Plus; Arrived, box clearly states iPhone 6 Plus, 7 Plus. Screen protector way too small to protect the entire surface of the phone. Case does not fit iPhone 8 Plus properly to protect the phone. Disappointed. Returning for a full refund.
 It chipped as soon as I put the phone in the case then I had to rip the buttons off cause it was to solid to press the buttons had to grow my thumb nail so I can dig in to turn my phone off and on the best part was the stand
 The belt clip literally fell apart within 5 minutes after attaching it to the belt...VERY poor craftsmanship
 Got this because it said it was a rugged case (and it is to some extent).<br/>Pro: I like the way it feels in my hand and it does not slip out of my hand.<br/>Con: it only fits in the belt holster ONE WAY because of the built-in loop to attach the neck lanyard. So the way it hangs in the belt clip has the top of the phone to my back...so when I answer the phone I have to flip it around instead of just grabbing it and bringing it up to my ear.<br/>That being said, everybody's taste (and opinion) is different...that's mine!
 I love this case!  It has a great design and the color is vivid.  I read the reviews and they said it was a bit bulky.  I don't think it is.  I don't use the holder.  I just put it in my purse. It works great.
 Having a love not so much love relationship with the case. Really want to give it a higher rating but it has a couple flaws. First of all I love the look, feel, and over all construction of the clip and case. In my case I found that the button that sits over the sleep button caused issues. I could not answer the phone when it was in the case. I cut that button out and now it's fine. It's hard to hit the reset button but I can answer calls. The second issue is I find the stand needs a crowbar to open. Once opened it's sturdy and works great.  Outside of those two items I love it.
 I love the way it looks.  The case itself protects the phone well.  The little pop up leg broke the first time I used it.  If you're buying for the kickstand...good luck
 Piece of junk sorry I bought it but it’s mine I’ll deal with it
 Nice case. Better than I thought it would be!
 Wanted a case with something to grip onto so it wouldn't slide out of my hand so easily.  This case is great!  Color matches my phone, tempered glass front came with the case (which also has a little pop-out stand). Also like that it's going to protect my phone better should I drop it.
 Case seems to be a little too tight for iPhone.  Just like other reviews, the case power button constantly presses on the power button of the phone, making your phone ask if you want to shut it down.  Case does have a hole for headphone jacks which the iPhone 7 does not have.  Packaging does say iPhone 7S, which does not exist.  After some time working with the case, I was able to get the power button to work without trying to shut off the iPhone, but if you use the belt clip holder, it will still ask if I want to power off the phone when I remove it from the holster.  The case is heavier than an Otterbox Symmetry, but for the price it's not too bad.  I seriously considered returning the case, but I have the button working for now and I don't use the holster that much anyways.
 Terrible case. It does not work for the 7plus I believe this is a case for the 6splus it has a cut out of the audio jack which this phone doesn't have. It holds down the lock button on the side making it so you can't use the home button and just wants to turn off. The glass screen doesn't fit properly either. Waste of money do not purchase for your phone. Just the money to get an otter box or a life proof.
 Like most people I have had a ton of cases; from huge super protective cases to thin ones. I wanted a case that would protect my both at work (in a busy kitchen) and at home (where I have 2 toddlers that love to mess with my phone) and this case is perfect. It's hard shell and rubber outer layer give maximum protection yet it isn't as thick as a leather bound book. It's easy to hold with one hand and all the ports and buttons are perfectly accessible. The belt clip is much stronger than others I have had as well. This will definitely be the brand that I stick with for awhile.
 Good looking and durable plus an added screen protector
 I bought this style case multiple times each time I upgrade iPhones. Protects phone really well, comfortable to hold at first may seem bulky but after a few days you get use to it, I love the gold color my son always gets the green color.
 I enjoyed the flashy color of the case and the kickstand for a few weeks but when trying to set up the stand on the back with minimal effort of just opening it the stands arm that keeps it attached broke in half, though I still enjoy the case and the way it feels in my hands I’m only able to say it is just another case and if you are extremely careful and slow with it it should last longer than mine did.
 I bought 2 cases for myself and my husband for our IPhone 7plus phones. And so far we love them. I love the fact that you included they type of screen protection you did with the purchase of these cases and the fact the you include a clip with the purchase as well. Couldn't be happier or more satisfied with the purchases I have made. They look nice, feel nice in your hand and you get a lot of extra for a small price. Where with other cases you'd have to buy those separately. Thank you for the awesome product keep doing what you do!
 I purchased this case and it was defective the first time but the seller was courteous and replaced it.  The next one lasted two months and the clip broke away from case holder rendering it useless.  The actual phone case still fits the phone but now I’m back to carrying it my pocket which I didn’t want to do.  Could’ve been better.  Shop around before commuting to this one
 I love the design and how it makes my iphone 7 plus easy to hold. However the power button on the case does not work, it doesn't put the phone to sleep, and you can't even press it down using 2 hands. Currently in emails with Zizo support who say its a "technical" issue, but the 17 other reviews between their own site and amazon people have had the same issue. I hope they stop blaming me that i installed the case improperly and look at actual reviews. They have a nice product, it just needs to work, and I would give it a 5 star review.<br/> ***If this issue is resolved I'll edit my review ****
 The case has a nice feel. The plastic is grippy, but still easily slides in my pocket. The kick stand is very convenient though it does take a little while to break in. The tempered class cover works great. My only complaint is the at the top of the case the plastic shell separates from the rubber a little. If you push it in at the sides the back pops out and vice versa.
 I don’t think this is very well made. I’ve had this case not even 4 months.  Within 2 month, the kick stand broke just by opening it.  It cracks easy and multiple small parts on the side have broken off. The last week, a large chunk has come off the back.  I’m not very hard on my phone so this is disappointing.<br/>Only pro is it’s comfortable to hold.
 I bought this for my husband right after our trip to Peru. My husband likes to take a lot pictures using his big iPhone 7plus during the trip. However he was also worried that he’d dropped his phone accidentally by standing over cliffs or on boats. With this new Zizo phone case that has a built-in key chain ring, he was able to tie a hand strap (our own) to secure his phone.
 This is one of the best priced iPhone 7 Plus covers that I have seen.  The housing is way too tight and stiff.  The rubber is not very flexible, so it constantly pushes on the power button and tries to turn off the phone.  Gave away to a friend.  Maybe they will have better luck.  The tempered glass is nice, but I don't think it was designed for the iPhone 7 Plus.
 So I got the case, was very sharp looking and I was looking forward to having the kickstand.  But a few things I didn't like about he kickstand, it only worked for landscape not portrait, it didn't really snap back into place easily or very well and the most important part, it the peg holding the kickstand in place broke on first fall, and it only fell about 30 inches give or take from off of my desk.  They need to construct that piece a lot better/stronger.
 Good looking case.  The case has out lasted the lanyard, (broke day one) the stand on the back (lasted 2 days and fell off) but, the case itself is tough as nails.  I've kept it just for that fact.
 Being a defender fan- until my iPhone 7s... I found this to fit snug and the belt clip ratchet to be solid and stable. I so far am pleased with the design and features
 The phone case itself is very nice, but the hard plastic piece that you would attach to your pants/belt broke within 2 months of my purchase.  I have contacted the seller, who had me contact the manufacturer, and I have yet to hear back from them aside from a standard "We will get back with you soon" email.  That was weeks ago, so to me the product cannot be used as intended since we needed it to be able to be attached to the belt loop.
 It’s a good product and it does keef the phone safe, however the process of taking off/ putting on the case is a issue for me because it’s too hard and I’m always afraid of breaking the volume buttons and the sleep/turn off button.
 I purchased this a couple days before i got my iphone 7 Plus, i couldnt wait i have wanted a zizo bolt case since i saw them. The day it came in was also the day i got the phone. I got home and threw the case on and was utterly disappointed when the buttons were SUPER stiff, and almost impossible to press. I will be sending this case back as i had to go out to best buy that night to get something to protect my shiny new 7  plus....i read through a few reviews and this doesnt seem to be a normal thing, maybe i just got a defective one :(
 Applying the screen was pretty painless<br/><br/>Squeezing phone into the case was a little tough. I like the feel of it, good grip, still thin.<br/><br/>The lock screen button however doesn't work when the case is on. No matter how I attempt to press the button, it will not work. It will sometimes give me the option to turn off the phone though, suggesting that the case is constantly pressing on the button? Kind of frustrating. May make me send it back.<br/><br/>Also the kickstand is cool but impossible to open it up. I don't have the longest nails but even what I can get under the clip, it hurts and I had to resort to a tool to open.<br/><br/>It's a shame lock button doesn't work otherwise I'd give 5 stars. I'll attempt to fix problem but think I'll end up returning
 The phone clips into the holder funny and the clip that holds in on your pocket broke the first day we used it.  Returning
 This is a protective case but need something else to protect the case from breaking. The belt clip came of in a day and Zizo promptly sent me a replacement but the rubber edges given on the sides are made of cheap plastic and peels of like candy. No point in having a case which can not protect itself
 Did not fit with iPhone 8 Plus. Was able to get the phone in the case but the the power button on the right hand side was in a bind. It kept turn the screen on and off on its own. Also the apple on the back did not line up with the hole of the case. There must be differences with the iPhone 8 Plus and 7 Plus that make the case not universal with both. This case is not for an 8 Plus.
 The case looks stylish and rugged, however the case doesn’t fit exactly. The softer first layer seems to push the power button all the time so it intermittently turns the phone on and off. I went back to using my otter box. Gave one star because looks is only second to performance.
 The tempered glass was broken upon delivery(one of two reasons I bought this), and the inner part of the case is way too rigid for my taste. Took us about 20 minutes to fit it back inside of the outer cover. 10/10 am disappointed.
 I bought the case earlier and I just got my new iPhone 7 Plus.  I am very happy with the case and all that came with it.  The case has enough ridges and texture to feel secure in my hand.  The glass screen protector was easy to install.  I am actually using the belt clip.  All in all, it seems to be a very well made case.  For the money, it is very hard to beat.
 I have bought two of the Zizo cases for my iPhone 8+. The look is great, and the included screen protector is a huge bonus. The inner protection piece though did not last long on my first purchase, only about 6 months before the part where the strap connects broke. The outer shell is excellent protection though. The carrier also snapped in half after minimal use.
 Fits my iPhone 8 Plus perfectly! The Apple logo is even perfectly centered on the back, so it’s an improvement on my older Zizo case. The stand is also more sturdy and won’t break off unless some heavy force is applied.
 I bought this case and screen protector because life proof hadn't come out with a case yet for the 7 plus. The case is really nice, comes with a kickstand which is awesome for watching movies and such! With that said I was nervous about having the screen exposed. I've always bought lifeproof cases because the screen is protected. So I thought I'd try this case with the screen protector. Well the inevitable happened. Dropped my phone, and my iPhone screen shattered. What is crazy is that the screen protector which is supposed to prevent the shattering didn't even crack but my iPhone screen did?! it claims to be be glass, but actually feels like plastic. I would recommend the case, but don't count on the screen protector to do what it claims to do. Lesson learned the hard way.
 This is the most solid phone case I ever bought. And for the price, its a steal. It came with a tampered screen protector, hand strap and, belt clip holder. The red case is gummy and the black, some kind of military grade-like plastic. I bought it for my wife and she absolutely loves it.<br/>Highly recommended.
 Been with 1 case manufacturer a long time. I decide to make a change and this Zizo case is absolutely wonderful. I always have my phone in my pocket so I love how it’s durable and sleek all in one.
 Poor design could turn volume up or down
 Cheaply made.
 This thing looks great when it arrives, but it’s cheap as hell. After about 2 weeks, the kickstand slider on the back broke off. Several chips off of the exterior have also occurred. I would t recommend this product.
 I love this case!!!! It’s the best one I have ever found. I highly recommend this! I just wish I didn’t get white, my job is very dirty. But it’s easy to clean! Love it
 This is a pretty neat phone case that looks great and fits the iPhone 7 Plus nicely. It comes in a good selection of colors to suit your tastes.  It looks and feels as if it should survive most drops and it fits the hand well with an added grip. NOTE: When putting on the case, you could easily turn off the iPhones "silent" button on the top left side of the phone (as I did). Something to watch for as your phone won't ring until it's switched back to the correct position.
 I bought this cover for my husband. I was dissappointing when the piece he uses to put on his belt broke off 5 minutes after he had opened it. The cover itself is fine even if it does not really offer good protection to the camera.
 To you and your brothers I am very happy with my phone case, I am happy it’s a sturdy one dye to my two year old granddaughter likes to play on it, and of course she drops it.  I am working on getting my older one to also get one of your cases.  I am happy with mine
 It is beautiful and nice, I really love it but there is one thing, that is not a baby proof 🤦🏽‍♂️🙈 my 2 year old kid just broke the phone stander she just pulled it and that’s it 😩
 The screen protector is a bit small for the screen. The black plastic part looks like it had a hard time coming out of the mold. It’s surprisingly smaller than what I thought it would be. It fits the phone fine, was a little bit of a hassle to get on. I’m not really sure if it will save my phone or not if I drop it.
 I'm giving it three stars because it does fit the phone and it comes with a screen protector and belt clip for no extra charge. I don't recommend this product though because it was most definitely made before the iPhone 7 Plus was revealed as there are random holes (possible iPod Touch style aux port locations) on the top of the case as well as an enlarged opening on the bottom to make room for the old aux port. If you want a cheap case with a belt clip, have at it, but don't get if you're wanting something of a higher quality that is made for the phone it advertises.
 It tis a wonderful case. Smooth in my hands, looks very nice and has an attractive feel. Holster, Tempered Glass, and Kickstand make it even better. What a bonus. I just thought great case but got much more. Thanks.<br/>Asked to right review for promo. disc.<br/>I recommend it.
 Looks great!  But it hits the power button and jams it up on the 8 Plus. I tried many times to get the phone in the case without jamming the power button.
 I really wanted to like this case.  Had a cool look, good feel and seemed pretty durable; however, I had issues with how it worked with the sleep button.  The case was so tight that it seemed to be putting too much pressure on the sleep button.  It would randomly try to power off, and I would have times where I couldn't do anything with the touchscreen.  It would act like I wasn't touching the screen when I would swipe or touch and it caused me to miss several calls.  I left the case off for a week (and it has now been over a month) and haven't seen the issue since.
 Love this case, I tend to drop my iPhone, this protects it. The design has grips to easy hold on to the phone. Yes I would buy again. Color is nice. Great price. Comes with screen protector and belt clip, if you want to use it. Great price, I would buy again.
 This the second purchase for this case due to the stand breaking. It only been a couple months and the new case stand just broke.
 The apple logo cutout is way too big and is not centered with the apple logo for the iPhone 7 Plus. If you have bad OCD this case is not for you. Overall the fit and finish is nice
 So disappointed... I just updated my iPhone 6 Plus to 7 plus, I wanted a case for my phone asap, I ordered this case along with other stuff that I didn't need just so I can qualify for the free 1 day shipping. Like I said I wanted it asap, anyways I received the case I put it on my phone , when I went to holster it to my belt it broke off, really? Box says designed for ultimate protection, durable, heavy duty.
 Fits perfectly and have dropped my phone several times without any damage thanks to this case. Plus the rose color coupled with the masculine design makes its super cool looking too! Looks brand new even after 5 months of use.
 Durable, however the kickstand broke the first day.
 It came broken. This case is poor quality. Trash material. Believe me, don’t spend your money with this case. The worst thing is that the piece that was broken... was poorly glued.<br/>Very disappointed with the seller and the product.
 The case is not really one of the better ones. It back clip broke, the case chipped. The phone never broke but there are better cases out there.
 This is the third case I've bought by Zizo. Great case, great company, great customer service. I had one for my LG V10 bak when I was maintenance in a factory. That case was bullet proof. I dropped it, hit it on things, the whole nine yards and my phone was just fine. Buy these cases. Highly recommended.
 I liked the case but It broke right at the volume controls the same week I received it.  Now it snags my sweaters.  The stand broke the next week.  This is one purpose why I purchase it, now it’s useless.
 I work in a high-volume, high-intensity  Level 1 Emergency Department. I need to have quick access to my phone but I can't risk damaging or losing it. The Zizo holster is streamlined and keeps my iPhone tight to my hip; it's accessible the second I need it. The raised lines on the case's back gives me a firm hold on my $1000 investment. Final word, Zizo's packed a $100 product into a $20 price tag. apatientnurse.com
 
 The case has an awesome look, but the power button case would continually hold down the power button on the phone while it was in the case. I tried multiple times to take the phone out and put it back in thinking it would change something, but it didn't. Besides that the case seems durable yet light weight. If I didn't have the power button issue and having to return the product for something else i would have given it 5 stars.
 This is a really nice case, phone fits snug, good grip plus kickstand. Yes this has a wider opening on left bottom of phone for 6splus but so what. Looks good, feels like it is giving excellent protect to phone. Buttons work very nice. You do have a deep recess for the sound vibrate slider so you do have press a little to get your finger in to toggle it. Not a deal breaker at all.  Going to get the black and grey also. For the price very hard to beat.
 The carrier cell broke rhe same day. And the stand alone broke too two weeks later. Dont buy white get dirty very quick. And its hard to clean.
 good case if you are active like me as it protects your rphone form those "little" mistakes....the ones that can cost you $100.00's in repair. A little bulky but otherwise its fine.
 Great product and very well made. But takes forever to take off and put back on. I have a bike handlebar mount and this case was too big to fit in. Plus I have a magnetic car holder and the rough texture of the case make it so a adhesive magnet won’t stick on.
 I recommend, I just do not like that the phone goes into the belt clip one way.  The stand is on the actual phone case only.  If not careful with the stand it can break.  I bought one for my daughter and I bought one for myself.  Her stand has broken but mine is still intact.  Mine feels like it will break if I pull it out all the way.
 The Zizo IPhone cases are just as comparable to the expensive name brands (Ott@rbox) and actually protect better and cost much less.  The other brand you have to purchase a separate screen protector to have that extra coverage, whereas the Zizo Phone cases come with an extra screen protector you install before you install the actual case on the phone...  I love it....
 I usually buy my iphone and case and screen protector at the Verizon store.  This last time, my iphone 7+ was back ordered.  When the new phone arrived, I got it activated but ran out of time to purchase the other stuff.  Saw an ad for the Zizo online and bought one.  For $20 I got a great case, a holster, and a tempered glass screen protector.  I figured I saved about $75.  The Zizo case actually protects the corners of the iphone 7+, unlike the one I had for my 6+.  I dropped the gorilla glass and encased 6+ twice and broke the screen both times.  That's about $150 a pop to replace it and the screen protector.  The Zizo holster is a lot more secure, and there's no way I can drop it and hit the actual screen.  The Zizo is a great buy.
 Good and hard case . Really loved it.<br/>Although gets little brittle after may be 2 years use. But very great for 2 years of tough protection.<br/>Any plastic will tend to loose toughness after certain time. Great piece though.
 I've purchased several of these cases. My husband loves his grey case and has no problems with it. My son has the blue one, again, no problems. The two white cases I've purchased just didn't work. The first one simply didn't fit my 7 plus. The second one has major issues with the power button on the side. It's nearly impossible to press yet it manages to take random screenshots or attempts to shut down the phone without warning. I want to love this case as much as my husband and son love theirs, but I can't.
 The only thing I dislike about this case is that the screen is flush with the case edge. If dropped on an uneven surface I think it would crack the screen.
 This case feels very sturdy and it looks really good on my phone. The side buttons are all well protected but are still relatively easy to press compared to some cases. The screen protector come with everything you need to clean your device and keep it dust free when applying it. The kickstand is a little hard to open but it feels sturdy enough that it isn't going to break easily. It also snaps snugly back into place so you won't have to worry about it opening up accidentally from regular use. I'll buy again in a different color to change out every so often for a change of pace.
 I have had cases before that lasted longer than the phone. They were priced less than this. This only lasted 1 year and I think the material started falling apart mid year and finally a corner piece broke off. The screen protector lasted only couple of months as it kept sliding to a side and chipping from sides. Not sure if there is any warranty left as well. Will not buy again.
 The glass cover could be a little larger.  It does not cover the whole top of the phone.  The case is great!
 My teenager loves this case.. it’s cool enough for him to walk around with an it’s durable. I like that the hip clip goes on the front of the phone to add another layer of protection
 Hubby needed a case for his work phone. He works construction and it has survived some rugged abuse. All in all he says hes hapy with it.
 In a sea of boring cell phone cases this case really stands out. The tempered glass screen protector that comes with it is the icing on the cake. Can't get a much nicer looking case for the money.
 I love the way this case feels in my hands, it feels like a tight and secure fit. The case designs are awesome compared to other brands. You can tell these are just well built cases and it functions as advertised. I will continue to buy Zizo as long as they keep improving the look of the cases. Thanks Zizo
 nice case light and seems secure. Leaves the phone exposed on the top where speaker is and bottom where button is. But that is more of a design and not a flaw.<br/>I am still getting used to the grip as it is a little hard but I think over time it will break in a little. I was not able to use glass the armor as it did not fit the iPhone 7 plus correctly. the holes do not line up. But case is nice and solid.
 Rugged and fits but a simple design change would help a lot.  In order to open the phone and use it, the cover comes completely off.  If the clip was located at the center of the side instead of a few mm from the center, the cover could snap into place on the back of the phone.  As it is, the cover is very easy to lose.  I like the appearance and color, but would like it much better if that clip was in the right place.
 This is a pretty nice case very sturdy very durable. Very easy to use to place my phone inside. The kickstand was very easy to pull out, not like I heard from other reviewer’s that it was very difficult, and that it broke when attempting to use it. I believe a lot of that was user error. This is a great product !
 This is my second holster case ordered. I liked it because it was strong and made with good material. The first one by accident I broke the clip that is attached  to the case so I ordered another one and this second one the kickstand came already broken and material very thin. It’s almost three days since I got this email to write a review. I wrote an email to the seller but since it’s almost three days and I got no response I’m writing this review.
 This is the best case I’ve ever had since 1995. Although I don’t have the 7+ anymore I ordered one when I bought my iPhone X and I intend to keep using this brand
 Absolutely great product! Durable, well built and for $19 it's a deal and a half! You get the case a clip (which I'll never use) and a tempered glass screen protector. I really wanted the gray and black which was out of stock at the time but as soon as this one came in and seen the quality I ordered the gray and black which my fiancée is getting this white a gray one. Great product all around and you won't find one better for the price let alone one that's $30, $40, or even $50. A+++
 I was disappointed because I had this Zizo case on my last phone (iPhone 6), and knew immediately I wanted to replicate that case for the iPhone 8 Plus. However, the power button became totally inoperable when the hard shell was fit. Even with the rubber inside case it was difficult, but when fully together it was utterly non functional. The hard shell was even warped a bit, like it had suffered some stress fatigue or just molded incorrectly. It's a shame because it was originally a great product I liked.
 I’m happy with my iPhone case. The only reason I didn’t give it a five star rating because the stand  attached to the case is supports by pins to allow your phone to stand hands free cracked.
 This case is very durable and well made. It took a little time to get the phone in and aligned so the home button was aligned with the rubber piece. So far, I have clumsily dropped my phone 6 times, all from waist height or higher and the case has protected my phone beautifully and doesn't show any significant wear from the drops. It may add some bulk to the phone, but nothing like other cases out there. I also appreciate that, despite the added bulk, I still have full use of the screen, which has been a problem with some other cases out there.<br/><br/>Overall
 This is definitely not a case specifically made for the iPhone 8 plus. Just be aware if you are buying this for the 8 plus, it will fit, but it will not line up correctly with the apple logo in the back. Maybe not the biggest deal but it just does not look good.
 Well I tried 3 x  to install the case over my iPhone 8Splus and it fit like a glove.<br/>One problem I could not turn on the iPhone on button without lots of pressure and pushing.<br/>I have no idea what is wrong with the case. The top right button imprint on this case does not press properly<br/>on the phone on/off switch. Still trying to figure this out. Time to call Zizo Bolt Co for EMS assistance.
 Doesn’t work with magnetic phone holders.  I tried to notify customer service - the reply was “ it never was advertised to work with magnetic holder “. - I told them , maybe it should’ve been listed to say it will NOT work with magnetic holder, since so many people use them. Then after only 3-4 times trying to put phone in and out of case - it is already beginning to separate. I probably cannot return it either - because it came with glass protector I put on First - and now can’t return that. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CHEAP product.
 2 months after purchasing this case I am writing my review. Initially, it would have been a 5 star review. Functionality, and over appearance is perfect. Product quality gets a solid “F”. The clip on the holster that holds the phone on your belt snapped off, rendering it completely useless.<br/><br/>An iPhone 8+ is in my opinion, far too large to carry in your pocket and I really like the usefulness of a belt clip, so now I have to buy a brand new phone case. I will not be purchasing this product again.
 The case fits good and looks great. Love the looks. The glass screen protector moves around on the screen over time. I had to peal it back off and re-position it. Then after only about 6 months I noticed a big crack across the back along one of the black lines. I am not hard on my equipment. My last phone I had for 4 years and traded it back in and it was perfect looking on the outside and functioned great so I doubt this is based on me. Wouldn't buy again.
 It’s a great product for an iPhone 7+ but contrary to product description, doesn’t fit the 8+. The side buttons don’t work and the logo doesn’t line up with the hole.
 Case is okay, stand broke.  Clip is holding up and it does protect the phone from drops and falls.<br/><br/>The Apple logo is not centered in the back opening... ocd issues kicked in high gear on this...
 I would not get this case for IPhone 8 plies function buttons on the side don’t match.  If that was not enough of a stress the clip on holder broke less than 90 days.  I’m not talking the clip to belt I’m talking about the tabs that hold case in. The look and other functions good but the whole goal is to hold the phone while traveling and that is broken.
 We bought two  IPhones 8+ and searched for a great affordable case for them. We found it in Zizo’s package of case &amp; tempered glass cover  We bought two - his &amp; hers 2 different colors.  After watching installation video - it was easy to install tempered glass and pull case onto phones. They are really armored now at 1/4 the cost at the phone store.
 good &amp; sturdy!<br/><br/>looksgreat...will use it as soon as my phone arrives!!!
 This phone case is awesome!  Fits my IPhone 7+ perfectly.<br/><br/>It’s been about a month now and it’s been sturdy and gets the job done protecting the phone.<br/><br/>The protective glass and littl kickstand are icing on the cake.<br/><br/>I waited a month to write the review because you know...  some times you buy stuff on Amazon and it brakes a few days later.<br/><br/>So far,pretty good.
 So I’ve always had otter boxes on my phones and as these are great cases they normally will last me a year or so. I’m a bit hard on the cases but the minute I got this case I felt the difference everypart of it is extremely well built
 The style &amp; colors are great, although i was skeptical about the kickstand on the case itself. I purchased two, blk/red &amp; gun metal grey/blk. I had to send the grey/blk one back 'cause the kickstand was too loose, hardly staying in place ! the blk/red one stayed in tight. So i sent the grey/blk one back, ordered a new one same grey/blk color. When the new grey/blk one arrived it was only a bit better, but not a tight fit like the blk/red one. SMH
 Case looks great but had some fit issues, the volume down button didn’t fit right so had to do some modifications. Also I’ve had this case for about a month now and unfortunately both the hard plastic and rubber are starting to crack. Was really hoping this case was going to hold up better
 I purchased my cover about 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it! I used to be a big fan of the Otter Box but since I purchased it these covers I am a bigger fan because the product is lightweight and seems pretty durable. I haven't dropped my phone yet and hope not to! It's slim enough to still fit in my pocket and love that it comes with a lanyard. It seems to be exactly as described! I couldn't be more thrilled think I will purchase a couple more in different colors!!
 This is a great case!  I love it!  It fits my iPhone 7 plus perfectly and gives it the protection I was looking for.  I love the clip on the back for those times I want to watch something on my phone.
 Truly an awesome phone case....great style and strong protective construction. You can't miss with this one! I have another phone (Sony XA2 Ultra) and waiting for Zizo Bolt to produce a phone case for my second phone. AP
 I have an I Phone 8 PLUS no buttons work (volume up/down and power) and the funny thing is it keeps making 911 calls that thank GOD i could stop.But it is a really nice case and I have taken it in and out many times to try to get it to work with no luck!
 I love these cases I bought two for my samsung8 plus and my iphone 7 plus. They fit perfect they have been dropped with zero issues. My buttons still work great on both and the glass also fits and stays great! Love them both it was a great purchase!
 I bought this for an iPhone 8 Plus and while the case fit the phone fine, The buttons don’t work!!!! Once the phone is in the case, I can’t turn it off or change the volume because the side buttons just don’t connect with the actual buttons on the phone. Absolutely ridiculous purchase and total waste of money - stay away!!!!
 I love the iPhone Case because it fits perfectly, it is very strong and sturdy and looks sharp.  I am disappointed, however, that my holster or belt clip broke after just 40 days of use leaving a sharp plastic broken piece near the top where the phone slides into place.  I need the belt clip so I had to purchase a new case and clip.  I wish the holster/clip were better quality to match the case.
 I am Really happy with my purchase.<br/>Holster, Case and tempered glass for my iPhone 7 plus for a Great price and Great quality and feel to it. I wanted to replace my UAG case and I have bought otterbox speck and incipio and I Must say the quality of this case is equal too if not exceed my expectations.
 I had previously purchased this case for my iPhone 6 and was really happy with it!  So when I upgraded to iPhone 7 Plus I figured I would just get one of these and be just as happy.  Not even close...the power button does not depress with the cover on and of course I noticed this on other reviews after I ordered.  It's junk for this reason and I cannot even use the phone with this case on!!
 Opened package as soon as it arrived. What I noticed was the product seems flimsy! But I continued opening, temperered glass protector the corner is CRUSHED AND THERE IS NO DIRECTIONS!
 Very small and weak protection for the main screen on iphone 8 plus. Attractive design, but I am disappointed with the protection on the screen just by installing it. :(
 This phone is simply not what it claims to be. Looks cool and feel isn’t to bad. It dropped (not to hard either) from about 10 inches, onto the ground, and split the case.  As well as the screen to my IPhone which had to be replaced. So that’s my reason for rating your falsely advertised product so low.
 This phone case has been wonderful for my 11 year old son. He is very clumsy and drops his phone frequently and this case has held up really well.
 The case is great except for a piece of plastic sticking out on the side that I had to cut off and file down as it was sharp.
 Bought this as a gift and ended up buying two more the case is a great material and the clip is so convenient!! Definitely looking forward to getting mine soon too!
 I bought this as a present for my husband because he always breaks the phone or the screen. He loved it. Also I liked they include a screen protector with the cover and all the extras.
 Absolutely, hands down, top notch case for protecting your iPhone. I have this case for my phone as well as my wife's. This week I purchased one for her after she dropped her phone and cracked the protective screen. She did not listen when I suggested this product until she dropped her phone and spent an afternoon getting her screen replaced.
 I like that it is thin and has a strap.  For me, who drops his phone most of time, this is useful since i can use the strap.  I wrap my hand with the strap, when I am using the phone, so if I accidentally drop it, I can still save the fall.
 Looks nice, however, I feel the front of the case is too exposed and can easily break my screen. I went to Five Below and found a really good one that I feel would better protect my phone.
 Just received the Zizo Bolt iPhone 8 plus phone protection system...wow! Great design and thoughtful engineering went into this phone protector. Has some useful features that enhance it’s protective purpose. Don’t hesitate -  get yourself or your loved ones this phone protection system, you won’t be disappointed!
 This case is not only beautiful, but offers primo protection. I have a Note 8. Cracked the screen a week after buying new phone. Was informed that since the Note 8 is so new, that the screen can not be fixed or replaced. I applied the tempered glass that came with this case to my new phone and the cracks are BARELY visible. Love it!!!! Also the black snap case can be put on the front of the cell giving it double protection. Great job designing.
 If you doing mind your phone being bulky this is a great product. I drop my phone a lot and this had held up to that challenge. Bought a new case recently to change things up but immediately put this one back on.
 Nice sturdy cover for iPhone. Everything they advertised and I purchased. I am surprised that I dropped my phone twice and I am good. I would purchase this again if needed.
 Fantastic for price
 I really like this case. It’s durable and the design is awesome. I like the holster i can use it for the gym and taking the dogs for a walk not having to worry about it falling out of my pocket
 The plastic red cover fit the iPhone 5 plus perfect.  But when I placed the hard cover shell over the inner cover it was hard to get on.  And it prevented me from turning the phone on and off and the same with the volume buttons.  So I use the inner red only without the plastic hard cover.
 After dropping and shattering the screen saver and screen on my new phone (which was "protected" with a DIFFERENT product, I wanted something that could give me additional protection and still look nice and this case is perfect.  I particularly like the options it gives me for the snap on holster, embedded kickstand and detachable lanyard.  It arrived on time, was simple to install and feels good and balanced in my hand.
 Case fits tight and very protective.  I have dropped it a couple times and no damage to my phone.  the screen protector does a good job of protecting the screen.  I would definitely by from the seller again
 this case isn't designed as well as the griffin case, however it does run a close second.  there is no part of this case that protects the screen, they send you a separate screen applicator - that sux.  the belt clip doesn't clip onto the belt, it simply clamps down, that can be compromised.  they should examine the griffin belt clip.  I have to be a lot more careful using this case due to these flaws.  I do however like the built in kick stand.
 I love these cases and Ive had several in the past.  These are durable in any situation that no matter what your securely free of any damage the phone may be exposed. But This item is NOT for the Iphone 8Plus as advertised! the case fit ok but the color is lighter than what it appears in the picture and the back apple logo is not centered
 The case is nice and durable.  I have had it for about a month and dropped the phone multiple times without damaging anything.  The only negative I can think of is that the kickstand on the back is very hard to open without using a foreign object to pry it open. For as often as I use the kickstand, its not really an issue.  The screen protector went on nicely and has not cracked yet so I am not sure if it will actually prevent the glass from cracking or not.
 Well designed. I carry my phone in my shirt pocket at work. Until using the Zico, the phone would sometimes fall out to the ground. Because of the ribs on the case it grabs and holds in place. Plus the lanyard is extra protection. Doesn't interfere with control buttons.
 Doesn't fit a IPhone 7 Plus, it says it does but not well. Bought one from for my wife's IPhone 7 Plus off EBay it fits prefect,its has better cut outs and fits perfect and the same case just different color, beware if you buy this product.
 Before I ever got it completely out of the box the peg to the kick stand was broken off. I’m not the kind of person who really cares about that so I wasn’t worried about getting it replaced. However, overall it is a great case. Sturdy and came with a good screen protector. Saved me overall about $80. Great price and was at my door the day after I received my replacement phone in the mail.
 Durable case but I wish I would’ve ordered the blue. The green one has more black than green but it’s still very nice.
 I have found that this was a great value and is made with quality.  However the screen protector sent along with the unit was damaged during shipping and I was u able to use that part.
 I ordered a case for a 7 plus and received a case for a 7 S.  I did not teLize it until I threw away the old one and tried to it my phone in it and the case kept turning off my phone and did one ting calls.  I then looked at the box and it stated 7 s.  I have always used these cases and my grandson has the same case. Very pleased with the product but not this one.  I only reordered because I broke the one I had.
 I think the case is great. Protects the my iPhone completely when snapped in the holder. Not always easy to get to the phone when in the holder but it does what it supposed to do, protects the phone.
 Loved the look and construction of case.  The only problem is that the case i s too tight and held the power button down on the side.  Tried to contact company but no response, so item returned.  Real shame because it seemed like a good case minus the power button sticking down.
 This item did not fot the phone at all. It was so tight that it was causing the phone to randomly power off as the case was consistently pushing against thenpower button.
 For the price this is an excellent case, exactly what I was looking for and the kickstand is an added bonus, easy to put on my belt loop and is snug to my hip, doesn't stick out. I'm very happy with this purchase.
 I rate zero stars.  I had issue with case, contacted manufacturer on 12/1/18 for warantee claim and never heard back.  Ordering otter box because at least they stand behind their product.
 This fits an iPhone 8 Plus perfect. The Apple logo on back is lined up correctly and no issues with the buttons on either side. The bottom speakers and charger port is exposed but not a big deal.
 Received my case, looks really good. Tried placing the glass on the screen and there was a gap on either side that i could place a quarter on edge. Then to make matters worse, I dropped the belt clip on the floor and it broke in half
 It holds the lock button down. The screen protector doesn’t cover the entire screen. The back circle doesn’t show the apple logo. That’s not a big deal but does prove it is not designed for the 8 plus. It says 7plus on the box. I had heard a lot of people saying they are the same and it would fit but it does not. Just go to a brick and mortar store for a case if you have an 8plus they are to new to have specific cases on here currently.
 Just bought 2.  They are beautifully made, extremely sturdy, feel great in your hand, all operations of the iPhone not at all interfered with by the case.  Every detail even down to the packaging is first class.  I appreciate the design, the uniques color combinations.  Couldn't be happier -- I highly recommend.
 I prefer not to carry my phone in my pocket. However, holsters for phones are either the holster by itself or if a case is part of the package, it's quite bulky. The case by Zizo is a nice compromise. The tan outer grip prevents it from slipping my grip. The phone is easy to get into and out of the holster. The holsters itself is made of a non-slip material on the outward facing part, as well as the clip.
 This has certainly been a case to remember.  We will be buying more.  The case is still on the phone and has protected it very well to this day, a little dirty but the guy that uses it gets his hands dirty a lot.
 It a pretty good case ! It’s grippy and strong. Only thing is that the clip is to weak putting it on the belt it broke and also the clip to stand up the cell phone became a little lose on the second day.
 The product itself is fine. Unfortunately I had to return it. The discription I read said it would fit IPhone 7 but was not the case. I have had a few of these and they are great but they have to fit my phone. Sorry.
 After I cracked the corner of my phone screen I was nervous that I was about to lose hundreds having to either buy a new phone or fix my screen. I gave this phone case a chance and I am glad that I did because it protects my phone and the screen protector that it comes with is doing an amazing job at keeping my screen together.
 This case is a bit bulky, but it protects the iPhone 7 Plus front, back and sides very well.  If you are looking for a large case for complete protection, this is one you should consider, especially if you are an outdoors person.  This case is rugged and will stand up well to all conditions.
 Got the case quickly and in perfectly new condition.  I really like the design, especially the kickstand, which I didn't think I'd use. I use it to stabilize with my fingers for one-handed use. Haven't applied the screen protector yet.  The reason I only gave 3 stars is that the power button fits too tightly and it continually is either trying to power on/off or taking pictures of the lock screen/my leg/etc.  It actually recorded voice memos and sent out via FB Messenger to 6 of my friends/family while it was in my pocket...not a good thing. If it doesn't stop, I'll contact Zizo/Amazon for replacement/refund.
 The case is sturdy, attractive and has many features for the price. Drawbacks after 3 days: the side buttons for turning the phone on and off and volume adjustment are stiff and don’t work well. This may improve over time if the case loosens up some.
 This is a good product, almost like an insurance to insure the safety of your iPhone. We know how much we paid for the iPhone. It is relatively hefty a little bit more than otter but way cheaper. If you want thin and flimsy this is not for you. But if you are active and have a tendency to drop your phone this may be a good product for you.
 Love my new case! Fits Great in my hands. Didn’t need to buy<br/>Anything extra. Came with screen protector, stand, and holster.<br/>I feel very confident in the quality, Incase of a drop.<br/>Highly recommend!
 Very bulky and big to hold.  it was more of a tan color than the photos show and was just not a good fit for me
 It took a while to put this on my iPhone 8 Plus. It fits tight. All buttons work.  Love the lanyard. I’m using that. I drop mine a lot.  Put on glass screen an a  zagg one. Double protection no chances at 800$ lol.
 Hey guys, I love this product! However, I bought the last cover because the kickstand on my first Zizo had broken, I have had this Zizo little more than a week and the kickstand on THIS just broke also. I bought these specifically FOR the kickstand. The first one lasted about 2yrs, this one only a week and a half. I still love this product because I think it offers the best look with a very nice countersunk kickstand. Can you help? Thanks
 I hesitated getting this case due to the reviews of it working with the Iphone 8Plus but liked the color so took a chance. This case was designed for the IPhone 8Plus everything fits perfectly.<br/>I gave Material quality 4 stars because the piece inside the kickstand just seems brittle.<br/><br/>Had it  week and already dropped it, held up great<br/><br/>Very Pleased with this case
 The case looks like it is well built, but a few days after using it some if it broke. The case has a stand on the back that is plastic and while opening it to stand the phone up it simple fell out. Upon examining it closer the plastic had several cracks in it. The case has a nice grip to it and the holster is good and solid.
 Unfortunately I cannot give this case a good review.. in the description I was under assumption that it was built similar to the otter box defender just at a better price. Upon receiving the screen protector is film the case does not cover the charger port nothing is proctected I can only have the phone in the clip a certain way unlike the otter box. In summary as soon as I am able to order an otter box I like I will do so.<br/>  Thank you
 I’ve had this case for over a year now. I had held up great! Protected my phone against drops and bumps very well. With the color scheme it blends well into a military environment. The kickstand is at a good angle, but will only support your phone in landscape.
 When I purchased my new iPhone 8 Plus, I knew which case I was going to get because I knew it would protect it. My 4 year would play on my galaxy 7 edge.  He dropped it many times with no damages. The case fit perfect and I could trust it.<br/><br/>But i am disappointed with it on my iPhone 8. I can not used any of the side buttons. You can tell the inner case is still made for the iPhone 6 Plus.<br/><br/>I do feel it will still protect my phone. It is still made good but does not make all the buttons usable.
 I ordered the white case...It stain where I hold in my hand and ths stain will not come off...Never has a case to do that...I'm a very neat person, and the stain is driving me crazy...So that's $21.00 I have lost...
 The case is very functional, and fits the phone perfectly. My only complaint is that the phone case is left handed. It will not<br/>go into the holder without flipping the phone end for end because of the lanyard attachment....Lefty's will love it, but other than<br/>that, it is an exceptional case.
 The case itself is very nice but do not use the “extras” that come with it. The lanyard broke the first day and I would have been better off getting a screen protector from the dollar store. This one started sliding off of my phone before a week and when I put it back it was no longer sticky. The phone case itself is very good but these amenities are cheap and I would have been better off not using them.
 This case makes it easy to hold your iphone. Also comes with the holster that fits on your belt. Case has a fold-able stand that retracts into the case.
 The time we tried to us the clip on case it was broken. The hung for the clip just fell apart. We are extremely disappointed.
 Loved the fact that it can clip to whatever I am wearing;  not afraid of it falling and getting broken;  very durable and attractive case;  very pleased with the product
 Very happy with my purchase of this case. It fits my iPhone plus just great. I purchased the rose/gold color and it matches my iwatch and looks great. This was the perfect case for me for work. Also the protective glass cover that is included is great too. Great case for a great price!
 We had to cut the rubber buttons because it powered the phone off and one.<br/>I believe case is actually cut for the 7plus and not 8plus because the case was just too tight
 Pretty sturdy case and also good looking. Since is very new (had it 3 days), still remains to be seen how will it protect the phone in a hard floor surface and absorb impact. Will provide updated review in time and if the protection is 100% on falls and impacts i will give it a 5 star.<br/>Merchant's description matches well the product, delivery extremely fast and seller followed up. Very pleased with that.
 everything works great would be 5 stars, if it did break already. waiting to see what will happen, if they will replace the holster or not. I emailed the company to see what they are going to do.
 I love the case an the way it sits in your hand. Bad thing was the clip on the back of it was broken when I opened it up an not sure how to get in touch with the seller. Would be interested in buying a couple more if they could fix the problem. I have 3 other phones in the house an everyone loves my case. Hopefully somehow the seller can get ahold of me to fix the situation.
 I absolutely love my case! Super durable and not too bulky! Best case I’ve had. Only flaw is that it’s hard to get on and off, but that just means the phone is snug and secure in the case
 Heavy duty case without feeling heavy duty. Easy to hold. Still able to access buttons. Doesn’t cover up speaker.
 I received my third zizo case and it broke within days of putting into service. I gave a one star review in my disappointment. One of the owners reached out to me and made it right immediately. I’m very impressed with their customer service and now wish I would’ve called them before my review. Bottom line is they fixed it and I’m still carrying a zizo case. I’m a big fan of the kickstand case and really like the zizo style. Thank you zizo for making it right!
 Clip doesnt hold the phone and is extremely loose.  Also the kickstand requires the use of a small screw driver or knife to snap it open.  Cheap stuff...you can also see cut out marks from the assembly line.  Chinese basement made, not high quality like described on website.
 Some reviews said the phone was difficult to unholster but I found that after becoming familiar with the design and with practice it was easily mastered.  The size of the 7 Plus makes it a little more awkward than a regular sized phone but that is no fault of the case.
 While this is an impressive looking rig and is well suited to my usage type (I really need the easel) the tab that is intended to give leverage to release the phone from the holder broke off within the first hour of use. It is flimsy in that area are could not withstand the pressure needed to release the phone. Otherwise, it does the job well and is very reasonably priced.
 The belt clip broke before I could even use it on my belt.  There doesn't seem to be an option for returning just that item.  I hate returning things, and I actually like the case itself, so I won't be returning it.  It is irritating that I can't get the belt clip replaced, however.
 Item on Amazon says iPhone 8+,7+,6+  but packaging doesn't mention 8+ and it doesn't fit.  Have to return.
 the clip that holds phone in the cradle broke lasted about 3 mo.  seller wont respond  I bought an Otterbox which i should have in first place
 I bought the blue case for my upcoming iphone 7. I liked it. Its a good quality case for the iphone. If there's one negative thing I'll say (and its not that negative) is that the blue is more of an indigo color. I was hoping for a royal blue but I still like it. In fact I'm going to buy the orange case too.
 Good protection but black clip case bleeds onto the red case.  See attached picture- photo doesn't really show this very well. And case feels too bulky.
 I have had this case on my phone for a year and a half and have dropped my phone many times with no damage to the device. This case is very durable and I am now ordering this one for a friend. The only setback to this case is the kickstand tends to break after a few months if you aren't careful taking it out but for the price/value of this case it's the best I've come across
 Right out of the box the case was useless if you wanted to use it with the stand because it snapped right away first time. The screen protector cracked within a day and didn’t drop it not sure why it broke?
 These are my favorite phone case ever.  Buy them for all our phones. Feels great in the hand, plus, is a great protector of the phone. The clip is perfect for waist band or purse/bag.  Never have been disappointed with ZiZo.
 So far so good. I like the color and texture of the case and the kick stand. Only thing is it's built for an iPhone that has a headphone jack on the bottom left, which the 7 does not have.
 Received this product just two days ago. I had been using the OtterBox defender prior, so when I changed out the cases I immediately noticed the obvious difference in size. The Zizo is more streamlined and easier to grip in one hand. I was also a bit apprehensive about the protection provided by a much smaller case. Well in a short two days I have managed to drop this thing a half
 I got this case for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! It’s made VERY VERY well! He is a welder and needs a case that will protect his phone in the shop! I highly recommend!
 It does keep my phone safe from falls but it gets brittle after a while and the screen protector cracked on me a couple of times. I wish it could be made more durable . I already bought 3 for my phone in a span of 1 year. It does protect my phone but it breaks after a few months:
 When I installed this case, the rubber frame created enough pressure on the power off button at the right to constantly switch off my iPhone 7.  I had to relieve some of this pressure by cutting a hole around the button.  The tempered glass screen protector can be unforgiving if you install it off center.  I tried to reinstall it and ended up with bubbles and dead spots.
 Love the case.  I have 4 now and definitely will use them for as long as I have this phone.  The belt clips are not my favorite.  I break them as fast as I get them. With the clips were as awesome as the cases
 Plastic broke, screen broke and screen protector broke on the first drop. Junk. Bought this instead of an Otter Box for my husband. I should have spent the extra $10. Back stand broke off as soon as it was out of the box, the pins were made of cheap plastic. Seems this item used to be a good one, but the company opted for a cheaper make.
 In had an Otterbix Defender before this and was looking for something smaller. But I regret doing it. The case is alright, but the kickstand does not stay out and keep popping out on the corner. But my biggest problem is the holster. No matter the direction I place it in the case it rattled around and I would not trust it to hold my phone and the lock to keep it clip open has already broken off after only a few uses in a couple of weeks.  It worth the money.
 To put it in simple terms. I love ZIZO CASES! This is my third Zizo case and my second for my iPhone 7. You can’t beat the quality and the choice of colors, and that genius idea of THE KICKSTAND which I use daily!
 I love the look, feel, and protection of this cover but the right side on/off button on my iPhone 8 does not work with this cover no matter how hard I press. I had to turn on AssistiveTouch to enable screen shots
 This is truly a great case. Very well manufactured. Bonus that I didn’t see specified is wireless charging works. I didn’t think it would cuz of the non flat back design.
 Awesome case. By far a great case for the price. Its rugged and perfect for a firefighter like myself. One thing I will say it that the case is a little tight on the power button and continued to cut the phone off. I simply took a sharp knife and trimmed the inside of the power button on the rubber case and it now works like it should. Thanks Zizo
 I ordered this for my new IPhone 8 plus, Im absolutely in love with it, my husband loved it so much that I ordered him one for his IPhone 8. Very heavy duty &amp; stylish.
 It’s a nice sturdy case if you are looking for a bulky one and you don’t mind the texture all around.  Personally I like the standing insert it comes with already in the case.  I didn’t like that it’s almost like 2 in one and the volume buttons weren’t perfect as too I couldn’t hire or lower due to the rubber bending around them. But other than that it does the job of keeping the phone safe and secure.
 Husband loves it.  rugged, durable material.  Looks good, too.  And for the price, you can"t go wrong.
 The screen protective glass that comes with the case  is a bit to small around the edges. Witch allows lint, dust etc to collect. Witch mean you must remove it wipe the the edges and reinstall the protective film of glass exactly centered.  Kinda annoying.  The outer case is fine though.  Good luck.
 Had the case before in a different color and it lasted over a year. Pieces of this one have broken off pretty quickly...
 I really like this phone case. Bought two, one for the Samsung 8 plus and IPhone 7 plus. Great price for the sturdiness and protection. The belt clip you can detach and use the case without it. It has a kickstand that I like. The screen protector works. I drop my phone hard and it was protected. Nice style with variety of colors. I like the desert tan/green. Only wish it came with two screen protectors or a way to buy this one. Great phone case without spending more money than the phone cost. Would buy again, highly recommend
 This case is perfect for my use.  The best part is that I can still use my charger that you just lay the phone on the circle and it charges without having to plug anything in.  Some cases do not allow that but this one does and it protects my phone.
 Overall the case is ok. The belt clip however lasted two weeks. I requested a return of send me a new clip and it was denied. I preordered my case so I’d have it when I got a phone so 30 days had gone by. Vendors reply was standard. I guess if yo don’t use a belt clip this case may die for you. I’ve always bought Otterbox but the price is getting out of hand so I looked for an alternative, never broke an one of thier belt clips. I’ll guess you get what you pay for.
 I did not like this item at all. First it was broken from the sound control place and yesterday the leg which we use to hold phone watching position was broken. This item did not prove it’s durability. I hope future people consider it. FYI, it is only 2 months old !!!
 I am so disappointed of the product. I bought two case, one for my son, and the second case when I opened the holder in the back broke insteadly. The material is plastic, I thought it will be a better material.
 This is not an iPhone 7 plus case. The case has a cut out on the bottom shaped for a headset jack which the phone doesn't have. The included screen protector does not support 3D Touch (which even the 6S has).<br/><br/>I suspect this was made for the iPhone 6 and has just been rebranded.
 I can't speak as to durability since I've only had it a few days, but the materials are lightweight and sturdy, so I anticipate it will last a while.  Beyond that, it seems a good value for the money.
 Love the product and wish it would work with my iPhone 8 Plus. However I have tried and it will not allow me to operate the volume or sleep buttons
 I am not digging the lanyard loop on the phone case. It hinders me from putting the phone into the belt clip with out turning it upside down on my right side. I use this phone for work and pull it out of the belt clip often and have to turn it right side up to see the screen. I was wondering if I sanded it off would it void any warranty in anyway?
 I love the kickstand and the accessories that came with the case!! However I’ve only had this case for 1 month and my clip will stop holding soon due to the hard plastic cover crackin very badly and the holes that hold the clip breaking off😢
 I discovered Zizo brand iPhone cases a few years ago. These are heavy duty cases that now come with tempered glass screen protectors. Such an awesome deal. These also come with a lanyard which I love. This is another reason why I chose this type each time. Also LOVE that Zizo is a family owned company.<br/>Happy customer once again. Thank you Zizo. 😁😁
 Got this a week ago. Today a piece of folding thing on back broke off. Now can’t really use the stand..  this is 2nd product. I have another one I ordered couple years ago I think works for my iPhone 8plus. Will try it back on but 1st one is fine. This one maybe bad one? Oh well
 I bought this for my husband as he prefers a slimmer case for his phone. At first appearance it looks great. It has a sleek look and holds well in the clip. He is constantly up and down ladders so this was important. Great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking in the future.
 Awesome phone case! I bought my first one a few years ago for my IPhone 6, then for the IPhone 7 and now the IPhone X. I travel a lot and they always protected all my phones very well. In fact none of the Zizo cases have broken down yet. Lastly, consider the price and compare it to other high end named cases, which I also had (Otter, Ballistic) and you’ll never go wrong. I highly recommend this product!
 I was a little hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews, however I’m glad I did. The blue looks awesome, the sides are just enough grip to keep your phone in your hand, but not so much that it gets stuck in your pocket.
 After my iPhone 7's screen got totally smashed when it fell off my belt I figured I needed a more secure case and belt holder. This is a very rugged case and the belt holder won't split off. The holder very securely locks the phone in place.
 I bought this product before and it was awesome. This time however it broke in a week. Tried to write company but no response from amazon or the company.
 These are great products except the case covers up the little tagel  button that lets one turn off the ringer.  Not helpful.  Where do I send them back???? David Blahnik
 Not so impressed with this case. The stand in the back doesn’t always lay flat and rattles a lot. Doesn’t feel like it can handle a fall so well. And have to put on a glass cover over my screen which I hate due to pain getting it off when it shatters after the first fall. Will b purchasing a different kind
 Bought for iPhone 8 Plus. Would not recommend at all cheaply made. It’s a pain in the ass to even get on the phone. Plus the volume Buttons won’t move at all and are stationary and hold the volume down button in so the screen off and on button doesn’t work while the case is on it. It’s not even for the iPhone 8plus. As the sticker says on the package. The apple logo on the back doesn’t even line up in the area left open for it.
 Outstanding Case great colors. As a US Marine I like the rugged man look and the strength of the case. I now own 4 different colors. ZIZO OOrah.
 Case wasn’t even on for a month and it cracked by the side button, from using the button. Looked really nice, just didn’t last. Don’t waste your money.
 Case fits my IPhone 7 great, does not constantly press the power button as I read in other reviews. Volume keys also work great while in the case. Does have a headphone jack cutaway for previous model phones, but can't think of why that's such a problem for some folks, it makes good business sense for them to do it that way. The screen protector that came with the case seems like it's good quality, came with a cloth and wet wipe to clean the screen before installation which is nice.  ***update purchased again for iPhone 8, received 09/20/2018, case still fits great!***
 I love the feel and the side protection. The bezel level is even with ethe screen. I’d like a little more protection on that however, the screen protector will work.
 I love my case. Oddly enough, my room mate dropped my phone as SOON as the case was on it. I was mad, and the case scratched a little, but no damage to my iphone 8 plus.
 Phone case isn't bad. It's pretty cool looking and has that rugged look I was looking for. Only down fall is that it's pretty snug on my phone. Every time I go to turn it on with the side button it takes a snapshot.
 The description says IPhone 8 Plus Case and received a IPhone 7 and 6 plus,  and used because the bag of the screen protection cloth was opened.
 I love the case. It handles very well. The only issue I'm having with the function is that the kick stand is very difficult to get out. The other thing that sort of bothers me is that the window for the Apple Icon is not centered, and the apple is partially hidden at the bottom.<br/>other than that, I like it.
 Cool design, strong against impacts around the house and in the field (construction), definitely worth the money and it is comforting to support something that I will one day have intercourse with. This phone case? It’s got a nice ass. What a great ass. 2/5.
 The case did not fit the beat on the iphone and was very difficult to fit. Then the volume button cover kept turning down the volume without me touching it. Lastly, the screen protector that vame with it was cracked when the case arrived...truly disappointed. That said, this is why i usually dont purchase cheap cases.
 Don't bother with this case. The outer plastic was warped on both sides. When I notified the seller all the did was ask me to please change my review. They didnt offer to replace it. That says a lot about a company. Maybe i just got a bad case but doesn't any body check quality control. And the belt clip is flimsy cheap plastic
 The iPhone 7 is water resistant, so this case is perfect for this phone. I like the style of it, the stand that's part of it, and the protection it brings to my new phone. I've seen a couple posts or videos about getting this until Otter or Lifeproof come out for the 7. The price is right to buy more than one case, but there is no need! I bought two colors of Zizo Bolt Covers. I'm very pleased with the fit and finish.
 This case is awful. The belt clip broke within 24 hours of receiving the case. Within 2 weeks the screen protector started to come off. I wish it had a cover for port. It is getting dirt inside of it. The back kick stand is hard to open too. I should have just went with the Otter box case! Those have always worked out for me. I guess you get what you pay for.
 I like the look and feel of this but the holster is not durable. I even ordered a second one and two weeks later the holster broke. I am looking for another brand but there is 30.00+ down the drain.
 I liked it, I also liked the fact one could use it with the stand to watch movies.<br/>Wish they all came with a stand like this product.
 I need to return the product because it is the wrong size
 I love that this case looks cool but I dislike how kickstand brakes with in three days of having it all in all it’s a good case not a great case and I thought I would share thanks
 I bought this for my teenage son. It looks even better in person than in the pictures. Best of all, it's durable. It is very well made, and protects the phone as intended. (Some of the covers we have bought in the past did not protect the phone.) Would but again.
 When my fancy overpriced case from my service provider broke AGAIN, I bought this one. Durable and useful.
 Love my Zizo case!!  When I upgraded my phone the first thing I went for was a Zizo that fit my new phone because the old phone took a licking in my Zizo!  I love the color combo on this one!!
 I wish it offered a little more protection for the front of the phone but is a good phone case lasted about 4 months then orange shell broke
 Looks like a nice product, but does NOT fit iPhone 8 Plus as product description says. If buying for 6 or 7 Plus, enjoy! Otherwise, don’t bother.
 The case is sturdy enough for drop protection and the included screen protector was a bonus. This is the first case I’ve owned with a kickstand, was looking forward to using it. Unfortunately I discovered that mine was broken right out of the box. It seems to be the lowest quality thing about this case. Other than that, this product performs as advertised.
 The case itself is very nice. It allows for a good grip but the belt clip broke within a few days. The clip is made out of very thin plastic and broke in half with just normal daily activity. The screen cover does not affect how the phone functions as well. Overall 3 of 5 stars because of the belt clip breaking. I got this case because it came with a clip but now i will need to look else where for a case with clip and use this case as a backup.
 Probably the BEST case for a valuable instrument!  Very rugged works as expected!  I need another one, I accidentally bashed the clip off my first one!
 There were no directions for installation, only a website. When I went to the website, the only video that wouldn't open was the one I needed for installation. When I did it without instructions, the case cracked. Then, I had a really hard time getting the buttons to work with the case on.<br/>Very unhappy with purchase.
 This phone case looks and feels solid, smooth, durable and so luxurious! The color (rose gold) is very cute and just the right amount of pink (not too much).
 The case looks great and is durable. I'm a NYC union plumber and I got the case with my job in mind for possible damage my phone would take on the job. I have the iphone 7 plus and the only thing I didn't like about the case is that I needed to cut the case in order for it to work with my phone. For some reason when the case was on the power button would constantly get held down no matter how many different ways I put the case on and made sure it was on the right way. So I had to cut the power button slot out for my phone to work properly.
 I like the slim fit, bright color of this protective case makes it very easy to locate my smartphone given the fact that I am guilty of forgetting where I leave it. Great price for great protection!!!.  Finally last but certainly not least, I dropped my phone from 25 feet to the concrete floor at my job and it survived with only two small chips to the screen protector.
 I bought this for my grandson and he loves the color and how strong it felt on his phone the only thing he did not like was the cover that goes on the screen pops off very easily but like he said he would only use it when in his back pack going to school
 This is my second purchase of the same product. While I love the case itself and feel it is extremely durable, the holster clip broke again after only one day of use... The same thing happened on my last purchase. I will buy again because, as I stated, I do love the case, but I’m not expecting much from the holster/belt clip anymore.
 Excellent case, never have to worry about dropping the phone.  Received my order within days after I ordered it.
 Today my screen shattered from waist height when it hit a tile floor.  I have emailed Zizo to see if they truly have a 1 year manufacturer warranty for their screen protectors and cases.  When I peeled the shattered screen protector off it also pulled pieces of the actual glass screen out with it... I'm looking at a few hundred dollars in repairs because this product did not live up to their promises - both in replacing the screen and potentially the LCD since there is now some color distortion.<br/><br/>I will update the post as I hear back from Zizo and/or Amazon.
 I haven’t had this very long but I like it. I like the textured gripping area. I felt like it was a little bit difficult to get the phone into the case. And the belt clip seems pretty secure.
 Absolutely terrible since they sent me the wrong one first and now that I finally have the “correct” phone case it doesn’t fit. Constantly holds in the power button and it almost broke my phone when I tried to get it out!
 I would not recommend this bundled deal. Within 2 weeks of putting case and screen protector, my brand new iphone8 has a shattered screen. I was using my phone 2 weeks with a different case that I’ve had for over 2 years that finally gave out so I ordered this one. I regret it. Never had an issue before, never shattered a screen on any of my previous phones. This sucks. Pictures included two with the screen protector, one without
 I was really hoping that the case would be a bit more durable.  Unfortunately after a few weeks the front corner broke.<br/><br/>I actually still use it and really like it but it really didn’t last as long as I would have hoped.
 Just received today and the comfort of the case is great. Whether it’s military grade protective, we will soon find out. Usually the cases aren’t the problem with me it’s the tough work I go through daily and the belt clip is the first thing to break. I got this product for that purpose and I hope it survives longer than two weeks. That seems to be my time frame for belt clips before it breaks.
 For the money this case ok<br/>Pros: solid protection<br/>Diffrent looking<br/>Came with glass screen protector<br/><br/>Cons: kickstand is useless<br/>Back is really weird<br/>The lanyard thing is a joke and gets in the way<br/>This case is a pain to remove
 I really like this product it has saved my phone countless times. For the money you can’t get better protection.
 Pleased with the case.  Much more protection than the original case ordered.  Coming with a screen protector was a bonus so I didn't have to order separately!
 Have used since received. Haven’t had any issues. Didn’t like the eye/loop at top of case. I cut this off
 the protection lens that goes on the front of my phone did not last just a few day very thin lens the belt clip broke after a few days
 I am a local janitor and I have dealt with many different cases. In particular, I prefer my phones to have a strong holster. The problem nowaday is that the holster are so weak that they break easily. There are multiple times during the day when I get asked to clean up and I need to have my phone on my all of the time. The reason I love this case is because of the holster because I do not have to worry about it breaking. I know it keeps my phone protected by I know my phone is on me all the time. The holster is strong and will not break like the other holsters. I recommended this product to anyone who needs to have a strong holster and a strong case
 No Bueno. Was for IPhone 6 not the IPhoine 7. So Dissapointed with screen covers as well did not match up it standards.
 Case seems well built but can not access the power/lock  button. The case will not allow it to be pressed other buttons work just fine.
 Awesome case! Easy to slip on, seems very durable and has many options for carrying it including around your neck, using a clip or maybe even a carabiner. Very easy to use buttons too. I drop my phone too much so I feel a lot safer with it using this case. Thanks!!
 On off button doesn’t work with case . The volume doesn’t work either with case. I find I have to take phone out of case
 For the price and design it is excellent.  Kick stand in back and holster are a bonus.  Almost on par with an Otterbox, at 1/3 of the cost!
 I really have not put this case through much ..... the back thing to hold phone up broke within a month .....  got crack around volume buttons that just appears out of no where ....  not impressed otterbox here I come
 Not worth it unfortunately, the tempered glass is already broke from one drop. It fell on laminate flooring, and the case itself has a couple cracks already. Had only had for 2 weeks. I also take decent care of my stuff to. Wouldn’t buy it again
 Kickstand on actual case is fragile. Phone dropped one time, from approximately 3 feet and kickstand broke off. Case itself seems sturdy and holds up. Using the belt clip stand is a little difficult. Turning the clip is a bit difficult. Overall I know this sounds like a bad review but case is ok.
 Pretty solid case for my big iPhone. I like the 'finger grooves' that help you hang onto your phone.<br/>Before I got this case I was nervous about dropping my phone because it was so smooth.
 Pretty color, arrived on time, also has a neat loop on top for keychain lanyard etc. Two stars because the power/sleep button cover is messed up. It can not be depressed directly but is super sensitive if it is touched on the side so every time you grip the phone it flips out. When I tried to turn the phone off it kept the button depressed and the white apple screen just blinked until I removed the case.
 Fits nice, the tempered glass however does not stick even when following instructions and cleaning screen. It peels right up. Other than that... I like it!
 Very good case. The cover goes on opposite way that Otterbox does. Didn’t quite like the hook for strap; but love everything else
 Support is second to none and the product seems to work well. We will see how the spring and summer farming and harvest season treats it but so far so good.
 i have tried this on 2 different iPhone 8 Plus’s. When the case is on I can’t press the volume + or -  and the power button. I tried putting in on multiple times. First the red then the black, both at the same time.. nothing works.
 Poor design and weak case, Day 1 installed phone 9pm Friday.- Sat AM kickstand broke- a primary feature and selling point. Day 28 - hard case broke near the volume button. Case is cheap, poor design, support leg- two small plastic arms, case slim at pressure points. Buyer beware.
 The case looks fantastic...not sure about the durability yet, especially since the screen 'protector' was already broken when I removed it from the package. Not a deal breaker, but I've seen numerous other reviews with the same issue...
 The product is so durable I feel it can bounce from a three-story fall.
 Seems like a nice case at first but the lanyard connection is on the wrong end of the case. When its hanging around your neck one should be able to pick up the phone and start using it with out having to spin the phone around which tightens the lanyard. The apple logo is off center another design law. The belt clip is really not usable breaks easily.
 Sorry Otterbox! For seventeen bucks with a glass screen protector this is all the case I need!
 I love how rugged but slim this case is. The screen cover is excellent. The option to care with a clip is nice, though it is not something I use. The flip out stand is great when you want to watch a video. This cover did nothing but enhance my i Phone. Would highly recommend.
 I opened the product and tried to move the belt clip and it snapped and broke. I will not use this product at all. If I could rate this lower than 1 star I wouldn’t even give is a .1!! I am very disappointed in this product!!!
 I love this phone cases so much all my family has one now , I have to say the materials used  are so strong and durable and soft to feel . I thank you sincerely for such an amazing phone case 3/20/18
 I primarily purchase MIL-Spec cases similar to this one for my phones. I think the ones from Zizo are priced more than fairly, especially considering that they include a tempered glass screen protector. I have the gold version for the iPhone 7 Plus, but there are quite a few other color schemes available. The cases remind me of a cross between Otterbox’s and UAG’s cases. They are definitely less expensive. The utility loop on the top left corner doesn't really add that much bulk in case you want to slip your phone into your pocket. Make no mistake though — the Blade is not a slim case, especially for the Plus. Speaking of plus, this case will fit the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus too, and the case area where the 7's now absent audio port was located is not covered.<br/><br/>An iPhone pops securely into place in the case, and it the snug fit means it takes a bit of work to get the phone back out again. In turn, the case attaches easily to the rugged, clipped belt-holder. It’s easy to snap the phone in and out of it one handed once you get the hang of it. A lanyard/keychain is included if you want to use it. The case materials are two sandwiched layers, but mainly a rubberized plastic that offers excellent grip and allows all of the ports to be perfectly accessible. That includes the camera opening and framed Apple logo porthole on the rear of the main case. All-in-all it feels quite sturdy, but I won’t be doing any drop testing it at this time if it can be helped.<br/><br/>The buttons are decent but don't quite have the refined feel and action of some more expensive cases from other manufacturers. The covered power and volume buttons don’t really feel like they move but they do activate when pressed. The little kickstand that pops out on the back to prop up the phone horizontally is probably my favorite feature, but on slick surfaces it is prone to sliding, so isn’t very useful if using touchscreen features. I’m afraid it will snap off after a short time, but so far so good. It did stick a bit when I first attempted to open it and I was afraid that I’d snap the hing. The stand is useful for watching video and other applications were you don't need to be touching the screen constantly.<br/><br/>The tempered glass screen protector arrived undamaged and is nice and thick without sacrificing screen clarity or touch sensitivity. Between the protector and the case, I feel that the phone is very well protected, especially when full enclosed in the belt holster. The Bolt may not be quite as refined as some cases I've used in the past, but it is still very well made, well designed, and gets the job done if you're being thrifty and want the extra features offered by Zizo. This is not an ultra-slim case by any means, but I’v had no real issues sliding it in and out of large front pockets. Hip carry is what the belt clip is for and is the best choice aside from using the lanyard if you have a belt or sturdy waistband.<br/><br/>The seller provided me a complimentary sample for evaluation purposes and to provide an objective review. The opinions related here are from my own experiences with the case.<br/><br/>~ Kort
 I waited 2 months two write this, I thought braking it in you would be able to use the buttons on the side of the phone. It never happened! Liked the cases though.
 tough as it said it was, it has gone through many falls and protected my new phone. Kick stand in back VERY difficult to pull out. Color easy to find. Comes with clip and lanyard.
 This is the best phone case I've ever owned. Have 2 of them so far. Highly recommend this product.
 The case seems pretty durable. Tough to get on the phone but once it's on it fits nice. Makes the power button super sensitive. And if you wear your holder on your right side the case will only snap in place with the top of the phone facing backwards. Other than that good case so far. I bought 2. Blue and black and green and black so I could switch and put the blue and green together. Looks awesome.
 Purchased zizo bolt cover and I am very happy with the product and quick shipment of the case as described.
 Great tactic-cool case that is light weight but durable. The stand works ok. Could use a little better grip material but still grippier than most.
 easy install, good "feel" and grasp for handling a VERY slim/slick phone. ONLY thing I don't like is the lanyard attachment on the case. The positioning of the attachment port forces me to holster the phone upside down &amp; backwards. This is a business phone and answering takes just a little longer now when retrieving the phone from my belt holster... unhook, grasp, rotate 180 degrees and then answer.  I will most likely attack the case with my Dremel Moto tool this weekend and eradicate the lanyard hook so i can carry the phone correctly.
 I’ve been using the Zizo  phone cases for several years now on my first one the clip that holds the phone and place snapped and I would like to know if they would send me a new one at no cost and I also have purchased two more since then I do like the cases and I really don’t think that should’ve broken anyway I would like to have somebody get back to me on this and my name is John Campagna and my phone # 9084160788. Thank you
 After 2 months of use the plastic around the volume buttons completely broke as well as all the plastic that holds the stand to the phone. I was excited to try this case with all the great reviews but come to find out this is not as quality of a product that I was hoping for.
 This is the second case like this I have bought. I’ve tried many different more expensive cases and my other one lasted and was still in good condition after 1 1/2yrs when I bought a new phone. I like that it comes with a glass screen protector and enjoy the kickstand built into the case. They did correct the problem from my first cast with the plastic belt clip on holder making you able to put the screen in or out and will probably use it now.
 Love the case very durable and fits my phone perfect! When you have a problem they are great at making it right! I will buy from them always!
 This product sucks it should have a 12 foot drop distance and the case and the back of the phone cracked. After we just had is fixed. This case is not what is says it is.
 A little slippery which is good going into my pocket, but not so good in my hand.  The lanyard slot on the top is not usable for me.  Like the color! For the price it is a good deal.
 The cover is great, but the part of the cover that is over the buttons is horrible.  You can squeeze the phone till you hear it cracking, and it still won't allow you to utilize the buttons.  Very disheartening when you expect better.
 This case Feels tougher than the cases I’ve had before it. I normally stick to a phone case the life of the phone so I’m giving this case a try and so far I’m impressed. It feels like it’s well built and the stand on the back is flexible so it doesn’t break easy and overall easy to install the case and screen protector. I haven’t used the clipon belt holder but I’ll try it out and give an update.
 I’m very disappointed that my holster just broke after only having it for a month.  The phone case is fine but the holster sucks. I use it for work because I can’t put my phone in my pocket.  I don’t know what I’m going to do.
 El case está muy bonito pero el clip y el stand solo me duró dos dias y se rompió, en una semana de uso las esquinas se estrellaron.
 Not made for iPhone 7 Plus. Other reviews say as such, but it looked like there were some that said it was updated for the new iPhone 7 Plus. That was not the case with the one I got, so the lock button did not work and there is still a cutout for the headphone jack. Case also had a cheap plastic feel, but the not fitting was the reason to return the case.
 If you're reading this, just pick out the color you want and add it to your cart and proceed to check out! No need to read any more lengthy reviews. This case is everything you're looking for at a great price. I'm so pleased and you will be too!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/iPhone-8-Plus-Case-iPhone-7-Plus-Case-Zizo-Bolt-Series-w-iPhone-8-Plus-Screen-Protector-Kickstand-Military-Grade-Drop-Tested-Holster-Clip/dp/B01KX0KBCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iPhone 8 Plus Case / iPhone 7 Plus Case - Zizo  Bolt Series] w/ iPhone 8 Plus Screen Protector ] Kickstand  Military Grade Drop Tested] Holster Clip</a>
 poor quality
 *DESIGN FLAW* The power button on the case is too big on the inside. It holds constant pressure on the power button, turning the phone off, or making screenshots when you press the home button. I fixed this by melting off the back side of the power button with a soldering pen. That said, once I modified that button flaw, I LOVE the case. The phone fits snug, and the case's slim profile makes it very attractive. If the power button was designed properly, I would have given this case 5 stars.
 Unfortunately my stand broke within a couple days. Returning it - ordered second one. I got an email from their customer service rep and let him know of my problem. He excepted my return and asked me what he could do. I asked him to put the stand on for me - that was my only complaint. Got my replacement in just a few days with the stand put together for me.
 I was nervous about what I would receive as I hadn't read the reviews until after I ordered, but it was exactly what was advertised, fit perfectly and hasn't given me any problems with the power button as stated in previous reviews. I'm so glad I ordered and would order again!
 My phone was knocked off from counter.  The glass screen did not break.
 The case looks great and protects the phone, but the design is such that the on/off switch on the phone doesn’t function properly. We had to buy another case because this one made the phone unusable.
 Overall amazing for the price. Had to look up online how to install. No instructions were included. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star.
 Hey Rocky? cool case! The lanyard was a bit flimsy and failed unfortunately and it was lost, I'm only left with the tether. How can I get that replaced?<br/>The ability to flip the phone over in the case is lacking...you can only lock it in face down.<br/>The holster and the kickstand will only let you use the display in landscape mode vs portrait...also if the case was a bit more "grippy" or less slick so it doesn't slide around on my console or other surfaces would also be outstanding.<br/>Thanks Rocky!!
 It arrived way quicker than I thought it would and just received my iPhone 7 Plus today but the case fits perfectly, tightly and solid.  So far so good and it looks amazing for sure too.  I'd recommend these to anyone looking for something other than a plain old run-of-the-mill case that's also tough, durable and stylish.
 Congratulations Rocky I really like the product. Very sports looking and great color selection. The lanyard could a bit wider. I've been trying to purchase your product since November.  I missed out on Christmas sales. I will be buying more. Thank you for reaching out.
 The case racked after being dropped once. But it did protect my phone. Works pretty good for the price. As pictured.
 The case does indeed press constantly on the off button. I had to go in with a Dremel tool and remove a layer of plastic to relieve the pressure on the button. Otherwise a decent case, but the manufacturing mold was off and it will need to be trimmed
 It fits my phone well and so far, no problems with button usage. I like the color and the little kickstand
 The built-in kick stand does not stay 'built-in'!  It keeps falling open then fell off enough times that it no longer stays put.
 Clip broke in 5 weeks, conveniently 6 days after the return date.
 Love the ability to use the side clip for phone attachment. Doesn’t detach so far
 I love this case. It is slim and durable case fits nicely in my hand as well as in my pocket. I feel confident about its protection.
 Finally, after several purchases of phone cases, this case meets all of my expectations. Great product, easy install, and properly protects my phone. Now I’m thinking of buying again in different colors.
 Broke after a week.
 Love my case, it comes with a glass screen protector and so far, so great! It is not large and bulky as it looks. In fact I was worried that it would not protect my new iPhone 7.  Case is durable and soft and I get a lot of compliments on it.  I have dropped and no breakage yet!!
 Arrived damaged but the seller resolved really fast the problem! Good quality and comfortable!
 Once I received this case, I was excited to put my phone in it. I was very pleased with the size and feel of the case. Once I installed the phone, I noticed the side buttons was very stiff and had too snugg of a fit. It was so snugg that the phones volume buttons even when untouched, were being pressed by the case. The left side button also was being pushed so thT every time the home button was touched it made a screen shot. There was no remedy for this and so the case is completely useless.
 I’m not to impressed with the case at all.  The belt clip broke.  While trying to adjust the phone to put on belt, it snapped.  Not to impressed at all.  The screen protector isn’t that great either.  Haven’t even dropped my phone and the edge of the screen protector is cracked.  This all happened within hours of taking it out of the package it came in.
 Great case . I had one on my iphone 7  and was very happy . Just upgraded to 8 plus and gave the 7 to my daughter . Got the Zizo 8 Plus case . Love th glass screen protector it comes with . Case fits very well and not as bulky as the otterbox and the outer skin does not get loose like the otterbox. included belt clip work well also . Sold customer .
 I really like the quality and design of this case. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the kick stand could be a little longer. It’s not a major problem but it doesn’t quite get the phone to the angle I would want it. Either way, overall good product. I would recommend it to others for sure!
 Great case! The side button is hard and slightly awkward as noted in other reviews. The case beyond that, is fantastic. I have dropped my phone on three occasions since getting the case. The phone is fine. I replaced a UAG case (liked the UAG buttons better) and really appreciate the holster option. Thia is comparable to the UAG with the added holster is why I tried it. I am pleasantly surprised at the case and it's value.
 Send it back does not fit probably cracked the case trying to install it properly tried for over 20 mins. Still has gap on edge. Not happy . This is a new iPhone 8 Plus.
 Just ordered the case looks grea.t wish I would've been able to get the color I wanted but was not able to because the shipping was too long. so I settled for orange put the case on this morning and no one can hear anything that I'm saying.  Took the case off and everybody I was calling could hear me fine. so it has to be an issue with the case extremely disappointed with this being that I really like the design of the case.
 This is a great protective case.  I picked it because of the protection and grip ability also the clip. Sad to say mine arrived with a broken clip so after calling amazon they refunded my full purchase. I use this case everyday it is a great case. I recommend buying one. I will most likely purchase another color of this case.
 Seems to be made very well with quality materials. Only drawback I have is the case is too stiff to allow you to press the power button off and on or take a screenshot. I used an exact knife and carved a hole for the button to stick through. This case will do the job but definitely doesn't fit as well as an otter box.
 It says its military grade. But after less than 2 months my 14 year old son already broke the case
 This is my second case, my first case loved it so much that when I changed phone I got a new case to go along with it.  Problem is the case. The power button kept being pressed in by the case regardless of what I did so I'm a bit disappointed and I'm going to have to get a different case.
 I like the grip of this case, a little bulky for me but overall a good case. Will be my travel case.
 Extremely well made and protects the cell very well.
 nice added protection and durable kick stand  for watching tv / movies
 It’s really good looking, well built, and fits my iPhone 8+perfect. I love the stand and front cover/belt clip for extra protection.  Great fast shipping
 Awesome case well worth the $ paied and it comes with a tempered glass screen protector they are like $40 all on their own!! The case is very nice and for a military grade case it’s not bulky. Very please with this purchase!!
 Really liked the case but stand broke after about six uses, two days after warranty expired.
 Easy assembly. Feels like it would protect well. Less cumbersome (and less expensive) than the OtterBox I had on my previous phone. Could not get the kickstand to open without using a kitchen knife to pry it up. Took off a star for that but not a deal-breaker for me since I'd never use it anyway.
 Absolutely love this case for my new iPhone 8 Plus! It even has a nice kickstand on the back. Highly recommend this product to protect your investment.
 It is perfect! Works great! Although I lost my clip I really love the visual and protection
 Second one I have owned. Bought a new phone and immediately order this case. My first was dropped a lot and it broke the plastic shell in places. Phone still looks new. Great screen protector, it cracked as well both the screen scratch and crack free! Highly recommended!!!
 I had to return this item.  The buttons didn't line up with my iPhone 7 Plus.  Unusable!!  I did have this case in Purple for my iPhone 6 Plus and I love it.  Never had any problems with the 6 Plus Case...
 Love my new case! My teen loves hers too! They are very sturdy but not too bulky. I have dropped mine probably 4 times since I got it and the glass is still perfect. (2 of those falls were asphalt bounce to metal door frame! Not a scratch!) Plus the design fits the hand beautifully and I have small hands. Kudos great product more than worth the price.
 Case fits tightly and is easy to hold. Seems very tough. The kickstand is useful but only works in one direction. Would be nice if you could stand up in vertical directions. Also have to be careful when putting kickstand out because it may pull out of the back. Belt clip seems to not hold phone too tightly. Afraid to use in anything but office environment.
 Great quality . The color part on this case gets dirty  still like it a lot
 Very rugged and durable.  I don't recommend the white one, it got dirty and was tough to clean, but very good protection for my iPhone 7 Plus.
 arrived with small crack but it's ok and doesn't effect the use. it's currently on my son's phone, although originally for me. he doesn't mind the rose gold, bc it can pass as a light metallic red...
 Love the case I had a silver and a blue one now.
 I liked the different versions that you can choose from but the product keeps breaking. This is my second one I purchased thinking maybe bad luck but the material isn’t strong enough and starts following apart. Tried to contact seller about trying to see if maybe one part could be replaced but not luck. Product should be cheaper for how short amount of time it last.
 Only thing good about the case is that the phone actually fits in it.<br/>The screen protector (supposed to be for Iphone8 Plus) was actually for an IPhone 7.<br/>The back of the case is poorly designed because the "apple" symbol is not centered in the circle of the case.<br/><br/>Only good as a cheap alternative - buy something reputable instead.
 3.5 , I like the case. I ordered gold and I'm happy with it other than it seems people have trouble hearing me talk. When I take the case off there is no trouble and people can hear me clearly.  Seems to be issue even with the speaker phone on, though possibly less so that way.
 Very Nice Product. Purchased for my wife's iPhone and she loves it. Slim case and appears durable. The lanyard is a nice added feature she thought she would never use, but she finds herself asking how she ever got along without it. Going to purchase another for my son...
 My husband works outside most of the day and this phone case will ensure that his phone stays safe and damage free! He commented about how much he likes having the kickstand on the back that you can use to watch videos or read.
 Well it is no what I expected. Peeled the sticker off screen protector and it cracked. So there goes that. The black piece you put on first before the pink hard case, is now ruined because it’s so hard to get the pink case over it that the buttons broke. So I do not recommend. I’ll stick with my expensive otter box I have used in past.
 Love the corkscrew design and kickstand feature! A little bulky but very lightweight. Kind of confused about the loop and lanyard feature because I wouldn't dangle my phone around my neck. My favorite color is red and many of my past cases dull and get dirty but this will not happen with this shade of red and type of plastic that doesn't absorb
 It fit perfect and came with everything including a lanyard . Delivered on the day that they said it should arrive, excellent quality and looks great.
 After a couple months the case started cracking by the buttons and pieces fall off. The stand works great and I still use it. But I really need another case because there are big cracks on the side and around the back.
 I’ve owned other cases for other phones but this one is by far my favorite. These cases fit my hand well and it comes in the colors I want. Every phone I’ve owned I bought one of these for it. Their customer service is amazing as well I broke the belt clip on one of them and they gave me a new one for free and I had it the next day.
 My husband bought this case a month ago and the case is already cracked and a corner has broken off.on top of the cracks and corner missing the pop out stand in the back has broken off as well.  👎🏻👎🏻
 Holster break after about a month.<br/>I dropped my phone out of my hand as anyone does and the right corner of the glass broke even with this case on.
 I really like this case!  There are two reasons I only went to 4 stars: 1) the glass cover needs to be just a little wider as, in my opinion, doesn't cover the face completely on the iPhone 7+, it is only a hair off. 2) only two days after I received the case I broke the holster. All I was doing was twisting the belt clip and the plastic connector that holds the rotating belt clip (&amp; kickstand) to the holster broke. In my opinion the connector design is weak. I will contact the seller/manufacturer to see what they say.
 I love it dearly. Works great and looks even better. I have received many compliments about it. Get yours today! Works for both the 7 and 8 models.
 Kind of disappointed overall. I'm not sure what case I got. It fits the 6 plus but there is a hole cut out at the top for a headphone jack which the phone doesn't have. The power button doesn't line up so you can't turn off the phone. The plus side is the belt clip to hold my phone nicely in its otter box case so I guess I did get something out of it. My suggestion is spend the money for the otterbox
 GREAT PRODUCT! It feels very nice in the hand and comes with a lot of extra features. The kickstand is great and the glass screen protector is very nice! A lot of people were complaining about the power button not working and I was having the same problems too with both of my zizo cases so I separated the layers and stretched it out from the sides a little and it now works. The company is also very quick to respond! People also said the belt buckle is easy to break but the two I received are very durable!
 This is probably one of the worst cases I have ever purchased. The phone case itself is poorly put togeether and the rubber was separating from the plastic right out of the box. The tempered glass screen protector cracked trying to put it on, and the belt clip broke in half on day three. They claim this is milspec but it is very far from the truth.
 I love it and so comfortable to holding my new phone case!
 Gets dirty look and no matter how much you clean it, it doesn't come clean
 The case is very nice. Unfortunately it came missing the tempered glass cover. Someone returned it after they took whatever they needed from it. Then it was sold to me missing parts that a blind man would have noticed. Not very nice!!
 I was let down with the Otter Box case that I bought with new phone. Looking for an affordable replacement and found this case. I have young children and needed it to be able to take abuse! It has been a week or so and after several drops it has performed great! It is comfortable to hold and goes in my pocket without any problem.
 It's a good durable case. But it's not fitting the phone nicely. Had cut some inside parts. Also the kickstand is almost impossible to open with the fingers. I always have to use something like a knife to open it. Ordering another case from different company.
 I love that it feels solid but not bulky or heavy.  I like that it has multiple features such as the kickstand as well as clip.  Overall, very satisfied!
 Looks great, 2foot drop cracked screen. Clip on hoister is a weak point (cracked, see photo). I am reordering another one to replace hoister. Case has good feel.
 Oh Yea,, now that the iphone 7 plus is water resistent, I decided on this product because of the ruggedness.  I will be using this case not only for daily use, but also for fishing.. if you notice i attatched a floatation device.  Now when my fising buddy is recording my big catch, I dont have to worry about him dropping my iphone in the water, or better yet,dropping my iphone in the boat.  it will be well protected.
 Marketed as an iPhone 7 plus case but designed for the iPhone 6 plus and 6s plus. Causes the iPhone 7 to turn off and on constantly due the the rubber buttons on the power side.
 I'm very impressed with this phone case:) It rocks! It is sturdy and comfortable. It does an excellent job of protecting my phone. It is very worth getting!
 Broken piece upon delivery
 This case is great.  Fits the iPhone 8 perfectly.  High quality construction and not too thick and bulky.  I especially like the little slot at top for a strap - extra security for activities where something may fall out of a pocket.  Nice feature is the glass screen protector.
 Is a great product and would order again from this company!
 I have had this case for over a week now and have found it fits my iPhone very well and offers better protection than the leather case I had on it. I love the design of the case, good grip. I purchased the orange colored case so it’s harder to loose it
 Falsely advertised as iPhone 8 Plus. Extremely pissed to get this case today and find out it IS NOT an iPhone 7/8 Plus case. Case will fit properly over power button. Utterly useless case if you cannot turn on/off your phone. What a shame to falsely market this as iPhone 8 Plus case
 I am highly disappointed from this product partially because I had very high expectations before ordering this case. I ordered white/gray case for my new Silver iPhone 8plus.<br/>Pros: it comes with a glass screen protector so it saves at least $5. The material is better than other similar priced ones available but not as sturdy as Otterbox Defender series.<br/>Cons:<br/>1) If you look in bottom, this case has slot for Audio Jack (last time it was seen in iPhone 6 plus), so it is at least two models old. The case is actually small in size for iPhone 8 plus, that you will realize when you will forcefully squeeze your new iPhone in this case.<br/>2) THE APPLE LOGO IS NOT IN THE CENTER OF CIRCLE at the back and that is a huge turndown for me.<br/> 3) The volume button are not working smoothly (again it is not for iPhone 8 plus).<br/>For me, the delivery was two days late so another bad experience as I could not use my new phone for two more days.<br/>I would give it two points for a sturdy, fancy case but actually I felt cheated as this is a clearly a fake product.<br/>Dimensions of iPhone 6 Plus vs i Phone 8 plus (Height 158.1mm vs 158.4mm), (Width 77.8mm vs 78.1mm), Thickness (7.1mm Vs 7.5mm) respectively; so iPhone is BIGGER IN ALL DIMENSIONS.
 My husband is not to interested in the clip that is apart of the package, but he really likes the cover on the phone. The clip is there as an option for him. Also the fact that it does come with a protective glass for your screen is a BIG+++++ with the iPhone 7+ being somewhat new it just makes it so much easier. The guys at Verizon we're impressed with the glass cover. The guys at the particular store we went to had never put one on. It's easy, durable, and good on the eyes. Good product.
 I bought this case for my iPhone 7 Plus. Very simple to put on very tired and very happy with it the glass also covers the complete phone. Love the clip attachment downside is if you have a magnetic phone holder mount for your car you need to glue it to the clip will not penetrate the back of the phone. Love it highly recommend it
 Bought this for my wife. She loves the looks and seems to protect the phone ok. (Not quite as sturdy as Otter box, but it is a whole lot cheaper)<br/>First one we received was scratched so we r in process of return g it for another one. Hopefully it will not be an issue. Overall, it seems to be a good case for the price.
 Loved the case design and feel. Really wanted this one but the buttons were bad.<br/>The volume buttons on the left were hard to push and the button on the top right that was supposed to<br/>Turn off the screen was too tight and constantly pressing against the phone. This caused the phone to screen to stay on and the slide to power off would pop up on my screen to power the whole phone down.<br/>Had to return it. I have since bought another case and it works fine.
 This case fitted on the dime, with no problem, highly recommend.  All buttons on the dime as well with no problems.  Sorry to here some of you have problems with the bottoms, maybe it's just deflected case returned it and get an other case.
 Best case I've used to date. Had a UAG in crimson color and loved it but after seeing the Bolt in the same color I ordered it and I have to say it fits the 7 plus even better.  Feels great in the hands. The ribbed back is very grippy. Very cool looking as well!!!
 super sturdy, and includes a holster/cover for extra protection and mobility
 Too Bulky and definitely not full proof, I dropped my phone right after I put the cover on it and the glass cracked.
 What I liked the most: The durability, the cool design, the built in stand, the clip and even the small loop that let's you attach the phone to briefcase, etc. Unfortunately, the only thing I didn't like, was the glass cover had factory flaws in it, that kept it from completely adhering to the glass phone surface.
 My power off button would not work at all in this case and I also could not do a screen shot. I thought maybe the case had an issue so got a 2nd case (exact same case) and it had the same issues. Really disappointed because I loved the bright color and it looked great. So sad it wouldn’t work.
 Third case I have bought from Zizo. 1st one lasted about a year, under some extreme abuse. I was very happy. 2nd one, used to replace the first, lasted about two weeks. The outer shell felt brittle, not pliable ike the 1st one, and cracked and fell apart almost immediately. The 3rd one, feels and appears to be similar to the 1st one and I expect it to perform similar.
 Great protection little hard in the hands because of the ridges, iPhone 7 plus. If I use my phone a lot it's a hard on my hands but it keeps it safe. I just wish it had a way to put a card carrier on it or it had a storage spot for cards
 I pledge by Otterbox but I wanted a different look for my new phone so I purchased this case in rose gold to match my rose gold iPhone. i love the hand grips and will keep this case until the summer
 This case is very nice for the price.  Pick up one of these if you are looking for a case.  You won't be disappointed.
 Terrible case
 Awesome rugged &amp; lightweight case! Love the unique design &amp; modern look! Two things that I’d like to suggest are: To exclude the wrist strap attachment on the upper left corner of the case, as it’s not common to use. And maybe include a front a screen protector/border shield (mainly to cover the top &amp; bottom of the screen). Other than that, I’m quite satisfied with this case (&amp; belt clip holder) and the price.
 The hinge on the stand snapped on first use.  The plastic molding on the rear of the case is badly fitting at one spot. Otherwise, it’s ok. Seems robust. I like that it came with a screen protector and materials to clean the screen before fitting the protector.
 Pretty decent product, fits perfectly in all the right places. Only complaint is screen protector was broken probably in shipping since it was on my sidewalk and not in front of my door, UPS three it from the street.
 Excellent case however the belt holster broke on me literally broke in half just by getting into my car. I contacted zizo after receiving and email about replacement parts free and was told they wouldn't  do anything for me so I only give the case 3 because of this reason if they would have helped I would have given 5 star review
 Fantastic case!<br/>Not only is this a great product, but their customer service and replacement policy is even greater!<br/>Very strong and sturdy case for the iPhone 7plus and slip resistant ! Very good quality!<br/>They definitely have a very satisfied, life-long customer!
 I liked the case everythinf was perfect only reason for one star is that they forgot to put the tempered glass in. There was instructions on how to put tempered glass on but no tempered glass.
 Don’t buy ! the plastic for the cover  was cracked in the bag poor shipping. Won’t buy again.
 Love it, love it, love it!  Great style, feels sturdy,  and love the kick stand. I really like that I can put it in a pocket, use it on a belt, or hand it on a lanyard.  All buttons on my phone are easy to get to and use, unlike my last case.  Just received it today, but I know this a keeper and will use this brand again!
 Love this case. Had the one for iPhone 6 before so when we upgraded to iPhone 7 it was a must. Holds up to 4 year old and clumsy hands, looks great and the stand is awesome!
 Great design but lacks quality. Should have known by the price I guess. Tab on holster broke off during normal use, the button on the side did not work until I scraped the excess material off, and the kickstand broke(although you couldn't open it without something to pry it open in the first place). All around fit was horrible. If they were to improve all the issues and concentrate on quality I would buy another even if it cost more but as it stands I would stay away from this product until then. By the way I have only owned this for a month tops.
 For the price I was very surprised of the quality and the extras that comes with it. Thank you Zizo
 Like the slim fit and color.  Sturdy, however iPhone 7 Plus Screen Protector: a Zizo  Lightning Shield] already cracked when drop from my hand and hit the wood floor.  But the phone screenunder it  didn't crack...
 I am very satisfied with this case.  It’s sturdy, it holds the iPhone very snug In place, I recommend this case to anyone.
 The kickstand is impossible to open with your fingers or even a sharp pointy tool so you can set your phone on a desk and watch a movie or video.  You can't even pry it open.  What's the point of offering a kickstand? Secondly the clasp hip holder doesn't "hold" the phone!  What's the point of that?  Such a waste of money
 Great case. This my third case for three different phones. All high quality.
 Unfortunately I read it wrong and I have the iPhone X  so I have to send this back. So disappointed.
 Kind of spectacle about this case at first, but when it came it over exceeded my expectations. I am happy that not only the price was great, the quality of the case is sturdy and to top that off it came with a tempered glass as well.
 The white case immediately started to change color and get dirty. The volume buttons don’t line up on the 8 plus. Returning mine.
 Screen wouldn’t set correctly. Even had at&amp;t help but without success. I threw away the screen protector. Then a week after using the rest of the protector, it cracked near the volume buttons.
 Fits good, good protection. Even came with glass for screen
 Good case and quality for th price. Have some minor wear and tear issues after several months of ownership but for the price it has held up longer than expected.
 It's good to know that I can rely on a good and quality product such as the zizo bolt cellphone case to protect my phone from getting damaged easily. This product comes in a complete set, allowing to protect your phone without having to look for screen protectors, cases, etc... everything in one single set. Fits my phone perfectly, I highly recommend this product for all you people with a physical job description. Protect what you like.
 Got for my husband - very durable, easy to wear on belt.
 These cases are good rugged cases, and the lanyard is kind of cool. But the buttons on the power and volume were to tight and would make the phone freeze up. I was going to return them but I decided to cut them out instead. Have to use my fingernail to hit the buttons now but I have no doubt the case would protect it in a fall.
 Update on the iPhone 8 holster case i bought<br/>three days ago as you can see it didn’t last long until the corner of the holster broke wish I could get a replacement but I guess that won’t be happening.
 The package says that it is for I Phone 7 and 6s. The web description says that it is for 8 and 7 plus. If the reasoning is that they are compatible with 8, then why some colors say 8/7 and rest says 6. This is completely misleading... I bought a pink color case. If the web description is appropriate , then I would have a got a different color.
 The case is sturdy and nice but the power off button doesn’t work when the case is on. The design isn’t right for the 7+ To allow the button to work.
 We have purchased these cases for our phones twice now. For our iPhone 6’s and now our iPhone 7 and 8 plus. They are very durable and have lasted longer than any other case. The kickstand is great, and the handle on the corner is very useful. I will definitely buy this product again.
 It pushed the phone power button when it was on the phone. Which made it not fit the phone. Didnt return it because didnt have the time too..
 Case is really nice but the clip broke as soon as I put it on my phone idk if the clip is able to turn two that it can clip on to your belt side ways or not but I tried turning it and it broke.idk if it's my fault or manufacturer defect in my case. And that's the only reason I bought this case was for the clip as it is easier to use when I am at work instead of trying to dig it out of my pocket.
 I have had this similar case previously for another I-Phone I had, they offer great protection. I like the screen cover it comes with. Also have a teenage boy that uses the same case, and have never had an issue with breaking a phone or the glass
 The stand on the back broke within the second day &amp; the hard plastic shell cracked and started to fall off after about a 3 foot fall. Protected my phone but I wouldn’t purchase again.
 This is a sturdy case that fits well.
 I am very disappointed in this phone case because after using it for 2 months it broke. The holder for the phone case has a single clip on one side that is lifted  up to release the phone from the holder. This clip broke off making the holder useless. The clip broke off when I was simply lifting it to release the phone from the holder.
 Super protective and the lanyard feature is great when we are at the amusement park or with the kids and need our hands free.
 Really liked this phone case my phone was well protected dropped my phone out of tree stand 30 ft. and my phone was in perfect condition.
 Love the case. Have used many different ones in the past, but this has the most protection for it size that ive found. It has also been the most durable for my lifestyle.
 When i put on the case for my IPhone 8 plus, when i look at back side, I couldn’t see apple logo completely, which is not the case images shown on the  website. I returned the case but had to bear shipping cost. Waste of time and money
 Love these cases.  I have one for my HTC and this one for my wife.  Only issue was that the stand on back is a little cheap and breaks easily.  Pins always fall out. I would make more sturdy.
 I had one for years before replacing it after the kick stand broke.  The plastic seems cheaper, my new one broke in the same place in a day and a half.  Bummer the case looks great and protects well.
 I just received it today and opened it right away, and the kickstand broke off, the part that I bought the case for because I already have a case for my phone. Very disappointing.
 Had it a week and I dropped off a 2nd story breezeway, right on to concrete. Horrified my iPhone 7 plus was trashed, I ran down and picked it up to find only the protective faceplate cracked!<br/><br/>I'm in love!<br/><br/>Kickstand is also pretty cool
 Case is excellent. Great color and very stylish. I gave 2 stars because the clip doesn’t hold the phone well at all. It falls out of the clip several times daily and completely defeats the purpose of the case if it falls out constantly. Unfortunately I will end up buying another case and clip because of it. However, if you don’t use the phone clip then it is a perfect case.
 This case did not fit my iPhone 8 Plus at all. The button in the right side to turn the phone on and off would not function at all so I returned it
 I would love to try out my new case but, the one big reason I bought this case was for the tempered glass. Which is not in the packaging! Sorry for the one star, but a major piece was missing!
 great case. snug fit, with the kickstand. Comes with a tempered glass screen cover. Not part of the case itself.
 YouTube review sold me on this functional product.  Amazing value !  FYI this was my first time  applying  a screen saver  I did not follow directions  explicitly and mine (without me tapping the center)  adhered it's self almost immediately.  follow directions  follow directions with included cleaning cloth to avoid crooked screen saver.  Luckily mine is straight. Top quality product.  I paid retail and I'm very pleased.
 I would give this negative stars if possible. I loved the look and color of the case but when I put it on my new phone it made it go crazy. The plastic was hitting the screen lock button and made my phone start turning on and off back and forth. I thought it was going to fry my phone, so bad that I had to take it to the Verizon store. We tried cutting the plastic but then the case wouldn't work so we just threw the $20 we spent on the case away. If it had actually fit I would have loved it!!! But a big fat waste of money.
 Nice and well fitting case that not only looks tough, but can handle then daily bumps and falls that Insubject my phone to. Thanks Zips!
 I don't have my new 7 plus yet but tried it out with my 6 plus. For my use I needed to modify it, I took a sharp razor knife and cleanly removed the tether loop and smoothed it with an emory board. The holster only holds the case in one direction, which is opposite the way you hold the phone to your head if you're not using a headset-to put it in the holster you need to rotate it 180 degrees to snap it in. By removing the loop for the tether and then using a dremel to make small holes for the holster to clip into on the opposite side of the case it will work perfectly for me! if you have any DIY skills its an easy mod, they should sell it this way imho. Like the case just not the loop holder and need to rotate 180 degrees to put in holster. Four Stars cause of the need to rotate it for the holster and my need to mod it. Seems like it will be great otherwise for me.<br/><br/>update-gone through a bunch of holsters, and some you order will have a centered clip and some off center, strange-I emailed about it over a month ago-while promised a response I've never gotten one. Lowering to 2 stars since i had to mod it and holsters are strange and break.<br/><br/>Update Jan 26,17 been 4 months and the holster and case have held up very well! I've had no issues
 I really like this case.  It fit iPhone 7plus perfectly.<br/>My only recommendations for improvement are eliminate the hole that shows the Apple logo and make a door that covers/protects the camera lens.
 My iPhone 8 Plus barely fit in the case and the volume buttons will not work in the case, I was very disappointed in this case because I have been wanting one
 Volume controls work fine but no matter how many times I try and place my phone in this case the power button never lines up correctly.<br/><br/>Plus, this is just an iPhone 6S Plus case repurposed for the iPhone 7 Plus.<br/><br/>I will be returning it for a refund.
 love it....has saved my phone a few times .....I drop it by accident a lot
 Bought it for the color and was surprised at the great quality. I Recommend .
 I would NOT recommend this case to ANYONE I bought 3 of them for my family for Xmas and wish I had made a different choice. 1.) The case fits to tightly. 2.) Because the case is so tight it makes it VERY hard to turn off the phone or put it into sleep mode. 3.) The glass for the screen protector doesn't even cover the whole screen. Bottom line just keep scrolling and don't pick this case protection for you're iPhone 7 plus...
 Typically you get what you pay for. Not in this case. (No pun intended) Great inexpensive cover. Looks pretty cool too. I could do without the lanyard, as the loop on the cover adds to the size. All in all though, I’d buy it again. I also like that it comes with a screen protector and belt clip.
 I'm sorry, but I didn't care for this item. I wanted an Otter Box defender, but didn't want to spend the money. Although this item appeared to be quality, it doesn't offer the protection in need
 I have been extremely impressed with this case thus far (approximately 2 months).  It has a different look/ design than you would typically not find at your local phone store which I like.  Extreme durable, and the stand is a great added bonus.  The clip is another great feature proving the capability and option to clip the phone to your belt or pocket... It is my opinion that this is a well made product. I recommend it...<br/>J. Barbosa
 My mom loved the case she had been asking and asking me for a case read all sorts a reviews for all kinds of cases definitely will go with this one
 Love this case on my new iPhone 7+. Stylish and does it's job.
 Porfavor dejar artículos cuando sean pequeños en los buzones de los apartamentos, ya que esté artículo lo dejaron en la puerta de mi aprt y me lo robaron.
 I love it. This case is exactly what I wanted to protect my new iPhone 7+. I ordered it on the 21st and it arrived on the 25th.  I was extremely happy it's a great case I would recommend it to everyone with an iPhone
 So far so good, my second cover as the first broke after about 4 months. I can already tell by the construction that this one is much better built and will last much much longer.
 My Zizo case is NOT what I expected to receive. My iPhone 7+ will not work with this case. I bought a Tan and a Orange. I did get the Orange to work. The Tan is just too tight around the power button and offers no relief.<br/><br/>They look great for only one out of two work.
 Excellent case! I feel very confident I could drop kick the phone across a parking lot and it would be fine. It's very rugged and that's what I needed as a commercial diver. Has a good grip and very easy to hold, will not slip out of your hands. Holster is well done as well, I just wish there was the option for the screen to face out as well as in.<br/>All in all, for the price and what you get, it's outstanding. Great job Zizo!!
 Great case. Easy to keep a grip on the phone. Only issues I have are my power button on the side doesn't line up correctly and I can't lock my phone. It has to sit there until it times out. I have tried taking it out and putting it back on the case to make sure the buttons are lined up correctly but still doesn't work. OT her issue is the clip brok the day I got it. I went to turn it so I could put it on my belt and the plastic broke to the actual clip part came out. Now I'm down a clip.
 Only problem was the tab used to open the stand broke the next day after receiving other than that it's a really nice case and arrived really quickly!
 This product is not as described. It is very cheap. ZIZO might send you the wrong product like me and make you pay to return it.
 Husband loves it he works welding and it's holding up to him
 This case is light weight and very easy to put into phone in. I usually by Otter Box cases for our phones but thought I would try the Zizo Bolt to see how I would like it.  Have to say I love it.
 I was disappointed with my order.  The case itself is nice and will protect my iPhone just fine, however, the tempered glass cover does not fit the case.  It's too narrow and it slides off the case so the face of my phone is unprotected.  Can I get a tempered glass cover that fits this case?
 Love it and very protective. I only wish the clip allowed a front and back clip on as opppsed to face down. Beside that, it is very good and serves it purpose.
 I have had this product for only a couple weeks and th stand on the back broke after one use. Very cheap material. I won’t buy but again
 I really like this bundle. Cause it comes With a protective screen for your phone. This is my second one. Can’t beat it for the price.
 the case for the phone is nice, I hate the side loading holster. its hard to get phone into holster.  especially when in a rush you have to be careful not to drop the phone.
 I love this case, it wasn't expensive, lots of color options, not big and bulky, everything I was looking for. It has a stand to watch shows on, and it is a good quality case.<br/> I highly recommend this case for anyone that does anything outdoors as it has a place to tie something to it so it doesn't get lost. It even has the screen facing the clip bracket for extra protection when not in use. Plus it comes with a tempered glass protection screen!!!!
 I received the case and I was amazed by the quality.Met all my expectations in terms of appearance and durability.Look forward to doing more business.
 I bought the red on black my son chose between it and the military color style hard decision for an eight year old when he loves both military and deadpool but the red on black won our vote and my husband loved it more and the fact that it was military grade tough it has just the right amount of grip and he uses the stand more than I thought he would this is a great phone case in my option better than high cost or any name brand I would gladly buy more of this product!
 Solid case the way I like it. Everything was fine except the power button. It didn't aid in the function of powering off my phone. I wiggled the case slightly to see if it fits differently, which it does but prompts my phone to fully shut off. Tried with just the inner sleeve (to see if the outter hard case was pushing the button) turns out the inner sleeve is the problem. Fit fine around my phone- perhaps too well. Will be returning.
 Great quality and durability plus it looks mean
 Does not fit the phone properly. Read the one star reviews. Its constantly putting pressure on the power button. Also the logo cut out does not line up
 I like this case but it needs a light hole on the belt clip side of it.
 Very nice case, not too big and bulky which was what I wanted. I really liked the fact I could get it in various colors not available from other manufacturers.
 This is not for an iPhone 8 Plus like it says it is. The buttons do not work with an iPhone 8 Plus and the packaging for the case says iPhone 7s plus.
 The stand had a crack in it so as soon as we tried to use it, it broke. The stand is made of cheap thin plastic so don’t expect it to work for too long. Screen protector didn’t cover the entire screen either. Nice color though.
 The case for the iPhone 7 Plus was ordered before I received the new phone. The case is defective as designed. The on/off button and volume buttons on the side don't engage properly. You can't use these buttons with the case on. I modified the case by cutting out these areas with a knife to make it useful and protect the phone.<br/>The case I had for the iPhone 6 worked perfectly, so I am disappointed in this one.
 Very happy with my new phone case. Looks very sharp and it's tough as well. Already had a number of people ask me where I bought it and what brand it is.
 Case looks nice but did not function, the power button would hold down causing the phone to do random power cycles and I contacted the company for a new case and never heard back after 1 or 2 emails of giving them the info they requested, in unhappy with this product and I normally never leave reviews less than 4 stars
 The plastic built-in stand just broke within 2 days of use. The tiny metal bar that sustained it was glued to the plastic piece in a very poor fashion.
 Case was modified from iPhone 6s Plus with the earphone 3.5 mm cut is still there. The tempered glass does not cover over glass surface. Find a defected spot (3mm) internal glass. Case is perfect for protection. I accidentally dropped it from 3 feet height onto concrete floor without damage the phone. Would like to take off 3 stars due to old earphone jack enlarged on case and the not fit with defective tempered glass.
 Tight fit around the iPhone. Great feel and grip with a soft feel to the touch. It definitely protects the edge of the glass. love the extra kickstand in the back of the cover.<br/><br/>Did not like the screen protector, it did not seem to have a good grip on the glass. I should not have been able to reapply the glass sheet.<br/><br/>The lanyard broke on the first day at the female part of the connector. love the extra kickstand in the back of the cover.<br/><br/>I would buy this again. Great product. Great price
 Im very pleased with my Zizo cover!  I got the orange one because I like how it stands out and as someone who frequently leaves his phone on a table or counter, all I have to do is glance and I'll see it!  I also enjoy the toughness of it and the grip is fantastic.  I feel very confident this cover WILL protect my phone from the  numerous times my arthritic hands will drop it.  I recommend this case to anyone wanting rugged protection for an expensive phone.  Oh, and the price is phenomenal!
 Item came with broken stand. Disappointing
 Very durable and does not mute the mic or the speaker
 This is the second case and we, in our household all have Zizo cases.
 Awesome case I got the gold one, it’s super durable and adds good weight to the phone., even cane with a screen protecter and lanyard, the case it self passed my drop test when I let it go onto the sidewalk and not a scratch, even the phone clip is super handy
 Less than a month old and phone case has completely cracked.
 My iPhone 7 plus screen cracked after 1 day of having this case. It was a defective case and put pressure on the top left Corner of the actual iPhone screen. I had it proped up on my work desk and it fell not even 2 inches onto its back and it cracked the screen from top left to the bottom right. This phone case is cheaply made and I would not recommend it to anyone. OTTERBOX ALL THE WAY PEOPLE.
 Love this case. Has protected my phone for over a year with almost no wear visible.<br/>Has survived drops, and all kinds of abuse.
 What a great value! This case looks awesome on the phone. My husband works in construction and is always dropping his phone and between the case and the screen protector that came with it his phone is protected. It is a sleek design and the belt clip is even working out.
 Case is nice but the buttons do not line up correctly with my Iphone 7 plus specifically the lock screen button on the upper right! It would  not align properly and I made multiple attempts to see if I could correct it with no luck.
 none of the side buttons will work with this case.<br/>clearly the 7 plus and 8 plus cases are not the same.<br/>has an extra hole for the ear bud and the apple logo is not entered in the window in back.<br/>was not able to contact seller.  grrr.
 The buttons are to hard to use. The off/on button is to hard to turn off or on. And the volume buttons are also hard to use. When I try to use the volume it wants me to turn off the phone. The rest of the case seems to be ok. May have to get a different case.
 Good quality case
 Does not fit iPhone 8 plus. The apple logo doesn't line up. Volume buttons and power button does not work. Case is extremely difficult to put on!<br/><br/>Customer Service contacted me Asap and sent a replacement case out Asap!
 The belt holder broke once i put it on my belt and the case didn’t let me screenshot and my phone would turn off when I would press the volume bottons 🤷🏽‍♂️ Over all it looks great but not durable for the type of work I do
 Fantastic product. Fits the phone right with no button jamming. I especially like the lanyard feature, it suits my work and lifestyle needs. Love the design.
 Very well made case and holster. I like how easy it is to pop the holster off the case. Just what I was looking for.
 Holds phone in place pretty well. The strap clip broke with little pull or resistance. Over all I’m with the purchase.
 Great case! Very sturdy, good grip, attractive. All the buttons work perfectly through the body of the case. Hard to imagine any problems in the future. Feels great in my hand!
 Terriable phone case. The buttons were so stiff they were pressing down on the buttons not allowing them to release. So my lock button was being pressed down and not releasing so I couldn't use the phone. Tried to cut some off to loosen it up but still didn't work. So I cut it off completely then re glued it to try and fix it but didn't work. So I just threw it away and I just got it today!!!
 I like it very much
 Got it for iphone 8 plus, fits great, no problems. All buttons/ports line up and function fine.  Seems sturdy and functional and has the bonus of the stand, lanyard and belt clip for a great price. I already had a screen protector on, and it's still fine, but great to have an extra now. Came quickly, well packaged.
 the back stand broke and fell off no where to be found.....not happy with this product since I haven't had more than a month.
 This is the best phone Cover I have ever had. I searched and searched for a new one. I could t remember the name. Very gratefu for Amazons order history from 2 years ago.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/> ERG Durable, yet sleek and stylish!
 The case on the phone is nice and sturdy but the belt clip and holster is extremely fragile.  We purchased two of these cases and within a few weeks both of the belt clip/holsters were unusable.
 So far, I really like it!!
 This case is well made. Fits my phone snuggly. I like the two piece design with the silicone fully covering all sides and corners and the hard case covering the sides and back.
 It isn't for iPhone 7 plus. It fits, but the holes are for i6. Otherwise, makes me feel secure.<br/>FYI the stand is so tight that I am afraid it will break the case to open. Don't buy it for the stand.
 Great cover! My husband states they could have put more thought into the stand part of it.
 This was such a great case for my iPhone 6S plus, that I bought another for my new iPhone. The fit and finish is of top notch quality, and durable. I've owned many different brands of cases for my phones over the years, and the Zizo cases are a refreshing combination of high quality at a reasonable price.
 I like the quality of the product. It was very easy to install iPhone 8 Plus into case. The appearance looks great. The case has a built in stand for hands free viewing and comes with a durable clip. The case also comes with a lanyard clip if you choose to wear your phone around your neck or want to secure it to something else. Great investment.
 It's pretty dang great. I got the case before the phone so I had the store install the screen protector and assist with the case. The outer shell was difficult to put on and isn't snug in some places.
 Great product for the price.  I bought others that were more expensive from other stores,  they were not as nice and durable as this product.  I love the design and the extra key chain to hold my phone. It makes it easier to grab from the bottom of my purse.
 Have purchased 5 so far. Does a great job And is far less expensive than others. Dropped phone many times with no issues.
 Absolutely love this iPhone 8 Plus case. Great protection, style, quality, fit and price. This is my second purchase from Zizo and I highly recommend their products.
 I’ve had this for about three weeks and overall, it protects my phone. However, the kickstand feature broke after only three or four uses. The design is fine, just needs to be more durable.
 Previously I had bought 2 cases that were good, however this time the screen protector came broken and the folding is not good and always opens.
 I really like my new case. The design and sturdiness of it is exactly what I was looking for. I especially like the belt clip because it is a lot more effective than what I had been using. Great product and I would buy again.
 While I like the design and slim fit, the clip broke on three of the units.  The first two, were replaced without issue but this last one was outside of the Amazon return window.  Also the volume and scree off buttons did not match up exactly so did not have a goo sensory feedback and I would have to push them multiple time to get the desired outcome.
 Within 24 hours the glass screen protector broke and peeled. Thank goodness it's there,  wish it came with extra glass.
 I like the feel and appearance.  Very responsive screen.<br/>This item is a glorified bumper case with a adhesive screen protector.<br/>Does not offer the same protection from water as dust as a Lifeproof or Otterbox.
 I got this case after my phone got broke. 😢 It is durable and looks great. Love the lanyard. Makes it so I can hang my phone in my locker at work rather than having it sit with my shoes.
 I absolutely love the case itself.  Durable, sleek and well made.  I was disappointed to open my package and find the screen protector was cracked so I couldn’t use it on my phone, however I didn’t want to send it back since I found the case itself to be intact. Love the case though.
 Less than a week the belt clip broke.  The belt clip is not durable at all and I would not recommend this product.  I gave 2 stars for material quality because I do like the feel and design for the phone case in my hand but not quite sure how it will hold up at this point.
 So far so good
 Had this case on a week and orange plastic is cracked and piece broke off already !!!!!!!!!<br/>I would not  suggest buying this!!!!
 In case with screen protector and the screen cracked when it dropped on the carpet today.  Maybe it's a fluke but I'm pretty bummed.
 VERY NICE!!! IT'S SO COOL LOOKING! AND IT PROTECTS YOUR PHONE! PLUS THEY SENT A SCREEN PROTECTOR WITHE A CLEANSING WIPE AND CLOTH !
 Bought this case for my husband who is a police officer and most of his phone crack or break while on duty, so far this one is holding up nicely. Would buy again.
 I really like the case a lot and it’s one of the best cases I’ve ever had but there’s slightly a little problem. When I fold the clip on the back of the case to have my phone still to watch a movie,it broke but I am going to buy another one
 Fits well, looks good but black  power button is VERY STIFF and impossible for my wife to use. My Blue Green unit is much better. Suggest the case get a reformulation of the black inner lining...
 Overall, the case itself is good. It holds up well and looks very nice. The kickstand is another matter. There was a small crack in the corner of the kickstand and it has since broken completely off of the case. The kickstand was never even used. It just fell off one day.
 did not fit phone i don't recommend for the I phone 8 plus
 very prompt delivery, great device protection for the price, installation is easy. I found the support stand dislodges easily and the the device volume buttons are held in by rubber cover.
 I had never heard of Zizo, but the reviews were positive. I love this iPhone 8 case. It was so simple to put on. It’s rugged but light. I’ve had it on for a few weeks now and I see zero issues. Don’t hesitate, great price for quality.
 Only used for a couple months and the kickstand is already broken from regular use, it just fell off one day. Very disappointing because I love the case.
 I have the iPhone 7 Plus in red. I chose this case because I working in an industry where I am constantly on the go. Not only did the red case match my iPhone, the various features such as: Lanyard, stand, and belt case attachment made it a "PRIME" purchase. It did come with the tempered protective glass, but since I didn't need it I'll have it as a back up!
 I bought this case to use occasionally, but I like it so much I don't use other case. I don't use the front part of case or the screen protector that came with it. It's not needed with I phone 7plus.
 Worked out good
 This case is really cool looking and seems really sturdy. Very happy with it so far!
 don't buy this
 Didn’t hold up well. The flap on the back broke within a week and you can’t put magnets on it for car mounts.
 This case is amazing my phone felt from a 6th floor through an elevator slide and my phone didn’t break or got any scratches.  Highly recommended
 This is the perfect case for my husbands phone!  It provides a lot of protection from accidental drops, and it looks great.  The added protection of the cover that protects the screen is awesome.
 I like the feel of the case. Also very sleek and professional looking. I’m very particular with my phone cases. It’s important to know my phone is protected, as I drop it a lot, while still looking fashionable. The stand is great for viewing screen and for FaceTime features. Look no further!
 This item was purchased for my husband. The package was open, the kickstand was not in the package, the tempered glass was not in package and the wet wipe was open with empty packaging in the box. We are very displeased with this purchase. I have ordered many things from Amazon and this is the first item I’ve had an issue with.
 I made a mistake and ordered 2 of them but I decided to keep them both....Great Price too!!
 Very surprised at the fit and finish of the matierials for such a low price. Will definitely protect my iPhone. When I upgrade again I’ll be sticking with xoxo...
 Not what the picture shows
 Very pleased with this phone case and the accessories.  It will definitely outlast the phone!
 Love this case!! The glass protector was easy to install, and my iPhone fits perfectly.
 It just broke after couple of days, I bought it only to wear it when I’m at work, and out of nowhere the lid that keeps it tilted just broke and i don’t even use it
 Nice, well made case with shatterproof glass cover. Too bad I ordered the wrong one, but my daughter appreciated the gift. Love the color too...will be ordering one for my iPhone 7 ...
 This is my 3rd try for this case. I love the looks but the right  power button doesn't line up so it won't work. It's really to bad since it seems like a high quality case that looks good
 The case is great and very durable BUT when we got them the power bottom on the right hand side wouldn't work for either of them. We tried and tried and it just wouldn't do anything. All the other buttons worked. My husband ended up cuttin a couple small slits in his and that made the difference and it worked. We had to do the same for mine. It wasn't worth it to send them back but was very irritating for something brand new. I would not recommend this to any of my friends.
 I ordered this with high expectations. They didn't even bother to put the product in the bag. Totally disappointed. Never buy this.
 Love the color. Have dropped it several times and still good as new. Don't like the lanyard holder because it doesn't allow me to put the phone in the holder in the direction I like it. The clip on the holder broke before having it a year, but the case and screen protector have held up very well.
 Just got this case.  Seems very sturdy and solid.  Like the feel of it  it doesn't feel slippery  ..  Fits very, very snug.  Was difficult to get phone in and originally I thought the phone would not fit.  Kickstand is a nice feature.  The glass was not to difficult to put on.
 Did not get the item I ordered, I have a iPhone 8plus and when you put the case on, it does not fit. The camera doesn’t match up, the holes don’t match up, so I’m very very upset over this.
 Great case and design but the inside casing is too snug around the phone which causes the power button to be held down constantly trying to shut down the phone. I don't drop my phone very often but if I do it's usually about a 2 foot drop and I've only had the case a little over 7 months and the casing cracked on me. Doesn't sound very military tested to me...
 Great buy. Came as advertised. Fast delivery.
 The case was ok but the stand broke the first time I used it. I ended up sending it back
 My husband loves his case Its not overly bulky. This case is very easy to held on to. I like the lanyard clip since he is often around water.
 The case arrived timely as expected by Zizo.  The case fits my phone perfectly and the color is exactly as shown.  I love how the phone came with the screen protector as well.  Zizo has kept in contact with me through the whole process as well.  Great company!
 the case seems and feels to be durable (used for few hrs)<br/><br/>The ONLY thing about this product is that I had to cut the "nipple" down (on the case) a bit for the power button.. if you dont do that, the case will cause the phone to go to the "swipe right" power off option
 It is really gonna give you a back for your buck. Like to ruggedness and durability for such a good price. I normally buy Otterbox but its been very expensive lately.<br/>Love the kickstand that is built in the case. Awesome feature.
 Looks great but doesn’t perform that way. It broke from minimal use in first week of possession.
 I like that at the left corner top corner it has a thicker rubbery material. But the string broke off the first 20 mins of wearing it on my neck.  And I was mislead about the “bolt” series.  There is no bolts to keep the phone safe in layers.  But is very sleek and love the kickstand on the back.
 case feels like it's custom fit, tight and snug. hope i never drop my phone, but already feel like it's well protected. yes, i bought an orange case on purpose. i always buy black cases, but if i ever misplace this one, it'll be easier to spot ;) includes a belt clip, don't use it unless you want to be teased. that's what fanny packs are for. zizo...where's my t-shirt?
 Protect my phone .... besides the screen protector it should have came with a front cover
 The case fit the iPhone 8 Plus but it doesn’t allow me to power the phone on and off. Have to take the phone out the case to power phone down.
 Just bought a second case because the first fought a good fight falling down 24', destroying the holster clip and the kickstand, the glass screen protector cracked but the phone itself is in perfect condition.
 Are used to get OtterBox is for all of my phones.<br/>But not anymore!<br/>I love this iPhone 7+ case, not only does the company matching coc are used to get OtterBox is for all of my phones.<br/>But not anymore!<br/>I love this iPhone 7+ case, not only does the company matching colots,  but, it has a stand for easy viewing of my videos.<br/>I am now in advance of Zizo!
 Sturdy, comfortable, love it.
 Love it. Feels very beefy and gives great confidence that nothing will happen if I drop my phone. don't use a belt clip...but it seems very solid, almost to hard to detach phone.....maybe with time and practice it would get easier. Not really a bad thing when you consider the alternative.
 Its very comparable to my old otter case, I really like the kickstand it seems well-made it was a little hard to put in at first but it works just fine, I needed something thin and it is very thin but has little rubber grippers on the back that stick out a little bit which I don’t mind it’s easy to grip
 Fit great. Looks good.
 Very durable!!!
 Case was great, &amp; it arrived as scheduled.<br/><br/>***Problem: the clip for wearing the phone broke after only 1 day!<br/><br/>I rated this product 2 stars as the phone case is good.
 The case itself is great. Feels good in your hand. Looks great. The kickstand doesn't operate well and seems flimsy, so don't expect to get much use out of it. I would have preferred to have a wrist lanyard as opposed to the neck strap. Or maybe include one of each?
 Doesn’t work be great
 It did not fit my phone I’ve though it said it would
 I loved this case on my previous iPhone and decided to get it again when I got the new iPhone 8 plus. Only that it doesn’t fit and seller is refusing to refund me. DO NOT BUY for the 8 plus. The back circle for the Apple logo is not center and cuts off the bottom piece of the logo. I sent the seller pictures and they still claim this case is good from iPhone 6 to 8. Do not buy!
 Best quality case I’ve ever had. A lot of details and functionality built in. Yeah, it’s a little more robust and thicker than some slim cases, but that’s to protect your investment in the phone. So happy I bought a second case for one son and am about to order another for a second son. Buy it.
 Husband loves this case he works a labor job and it’s been amazing the inner case fit the iPhone 8plus a little snug but we stretched it out ! He got the white case and it holds onto dirt but he loves the fit the style and the protection very well made case
 Love it!
 My boyfriend loves this case!! He perfers these over any other!
 This does not work for iPhone 8 Plus. The case barely fits over the phone should should be a good thing but it is so tight that it holds down the lock button and tries to turn the phone off. DO NOT BUY!
 For wait I payed it is terrible it’s doesnt have a front cover it’s really cheap and I ordered a iPhone 8 Plus and got a 6/7 Plus so it don’t fit
 This IPhone 7 plus case  is fantastic, it went on easy and is very durable. A must buy for all IPhone 7plus users, great deal for the right amount of money. Thank you for this great product.
 Awesome case.  I would highly recommend this to anyone. Shipped fast.
 Love the  quality of the case and the style. Fashionable but provides great protection. I love the details of the case. Also comes with belt clip or a clip to wear around neck.
 Instantly liked it the minute I took it out of the box and stick it onto my iPhone 7 Plus. Dropped my phone on purpose a few times just to test it, satisfied with its durability. The kick stand that pops out is also a nice touch. Makes it easier to watch movies or do personal videos.
 The only thing that I did not like was the tempured glass that came with it. It was cheap and always had bubbles that I could not get out. I still have the case and use it all the time!
 My son loves the size of the case and the lanyard accessory but the stand on the back was semi broken when it arrived and later that day broke completely. I can’t very well send it back, since “ Santa” brought it. Just a heads up.
 I am buying this case for a second time. I think the case is real nice looking good colors and durable, except for the kick stand. The kick stand broke in two weeks. Hopefully this one will last longer
 This is a great case.  I have had Otter box and Pelican and this case is just as good as either of them, especially for the price.  It is not water resistant but I have already dropped my phone several times and no damage was caused.  If you are looking for a slim line case that is not bulky but you want good protection for your phone, then this is the case for you.
 Button for turning off phone too stiff to work. Buttons for sound work fine. Otherwise, so far so good. Had to remove the cover on the power button and widen the hole to be able to turn phone off/on. Also, did not receive unit directly from you, lost in mail. Reordered it through amazon.
 since my purchase , I have broken the clip and zizo has honored there product. I can not ask anything more. I'm happy with this product.
 Cute case, slender and the pink color is pretty. The only problem I have with it is the power button doesn't function properly and makes locking the screen difficult. The volume buttons work fine and I assume the case is probably rubbing on it. I've tried to re-adjust the whole case but if you take off the plastic outer case it's a pain to get it back on lol.
 My boyfriend really likes it, it's much better looking in real life. Might want to get another two pack of screen protectors though, because the one that comes with broke pretty easily.
 Love this case - I usually go with Speck because it’s what I know but this case is amazing! Love the built in stand and that the case does not feel bulky or cheap. Slides in:out of my pocket easily but also has a good grip in my hand.
 I bought this case for my granddaughter's new phone.  Her uncle and papa have your cases and like them.  She wanted one of these instead of Otter box. She is very pleased with it
 Words cannot describe on how much I love this case. I will keep it sweet and short. I tend to mess around with music apps on my phone and I create my own mixes from time to time. The built in kickstand allows me to have my phone on me all the time without holding it. With a click of a button I can remix and change tracks easily. I am a fan of these cases because of how protected my phone is from these cases. I bought this case at the perfect timing as well because they were having some sort of a discount on it.
 I keep my phone in my pocket, and work in a high-activity, sometimes wet environment. The case keeps my phone safe
 ★  from JAgomez on January 19, 2017<br/><br/>Not a cover for iPhone 7 plus<br/><br/>Not a case for iPhone 7 plus. It's a 6s plus case relabel. . Does not fits right in an iPhone 7 plus specially around home bottom Also package labeled as for 7s plus but an 7s plus doesn't exist.
 Awesome
 This case is perfect
 I haven't received my 7 Plus yet but had this case for my 6S and love it so ordered one as soon as I ordered the new phone!  The screen protector that is included is great as well!  Price is reasonable and quality is top notch!
 Case is very nice. Clip broke on the second day getting into car. Now trying Trianium case with clip for 2 weeks now with much more  success .
 Love the texture and how sturdy the case feels! I like that it comes with options like the lanyard, tempered glass, and kickstand. Seems like with everyone else you just get a name.
 I usually do not write reviews, but this product did not last! Not as described at all broke in just 4 weeks
 Keeps my phone safe, and I really mean it.  My phone has suffered several strong drops and this case has protected it.
 PURCHASED TWICE SAME DEFECTIVE POWER BUTTON!!!  JUNK DO NOT BUY FROM THESE GUYS  THE RUBBER MODLDING IS DEFECTIVE AND IT DOES NOT PUSH IN TO TURN OFF YOUR SCREEN AND HOLDS YOUR POWER BUTTON ON ALL THE TIME SO IT WANTS TO SHUT DOWN.  WASTE OF MONEY NOW i HAVE 2 IN THE GARBAGE.
 I really liked the case when arrived, looks great, felt great in my hands.  But as I laid down in bed the belt clip broke, definitely a durability issue when that happens.  Hoping the company replaces it otherwise it's a definite no more purchasing this product.
 Fit the case. Great price but when I added my phone to it the front was just straight open screen the tempered glass they provided was nice but didn't really give it any protection.
 El protector de pantalla se está levantando. Precio alto para la calidad.
 Great product.  We just bought new phones and have been looking around for a reliable cover, these fit them so well .  Easy to carry and protects well.
 I really like the stability and design of the case. The functionality is where this disappointed me. The button over the power button does not work. It is too hard and not flexible enough to allow me to use the power/lock button on my phone. If you have an IPhone 7 Plus, you should be aware of this before you buy this case. I can not lock my screen or power off my phone with the case on it because of this design flaw.
 Niiiiiiiiicccceee!!!
 Perfect for my needs...nice value for my money.
 Didn't matter how I placed my iPhone 7 Plus in this case, it would either turn the volume up or down or reset the phone by holding the power buttom down.
 Poor kickstand design. Support fell out when first opened. Plastic features to hold support in place were broken off. Material is also very stiff not sure if it would assist in absorbing the shock from a fall. Poor fit around the perimeter of the phone well.
 Fits like glove with my Iphone 7 plus. Tempered glass is a nice touch. I am very pleased.
 Shipped fast, like the feel and fit of the cover, as well as the “kickstand” should work well to protect the iPhone 7 plus
 First one came in the screen protector was broken!  I put my phone in the case and I could not use my phone what so ever!  None of the buttons would work on my new iPhone 7 plus!  I sent it back and ordered another one!  Case works good.  I kind of feels like it's going to fall out of your hand. The screen protector is falling off.
 The case itself is fine but the glass cover that they send you to protect the front of your phone sucked it was scratched
 This is my second one
 Durable yet sleek, I love it.
 I like the design of the case, however, the screen cover that came with it was cracked pretty good so I could not use it.  I bought this for my husband and was in need of a cover quick which is why I did not return it.  A little disappointed that a new product was sent damaged.
 While the case appears to be well designed and is very protective, it's clip-on holster is far less so.<br/>I've broke two in the space of two months - rendering the utility of the holster worthless.
 I really like the case although I haven't had it for to long now.  It seems pretty strong.  The only complaint I have is that the screen protector cracked as soon as I placed it on my screen.  Maybe giving two instead of one or maybe making a little stronger would help.
 Super disappointed with the color. Not even close to this pretty blue color. More like navy blue. We will use it for now, but definitely getting something else.
 This case is a horrible fit!!! It presses on the volume buttons and sometimes the button to turn phone off on the right works and most of the time it doesn’t! The apple emblem on the back is not lined up with the case!!!! Not worth the money and now I have to get another case because I’m sure it will ruin my new iPhone 8 Plus because of pressing on those buttons😡😡
 Powerful protection for my phone. The only thing I dislike about it is the hardness of the material. I wish it were a more pliable material. But that being said, it is an excellent protective case and it looks good to boot!
 One of the best cases I've ever owned.
 I love the look and feel of the case, however as noted in several other reviews, the power button does not work properly once the phone is inside the case. I tried to put it on several ways, and was unable to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Also the provided screen protector does not have the tabs to properly align it with the screen.<br/><br/>Although I really like the concept of this case, the functionality is severely impacted by the inoperable power button once the case is installed. I have no choice but to return the case.
 If I could give this case no stars I would. The clip broke within 5 minutes of wearing and the side buttons do not work at all. Power button and volume buttons. I will be returning this product !
 It can with an lanyard  witch was pretty great an it's not three piece  case like a outter box like is shows in some of the pictures. The case just slips on to the phone.
 send back would not fit phone right
 Works great.  Easy to use.  Now when i use my Waze app I feel like an Uber driver
 Ordered this in the desert color. Great quality. Probably my favorite iPhone case so far.
 Product arrived broken and cracked. Materials seem cheap. Product also did not come with the tempered glass that was supposed to be included with the purchase of this item.
 I purchased this in December 2017. Great size for my iPhone 7+.  Down side I dropped my phone from about 3 feet to a concrete floor. My screen shattered. I also had a screen protector on and the case saved the screen protector but not my screen. Going back to otter box
 Sttong material but too strong I couldn’t even lock my phone or use the buttons because the plastic is too hard
 Excellent protection to iPhone
 Very pleased with the style looks very sturdy, not sure about durability as of yet since I just received it.  Co-workers said only problem they had was the clip holding phone breaks very easily
 I’m very happy with this case.  Easy to hold onto.
 The case wouldn't work the power button or silence button like it should. I returned the case. The seller excepted the case back and had excellent service.
 I had to buy her twice for I gave the first one to my brother I love this product
 The case is too thick around the volume and power buttons for easy activation.  Also, the mute switch is too deep to use with your finger.
 There are a lot of heavy duty parts that I like about your case and some that I don't I have an iphone7 plus and the cover over the power button would not work until I notified it some and on the belt clip the steel pin of the hinge came halfway out the first time I wore it
 Works great and good styling
 Love my cover, have used over a year!
 I bought the case for iPhone 7 pluse, really like the military color and that it came with a temper glass. I have not drop my phone so I can't say that it holds up but it does look and feel strong . The case came with a belt clip but that wants that greats, it's ok because I don't use the belt clip . Overall I would recommend it
 The case fit as described, its nice and tight around the phone. The provided screen protector is good quality and went on with ease.  The built in kick stand is height/angle adjustable and is a cool feature.I only rated this less than a five because the caring case(the hip/belt clip) is weak. I'm a little ruff on things but I broke the belt clip in two days......other than that I would recommend the case.
 This a iphone 6Plus rebranded case. Does not fit on phone easily due to size differences.  Zizo is misleading the customers by saying its designed for 8 Plus. Cheating is bad business
 Great phone protection, but the fold-out-stand on the back broke after a few times of gentle use.
 Absolutely great! Fits perfectly, screen protector is perfect, a great value! Recommend it to friends! Easy to find and truly protects iPhone!
 It's Bad Ass I got it on my IPhone now and it's tight... Cell are very expensive so it's only the right thing to do is protect your investment!!!
 Looks great, fits correctly.  But the stand never held phone up securely and it broke immediately.
 Screen protector is NOT glass, it is plastic, glass does not bend. the belt clip is cheap
 Works great so far.
 Case fit perfectly.  I have dropped it several times.  No damage to the phone.  Feels a little cheaply made, but does what it is supposed to do.  Keeps the phone dust and dirt free.
 purchased for my husband. he love it. very nice and have a clip for him not to carry in his pocket. he love it.
 Looked like a nice case, but after having it just one day, the clip that attaches on the back broke.  Guess the quality of it was not as expected.
 Excellent solid case.  Color was off as I expected red it is a marron.  It has a tight fit that I had to work to get over the power button but once one - can’t be happier
 Love the way it looks. Wears fast, color rubs off if u look at it to hardl.
 Case is decent, but it’s not good to advertise a kickstand that breaks even with carpet impact. Will be returning this sadly.
 I'm generally very careful when handling my phone. But sometimes it just falls. The case has protected it just like advertised...and it looks cool.
 After only 2 weeks with this case the rear kick stand won’t stay closed, its a feature of the case I don’t use often and it’s already broken.
 Had to use a razor blade to cut the silicone button covers off. Couldn’t use volume buttons or power button. Would definitely been a 5 start review if I didn’t have to cut to let my phone work properly!
 Clip broke off the back. Other than that it’s pretty good.
 Sturdy and very nice color.  Very little grip. Slides easily on flat surfaces
 looks great and seems very durable.
 Do not get the color cases the turn black with normal ware and tear. Only buy the Black. Also your warrentee is only 30 days so keep that in mind. Update today the kick stand came apart really poor quality.
 I’ve had this case for 4 months now. I love the product style. I’ve dropped my phone probably 6 times in the 4 months I’ve had this product and it still look brand new! No scratches and damages. The stand in the back is still intact. I’m only now giving my review because I wanted to test the product and not give my review a week after I got it.
 Love this case! Looks great and very durable.
 Phone Case is strong other than the stand, didn’t have the case for 2 months and the clip that holds the stand out broke while just opening the stand up, if your looking for a phone case to have a stand with it, this probably isnt the one for you.
 I am definitely impressed about the quality of this case .<br/><br/>Haven’t heard about this brand before and I was sceptical before placing an order ,<br/><br/>It has been few days I am using this case . I would definitely recommend for someone who is looking for a hard
 The case is nice and solid however....  the power button will only allow me to power down the phone. It is way to hard of a button. Plus since putting the tempered glass protector on my home button rarely works to open my phone. Plus once I'm in a window I can not always get out of that window. Very frustrated with this product. And I bought one for my husband too. '
 The case itself feels solid and fits well. However, I've been through 3 glass screen protectors so far because the case is so snug that putting it on causes one side or the other to bubble. Kinda frustrating.
 I love this product. Definitely built to last!
 Great case, strong, easy setup. Only problem I encountered was the on and off button on the upper right side, (will not work when I push on it) I don't know if it is a manufacturing problem or only on this case
 I bought this case for my husband. He is constantly dropping his phone and I needed something that was durable. The case itself is great but the clip is cheap and it already broke.
 Fit perfect and good quality also has screen protector great deal for the money
 The first time I ordered this I was sent the wrong color though it was super easy to return.  I reordered and got the correct color.  The case is nice but I was disappointed in the color.  The photos show it as a silver metal color but the actual product is a mat grey color.  Wish the color was more of the silver metal look.
 Price and quality was great.
 Very nice and solid...so far this is the best case I ve bought for my I phone 7plus...highly recommend this
 I really like the case and the clip. I only have one concern which is the reason for only 2 stars. I am having trouble lining up the power button of phone to work at all times with the case power button?  The volume buttons work fine but the case power button won't access the phone power button at all times and sometimes just randomly which is a cause for possible battery power lose. I would love to give it a 5 star rating with some help or suggestions for this issue.
 I wish I could give this case a zero. What is that goofy thing on the corner? A "lanyard" attachment? Really? What kind of ridiculous nerd-ism is this? Don't support this jackassery. The Samsung S8 Bolt doesn't have this "feature". Preserve your dignity and buy a grown up case.
 I like the slim plan of the case , but if you wear phone on your right side the phone comes out upside down and can not be changed. NOT FOR right handed people! ! ! !<br/>Phone can only go in belt clip one way FLAW in design.
 Power switch inaccessible through the case as the plastic was too stiff, rendering the case useless.  Do not recommend.
 Seems fine for the price. It’s as advertised.
 The cover works well but the screen protector was not. Broke easily.
 I liked it on my se and now on my 6 plus. Would be nice to have voice out like the otter box pursuit . But will buy again for my ,when I get the x.
 Excellent case! Love it. Have purchased the black and gold ones. Will buy a red one next!!! Very durable and slim!!
 So far I like it. Feels very sturdy. Buttons are easy to use and are not obstructed at all. The kick stand is nice. One problem I had was when I took it out of the manufacturers packing the belt clip broke. The little plastic clip that holds the holder to the clip simply snapped. I fixed with super glue :) and it is holding just fine. I would buy again though.
 Would have been awesome if it didnt screw up my phone's on/off button.  Everything you've read in other 1 star reviews is true.
 What I didn’t like is the case didn’t cover the entire phone like the outta box does. I didn’t notice it or see that before I ordered them. That’s wut I didn’t like.
 It’s perfect!
 Broken from regular use after less than a month!
 It's ok. The screen protector doesn't stick all the way to the edges and the kick stand in the back broke after 2 days, and that was light use. It looks good and color is nice.
 Finally case that actually works to protect your phone  I do a lot of outdoor activities camping, fishing, bow hunting in this case will protect it if it's dropped or lost
 I ordered two cases before for my iPhone 7 Plus and they did not work however customer service are great. They reached out to me and they send me a third one for free  which works.  it's a very good project product.
 Love it
 If you are looking for a great quality case reasonably priced, then look no further.  I love all the features, the kick stand to watch videos, the hard case that clips to you waist when jogging and even the string that I hang around my neck.
 Clip broke on 2nd day of use. Good looking case but 0 Stars
 I am unable to use this cover on my iPhone 7 plus because the outer cover pushes on the sleep/ off button ant makes it unusable. Causes me to screenshot everything when I push the home button because it's always putting pressure on the sleep button. Does not fit my phone. Like the outer cover is too small.
 My son picked this out for his new phone, and loves it. It is hardy, and looks good.
 I’ve had this case for a week. Dropped it from less than 3 feet. My phone is cracked. This is not a durable case, nor does it protect from drops and falls like the reviews claimed
 Luv the case!!
 Great
 Holds up good so far. Haven’t drop test it but I think it will be good.
 I love this case! It is very sturdy, lightweight, not bulky and provides the protection I was looking for.  I took a star off only because the tempered glass screen protector does not fully cover all of the glass, there is about a quarter inch gap all the way around. I'm sure it would be still be great protection,but I didn't like the way it looked so I didn't use it. Other than that I think it's a great case for the price.
 If fits perfect, I click in place except on ONE position only.  In addition, it only lasts me 5 months.  I wear it daily on my belt, and the corners broke and so, I need to find a replacement for the holder only. So once it is broken i have to buy a new entire cover and holder, and for that reason, I can only give 3 stars.
 Unable to use, returned. Tried case with phone, case depresses the power button continuously so that it is rendered useless. The phone just turns on and off as a result.
 Like my last one, it is a great case in so many colors.
 Best phone case next to Ballistic that I have used.  Love it!
 seems so delicate, wanted something that i could grip better, this kid of slips out of my hand.  thought i would have more a tough rubber feel
 The fit and detail was perfect. I liked the ruggedness of the case best. The only thing I would change would be the side of the loop for the strap. If you are right handed, you have flip the phone to insert it into the belt holder. I would highly recommend this product.
 I’ve had this case for a few months now, and have dropped my phone several times and it’s still just as great as if it were in a otter box!
 We purchased on August 17 and the screen has already cracked August 25. Don't wast your money!
 Got this one a while back, Love it, Looks and protects my Apple 7 Plus perfect. Thanks
 I like the case but the screen protector had a chip the second day it was on my phone. I hadn’t dropped it, set anything on it or anything. There is no reason for it to have damage. I think the screen protector I had on for two years was flawless still and better quality.
 This case is so awesome! I bought it for my husband it comes with a lanyard he loves that it came with that he wears it around his neck and has been getting many compliments on it. Very fashionable as well.
 I was first attracted to the case because of the way it looked. Upon receiving the case, I can say that I am very satisfied. It definitely did not disappoint. I highly recommend it to protect your new iPhone 7 and 7 plus.
 When it arrived it was cracked, the stand was missing. I'm really unhappy with this product
 Great my wife picked out this color and no problems or complaints from her.
 This case hasn't even lasted two weeks and is already broken. Now I have to figure out how to send it back
 Very happy!  This is the second one I purchased and I love it.
 The I Phone 7 plus is so big that its very uncomfortable to carry on your hip. I have bought 4 cases &amp; consider this case is the best for me. Not only is the design better this case its not as big as all the other cases I've tried. The price is also better than other leading mfg. case. I'm thinking about buying other colors in this style. Thanks, SMN
 Love it so sturdy and nice looking
 THis cover is too hard for iphone 7 plus. It is beautiful but too hard. Turn on/off button do not work because of thw cover being to hard.
 Got it for my husband brother he loves it well buy again 😉
 I think that it's indestructible .A great case for less than 20 dollars.
 Fits perfectly to the iPhone 8 plus. Notch on top for a lanyard is a little annoying due to its sticking out. Kick stand is flimsy. Broke off after a week. Dust collects around all openings. Recommend taking it off weekly to clean the phone off.
 Fit wasn’t great but it works
 Hubby loves this case. It’s masculine and protects his phone very well.
 Love this phone case, it is well built seems sturdy and it came with a screen protector
 Dislike the quality of the kickstand! It is already broken! I have had it 3 days! Very specific way to use the clip...only one option
 Amazing snug fit for my iPhone 7 Plus and it fits my iPhone 6 plus just as well.
 Great product
 A++++++
 I like the feel, multi use, and protection the Zizo gives. It was a tad difficult to get on my phone but once I figured out an easier way to get it on over my phone buttons I loved it
 Wife likes it looks exactly like picture
 The over all feel and shape of it literally the best case I have had first few hrs I had it I dropped it an it slid down the driveway a bit and nothing was wrong with it at all it’s great and I highly suggest it to anyone looking for a awesome case.
 The case looks and feels great. Awesome that it came with a screen protector too. But today the first day I’ve had it in my phone the outside plastic piece has already broke on me. Very disappointed about that especially since it says drop tested. The phone hasn’t been dropped it’s been in my pocket.
 Sturdy product and provides great protection!!
 I have received nothing for this review. I have had many phone cases over the years but none come close to this one for the price. I've paid 3 times the price for cases and didn't get as much protection. The screen protection alone is worth the price. Doesn't add as much bulk as most other cases built the same way. Swivel belt clip and built in stand on case and holster.<br/><br/>A lot of thought went into this case worth every penny.
 I first bought a Zizo for my IPhone 6+ and loved it.  When I upgraded to the IPhone 7+, it wasn't even a question when deciding on a case to protect it.  Being a first responder, my phone has taken a beating through the years but has always been protected with Zizo.  I've never had any damages or issues with the quality.  I plan on using their product for many years to come.
 The case is a nice design. However, the kickstand is difficult to release. Be careful doing this as you can easily hurt your fingers/nails trying to pry it open. I suggest using a tool or cloth to create a barrier if possible.<br/><br/>This review would have been higher if the tempered glass fit the iPhone 7 Plus. For some reason, they shipped a tempered glass for the size of an iPhone 4. Would it be possible to ship the correct size???
 Great looking and sturdy. They could probably save some money and leave off the lanyard part. I wish that the case could connect to the holsters from either side.
 It's a good case.  A bit hard to take the kick stand out but it does the job.  Wish it was a bit lighter, kind of heavy.
 Terrible. Wanted it for the clip. First time used the swivel broke. Cheap construction.
 Material on the back is slippery.<br/>Plastic cover is hard to put over the rubber piece.
 Should have listened to to the reviews. NOT FOR IPHONE 8 PLUS. Scammers. Also, glass cover screen protector that came with it is useless, big bubbles near bottom of screen.
 Used daily
 I like the idea that it fits IPhone 8plus. Wish the the screen was closed in cause I’m not that putting on the screen protectors 😋 I like the way it feels in my hands it looks great and unusual. I look forward to it protecting my phone for a long time
 Arrived on time.  Very simple to utilize.  So far so good.  Looks like it will be a sturdy, protective case and for half the price of an otter box.
 Its awesome!  The stand works and its pretty sturdy.  The case is easy to hang on to and doesn't snag on my pockets.  Doubt I'll use the belt clip thing but it works good too.
 Nice case. Doesn’t fit iPhone 8. Apple icon doesn’t line up and side volume buttons were unusable due to the bad line up. Have to return
 Arrived fast and as advertised. No issues at this point and don’t foresee any.
 works great
 Great product no problem with shipping. Very smooth.
 The glass protector doesn’t fit to the edge of the case. It leaves a gap. This may not be a problem to some, but I’m kind of picky. I also don’t like the corner at the top for the lanyard. Kind of sticks out making the phone not symmetrical.
 Awesome case, love the design!! The shade of red was exactly what I was looking for!! The tempered glass screen protector was a nice bonus. Thanks Zizo!!
 This case is not good for someone who needs a magnet for a car mount
 I purchased the product because of the color, which looked like a burnt orange similar to the university of Texas color.  However, the phone is an unsightly neon orange color that may speak to some, but is quite different to the way it’s presented online...
 My first Zizo Bolt case took a beating and lasted 2 years. When it was time for a new case the only question I had to ask myself was: what color Bolt to get this time.
 Excited about this process. Glass cover went on in a flash. Pretty rugged case. I like the way it looks and feels. Very tight fit. I travel all over the country and have to “Toss” my electronics into a bin to be scanned at the airport frequently. The lanyard is kinda funny. I liked it too.
 not designed exactly with iPhone 7 plus in mind. poor design
 Good size and appearance
 Made from a cheaper type plastic than the otter box... the belt clip broke as I was putting my phone in it right after I took it out of the box... on the plus side it did come with a protective screen that could be used separate from the case... so I bought a 20 dollar protective screen... not recommended at all
 I bought this as a gift for my father and we were both very disappointed. The buttons on the phone and case don't line up so my dad couldn't lock his phone. He ended up cutting out the side button so he can lock his phone for now, but we have ordered a different case. I would not recommend this product. Also, the screen protector broke seconds after we removed it from the package.
 I bought the same type of case for my work phone and I love it!! The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is it was a bear to get onto my new phone. I love the “kick stand” and how secure it is on my phone.
 Case is great, the lanyard and lanyard hoop are kinda goofy and I’m not crazy about the screen protector as it doesn’t fit my iPhone 7plus well.
 My phone screen broke my phone fell from 2 1/2 feet and it cracked I need to fix it now what are you guys going to do
 Very sturdy and protective!
 I love the color but wasn't able to use my phone in the case. It was really hard getting my phone in and out the case.  Maybe it's me.
 My second zizo bolt case. I have one or my iPhone 6. Liked it so much I ordered one for the iphone 7+ I ordered. I work in agriculture so I am rough on my phone the zizo case has held up better than anything I've used before. 5 stars easy!!
 Case for well, but Outerbox cases I've had in the past were better.  Screen is a stick on and doesn't offer protection I expected.
 I decided to give the Zizo iPhone 7plus case one more try. A few weeks after purchasing my first case, the belt clip broke. I couldn't find a belt clip replacement available so I just ordered a new complete case because it is a good value overall. I like the case but if it breaks again there won't be a 3rd time.
 Love the slim fit it’s comfortable in your hand not bulky.. have dropped phone on concrete several times since having it and it’s protected phone nicely will def buy again
 OK does the job
 We ordered a second one and now the second cracked the second day we had it...... very disappointing I will be reaching out for a refund or a better quality case.
 Great product.  Bought this for my husband.  He loves the color cause it is easier to see and really stands out.  The case is rugged enough to withstand the beating he give his phone when he is out on a job site.  Definitely would buy this again.
 I have one other case that I really like now I have two different colored cases ,the stand and belt clip plus protection<br/>they  offer , thanks for a great product.
 I really liked this case at first glance and it really does catch the eye. However it isn't do perfect...the only issue which is a pretty big one is that the power button won't work while the case is on unless it's sitting just right in the case... huge inconvenience and unfortunately am forced to return the item. Am hoping they will send another to try because i really do like the case if only it worked
 Stand cane broken in 3 pieces right out of box
 One of the best phone cases ever.  Dropped it about twice and no damage to my phone what so ever.  Highly recommend this product.  Just wish it had more colors.
 Not the greatest material quality. Sides started to crack and break off right away. The glass screen protector also cracks easily. It’s a good looking case, but isn’t the best overall quality.
 The case arrived on time and in good shape. The case fits perfectly and the glass screen protector is excellent. It even comes with a lanyard and loop to further secure your phone. Excellent purchase.
 Yes I like this case very much this is my third one<br/>I’m ruff with it but it protects my phone very well
 This case is great,  the colors are brilliant the case fits really good, a little hard to put at first, it feels good in my hand
 My husband loves the case . This one is strong and it's not thick and bulky like all the other ones he has had in the past . His phone fits in his pocket with the case on . The phone clip is a nice option on the job when he needs to have easy access to his phone. Also not bulky like other clips and durable like the phone case.
 Love the case and belt clip, but the screen protector would not stick to my screen. Do t know what to do about making it stick.
 Still on my phone today
 This is the 2nd case I bought. Both of them broke within weeks of purchase. The plastic clip to hold the phone in case is made cheaply.
 Love the case. Fits perfectly and that littglip down flap is a plus when gaming.
 So Far so good! I think the case is solid and durable as compared to the more expensive ones on the market, Will have to reserve judgement on the screen protector, but I think it will hold up well
 I liked this case it looked great felt but my power and volume controls didn’t work on the iPhone 8+.
 Didn't fit...
 The case is fantastic !!!! Meets and exceeds my needs.  My recommendation would to be have a lanyard such as a sports lanyard in the package . I understand the purpose of but for us running and walking types larger lanyard is a must .
 Slick , smooth case , easy application , screen protector included.  You won’t be disappointed , not bulky at all .  Why spend all that money when you can get this stylish case for under 20 bucks
 This case is not engineered properly for the 7plus. Package says 7S plus which isn't right. Seems as though it's a 6s plus case being sold for 7plus. The right power /Lock button goes off by itself as the case is too tight to fit the iphone 7S Plus. The ringer keys also goes off by itself..it seems to get stuck .. the case definitely is not right for 7S plus it just keeps attempting to power the phone down.
 I bought this case for my iPhone 7plus.  I like the design; however, when I installed on phone I noticed that the turn off button on right does not work and the case is too hard.  I wish I could return it; however, I tossed the boss.  It is not working on my phone.  Overall the rubber is way too hard for the buttons to function properly.
 Great item
 Great case/cover
 Cheap kickstand material. The piece that allows the mechanism of opening and closing the kick stand is very flimsy. The tempered glass and presentation of overall product looks great but the the quality... not so great.
 This is my 4th time buying this case, 3 for me and I gifted one👍
 Terrible voice clarity to recipients.  Had to trim off rubber above the mic.  No complaints from voice recipients after modification.<br/><br/>Product no longer under warranty after the mod but, I'm ok with that.  It was 16 bucks. Will shop elsewhere for the next one.
 This is a really nice phone case. I feel confident that it will protect my phone. I do wish that the stand would work both ways, it only works for a side view. Very good price.
 The little kick stand sopport bar broke the first day I had the case.  Today the rest of the kick stand broke off.
 Durable . Would buy again
 Fits the Iphone 8 plus perfectly, although the logo hole is a little off. Very durable
 Phone case is really tough. I had to take the black casing off of the green to put my phone in (only because I didn't want to cause damage to my phone). The stand is a bit tough to open at first, but eventually it became easier to open. Overall great buy! Tampered glass was good quality, packaging was done very well. I would recommend this to anyone who has daily activities that might cause damage to their phone. It is a very tough case.
 My cell phone fell off the roof of my wife's car is more driving 40 miles an hour.<br/> Phone was destroyed but the cage  was as good as like new.
 Just what I have been looking for.  Versatile!
 I was excited to find a case in the colors my boyfriend wanted but disappointed when I received it and it said it fit an IPhone 7. So stoked to discover it fit the 8 perfectly! Great case for people who like dropping their phones : )
 Kick stand is near impossible to pop out unless you keep tools on your person at all times but otherwise a pretty solid case
 Fits great, looks great! Just bought another one for my son.
 Pretty case, but buttons do not function once phone is installed. Tried repeated reinstallations of the phone.  Buttons do not apply pressure properly to the iPhone 8 Plus. Case is useless without function.  Product returned.
 Great price and product. Same quality than the overprice Best Buy accessories.
 Have problems with shutting off the phone., Had to remove the phone from the case every time. Not happy.
 My review is for the holster as it is broken!
 Doesn't work well with iPhone 7 plus it keeps taking screen shots or wanting to power off due to the right upper side button is being activated. It's either a bad mold when the case was made or a definition in the proper size and placement of the buttons on the case.
 Mi case se rompió, no tienen la calidad requerida para proteger los celulares. No duran mucho tiempo ni resisten por lo que no recomiendo que los compren.
 This case is not engineered properly for the 7plus. Package says 7S plus which isn't right. Seems as though it's a 6s plus case being sold for 7plus. The right power button won't work. Sometimes it seems to get stuck and attempts to power the phone down. I'm sending this back.
 I love my ZiZo Bolt 4 iPhone 7+. The case makes it easier to hold the Jet Black case. I had the iPhone for about 2 weeks, dropping it a few times. After seeing the Bolt for a 7+ with its drop protection &amp; double checking the  dimensions, I ordered it from Amazon. The case fits perfectly! I am very satisfied!
 This is a very well made case. It fits excellent and protects my phone very well. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a lot of protectiin
 Purchased this case for my husband and he loves it. It is a great color and light. Likes the stand on back to hold phone up while watching Netflix and YouTube. Great product!!
 I have the desert beige one too and it is great. I recently got the orange one recently and the plastic is brittle. It just breaks apart like defective plastic or something.
 I love my new case. I just wish it had a cut out for the camera. I have to take he case off, in order to take a picture. Otherwise, it's very durable!
 The lanyard clip on top is a real deal breaker for me, its wayyyyy bigger than it looks in the pics and very annoying.
 Husband loved it! Very sturdy and easy to put together!
 I dropped my phone after using this case for one month.  The entire bottom section immediately broke off.  Not even close to what I would expect from ‘military grade’.  Will not recommend nor repurchase.
 Have always liked the product
 I love the case because it's not bulky, the only thing I wish it was clip able on both sides because I'm left handed, that's why it didn't get five stars.
 Doesn't fit properly.  The upper part of the shell won't stay snug against the inner part. Bows out. I don't feel it is secure if it cannot fit snugly.
 Didn’t think I would like it. I ended up loving it
 what more can I say?  It does what it does and looks nice.
 Excelente cover de celular. Compré uno hace algunos meses y recién la semana pasada compré otro para mi hija.
 Ok
 Great Product and very durable
 Would buy again.
 I gave it as a gift and he liked the thing it has on the side that he could use with the lanyard to hang on his neck. Overall it’s a nice product, it looks nice and of good quality.
 good case for the price.
 This phone case sucks they broke so easily wast of money
 Had this for the Iphone 6 and had to get one for my Iphone 7. Love these cases
 Love it - it does exactly what it says it will. The cover is easy to remove if I need a slimmer profile. I would definitely recommend this case.
 This is an awesome case
 Been six months and the case (and phone) are holding up well. Spend a lot of time in the field with this... much of the time around water. Super quality construction and fee.
 Kickstand broke within 24 hours and side of case near volume button broke a week letter.  All this with my phone never dropping.
 Really nice case.  So far so good.  Very tight.  Nice protection.  Love the kickstand
 I like the case. However I did have some issues with the rubber button lining up with the lock button on my IPhone 8 Plus. I need the case for my new phone so I had to make a small cut to get the button to line up correctly and work correctly.
 Case looks good and has a nice feel. However, when i got mine on, the power button on the right side wasn't able to be clicked no matter how hard or soft i pressed. I tried manuvering the case to see if it was just an alignment issue but that didn't help. Maybe it's just a few select cases having this issue but it does basically ruin the functionality of the case.
 Didn’t fit my 8plus at all. Buttons didn’t work. Just too small. I’m sure you knew that. Looked cool. But it took me forever to put it on. Got another brand and it went on in a second. Would try Zizo again but was disappointed that you didn’t advertise it correctly. So I won’t.
 Don't buy.
 I did not receive the tempered glass screen protector that came with it. Someone has already used this case as the inside grey piece has all the buttons cut out. Now I will not be able to turn my phone on and off or use the volume controls. I am highly disappointed.
 Love the case. Nice slim design with good grip. Only issue was the kickstand was already broken when it came out of the box. I don’t use it so I don’t care. All buttons work great. Camera opening has plenty of clearance. Nice case overall.
 The kick stand broke within a month of use<br/>Do not buy this manufacturer product
 Fit iPhone 8 Plus. Very durable. Like that it has a way to attach it to belt. Very pleased with purchase.
 All 5 star reviews on this case is a lie. Does not fit the phone. As you put it in, the case constantly holds done the lock button and wants to turn it off. There is a cut out in the bottom of the case for a headphone jack that doesn't exist. The case its self feels extremely cheap and I don't believe it would protect the phone personally. Make sure you read reviews people because this is a lesson learned for me
 Case was nice but when phone was placed in case, the phone would cut off or take photos by itself. Sometimes the screen would go crazy. Apple advised me it's the buttons on the case and it lays on the edge of touch screen and causes these issues. Just a heads up...
 I have never been more disappointed with a purchase.  This is definitely NOT military grade!  I spent 20 years in the Army and never had an item break in he first five minutes.  I simply rotated the clip to change the orientation and I snapped off.  Superglued it and it broke off again.
 On receiving the case it was apparent there was a defect. Contacted Zizo via Amazon and got a quick response. A quick pic of problem and a couple emails and a replacement was on its way. Case has good fit and features-no complaints here.
 LOVE IT
 Perfect!
 I have dropped my iPhone 8 several times now in this case and so far no cracks or scratches. This case is very sturdy and looks cool too. I will say that it’s a pain to put on because the plastic shell is tough.
 My husband really likes the case. It wasn’t supposed to ship until the 13 but it shipped early and he just got it today.
 I was kind of skeptical about this product at first but when I received it it totally changed my mind. The product is made of good quality material and very study. I have bought others cases but this one takes number one spot. I’m very satisfied with my purchase and will recommend to family and friends
 I got this case for my dad when the iphone 7 plus was released.  For the past couple of months it seemed to protect the phone just fine.  Yesterday my dad takes his phone out of his vest pocket and the tempered screen is cracked as is the actual iphone screen.  The phone will not turn on and I am now waiting for my appointment with the Genius Bar.  I do not recommend this product.
 Phone case is good... clip is terrible quality! I have had this for about 2 weeks and it has already snapped a piece off when taking my phone out. I would not recommend unless you want just for the case itself.
 It looks exactly like the picture and fit the iPhone 7 plus, but none of the phone buttons worked after I put the case on. I couldn't turn the phone off or on and the volume buttons didn't work. Returning item.
 Very good product, very good design. one minor complain is that it's too tight and tends to squeeze on the buttons of the Iphone 7 plus.
 This case is by far one of the toughest cases I've purchased  precise ports, kickstand and tempered glass screen protector. Great value thanks Zizo!
 First it will not let me use the power button, the button on the case is really stiff, and it messes with the phone. Another thing the case is turning yellow, got the white one. Like the look of the case and seems very protective plus like the belt clip but the power button deal cancels all that out.
 The clip for the stand broke right away,  one on the phone.
 This is a great case and I would definitely buy another, but I have had it only a few months and I only use the kick a couple times a week and it's already broke. I would definitely look at a different case with a better kick stand if you are always using it.
 I got this for my iPhone 7 plus
 👍
 Provides nice protection , have used for few months but too bulky.
 I’ve had this on my phone for 2 days. Not a good fit at all. Sliding piece inside kickstand broke on the first day. Outside case pulling away from liner in top corner. Not worth the $18 I spent.
 This is a great case. The only problem I had was the protect glass was not clean so there is some dust between the glass and my phone. As far as the case goes, I really like it.
 Just as other users have stated, this is clearly an iPhone 6+ case re-branded/repackaged for the 7+. And like the others the mold around the power button in the inside of the case is too large and constantly wants to power the phone off...very annoying. I'm going to attempt to sand the inside of the case with a Dremmel and see if that helps...will post an uodate once I give it a try.
 Only two things keeping me from giving this cases five star. One is I'd loose the lanyard loop so I could put my phone in the holster both ways. Second is the volume and lock bottoms don't click, they work fine but if they had more of a click I would be so much more happy with this case. Keep up the great work!
 I first rated this a 5star. Dropped it once and the back broke!
 I bought the Zizo case after reading the reviews.  It lives up to the hype.  It is slim but sturdy.  It's got a great grip and the red color is perfect for me.  Price is right, too.  My grandson was impressed and now wants one also.
 Although the upright on the back is very flimsy it works. I love the color and it has protected my phone in the work place when dropped multiple times.
 Love, love, love!  Tough and rugged but cute.  The clip is a nice touch.
 Love it!
 Fitment too tight on the right power button, cause the power button to push in and always stay pushed in. So I can’t even power down my iPhone when case is on.
 Love the case. Very comfortable in your hand, good grip. But, the belt clip broke second day I had it. Still would recommend.
 With the case on my new phone it caused it to do a lot of crazy stuff, such as when you tried to access the app it would take a picture if the wallpaper that came on the phone. When you tried to swipe the incoming call it would not work, pushing an app to open it would take a picture, would not let me make phone calls, I has been nothing but a headache since I received it.
 Great protection without making it to bulky. Comes with screen protector as an added bonus!!!!
 The case fit my iPhone 8 Plus very well.
 I love the quality of my new ZIZO phone case protector, and the price cannot be beat! If you want a great heavy duty phone case this is the one to get.! The only thing I would change is to make the kick stand work  horizontally or vertically.
 This is the cheapest looking case I have ever seen.  I have spent less than this and gotten products I would recommend highly.
 Seems heavy duty! Only issues was with screen protector. Seemed little off, so i tried to remove it and fix it and it got few pieces of debris under it. So it’s useless now. Other than that the case works great!
 I am not satisfied with this product. It has already cracked on the side and the stand snapped off.
 It's really strong 💪🏾 and cool 😎 looking the only thing is, that is hard to take off the phone 📱 and also the little leg in the back that hold the phone so you can watch a video, is too hard to detach from the case. But overall for the price is actually a very well made product 👍
 Can't use this case. Does not work on 7 plus. Black clip on is not aligned correctly and the case also keeps buttons pushed in making it impossible to use phone. Peice of crap.
 This is the best cell phone case I've ever owned.  The price is perfect.  Well made, fits perfecting on my iPhone 7Plus and the cover with kickstand is just bonus.  I could not be happier.  Plus, it's so cool looking.
 The stand broke in less than a week.
 This case is awesome.  It came quickly, it's rugged, included the glass protector and clip.  I ordered this for my fiancée and he loved it!  I would definitely recommend this case.  Great price too!!
 I return it same day because it has strap like old camera
 Its a pretty nice case and it arrived on time. Not perfect however. The power button on the case was formed too close to the phone so it kept the power button pressed. Just shave it down with a knife and it’s fine though. Also the case messes with ipone’s 3d touch system. But that is a common problem so i can’t fault them for that
 I love the case and it's very sturdy and protects my phone!
 Great product!  Super stylish!  My husband wanted this case for his iPhone. When it strived, it came with the tempered glass and a soft cloth for cleaning. The product was lightweight and easy to get on the phone. It has proven durable and worth the meager amount asked. You cannot go wrong with this product!
 Too small for my iPhone 8 Plus. Phone locks and unlocks with the case on whenever it wants to, takes random pictures. It’s a pain in the ass
 Perfect for my new iPhone 8 Plus
 I can't believe such an awesome product for such a little price, amazing.
 The cover came apart from the rubber. Bad bad bad quality. Only lasted four days.
 Product does not work with iPhone 8 Plus as advertised.  Frustrating.
 A great iphone case with a cool poping color .. But I’m really disappointed with the build quality , the horizontal stand is half-broken after 1 day use .. and the material of the case peels off but simple scrathes.
 This is a good case however not recommended for any one in the EMS or First Responder field of work bc the belt clip will break easily and the phone case w/o a screen cover will not protect the phone at all from damage
 This case is well worth the price especially since it comes with a tempered glass. the case is very sturdy for being so thin, and it does not add a whole lot of weight to my device i have dropped my device a few times already and im sure glad i purchased this case as i would have a broke device had i not had the case on.
 It looks nice, but the rubber is too hard or placed in the wrong position for the phone, will not operate the volume or power button.Package says iPhone 8 / iPhone 7.
 Fits great and great price.  I have only had it for a few days but love it.
 I almost feel like i stole it for the price. its a great case comes with the glass ive watch it be throw face frist into a brick wall dropped face down from 12 feet and ran over by a car ! Lol im not going to test it ill take the videos word on it i  definitely recommend this case !!
 Great Mil-Spec case. Offers ample protection and draws positive attention from those that see it. Can't beat the price for what you get. Edges aren't crowding the screen making texting difficult unlike Otterbox.
 Everything fits snug, seems like it provides better protection than many other more expensive brands.
 Would buy this again. Exactly as pictured and it is very durable
 This case was purchased as a gift for my husband. He really likes the case but was disappointed that the package came partially opened and the screen protector was damaged.
 Drop the phone and a piece of the case broke off.  The phone made it.  I can't get a replacement bc the case only has 30 days warranty.
 Great product works perfect
 The power button doesnt work properly, isnt made right for the phone. Had to shave it down and make it fit so it doesnt hold the power button down all the time making the power screen to keep popping up.
 Good design for a case. Tight fit. Unfortunately a few flaws such as off center circular cut out for Apple Logo...no big deal just ugly. Belt clip snapped off and no longer functional. Deal breaker. Offer replacement clips would resolve this problem.
 Nice solid case - holster is handy when hiking or with pants that have small pockets. Just remember to take the phone off the holster if you need to take pictures
 Love my case. Last case I had protected my phone from so many drops at work. Case is in good shape still just bought another case for a change of color. Recently got my coworker one for his phone. He saw how good mine was and wanted one. Thank you Zizo
 The case fits too tight and constantly presses the volume and power buttons. The phone won’t adjust volume and constantly tries to power down or send the emergency signal.
 Nice an tough case but I broke my clip pretty easy an had to order another one which wasn’t a problem because I wanted another color also but then I broke that clip also maybe should make the clip more tougher
 The tempered glass screen protector started to chip away around the home button after a couple weeks. Other than that, it is a nice case.
 After a month the orange part starts to crack in different parts . Definitely I’m not going buy this item again.
 Broke the first day. Very bad quality.
 First day I had this case I put it on along with the tempered glass, happen to drop my phone from 3-4 feet and shattered my phone screen.... tempered glass is untouched and the only thing holding my screen together.
 Lovvve this case its lil thin but the quality fr the price n all the lil extras tht come woth it definitely worth it
 This is a great case, so happy I replaced my Lifeproof case with this one. Very happy with purchase!
 The belt clip is garbage. The clip that came in original order was recieved physically damaged (broken parts). I recieved a replacement that has lasted about a month and now that same stupid part has broken off once again! I wish I could go back in time and purchased a Ballistic case with clip.
 Protective glass cover does not adhere to phone screen works well for about a week and starts to come loose around the edges and then basically it’s useless
 This product states:<br/>Protection: The Zizo  Bolt Series] meets 12 Feet Military Grade Drop Test 810.1-G Certification. Certified to protect your phone<br/> but my phone fell from a 4 foot table and the case broke.
 Great features and design
 baxterrussell- case is great and screen saver was easy to apply. Never had any problems with any Zizo products.
 Its garbage you can't even push your side buttons .... will never buy again it was a total waste of money
 The Zizo case is the best I phone 7 plus case ever!! &amp; fits perfectly with my I phone 7 plus.  I love it !! Like really love it! This case is super hard shell rubber and has a remarkable shock proof that I could literally throw it off a building and the Zizo case will simple chuckle! A beast shall I say this is a  Chuck Norris case!!
 I ordered this for my iPhone 7 Plus.  It snapped on easily and looks good.  All the cut-outs match the iPhone 7 Plus.  This is a good case for the $$.
 I am not much on belt clips, so I don't use it, but everything else is great.  There are not that many products out there that you can buy and they give you 1 free screen proctor.  Now that was awesome!
 nice cases, clips leave a littleto desire, i have had two break off belt
 I normally do not write reviews but I was truly disappointed in this purchase. When I open the protective cover, it literally cracked apart in my hand. The case is extremely bulky with hard abrasive plastic. Purchase at your own discretion but I wouldn’t suggest it.
 Very strong phone case i really recommend this product !! I already recommended it to my brother and he bought one and he liked it .
 not as good as an otterbox but works as expected
 Arrived sooner than expected!  I love the case. It looks and feels great. If I had another phone I would buy another one.
 Good iPhone case
 Phone case is fine but when I try to open my package I find out the protective glass is already broke. I think it is free with protective case so somebody break it.I am going to return this item and I will never order from the same company now. Awefull!!  Very Disappointed!!
 The first time it was dropped it broke!
 Love this case. It is well made and offers good protection with style. The price is a bonafide bargain. MIne is red and my iphone 7+ looks great in it!
 Have had this case for my iPhone 7 plus for 4 days and it works great.  Face planted my iPhone today on a retail store floor.....after I come to LOL, the phone was in perfect condition.  Awesome temp glass screen protector and I love how the phone is significantly thinner than other "box" cases out there.  Would highly recommend!!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
 I received my new Zizo case yesterday.  I'm tickled with the design, toughness and how it pops in the clip.  I was also pleased with the color choices.  The other feature I look forward to using is the kickstand on the cover.
 Case fits the 7 plus snug. Only downside was the clear plastic screen protector was not durable and broke on the install when a little bit of pressure. Otherwise the case works as intended.
 This case is everything I expected. I purchased it for my husband because he is a tow truck driver and needs something tough, but nice looking and with a belt clip. He loved it!! The color selection was good so I'll definitely be buying him a few others so he can switch it out. Thanks Amazon &amp; Zizo.
 Awesome case
 good
 The phone case itself is great, this is the second time I bought a Zizo case, but the only improvement that needed to be addressed is the durability of the phone clip , my first zizo clip Broke quickly . It needs to be stronger and can withstand continuous use . Keep up the good work of your products
 I love the design of the case, but it is constantly interfering with my power button on my iPhone 7plus. If it was not for this, it would be a phenomenal case. Very disappointed. May it is just a defect in mine.
 Great product and very good price.... will buy again
 I loved the case at first.  It is big and solid just like it wanted it to be.  However, one drop and the case cracked on the side.  Within a few hours a piece fell off.  Perhaps, I got a lemon.
 This is an excellent case, however my son already purchased one. Will keep this case in mind just in case he needs to buy another one.
 Great phone case affordable price and it arrived on time
 It was I hoped fir love it
 Bought this for my husband, he loves it! He drops his phone a lot, it has provided great protection.
 I liked the quality ,feel and the price was great
 I love this rugged case very protective beautiful craftsmanship
 Great case and durable!  My daughter drops her phone ALL of the time and no damage so far!  Highly recommend!!!
 Very disappointed in this case. First a design that actually has the phone screen facing in to the case so that you can't see it without taking it out of the case makes no sense. The clip is cheaply constructed. The "tempered glass" protector does not sit well against the case and so forms air bubbles between the phone and the film. Very disappointed.
 Amazing! got this for mom mom's iphone and i liked it so much im getting one for my galaxy just different color!
 Bout for my husbands 8s plus iPhone. Ans he absolutely loves the case. Said from now on he will only buy a Zizo Case!!!!
 Love the color blue!  It is sturdy and a great case for the iPhone.
 Great case for the money
 Received my case right away.  Love it!! I do not have to worry when I drop on the ground.  Case is very strong and the color is great!! Thank you!!
 Great product
 Wife loves the case, the protection screen needs to be part of the case, and not a added feature.
 Very nice case, the button on the right doesn't work great, so i cut it just a bit with a razor blade and it works great now.
 so far so good!  The only thing I would like different is being able to have the option of which direction the iPhone clips in.  You can only insert the iPhone in one way to fit the clip correctly.  This is because there is a loop feature on this case.
 Highly recommended
 Great case, like the look and the feel. Could do without the lanyard loop though. Fits my iPhone 8 plus perfectly.
 As soon as I took it out the box the belt clip broke off..not happy at all😡😡
 I don't like it because it does not totally incase the phone. You have to apply a screen cover but the screen is still exposed.
 Dropped my 7plus several times, and it's protected it very well so far.  Excellent for the price!
 Great case overall, it has a nice weight to it with the phone. Feels secure and safe. The added screen protector is a bonus as well. I'm happy with my purchase. Comes with belt holster as well. I'll keep buying more colors cause I am a fan of the design.
 The case itself is fantastic.  The screen protector is garbage.  No matter how careful I was, it ended up with air bubbles.  Even when the air bubbles were fixed, it does not adhere to the top and bottom of the screen effectively.
 Cannot use power button on my 8+ with this case!
 Slick feel, great case, but one fault. Maybe it's just me  but I like my phone to sit in the case a certain way. The part on top of the case that is for the absurd wrist band is in the way when putting in the belt clip. Have to flip the phone over. So when you take it out of the clip it is upside down.
 Let’s start with the positive the case looks nice. However upon clipping it onto my belt for the 1st time the clip broke!  I guess you get what you pay for, spend a little more people and get a case that doesent break on the 1st day!!!!!!
 These guys rock. I got a malfunctioning case and they were right on it and sent me a new one 2 days later. Very cool cases and at real good prices. Thanks again.
 Solid case<br/>Fit my I phone 8 plus perfectly<br/>Very happy with this after several months use
 Loved this case it comes with screen protector and a belt clip which is something I like to have for work. The feel of it is very nice.
 I like it.  It's stylish and sturdy.  Be careful when installing the glass protector -- it can easily slip to one side...<br/><br/>The holster broke after 18 months due to my fault.  I'm buying same one.
 this thing is trash.  the on off button is hard to access and press the screen/front of phone does not fit right.  Im going back to lifeproof covers.
 Only problem with. This case was the fact that is such a tight fit getting it on was hard but this means it fits the phone like a second skin. This is a great case. Would recommend it to any one. Tried 2 other cases that did not work out first.
 Nice case for durability, but does allow me to use power button
 I Love the look but Belt Clip fell apart in 2 days. I only choose cases with belt clips and I don't care for otterbox color selections. The clip on this thing fell apart with ease!!
 I bought this before getting the iPhone 7 plus.  Because I love the one I had for the 6 plus so much.  But when I put it on the power button doesn't line up properly and let you power off the device.  For some reason it won't let me use the home button either.<br/><br/>  I really wish this worked out but they failed big time.
 It's very sturdy, but the plastic front shield was too small not really for a 7plus. In additoin, the case was tricky to open and fifficult to put ahut after one used the phone.
 This case is awesome I wish I would've had one on my iPhone 6 know that I have iPhone 7 Plus i'm glad I have one
 I like the case but it’s hard to fit in the holster when on your belt.
 First off, come with everything you’ll ever need for a phone, and more. Love the sleek look, I thought it would be a lot more bulky but it has the perfect look on my phone plus a lot of protection! I have another Zizo brand case which I also love, I don’t think I’ll be looking for any other brands anytime soon.
 Just got it...so far so good...easy to use and great that it came with tempered glass protector!
 This case has been on three phones and I have dropped the phones and never had a break or crap. The reason for the three phones is carrier switch and upgrades I love this case
 This is my second purchase of the Zizo Bolt.  I wanted to change colors.  For the price you get a stylish, strong case.  So far I am very happy with this case.
 Great Design, love it. very well made!
 Bought for hubby, he loves it.
 The Zizo iPhone 7 plus cases almost never fit properly! The power button to the right of your phone will not work once the Zizo Bolt cover is put on! I've had to return 2 different cases before I received one that works decently! My gf had the same problem with hers and just returned it for a refund and went with a different iPhone 7 plus case
 I purchased this case in December 2016. The case has lasted me 2 years before any issues. The plastic has finally cracked right next to the silence slider. Great price for the a great case.
 The belt clip is only for a left handed it didn't work for me. And also the on and off button is very hard to press.
 Sent it Back.<br/>The buttons did not work with this on.
 Bought for my husband,he loves it!  Great quality and came with a tempered glass screen protector.  Would purchase again.
 Love or it a lot
 Love it durable and very stylish
 The thing on the back that supposed to help stand broke easily after purchasing in 5 days. I’m very disappointed
 Very good
 The case is perfect. I bought one awhile back for my son for a different phone he had. He lived it so much he specifically asked for one again. He loves the stand feature.
 A little more expensive than other cases but worth it!! Very durable, screen protector has already saved my screen from a drop.
 great case and holster. Very well made and looks great.
 Better than Verizons
 Didn't Like Glass Cover
 Extremely difficult to install. Hard to access power n volume buttons. Broke during installation. Definitely not worth ur money or time!
 The case is very light weight and durable
 Breaks very easily. Need to have replacement clips.
 Plastic part of Case broke while inserting phone very cheap plastic<br/>Dropped my phone and did NOT protect it AT ALL

Missing phone case
 Perfect fit!!! Love it
 I bought this case for my iPhone 7 Plus, but it didn't fit. They send you the case that fits the iPhone 6 Plus, which keeps the power button pressed and it won't let the phone work. I was going to return it but I'm going to keep it for my work phone which is a 6 Plus.<br/>Too bad though, it looks really nice on the 6 Plus, I wish they had it for the 7 Plus and worked fine.
 Great case good features, screen protector went on easy
 Case is awesome.  Very easy to put together. I've always purchased screen protectors at the AT&amp;T store so they can put them on. As for this one, I installed it with ease. First time was easy. I love the kickstand to have my iPhone 7 plus while watching shows or movies. As far as the clip, I don't use it so you can always exclude it if it seems too bulky.
 Se rompo el plástico que va en la bolsa del pantalón el primer día q lo use.
 Seems like a great case, but I ordered the wrong one. I’m having to return it. Looks really cool though.
 I like this case and beltclip very much would recommend it to anyone! I have had otterboxes for years and have had no complant exept for the bulky nature of the case. So to finally have one that is just as strong in protecting my Iphone 7 Plus with out the bulky nature loving it!! Try it you wont be sorry
 It serve its purpose while I had it
 Very cheaply made.  Kickstand broke within 12 hours
 The case is exactly as advertised and the price is reasonable for the quality of the product. Company reached out to me to ensure I was satisfied within 1 day of receiving my case. Good customer service.
 Works great<br/><br/>Looks good too<br/><br/>I should have gotten it 2 days earlier when I cracked my screen :(<br/>I bought a waterproof one earlier by Rieck<br/>They party I was talking too could hardly hear me.<br/><br/>This one works better, but not waterproof!
 I am very impressed with the zizo case. I recently cracked my iphone screen and had to have it replaced at the shop and the guy recommended the case to me. Since then I have bought 5 more for my dad, wife and kids. Great product and half the price of an otterbox.
 Love the item 👍🏽
 Excellent case great protection for a great price very well constructed many choices of colors.  I have had other zizo cases on Samsung products and will continue to purchase Zizo cases  My favorite to date is the Bolt series for IPhone 7plus.
 Great Product &amp; cool colors. Kids love your product. Virtually indesctructable!!!!!
 Good but did not fit phone correctly had to shave the power button down on the case for it to work and it had holes on the case were they did not belong but would have been to much the return other than that it was good product but do not order for iPhone 7 plus because it is not right might even be a fake
 This case is perfect for my I Phone 7 Deluxe. I love the Rose Gold color and the case has grips on the side to keep it from slipping out of my hand! I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Very pleased with quality.
 Fit my phone perfectly!!! I bought this before I got my new iPhone, so I was excited to see how it fit. Also the kickstand is great for when I'm watching Netflix or when my daughter is watching YouTube. Would be awesome if yall could make some with superheroes later on down the road.
 These cases are are tough as nails
 It’s easy hold light weight durable and and nice modern metal color.
 This case has rendered the side buttons unusable. No matter how hard I press on them the volume and the side button won't work with the case on. I can't use this case. I do not recommend this at all.
 Still doe not protect the screen of the phone unless you have it in the clip. The stand on the back broke after 4 days. I like the color I got, that’s about it. Probably won’t reorder.
 VERY good case and it looks cool! Purchased 4" stainless steel wire keychain to loop through the eye on the case. Makes it easier to grab/hold a big phone.
 I us my phone a lot for pictures😍I love the fit and feel in my hand. I wanted to be able to hang around my neck when not using for safety of I phone 7. I keep snap off clip and neck band in purse for as needed.<br/>I would recommend to any one safety around neck not in pockets to sit on.
 Phone restrictions in holster do to little port for Lanyard hook up. Kick stand on holster doesn’t want to stay open, and have a hard time getting phone locking back into holster. Nice concept but needs work. If known I would have spent my money elsewhere
 The belt clip was broken when I took it out of the box
 Very happy with the case.
 I had a Zizo on my iPhone 6. I liked it so much I had to get one for my new iPhone 7 plus.
 After purchasing this item, I am very impressed with this product. It is very sturdy and not bulky. This case is also very durable and I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends. This product gets all five stars!
 Great for the price
 power button is stiff, besides that excellent
 It’s my first zizo case.. It’s great not to bulky, a great fit!!!
 The only complaint I have is I can't get the wake/sleep to line up correctly so if I press anywhere near the top it wakes the phone up, or sometimes it'll be pressing down and I'll accidentally take a screen shot when I hit the home button. Overall I'm enjoying the case, I'd recommend it to people that didn't wanna spend almost 100 bucks on life proof or otter box.
 Love the case. Feels sturdy I love that it come with a glass screen protector. Color is great. Love that I have a holster case to put it in since it is a bigger phone. The lanyard you can use is very helpful when I walk my dog since I use it to keep track of how far I walk. I love the case. I wanted a case that I felt protected my phone since I had invested so much and I feel great with this case!
 Not really what I was expecting and was kind of hard to get on my phone
 I have an iPhone 7 plus, this is advertised for my phone and the turn off button doesn't work with this cover on.
 Easy to install and uninstall, fits perfectly IPhone 7 plus, comes in a great package with proper instructions and is inexpensive, unlike the Otter (nightmare to uninstall) and the outrageously expensive, flimsy iPhone 7plus "protection" offered by Apple, which I bought and quickly replaced it with the Zizo. Very happy with my purchase.
 The case is nice, I was impressed for the minimal money we spent, however it's a "lefty" only clip. 😔  The "lanyard" that comes with it causes there to be a hook for it on the top corner of the case so you can only wear the clip that way.  We bought this particular case because we needed the clip feature, but find it very inconvenient for the lefty part.
 I had to return my case.  I did put my phone into the case, and it was beefy and I think it would do a great job at protecting the phone but the button on the right side of the phone was impossible to push.  This is the button you use to shut the screen off as well as take screen shots among other things.  I was unable to push that button at all.  The other buttons worked great so it is possible mine was a flaw I suppose.  Its hard to imagine so many great reviews and mine doesn't work but maybe it's just the color I chose, or a bad batch.  It did feel like a nice case otherwise though.  Unfortunately if it doesn't work, I can't use it.
 Husband likes so I picked right! 😜
 Great product. I’ve bought one for both of my phones and one for my wife”s phone. The kickstand is convenient for watching videos.
 Replacement for breaking the arm on the phone case (I had to ROLL on it) and lost the belt clip. A fantastic case and very glad to own one.
 My son loved it as soon as he got it, Immediately put his phone in it - loved the kick-out feature as well as the included screen protector!
 I love that I don't have to worry about worry about my phone falling.
 Give otter box a run for their money
 I like the case protection and style; however, i dropped my phone once luckily it was on carpet, by I see that my kickstand is already cracked.  I already had a screen protector; however, it wouldn't have worked on my phone because it would've covered my front camera.
 Very good for covering the phone.
 Not even 24 hours the belt clip popped right off when I sat down. Not so strong after all 🙁☹️Not as strong as they portray. I’ve had less costing ones that lasted longer than less then 24 hours.
 Very good quality.
 Zero stars really. DO NOT BUY for iPhone 7 Plus!!! This is just a re-marketed 6 plus cover that doesn't fit right. It presses to hard on the power button, so it will constantly go to sleep/try to power off. It also has the widened opening for the headphone jack still (dead giveaway!). I wish I had read the reviews before buying as it would have saved me a lot of disappointment.
 Doesn’t allow functionality of all the side buttons. I will be sending it back. Would gladly be keeping it if it wasn’t for that. Great look, but very disappointed otherwise
 Got the case on my phone at 11am and the clip broke by 11:25am. Don’t do it.
 Not a big fan. It only clips into the belt holster one direction. If you try to snap it in backwards it will fall out. The better ones allow you to clip it in either direction. It also says it comes with a tempered glass screen protector. That's a lie unless you call a thin clear plastic cover a tempered glass screen protector.
 The shape &amp;  quality are very good but not suitble for 8 plus . It’s very bad , you can’t press power button thats mean you can’t screen shoot . Also , vol. buttons always pressed . At least , i don’t advise 8 plus people to get it .
 Very durable case
 Excellent case for the iPhone 7 Plus. Fits great, no problems with buttons or ports. Comes with a nice screen protector also. And all at a great value. I absolutely would advise anyone needing a case for their iPhone 7 Plus to buy this one. I'm glad that I did!
 Ordered the wrong one and returned it for credit.
 Yes I love the product but it took two extra days to get to me should have been delivered on Tuesday but got it Thursday
 I am not happy with the clip on phone carrier. I am unable to face my phone inward so the face of the phone is protected. Also there is a small plastic nub<br/>That sticks up on the face of the carrier that has something to do with the swivel belt clip
 fit my i phone 8 plus good. nice that it comes with glass protection also.
 Great
 Well made. Money well spent.
 I actually ordered the wrong size and can not use it but the case seems to be nice,however after removing the case from the package the belt clip broke off.If you are wanting the belt clip feature then this part of it dose not seem to sturdy.
 I was hoping to have a cover that fit none the less stuck to the phone. Will not order from them again.
 The stand is broken only within couple of months of use. Not good quality
 I'm going to return this item. After putting  the phone in the case I cannot get my power button to work. I have the same case in red and everything works properly.
 This would actually be a nice phone case if it actually fit the phone properly. I got this for my iPhone 7 plus and it did not fit well at all. The back of the case starts to come apart as soon as you put the phone in it. And there were weird random opening in the phone case. Also the lock button is in the wrong place too. Until they make a proper fitting case I will not buy a new one.
 The case is what I needed. Very nice. The glass protector arrived broken, and was the main thing I needed, but couldn’t use cause damaged.
 Best case I have ever owned. Between the case and the glass protection I have successfully owned the same iPhone for over 6 months without cracking or breaking. That is a record for me. The pop up stand is amazing and works great to stream shows and movies. Love it!!!
 I like the fact it is really solid and seems like it will protect my phone really well. Nice grip easy to hold on to.<br/>I had a little difficulty getting it on over the power button and mute switch. And the pocket clip broke off the first time I used it
 Great product. Very fast shipping. Only con is that when you wear the clip on the right side of your belt the phone is upside down. That is the only reason for not giving all 5 stars
 It’s a nice case
 Not a 7 plus case.  Right lock button will not depress through this case.  completely and utterly pointless for an iPhone 7 Plus user. Sending it back today.
 Really great product
 Fit perfect. I feel confident this will protect my phone
 Great price for quality product. Easy to install
 The exterior is good but the clip is not worthy this is the second time that I buy this type of case and most likely will be the last, The clip snaps very easily and you end up having to  carry in your pocket.
 What a piece of crap, I had it on my phone for 2 days &amp; already threw it in the trash. The problem is it kept pushing the power button down &amp; would zap my battery, so don't waste your money on this piece of $&amp;@?
 Kickstand for the cover broke within a week, kickstand on the belt took 2 months to give up the ghost. Top edge of cover doesn't go passed the screen leaves the screen vulnerable
 Love everything about this  purchase. 👍🏿
 I just got the case today and it seems ok. However, the description clearly states that the included screen protecter  is tempered glass but it is not. It is flexible plastic. Seems ok but I hate it when the item that is delivered is not as described.
 Love the way it fits, very good material
 Great Product!!!
 Says that it is compatable with the iPhone 8 Plus and it in fact is not, the phone fits inside the case but don’t try To use any of the buttons on the side of your phone with the case on it, very disappointed
 I snapped it on my new iphone 7 Plus and love the protection I am getting from the case. Great product, would love to see a similar design with a flatter back.
 The cover on the power on/off switch does not allow me to turn the phone on or off.  The plastic covering it is too stiff.  Also, the rubber case was made for an iPhone 6 Plus, and not specifically for the IPhone 7 plus, as the cut out on the bottom is made for an ear phone jack.  I like the look though
 At first I thought I made a mistake because I have an iPhone 8 Plus but the packaging said iPhone 6 and 7.  But it fits the iPhone 8 Plus too.  I love it. It feels sturdy and I like the kickstand.
 The belt clip broke within a few hours. Went to wawa and it got caught as i went to sit in car and snapped. Actual phone case is great but belt clip is horrible. Can’t even buy another one.
 Great product love the durability of the case. Would buy it again to change up the colors. Thank you
 The weirdest piece broke off, the thumb release to assist you retrieving the phone/the piece that holds the phone in place. One day after purchase...
 great case thus far! I love the belt clip. My kiddos tested the no break case by throwing it in the air as high as possible, as my heart melted i picked up the phone and no cracks in the screen!<br/>the only thing is it is very hard to put on at first.
 Exactly as described. Quick shipment. Great quality.
 The back stand broke immediately when I tried to open it and the seems are not smooth. But over all can give it a try for the look it offers and also covers the phone in full and protects from a fall.
 This is my second case From Zizo, great product!
 I receive today and I like
 I love the kick stand and the protective cover. If you drop this case I guarantee you, your phone will be protected. It’s a perfect fit and a reasonable price.
 Great case provides all you need for reasonable price.
 I love this case!! I’m thinking of getting some of the other colors that are available. I like that they include a screen protector too I was wanting to change mine.
 Looks great and provides good crip. One suggestion is to increase the edge little bit higher to provide a better screen protection.
 The case around the phone itself is very good, but I broke the holster accidentally. It does an excellent job of protecting the phone when I have dropped it.
 Tactical phone cover is tactically tactical.
 Excellent design and durable configuration!
 Nice case. Heavy duty.
 All works well except the clip on want fit the phone.
 I like. Very sturdy
 Love it! Protects phone from every angle. Wonderfully reliable.
 The "included" Tempered Glass Screen Protector is junk. Get one from Tech Armor instead.
 Great case. Arrived on time
 Looks exactly like picture but didn't come with a screen protector.
 Phone case  is great. Belt clip broke within few days, metal pin fell out, not very durable.
 Fits great good texture and great screen protector
 Love it, great protector and got lots of compliments for it
 Looked great and all. It would not work on my 7 plus. The power button would not click and work. They did refund my money but only 13 bucks
 Amazing protection, coverage and heavy duty with stand, clip and string
 Great product only problem was the doesn't fit well it's to tied and makes phone goes off
 This case is as good as any I have ever had. Very tight and just tacky enough to have a great grip. Perfect!
 Great security coverage
 Excelente
 Very sturdy case!  The color is pretty and it came with its own glass screen cover at a great price!
 Love this better than the otter box cases I've owned in the past plus the kickstand is big plus!!!
 The power butting is so stiff that I can't really push it as I should be able. Great case, have 4 others that I didn't have this problem with. Fix the issue and rating would be a 5 star all the way.
 I received my case yesterday.  I like the way it looks and seems to be a good protective case.  The only problem is that in less than 24 hours the kickstand broke.
 Great product! Extremely happy with my purchase!!
 Fantastic item looks good and works great
 This is not for iPhone 8 Plus. Did not fit. Did fit  for my old phone iPhone 6 Plus.
 very strong protection.  I recommend it.
 I really like the case , fit just right seams sturdy , am thinking of buying one in a different color just I can have a variety of colors. The slide clip I really do not use , I wish there was a pop ring that can be bought so I can hold the phone with one hand.
 My I phone8 plus for work love the case. This is the second one I’ve ordered the holster broke ordered a new one good product hope this one does not break. Will notify if there is a problem
 The case is as rugged as they claim, really like that.<br/>The only bad part of this is the kick stand. It broke after 3 maybe 4 uses.<br/>What broke was the plastic slide that goes in the slot.<br/>Not the steel pin.<br/>I would still buy it again!!!
 The case was the product I expected to receive.  Excellent, very well made.  Because all the protection it has,it makes it a bit heavy once you insert the phone.  But the product does what is meant to do!!!
 It's a great case,  im pretty rough on phone cases and its doing a great job.  I who's the screen protector was better, it didn't stick very well on one corner.  But that could have been my fault,  not sure.  But it is doing its job.  Thanks guys.
 Stand broke  after 2day.  but it protect your phone when drop
 Great case. The holster could be a little more sturdy, but it works. The case is really nice and feels secure.
 The protective case and belt carrier is very durable. Stand leg on back of case that holds phone up for viewing, not so much!! Broke off third week after recieving it!!!!
 Kickstand broke instantly.
 IPhone 8 Plus case did not work.<br/>Volume and Sleep buttons on side became non responsive as soon as the case was securely only.<br/><br/>Cool looking case but was upset by the deficient product.
 The little leg for the case broke with jut a little muevent
 By far the worst case I've ever used. The buttons are so incredibly stiff it's constantly trying to shut my phone off. I've used quite q few cases for my iPhones and this is definitely the worst. DO NOT BUY!
 Bought this for my iPhone 7 plus. Just like many other reviews said, the power button will continuously be pressed in by this case and your phone will turn off. Amazon should halt sales of this product immediately. Needless to say, I am returning mine.
 It's thinner than the otter box, also the otter box had plastic over the iPhone home button which made it difficult to operate .  The Zizo well it's awesome. We love this product.
 I like this case for its product info on quality and style. I took it to work and on day one compliments. I will say that one thing that improve this product, would be to allow the phone to clip on either sides. Very minor but would make this flawless
 Amazing product but the description was wrong or perhaps i read it wrong and I ordered the wrong case and I wish I could exchange/return . Other than it’s an amazing product and great quality
 The apple logo on the back of the phone didn’t match up with the hole on the case. It says in the name and description for an iPhone 8 Plus and I phone 7 plus which are the same size. It is tight and hard to get the case on.
 Very nice case.  I thought it did not swivel at first but after I let my kid try it it worked.  Really happy with this product.
 Very sturdy case. Great features with clip on attachment and also a built in stand Usually those features are only offered on separate cases.<br/>Seller sent the case fast. Received in 2 days as part of Amazon Prime.
 I have not dropped my phone, but hopefully if I do, this case will protect it.  The tempered glass screen protector is ultra clear.  You cannot beat the price.  I wish it came in a version without the little tether loop.
 Great case! I actually got it for my 6+, fits great. Durable!!! Love that it came with tempered glass! Not sure if the color is actually rose gold, but I can live with it. Hard work to find super cute cases with excellent protection. So this was a win/win.
 I have had many phone cases through the years, this, by far, is the junkiest one I've ever owned. Multiple problems with it's functionality and any degree of quality, simply does not exist! Every cheaply made movable part is broken.i was forced to add a star to publish this review, it deserves "no stars"!
 Case looks and feels great.  Had to modify the rubber to work with the power button on my iPhone 7 Plus, still not working great, but now it at least functions.  Thinking it was a manufacturing defect.  Not sure I'd buy this again.
 Got this case for my IPhone 7 plus! Product is wonderful it fit my phone perfectly. The color is slightly darker in person than online. I love the wave design.. The glass that came with it seem a bit on the small side but it worked okay. Yes I would order this again!
 I have ordered 2 of these cases, as my first case was damaged. I am UPSET, as my phone was damaged and it can not be MILITARY GRADE!! I dropped my phone in the case and now I am dealing with a damaged phone.
 Awesome products, this is my second time I had this phone case. My other iPhone was dropped a few times and nothing happened to phone or screen. Great price for this case no need to spend big bucks.
 Love this case, we have bought many more and they are sturdy, pretty and the price is great!! Will keep buying
 The case holder was broken when i took phone out of packaging box. So I can use the belt/pocket clip
 Does fit well, the outer part doesn't lay flush.
 Reason why i give this a case 5/5 is because of i recently dropped my phone a good 10 feet from the top of my bed by accident because i was sleeping and when i wake up i find everything okay with the case and the Iphone
 Not a true 7+ case. Simply a 6+ case rebranded as it has the headphone jack cutout on the bottom. When I put phone into the case, it became unusable because the case was pressing on the lock button.<br/><br/>Save your money and the hassle, skip this phone case.
 It is soft and user friendly. I like the protection it offers.
 We bought a pink and a orange case for new phones. It’s really good on the phone. I don’t like to use the holster on my belt but dose work good on the car  visor.
 Power button and volume controls didn't line up on iPhone 7 +.  Overly tight fit.
 Perfect fit and looks nice too
 This is my second case I order through Amazon. It is very durable and provides a great grip. The only issue I having is the side button for the power off is very stiff and hard to use. I might have to return it to see if I can get another one that works better. Overall it is a great case and provides great protection!
 Pros<br/>Sturdy case<br/>Sturdy belt clip (w/ swivel)<br/>Includes tempered glass<br/><br/>Cons<br/>At first its hard to place case on phone. It feels you might damage the phone, case danm case is so rigid. Just gotta be patient I guess.
 Purchased for my spouse, this is an excellent case, bought 3 so far. You wont be disappointed.
 The power button is so easy to activate, only a touch will sometimes trigger it to ask if you want to power off. This is a real pain when it happens and you're right in the middle of sending a message or reading an article.  Also, the top left side of the orange part flares out slightly so much as to make it difficult to get out of your pocket.
 I like the case. My only thing that I would want in the design is a lip around the face. That way if it falls on it’s face it will have less stratches.
 Your looking at this phone case and your thinking oh yeah it looks great it's a good price... but it's crap, total crap. Zizo, heres an idea, how about you make the phone case for the phone that you advertise it for. People don't buy it. Your just going to be pi$$ed when it arrives and you still don't have a cell phone case.
 Best case for an iphone
 Absolutely happy with this case!! It’s very durable and pleasing to look at! I’d say it’s better than an otter box and lifeproof plus it’s cheaper! Great job Zizo you guys made a great product! I will definitely be a repeat customer
 Bought 3 of these, one for each of us, in different colors.  They are working very nicely so far. Good fit, nice quality, nice look.  Would buy again if needed.
 The clip broke right after the warranty ran out. The phone had never been dropped or played with, and just when I went to remove the phone the clip snapped. Case has held up pretty well but the clip was a great feat!
 Looks very sturdy and safe, love this product, in black look more professional, thank you
 I like the looks of the case itself and the lanyard.  I am constantly misplacing my phone.  This lanyard helps me keep my<br/>phone where I can find it.
 En la caja que recibi dice que es para iphone 7 plus y no dice si es para iphone  8 plus que es para lo que necesito. mi pregunta es: sirve para iphone 8 plus tambien?<br/><br/>gracias
 I love the fact that my phone feels protected but the case isn't bulky. It's ruggedness is reassuring and it looks EXACTLY like the picture. #OneHappyCamper
 I love it, including the silver color, in that it stands out more than the typical black cover.
 Works great.  Has taken several good falls.  No damage to it or my phone
 Love my case, I am extremely rough on cases and this ones no exception. The only problem is the the area around the volume buttons closer to the scream broke. Usually the same on any other case.
 I don’t understand the low ratings others are giving this case, but the one I received is absolutely perfect.  Perfect fit for my I-Phone 7 Plus.  All the buttons still work great and looks amazing.  5 stars.
 Great grip, well built
 VERY GOOD CASE! Works great on my iphone, just wish the stand was reversed so that my volume controls were on the top when watching a movie.
 It did not fit my iPhone 8 plus as it specified.
 I love it..Fits my IPhone 8
 I love my phone case! It’s durable and it has totally protected my phone. I will buy another ! It’s a tough iPhone case
 The case works very good protecting my iphone but the belt holder is not powerful enough to keep it at the belt.
 poor product quality I expected something better left me damaged
 I've had a boat load of phones and covers. This one has to be the best. NO JOKE<br/>VERY IMPRESSED.  The price is smoking too!  I like the stand up feature too.  😊 thank you
 This one fits perfect and is great!!
 Every part of this item was very  good except the plastic screen protector was difficult to get on the phone and it cracked.  we had to go purchase another one.
 For those who want to carry their phone on their belt this case fits the bill well.  Would have given it five stars but the pivot pin on the clip keeps working its way out.
 I LOVE this case, has texture, for easy grip. It’s ORANGE, which is so hard to find, and it has a kick stand, it’s slim, but tough feeling. Would DEFINATELY recommend, will be ordering one for my husband...
 My husband bought this an he loves it. It's very durable which is exactly what he was looking for. Plus the design is pretty neat too.
 Great product
 Size and Weight: iPhone 8 Plus is just slightly heavier at 7.13 ounces, compared to 6.63 ounces for the iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 8 Plus is also marginally thicker—0.2mm—than iPhone 7 Plus, so some very tight cases may not fit . This is the case with this case very disappointed
 The case doesn’t line up correctly
 A very nice sturdy case. I bought this for my iPhone 7 and it fits nicely and looks great.
 Zizo phone case is working great!
 Phone fits perfectly and looks great.  No way you can beat this case for the price.
 Just what I wanted, would have preferred more color choices.
 So far so good!
 I loved the case until the drew fell out of the kickstand....less than a week after purchase! It is a sturdy case but with the kickstand missing the case is ugly. I purchased this case because of the kickstand. That part of the case is cheaply made. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!
 the on/off button on the case keep pressure on the on/off button on the phone.  This causes the phone to keep turning off unexpectedly and taking screen shots when you hit the home button.  very frustrating
 Awesome case my one year old drops my phone all the time with the case nothing happens to my phone, plus the kick stand on the back is great watching moves or videos or what ever.
 Nice case only one problem was one the power button side of the case I had to trim a little bit off the inside of the button so it would work, I have the iPhone 7 Plus.
 I really like this case, it looks very stylish while being very protective. Only wished it had a charging port protector. I would recommend this case to users that work hard and play harder, with the reassurance that your phone is protected.
 The product looks and feels great...the downside is when I was putting the tempered glass on it did not line up right and when I was trying to position it so it would line up it cracked...
 Everything is is wonderful not big and Bucky
 This cover is awesome I extremely recommend it  and also the tempered glass is made from really good quality material!
 Didn’t hold up to the 12 ft drop test. Drop at 4 feet because it slipped out of my hands and it cracked my phone screen and shattered. Do not get this product
 GREAT ITEM...GREAT SELLER!
 The holder clip is very fragile
 Rubber layer is substantial and quite hard, which is good for protection and button function.  Gold color is slightly more subtle than photo but very attractive.  Pleased with inclusion of front glass layer and lanyard.
 I originally had a problem with this item and you immediately addressed my concerns and sent a replacement. The product itself works great and I am looking to get another in a different color.
 i really like the case, but the only problem is that you need to be very careful with the clip. in a matter of time the pin starts to come out.
 It's very good product and I liked it, Very Robust and can be confident enough to use I-phone rough and tough. Only negative thing is the back stand which is NOT standard, i feel it might broke anytime soon due its delicacy.
 Nice case. Don't know what the fuss over if it's a iPhone 6 case or an iPhone 7 case because of a very small detail where a headphone jack could go. Overall this case is very evident of quality. At least initially. Fits like a glove on my iPhone 7 and the buttons work flawlessly for me.
 Sent it back today 4/3/18. Poor design for the volume and power buttons. The soft shell piece constantly held down the power button so the phone would power down or if you pressed the home button you’d take screenshots.
 Wonderful product
 My son absolutely loves his new phone case.we were very pleased with the product and the accessories that accompanied the case. My son said, “This case rocks”😊 So thank you Zizo for making my baby a very happy boy 😘
 This is my first time using this type of phone case but I am very happy with it so far. Thanks Zizo
 Durable! But it was very hard to put the iPhone 7 plus in the case, it took me a while!
 Good looking case, the plastic stand is fragile tho don’t break it
 There is nothing I dislike about this case. Super protective considering how many times I dropped my phone and nothing happened.
 The clip is really easy to brake not a item to recommend
 No dislikes my I phone 8 plus
 it didn't look like will protect too much from a fall. its very hard to remove the case
 OUTSTANDING IPHONE COVER PROTECTION FOR IPHONE 7PLUS. THIS IS MY THIRD BUY AND MANY MORE
 I am very happy happy with this case. It is well made and attractive and fits perfectly. The price is great. I have owned many different cases over the years and this one is as good as the best at a cost of about half of what similar quality cases cost. I recommend it.
 Love it love the Glass cover that comes with a strong case and love the strap that come with it will order in the future for different colors.
 I like the case. It feels cheaply made though. I hope it works as the advertisement says.
 Absolutely love this case nice and sturdy. Also like the fact it has a stand for when I want to watch a show. Definitely sticking with these cases whenever I get a new phone and you should give them a try too!
 I really like the rugged design, color and quality. My only regret is the lack of a credit card pocket. And it is rather heavy.
 Army tough fast start salute to the soldiers
 nice
 This is my second zizo case and the first one was great, however this one broke as soon as I took it out of the packages. The stand on the back broke as soon as I opened it. I sure hope they send me a new one.
 I put on my iPhone 7s. Did not last long. Belt clip broke with in a week and screen protector is cracked now. Not very happy with the product
 The case fit the phone perfectly. The tempered glass was easy to install.
 Great case, sturdy, slides in and out of pockets easily, stays put on surfaces as well.  Very happy with this case for sure.
 This is a very nice, stylish case.  Plus the belt clip is very durable.  I would recommend to anyone.
 I have had the unfortunate privilege of dropping my phone a few times and onto some very hard surfaces. The case worked perfectly - no damage whatsoever to my phone nor the case. I have owned a few different cases from other manufacturers. I really like this case!
 Good Product ,I love it
 The  case is really nice but hard to put together. The shell would not fit right and felt like it would crack if we forced the fit. Since we tried to work with it for an hour we decided this was not worth it and returned it.
 Horrible! Not sure if this case was just bad or if they are all the same but the case pushes on the power button on the side of the iPhone 7 plus! So it constantly turns the phone on and off. We returned the case and went with another one!
 Just started using it,  but I love it so far. User friendly and appears well constructed.
 Beautiful design and very rugged!!!  I love this case and highly recommend it to anyone looking for solid protection.  Plus it's military grade so you know it's top notch!!
 Bought 2 of these cases for use with the iPhone 7 Plus. It appears the  Rose / Gold Black case phone cover does not align properly with the holster clip. The phone cover appears durable.
 Maybe I had bad luck with mine but the kick stand retracting mechanism broke after only a few uses making the purchase of this specific case disappointing. The case is rugged and will protect your device though.
 This case is cracking only in a month and a half of having put it on.
 Sturdy
 The part that hold stand is broken
 Tempered glass, is very fragile. Do not recommend this but the case is great.
 Fits my iPhone 7 Plus perfectly and gives the phone an elegant appearance.
 Overall a good product but one  button will not work,
 This is the second one that i have gotten. I changed because i wanted a new color. Love this case. It’s very durable and looks great.
 Indestructible. So far so good
 The stand breaks to easily. This is my second one and both stands broke.
 This case is awesome. Enough said!
 Great product
 Nice, sleak, Slimline and sturdy.  Masculine appeal.  Would get 5 stars if it were a little more Rubberized for better grip!  It's a little slippery.
 It’s nice but it a real pain to get on and off the phone. The buttons are the real problem. I feel like I’m going to rip the rubber buttons off when I try to take the hard cover on or off.
 The case belt clip broke the same day I got it. Isn't a huge deal but I paid for something I can't use. And I wasn't about to return everything just to get a beat clip back. But other than that I love it. It compliments my red phone very well
 Great case for the price! Received 10/28/16. Fits fine on iPhone 7plus. No problems at all with buttons not working. Didn't like the belt clip so used a dremel to take it off. Stand is very hard to open.<br/>Feels very good while holding. No slipping out of hand with this one.
 Love it! Great color
 The right side button won't work with the case on. I ordered this as soon as I ordered the phone, but the phone just arrived and now it is too late to return the case.
 love it
 For money, great case, good protection.
 Damage items product was broken when I receive
 When unpackaging the item, it was discovered that the clip for the holster was broken. Small plastic fragment in packaging. Case, however, is very sturdy and nice appearance. The clip for the holster seems to be of cheaper plastic. Possibly mine was defective...
 It’s not big an bulky and comes with a belt clip which only otter box has but is to expensive . So far I like this very well. Alittle worried about how protective it is but it’s only been 2 weeks since I’ve been using it.
 I wish the screen protector was larger to fit the entire screen. The fit of the case is perfect!
 Worst investment ever made on Amazon.
 You can tell it’s a cheaper case but does the job!
 So the case fits nicely... almost. Part of the exterior, rubberized plastic sticks out, even if I try to pop it back in place. Also the tempered glass had a little crack, wish I didn't realize it  till after I placed it. Didn't want to risk having the phone without screen protection, so just kept it with a crack, rather then go through the hassle of returning it.
 LOVE the look &amp; reliability of this case! Would recommend it to anybody who wants a good protective case!
 Love the case!<br/>Durable and protects well!
 I love his case. My only problem is that the belt clip broke. But that was mostly my doing as i was climbing up into the Fire Engine it got caught. Otherwise this is a great product.
 The kickstand broke the first day, first time I tried to use it. Don’t exactly have high hopes this will protect my phone.
 This phone case is awesome. I like the holding clip and the sliding prop up on the back of the phone. I really like how sturdy the case is. If I drop my phone, I know it's safe.
 The case is great but I have not had it even a month and the holster clip broke and I look and can not just buy the holster but it should last more than a month.
 Excellent value
 mobile cover has back flap to support mobile while watching video in tilted position, which is not strong enough, it can easily damage.<br/>mine was broken just in a week. otherwise cover is nice.
 producto de baja calidad el gancho sujetador se rompió.  AMAZON  dice que devuelva el producto pero estoy en otro país y eso me resulta mas costoso que lo que pagué por el producto.
 I received a previously purchased item. The box contained the cover. However the only thing left from the screen protector was a wrapper and various other trash, even someone’s hair. Not very happy.
 Garbage. Broke after two days.
 Bought this case instead of an Otterbox.  The integrated kickstand is very weak and broke the second time I popped it out.<br/>Guess I'm getting another Otterbox.
 The case is great. The screen protector not at all worth even adding to the package. Mine was cracked when pulling out of the wrapping.
 The belt clip broke very easily. Need to return
 I have had this case for a little over two weeks and it's been an amazing purchase! This case is protective without being bulky, as well as multiple designs to choose from. I have already recommended these to many people who are in search of a case.
 I like the case works good and the kickstand. The only thing wish they would’ve added a charger flap to cover it and the ringer switch
 Absolutely a great case looks great feels solid and the free tempered glass screen protector is the iceing on the cake.
 Just got this to protect my new iPhone 7 plus , they also added a tempered glass screen , I had the misforune of dropping my phone waist high with this case installed and nothing but excellent came from this protector
 Sent me an iPhone 6 pluss case in an iPhone 7 package ....it’s not compatible power button and apple  symbol do not line up power button is unusable<br/><br/>Love this case for my old iPhone six<br/>Useless on my new phone.
 This Zizo case I had just bought for my brand new iPhone 7 Plus recently works great. It includes kickstand has helps me a lot with video calls. The grip of it feels nice though. Thanks to Zizo for including screen protector. I find it very useful and handy when I use it often.<br/>Overall, it's awesome!
 Case it’s self is very nice however when I dug further into the box for the belt clip ,it was broke so I don’t know if you are buying a good holster or not but the case is 5 Star all day!!
 I really like this phone case! The fact that it came with a tempered glass screen cover and belt clip was a huge plus. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the power button didn't fit quite right and so my husband had to work with it a bit...almost every time I moved my phone it tried to shut it off.
 While I liked the overall construction of the case, it was so tight on my son's iPhone 8 Plus phone that the power button was constantly being pressed. This, of course, made the case's protection moot. I wouldn't recommend this case.
 The case is really nice but the screen protector does not cover the whole front to the edges.
 Looks good so far.  Let’s see how it holds up. I’m satisfied with my  purchase .
 Fits well
 Strong case, nice design, and I love the lanyard... never thought I needed one until I got a case with one! Now I won't buy one again that doesn't have one! Lifesaver!
 Second one of these cases I have bought. First one works fine, second one the power button does not depress. Seems like a problem with the plastic casting on the frame. The button is stiff and unresponsive to touch. This is the button on the right side of the case to put phone to sleep.
 Yes perfect product. For a great price as well very satisfied my dad loves it.
 Aesthetically pleasing and I like the look/how it feels but it doesn't fit my 7plus very well. Keeps turning on and off by itself. Will be looking for another case that fits better without the hassle
 Love this case!!!
 The Zizo IPhone case is by far the best Quality phone case that I have purchased. Less than half the price of Box cases with far better materials and Engineering. If I could buy stock in this company I project this company will be the leader of the Industry in time!
 This case would not make contact with any of the side controls on my phone. Unable to use volumne controls and on/off control on side
 Incredible quality, well-made, durable, and very protective of that sensitive phone it holds. The glass screen protector was easy to install and came full a sticker for removing dust, and a cloth for cleaning the screen as well. Great buy for the price and all listed features. I would have expected this to cost at least $50.
 Love this case!!!!!!
 Overall I like the case, the only issue is the first time I opened the kick stand it was broke inside. I rarely use a kick stand, so it wasn't enough for me to send it back.
 Yes I am satisfied, desing is very good and the quality is great the only problem I had was that it came with a broken belt clip. Can I buy the only the belt clip?
 Love the product, case is sturdy and glass went on easily.  The kickstand on the phone case works well.  There is also a kickstand on the belt clip case but the phone won't insert with the face out so you could also use phone in the belt clip.  Maybe someone has that figured out, if so let me know!
 I liked that the hole for the power cord is wide enough to plug in with the case on. I dislike that there is no protective piece over the camera on the back of the case.
 My kid loves it and I feel her phone is safe.
 The phone holder is made of rubber like material and phone falls out to much for it to be of any use
 Nice sturdy case comparable to the otter box defender case
 I’m still using this, several years later.
 i just got my case. a complete waste of time. it is not an iphone 7 plus case, it does not fit at all. very disappointed!!!! what a waste of time
 This product is great so far. The only issue I have is I ordered a black unit and received a blue unit. Hate the color but needed the case.
 My phone was in the case when it was run over by a Prius. Screen was cracked but phone OK. This is a good sturdy case
 Very nice case for the price! Already received several nice comments about the case. I love the blue color. Working for me so far.
 Love it works great at a great price love is ease of use
 Too bulky and the stand was weird.
 I was very disappointed with this case, I'd heard and read lots of good reviews about it, but upon receiving mine did not fit well and the phone keeps constantly wanting to shut off, it is continually pressing down on the power button. I know this was just a twenty dollar case but I was hoping for more
 Great quality came in fast fits perfectly
 I love this phone case, you have to get use to putting the phone on the clip,, but besides that it comes with a string where you can put it around your neck so I don’t have a problem dropping my phone!!! And it has a god grip
 The case is very study and protects the iPhone 7Plus really well. The clip attachment fits loosely on the case and hopefully will not slip off the case when the phone is clipped to my pants.
 Why is the lanyard strap on the top of the phone?! Very awkward to hold when the lanyard is right across the screen?!
 I really like this case, but the plastic piece has broken off already and the stand doesn’t work.  I have only used for a few weeks
 Fit phone great and works great.........
 Very strong and lovely case.. it’s basically a one stop shop as you get the screen protector a lovely case a holster and a cord to put on the case. Bout one for a friend it’s very good I definitely recommend
 Perfect fit for my plus not to bulky fit in my pocket<br/>Light with enough protection for my phone<br/>Love it
 Simply loved it!! Makes my iPhone look sexy!!
 It was exactly what I wanted for the phone.  It looks great. I wanted a cover that would hold up to a 12 year old boy who is very active.  So far so good.
 The product seemed like it was durable and would protect the phone.  The main issue is that every time I tried to install the case on the phone it would cause the phone to power off.  Returning the day it was received.
 Two minor things that I had to fix:<br/>The inside portion of the case has an issue where to power button is located. It was molded with an oversized contact point for the power button and the plastic is way too hard.<br/>Second is the holster. The pin holding the clip to the body is loose and had to be glued into place so it would not fall out.
 Great value for the case and tempered glass! Highly recommended and have purchased more than one
 i like the case and the clip holder as well as the protection . i wish the case had a better locking devise to h keep phone locked in tight .
 Probably one of the nicest, well built and durable phone cases I've ever owned. The iPhone 7 Plus is larger than the regular iPhone that I'm used to but the case doesn't add a lot of bulk to it, but makes it feel like it very well protected! Excellent product!
 Awesome case for my awesome new iPhone 7plus. Keeps the phone compact yet gives great protection!  Love the style of this even though it does seem to slip a bit when holding it, but hey it's the 7 Plus!  Buttons work perfectly. And the tempered glass screen protector is great. And you can't beat the price.
 Fit my husbands iPhone 7plus perfectly! Now I don't have to worry about him dropping it or sitting on it and breaking the screen. Thanks Zizo!
 Bought this for my husband who is rough with phones and he has already put it to the test yesterday when he dropped it from the top of a 10ft ladder.. He said he was so scared to pick it up but not even a scratch was on it! He said it's a great case... thanks
 The kickstand broke a week after buying. But, it looks good.
 Just installed my Zizo cover , and it was a tight fit to get it on , other then that I like my color and the design it has , good price for it , thanks....
 Iphone8plus. Just got it so can’t comment on durability. It lives up to its advertising
 Great case, rugged and protects Iphone. Would definitely recommend to anyone
 Perfect for my husband that is rough on his phone.
 Power button does not function.  Not allowing you to power phone off or on and does not allow you to use the screen shot function on the phone
 The case is very easy to install, overall I am very satisfied with the stylish look of the case, I like that it also has a holster
 Looks to be a great case. Fits well and easy to install.
 lasted for about a month before the belt clip broke...thirty days later holster broke
 I'd give it more stars but the lining isn't lined up and doesn't allow me to turn off the power and be able to screen capture 😫 Is it possible to send me a replacement that works?
 great value for the money, looks an feels like a very rugged case. Would purchase again if another case is needed but unfortunately for Zizo, there product built to last. Will be buying cases for my entire household.
 excellent
 Very good for money. no need bought Costly OTTO .
 Went though two clips in less than a year. They keep breaking with normal wear and tear. The case is good though.
 This is for the old version 7 plus, will not fit 8 plus, apple in the back will not be visible! Fake! -1 star
 The case fit and look nice but cannot use to tune the volume up and down. And can’t turn on and off the phone but it kept on make the phone set to recovery mode when tried to turn off. Very bad case.
 Sending back. On off switch doesn't work when on phone and the holster will not hold case.
 Very sodisfied
 Got this for A iPhone 8+  It fits and looks great. Has a good feel in your hand. The stand is a little cheap but other than that no complaints
 I just received the case and screen protector. Case fits phone great. However the screen protector only seals to 90% of the screen. No matter what you do it still has air under it around top and bottom. Very bad design.
 This case is awesome. I was looking for a new design and this is spot on. Very unique to give you a case with tempered glass screen. And a lanyard!! You get a lot for your money.
 Sorry we have figured out how to use the product and it is working great
 I had the very same problem as the gentleman in the video did with the on off switch. I also had to cut mine off because the phone stayed on. Now I use my fingernails to turn it on or off. Other then that I really like this case.
 I gave this case five stars. But the screen protector gets 2 stars. One corner won't stay on my phone. It lifts up. I am most likely going to have a zagg glass protector put on it.
 A+
 I like the set up I’m using it for iPhone 7 plus
 The case would not permit use of volume buttons.
 Great product !!! I have used rugged cases in the past for all my phones but this one is outstanding. Well made and it seems they took care of every small detail, it's rugged and sleek at the same time with an original outstanding design in a wide variety of colors! I'm planning to buy another one.
 Sturdy, tough, durable and not too bulky the only downside is the white coloring quickly gets dirty from constantly being in your hands
 Decent overall case but the kickstand was insanely difficult to pop out. I actually broke my nail trying to get it out. After using a screw driver to pop it out it was still very hard to open and close. At the moment it doesn't even stay closed correctly which I'm guessing is due to having to pry it open constantly
 I love this case.  Both of my sons have used this same brand of case as well and really enjoy it.
 These cases are cheaply made prices of crap. Haven’t had this case but barely a week and it has already broke. The belt clip that comes with it broke the very first day.
 I ordered an orange case for my new I-phone 8 plus. It is exactly what I needed. I needed it to clip on my jeans and backpack. It is heavier and thicker than my case for the 6, but hopefully more durable. Seems well constructed and heavy duty.
 Thought grey would be shinier its dull when you receive it.
 My iPhone 7  screen cracked only 3 hours after putting the case on my phone.
 This has already shown to be a great product as I have dropped my phone twice with no damage. Thank you
 Was delivered damaged. Case was cracked
 For the price can’t beat it
 Work
 Buttons do not operate phone, i.e. volume buttons and sleep buttons do not work. Also my phone continuously tries to shut down and twice has called 911.
 Had to send the first one back due to a crack in the protective screen.  So far so good.  I bought it to protect my husband's phone.
 1st message from a year and a half ago: I can't wait to receive my case and my new iPhone. Out of all the cases, I saw this one looks liked it will last for years.<br/><br/>1/8/2018 - This is my 2nd case from your company and I love it.  The only reason I purchased another case is I broke my top case.
 The clip that pops out on the rear is very flimsy, broke off with just a few uses.
 I like the style I messed up the screen protector and would really like to purchase another for this same case, I Phone 7plus!! Thank you
 Great rugged case 4 of us have it at work and all happy with it
 Didn’t fit iPhone 8plus
 Very nice case this Color  really goes well with the Rose Gold phone and it really feels great in the hand also very solid and seems like it will protect my phone really well !
 This case is amazing I love how the rose gold actually match the rose gold of my iPhone. It is snug and I love the extra belt clip holder as well as the string that comes with it. This is a must have case and I love the price so well that I even ordered a second one in another color!
 Durable and non slip case.  Multiple uses comes with the case....case with stand, you can use the clip to clip the phone to your belt or wear your phone on you hip with the phone holder.  Multiple options on how you wear you phone.  Everything in one box!
 It’s cool and all but the kick stand is wayyyy too brittle/flimsy.
 Great phone case
 The case is really nice, and I went and purchase another one for my wife, right after that, mine got broke in half, the clip is strong , but the body that hold the phone is really think and easily broke.  Thanks
 Easy to snap phone in and out. Really liked the kick stand and color was as shown.
 Case looks and feels great however, the front of the case is almost touch with the screen. The feel and quality are great. Love the case
 Good product for iPhone8
 I just received this case for my iPhone 7 Plus.  It fits perfectly and has many options. It looks just like the picture. I am very satisfied with the quality.
 Nice case for a decent price. Nice fit and finish. The screen is turned toward the belt clip while using the clip and is not reversible.
 The belt clip does not fit the case. I have purched two of these and the clips are different on both of them. The first one fit, however the 2nd one does not fit either case.
 Gracias
 Kick stand is hard to open
 Plastic clip broke within the first week. The reason why I bought this one I have one just like it the other plastic belt clip also broke within about 2 1/2 three weeks case is fine but the belt clip suck
 Great product, very durable.  Doesn’t block any of my service signal like my old case did.
 I would like the say that I'm happy with the bolt case. It is really light Case and it's cheaper than the otter box defender case. though I wish the case would have a temper glass screen  protector build on it. I think that would make the case even better. But still it's a really good case.
 Fits great and looks great!  Definitely will buy again. Great value and quality for the price!  Keep up the good work!
 The clip broke off the 3rd day.  The case was hard to get on as it kept folding in.
 The product is as described but  I had to cut off part of the rubber power button so that it wouldn't keep the actual power button depressed. It was extremely inconvenient.
 Awsome product otterbox aint got nothing on zizo period
 Fit perfect!! This was for 14 y/o son! Has been very durable!!
 Case fits perfectly!!!! Seems very tough and durable!! The belt clip is nice as well and also can be locked open like a kickstand. The back of the case also has a kickstand built in. I love how rugged it feels while still maintaining a slimmer profile!! Would definitely buy again for my next phone!!!!
 It is nice , love it
 The sleep/ wake button on this zizo case has too much rubber causing power downs . Trimming this piece worked , the 2 piece design is hard to separate for install and removal. Once trimmed to a functional level this zizo looks good and feels great. Kick stand and lanyard are features new to me but love them
 Very pleased with this case &amp; belt clip. Have been using another brand heavy duty bulky case for years. Wanted something lighter weight &amp; less bulky but tough. This Zizo fits the bill!!
 This is NOT compatible with an iphone 8
 I have 3 other interchangeable covers (colors) that I use. I live them all . Excellent product - well thought out. I usually order direct. This worked. Thanks
 I love the holster .... hard to find.. I  am on my third only be cause I lost the first two .. I’m a realtor and need all hands on deck so this is perfect !! Good quality and takes abuse ... I drop my phone daily  lol
 Love the product real tough will buy again from seller
 Awesome case!!
 Fast shipping excellent quality
 This is an AWESOME PHONE CASE! Dropped my phone on concrete floor at work, twice, and it totally protected it. It also looks good.<br/>Thumbs UP 👍🏽
 The case is good quality and the glass was easy to put on. It was nice everything was in one package. I haven't used the clip on case.
 I got it for my step mom &amp; she absolutely loves it.
 This is the second phone case I buy from Zizo. This case provides great protection without being too bulky. It has a good grip to it and the back stand is awesome! Great product, Zizo!
 Wish I had gotten another one when I could
 The kickstand broke right out of the box.
 The tampered glass included with each cover is not good quality ... It effected touch screen
 It is obviously a hard case, but it’s too tight. It felt like I was going to break my phone trying to get my phone out. The discription says it will fit both iPhone 7 and 8 pluses, but it’s only for an iPhone 7+.
 The case is sleek and well made. some very slight prduct quality faults but nothing to effect the look or protection provided by the case. Thank you so much for a phone case I can trust
 Outstanding, lightweight but still great protection.  Love it!
 When box was opened on Christmas morning we discovered that the lens cover was cracked. Sent it back and waiting for the replacement.
 Clip broke a month after purchase.
 Great case!<br/>Cheap and very sturdy doesn't bulk up the phone at all.<br/>I have little hands and was worried it was gunna add more bulk to the phone but it doesn't!
 Nice vibrant colors with a good feel to the case, the belt clip is a good addition though the grandson probably won't use it "cool factor" and the screen protector included make it a 5 star
 It was broken when I opened the box, pile of junk!
 This case would be 5 stars, however I have only had this case for around 2 months and the kickstand has broken off. Id love to hear back from the seller about this. Case itself is extremely durable, definitely worth the money!
 I liked the case, but, it was defective. I couldn’t make the on/off button work.
 I like the case.
 This is my fourth one I buy for family and friends, fits good and after dropping it nothing happened to the phone. Plus awesome price and love the colors.
 I LOVE THIS CASE WAYYYYYYY BETTTER THAN AN OTTERBOX!!!! It WIL actually fit in your pocket
 When installed it applies pressure to the on/off switch constantly thus making it unusable. No matter how I adjusted it it would not work and would always show me the shut off screen when I would hold my iphone.
 Great design and super durable.<br/>Thanks
 Spend maybe 5 more dollars on a quality case. Not worth it.
 works good
 It was a gift for my dad and he loved it. Thank you
 Looks as good as advertised
 Exactly as promised.. from color to design. Instructions where clear and case fits my new iPhone 7plus like a glove. Case does not make my phone feel bulky,  I actually have a better grip and feels more secure. great product...
 This is an iPhone 6+ case that they have repackaged to be a 7+. It has openings for the headset jack and other things that the 7+ does not have. That could be workable, but the power button does not work. When the case is on you can't turn the phone off. This is going back.
 Great product and fast delivery....sturdy and heavy duty case.
 I didn't like it and sent it back. It was defective. It wouldn't activate the power button. Also, it makes your phone very thick. Too clunky.
 Got my phone case.  Love it!!!  So sturdy it’s almost hard to get it on the phone.  Love the accessories you get with it also.  My phone will stay safe in this case !
 I ordered this case for my husband when we upgraded to iPhones 8 Plus, it's rugged and hopefully will prevent him from cracking phone.  So far he has dropped phone without breakage.
 best ever cover you ever need...plus glass....
 Love it !!!! One of the best cases I ever had !
 durable fits the phone nicely looks great too
 I like the color combinations as well as the obvious durability of your product
 Love the look and feel of the case.  Only issue I have is the power button does not work while in the case.  Also randomly it pops the swipe to shut off phone.  I'm guessing the case is not lined up with the power button
 Looks good and protects phone. Bought for my 13yo. Fast delivery.
 The product is strong and protects the Phone great....nice case
 Just what I was looking for.  Good looking and great protection for my phone.  I recommend it.
 Wow totally impressed for a case under 20 bucks! The only thing is was the screen protector didn't stick but I don't like using those things anyway.  The case has a good grip and the belt clip is sturdy will use it when I go for my hikes and walks around town..
 Awesome value, best case I've bought. You get so much for so little, very well designed and thought out. I bought 3, one for a iPhone 5, 5s and 7plus. I'm really happy  with the form, fit &amp; function. With the lanyard, my wife has stopped loosing her phone now as well!
 Good quality product , will order another one  and item arrived promptly no hassles  very pleased
 Case is too tight for iPhone 8 Plus and keeps the power on
 Second Zizo Bolt Cade I’ve bought for two different phones and there’re awesome. Sharp looking, easy to grip. As long as this company is around I will continue to buy them
 I love everything about the phone case except the fact power button piece is to tight on my actual power button on my iphone 7 plus. So the power button is always held down and you can be sent to the power off screen sometimes randomly or you take random screen shots trying to unlock your phone. But I found ways around it.
 Case is great for protecting the new investment. I don't particularly care for the tempered glass protector though; my wife went through at least five before she gave up on them for a more traditional screen protector. All in all a great product from a family owned company.
 Great case
 This case is awesome!
 Great case.
 I love this case and use it when I'm out with the dog or doing anything outdoors like that so I can clip it on and I know that if it somehow falls (my dog is known to chase many things with me in tow) that it will be well protected in this case.
 Got my phone case and it is broke the back part for he stand is broken off  and bent
 Great case for your iPhone.  I like the fact that it comes with neck strap and holster clip.  I recommend this cover for protecting your iPhone.
 This case is excellent!  Was recommended by a friend who is a professional firefighter who loves the case!  Durable, stands up to tough environment, and at one-tied the cost of other cases is a tremendous deal.  I highly recommend it.
 I like it!  Nice price and it looks great!
 good
 Wrong size
 Love it. Really good protection for my phone I attach a paratrooper cord to it and it became a really hand held
 LOVE IT! Light weight but durable. Dropped my phone several times on the asphalt and it is unharmed!
 Great phone case have had on for over a year now... color is starting to fade
 Perfect hip carry IPHONE holder. Great price, good protection and convenient carry.
 I have only had product for two days, but so far it is working as advertised.<br/>Product is quality and seems to be as advertised.t
 Nice case, unfortunately this case is not for a IPhone 7 plus, sold as a 7plus but it’s really for an IPhone 6 plus. Cannot turn the power on/off with the case on the phone, even when pressing really hard. However, it works just fine on the IPhone 6plus. Returning this one.
 Best Holster and case on the market.
 I received this case and the Holster broke and the company replaced it for free.  I love this item and would recommend to anyone looking for superior protection of your Iphone!!
 Just got the case and iPhone.  Case and glass work great, perfect fit, buttons all work.  Older reviews stated they had issues with buttons.  Possible that the case may have been updated by Zizo, but not now.  I would buy again.
 Wore it one day. Belt clip came off my belt and case fell on the floor with phone. Retaining clip holding phone onto case snapped off when it hit the floor. Belt clip which holds the phone is now useless. Would not recommend if it breaks this easily,.
 My husband and I both LOVE our cases! Exactly what we wanted! Full protection with a cool looking design yet not too heavy like the otter boxes
 Very nice
 Bad product ..bad quality ..
 Very sturdy yet slim case. I am happy with it
 Fantastic case and fits my iPhone 7 plus perfect!! Buttons are not to stiff like other posts are claiming. This case also comes with a tempered glass and fits perfect!<br/><br/>This case is wonderfully made and I totally feel like my phone is protected if I drop it. Highly recommend!
 GREAT!!!!!!! This case is made like otter box cases from the phone store. I would definitely buy this case again
 Excellent product. Very safe and reliable. The best protection for my phone
 It looks nice but the case didn’t line up with the power button on my phone. There for it will not work with an iPhone 8 Plus.
 It came quick and is actually more we expected. Fit perfect on the phone and with husband who is in construction...works great. Hopefully he won't lose this phone...haha
 It dose not fit you have to cut the thing so your phone dose not cut off on the back of the button. And when you get it on the phone it dose not fit so you have too put it back on all day. I will not get this any more. The two is it's made good but dose not fit good so it up too you
 good snug fit early delivery
 this case is awesome
 This is actually one of the best phone cases i have owned. The belt clip is really handy along with the strap which pairs nicely for an extra precaution. So my final word and review for this case is that it is worth it. :)
 I like how slim the case is. It feels solid in my hand and really does help protect it. Only negative is that when the kickstand is diployed the volume controls are under the phone. But this is a minor detail.
 Nice, slim wish it was full coverage don't like the stick on glass cover.
 It seems like it's made of good quality material, the only thing that I have a small issue with this is the clip is the opposite side where it's supposed to be I'm a righty not a lefty. There should be ones for lefty and rightys
 Great case strong and durable
 It came sooner than expected fits great love the color and it is very rugged I would recommend this case to anyone looking for a case that’s reasonably priced and does what it’s supposed to do
 Great case. Only problem is that I had to cutout where the volume buttons go with a knife because I could not press the buttons way too stiff. Overall good product.
 Top quality.  More than I expected. Very reasonable price.
 Love my case!!
 I like the product is coming with all accessories and cover for screen
 Does a good job of protection
 My product was prepared and shipped quickly. It was packed well upon receiving. The item was exactly as described and was easy to put on the phone. Very durable and could not be happier with this product!
 Nice design unfortunately the secondary rubber housing for the power button was not aligned to my IPhone 7 plus, causing my device to malfunction. I had to improvise to make the case compatible with my device.
 The case is nice but it has some flaws. I don't like that parts of the plastic are not flush and stick out a little. I am a bit OCD but for the price I want a perfect case. Shipping and description were on point and it looks good otherwise.
 Excellent product and outstanding customer service.  Case fits my Iphone 8 plus perfectly. Light case for a large phone.
 I love my new case so far it’s my favorite case I have. Guess it’s because I’ve not see anyone with this case.  Thank you
 Had this case for a year. Haven't had any crack and have dropped the phone plenty of times. Very durable for the price
 very pleased. I like the support on the back of the case
 I got the cover for my teenager nephew as a gift and he’s super happy !
 Love it
 Thing broke in two weeks
 Very helpful and friendly service!
 Item arrived 2 days ahead of scheduled delivery. First off that is a huge bonus as I have a new iPhone 7 and was not able to use it until I had a case. The case is very sturdy and easy to install. The best part is that it came with a glass screen protector. I would highly recommend this case to all and will buy again.
 Got my new iPhone 7+ and this case is perfect for it. Had no issues applying the included screen protector and the case. Very strong holster and kick stand. Even the holster serves as a stand for when you need the iPhone to stand on its tall side because the clip snaps in place. And it looks very cool.
 Perfect :) been thoroughly tested by a Mama of 3 boys and it's held up. Surprised actually, but a very good and sturdy case :(
 This actually went on my 8 plus I like the design and the kickstand. So far I have dropped my phone a few times without any damage to case or phone. Would recommend it to a friend.
 It’s a great case.very durable.
 Great product.
 Amazing case
 Love it got one for me and my daughter and she likes it and so do I.
 If you want to turn up your volume good luck. You can't close your phone either. I will say the best feather is the color.
 A great high quality case
 I really like the Zizo Bolt Series Case.  It was everything as described.  Looks great and feels great in your hand.  With the 7Plus being such a large phone I wanted something that had a good grip/feel.
 This case is everything I hoped for!  Sort of wish the strap/ring was on the lower right corner, though I knew that when I ordered.
 Great case...was exactly what they said it was.  I have dropped my phone 4 times and it did it's job and not a scratch on the case or phone.  I do wish the Rose Gold matches my phone a little better but it still looks great.
 Good material ,heavy duty
 Protection A1
 This is my 3rd Zizo case... absolutely love them. Great quality and protects phone very well!!
 I love the case, but my kickstand lasted about a week before it broke. I would purchase again.
 did not work for me!
 Kick stand plastic broke as soon as I took it out of the package, not very well made I will be returning this immediately.
 Lime the case but had to trim the power button with a razor blade to keep it from turning phone off. Maybe a design fix as have seen other comments about he same issue.
 Case clips keep breaking, bought two and both broke. Case is good but belt clips suck.
 I had an issue with the power button being pressed by the phone case. I asked for a replacement and had the same issue. I then used a dremel tool to grind down the inside of the button on the case and the issue was resolved and everything now works perfectly. Overall I really like this case.
 Love my Zizo case.  Seems to be tough and like the stand. Thank you
 Cool looking case and strong.
 Looks great but case is too tight and keeps trying to power down my phone and wont allow me to use the side buttons on phone I would not recommend purchasing for iPhone 7plus wish I could because this is a really sturdy neat looking case
 Made the side buttons to hard to push.
 Like it very much.
 Case exceeds my expectations!!!!!
 Case seems durable and fits good. I ordered the royal blue that's pictured but got a dull navy blue. I didn't want to spend time sending everything back for an exchange of a different color and end up getting a different color again.
 Just got my case delivered today, I was so happy how it looks like. So classy and I would simply say, " Perfect fit". The materials,.....so elegant. I am ordering a white one soon. Cant wait to show it to my friends.
 Phone doesn't securely lock into holster and holster does not lock on to a belt or MOLLE
 good for the price... fits
 Wry hard case. Make your iPhone looks tough
 Great case!  I like how it feels in my hand. The ridges on the sides keep it from slipping out of my hand. Completely covers up the ugly rose gold color of the case :-)
 I love this case, it fits great, nice and tight and snug and is everything as advertised. So much better than otterbox. I would like to see a more variety of color combos for the iPhone 7+. Great job, great case
 Great phone case very strong and durable and bring ease to your hand whenever you’re holding it ..great product
 Thank you
 Did not work for me.Could not press buttons for them to respond appropriately.In all fairness may be my fault but the instructions were suboptimal.
 The power button is too deep forcing my phone to want to shut down CONSTANTLY!  WISH I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED!
 Great case. Quality product.
 Very surprised for the price. On par with Otterbox and less than half the price. The kickstand is a little tough to get out but it works!
 Case is great for price. Only negative is I wish their was more of a lip on the screen side.
 Very nice case,but be careful with screen protector very easy to crack when installed after it sits in cold mailbox not sellers fault,great case just got to get screen protector,I’m buying another one this week
 Not good quality
 I received the iPhone 8 plus case and few hours right after I put my phone on the clip broke 👀.what a joke! The product description says it is tested against breaks 👀! Wast of money!
 Light weight, slim &amp; seems very sturdy &amp;  well made.  The directions could be clearer.  I bought it so that I could carry it on a lanyard &amp; was pleased to discover when it arrived that the package included a lanyard.  I bought the rose gold to match my new iPhone 7 Plus &amp; it's a perfect match!
 Supposed to be military grade but the case broke when I put it on
 It's amazing even came with a lanyard too has everything you need to protect ur phone
 Great product,,great price,,,great service
 Product was not compatible with iPhone 8. So disappointed 😞
 Love the case.  Durable and has already saved my phone on a couple of drops.  I particularly like the stand on the back for watching movies on a plane ride. Highly recommended.
 Product arrived promtly but the case is defective, the hold/lock button stays depressed which causes phone to turn off unexpectantly or take screenshots. I would like an exchange. I love the case and want another one that works, i will return this one when the new one arrives.
 Second phone , second case. Old phone is like new after removing it from the case
 Power button doesn't function when in the case.  The outer plastic layer was separating from the layer below.  Looks nice but doesn't work.
 I bought this case for my son. He loves it and it’s very durable! It was not amazon prime but we received it in less than a week. It was shipped the day after I placed my order.
 This case is great but i ordered it for the 8plus and it said it would fit but it Says the case is for a 7....it was quite the squeeze.
 Manly
 I got it for my husband and he loved it
 Very sturdy great looking case.  Fits perfectly and I love the stand on it
 Great case so far!  My husband was very pleased with how slim it was. It fits in his pocket comfortably where the otter box was very bulky.
 They sent me  another case a different color, it fit my iphone 8+ just fine, Looks to be a sturdy and well made case, very satisfied
 Great for work!
 Just got this in the mail and it’s broke
 Junk
 The absolute Best Case for my Iphone 7plus!  I simply love it
 I would give the Zizo a 5 star but the glass screen didn’t even make it out of my hands before it broke
 I love the rose gold color. The product itself is the best. I only use these durable phone cases on any of my phones.
 Great, very good back protection and easy to install!
 Great case so far. Think it will wear well
 Buttons are to hard and do not work when pressed.
 The color is way off but the quality more than makes up for it
 Great Product! Definitely protecting my phone and looks good with the matte black Iphone 7
 It was not made clear that the cases front cover would not attach on the back. That makes the front cover useless.
 Seriously this is one of the best phone case I ever brought! All the phone cases I brought before just so not doing its job right! But not this one, this phone just so good at protecting my phone! First time in my life my phone can stay with for so long !
 Great feeling case but I wasn’t able to use volume buttons. I also couldn’t turn off the screen as the case was too rigid. Ended up returning it.
 Part of the clip came broken therefore unusable
 I am surprised. It is a really nice quality protective case that isn't bulky. Love it and the design. Ordering more
 Was just I was looking for at a great price
 I share ups be able to get a replacement. The screen cracked just falling from bed to face down on hard flooring.
 The case is nice and sturdy, but the side clasp breaks somewhat frequently.  In fact this purchase was due to my old one breaking.
 I have purchased zizo cases for my past 4 phones. All of them fit well. Protection is great. Only had issues with tempered glass on phones with a curved display. I highly recommend this case. Has not let me down yet
 Owned these type of cases for previous products so I ordered one for my iPhone 7 Plus. Extremely satisfied. Very durable and light. Looks very nice and really protects my phone. This by far one of the best cases out there! Good job!
 This is my second case one previously for my 5se and now for my 8 plus.  Great case!!! fit is perfect. Protective features outstanding.
 Bought this for my sons new phone!  He loves it, loves that it is military grade!  So do I he already dropped the phone!  Thank goodness for the case!
 Very pleased with the case. It seems very durable and better looking than an Otterbox.  The screen protecter cracked as we pulled it out of the box. Not a deal breaker for me. I typically don’t use them.
 LOVE IT
 Bought this for my husband for his IPhone 7 plus. He showed me this morning that his screen was cracked from dropping it on the bathroom floor. The screen needs replaced. This case isn't what it is stated to be.
 Strong, functional protection for precious iPhone 7.  Dropped it already once and haven't worried about survival of the phone.  Would heartily recommend this product
 The buttons press in easily, great feel to the case, and I've gotten compliments on it the first day at work. The standing clip helps me when I'm cooking and checking recipes. Would Recommend 10/10.
 Kick stand broke after 2 weeks.
 I broke the belt clip holster getting out of my car yesterday and could not find a replacement without buying the whole case again with it.
 Awesome looks/ designs!  Not so bulky design makes it better than pelican and or otterbox cases, but holster often breaks. I've already replaced mine 3 times.<br/><br/>Product is really good, except for the holster part. I will still give you guys four stars....
 Belt clip part broke in 3 days.... waste of money
 The back part of the case broke in under a month! It feels sturdy but don't go cheap with your phone case. The color will also fade fast!
 It’s a good case, at a good price. I got it for my father, he enjoys it. The black silicon came a bit damaged, but it’s hardly noticeable so overall great product
 Love this case have had one on the suoer fragile galaxy s7edge and protected that until I traded it in for the iPhone 8plus and have a brand new one on this awesome phone
 You cannot access the right hand button to turn phone screen off. Had to cut mine out and shut it off by other means.
 After putting the case on my new iPhone 7+, people couldn't hear me when I called them. When I took the case off, they could hear me fine.
 This case fits my phone perfectly. It functions as it should. And it way more affordable than the previous case I had
 Case looks ok and the texture isn't bad but the lock button does not line up correctly and will not lock the phone/turn it on or off! Terrible design Ana's basically just an iPhone 6 Plus case being sold as iPhone 7 plus (note the hole on the bottom of the case for headphones)...
 The worse cover I had ever get really bad quality it last just about a week or two. I never have seen something as bad as this.
 This is one of the best phone cases I have ever had. I'd recommend this to anyone
 Cell phone
 Little hard to maneuver but solid
 Very well made, priced right
 Love it! Better than I thought, kickstand is great, awesome product, blows away all the other cases I’ve had, my Qi charger works great with it as well!
 All I can say you get what you pay for... this case does not protect the phone or is it waterproof
 Very happy with the case so far. I would recommend this case to others. It’s built and design well. I would purchase again
 Great product
 Great case but the stand in the back broke within a week.
 Will not work with iPhone 8 plus
 Perfect fit!  Just as described!!
 Had a small issue, reseller took care of it immediately.  Great case, even better customer support!!!
 The belt clip stabs into my side when I sit down. I'm a slim person, but I can trim down the sharp edges. But the phone cover and screen cover is nice.
 I love the new iPhone 7 plus case by Zizzo. I may even get another case in different color
 Low quality material
 Excellent. I recommend this to anyone
 Got my case today. They must have fixed the power button issue I read so much about because this one fits my 7 plus like a glove and all buttons work just fine. This case has a very comfortable feel I love it!!
 I love this case
 The case design looks very nice but the one I received is unfortunately defective. The on/off button is constantly being pushed by the case, so the phone is  showing the "swipe to turn off" screen all the time. First wasted my time for it to arrive and now have to return it. Very disappointed 😔
 Is a rugged case that fits perfectly
 Fits great and protects welll
 junk
 Great case. I love the feel. It's slim but very protective.
 Case is nice looks good fast shipping
 I absolutely LOVE the protection that this phone case provides. It’s stylish too! Received lots of compliments. Thank you.
 The case is good, the screen protector was cracked when I received it in the mail. Would have a higher rating if
 Case fit my 8plus but the glass screen protector lifted the next day, and the kick stand is really hard to open, it feels like I’m going to break a nail when trying open it
 The first thing to break is the stand. Then the case broke on the first drop. It has a rugged look but the quality is just not there.
 I’m really happy with my new case! Most important, my asset is protected!
 Great case at a low price!!!!  Protects without bulk.  Need to ditch the lanyard idea, would rather be able to flip the phone over while in the belt clip
 Exactly what I was looking for! Sturdy and durable, but not bulky. Fast and free shipping. I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends.
 If you break your phone while it's in this thing, it's really not the case. It's you.
 Este producto no tiene calidad
 Amazing case!  Feels very secure in your hand and will certainly give your phone superior protection. So many extras that you won't get with cases costing twice as much!!
 The peach color case is slippery. I just realized that it is a different material from my husband's black and green case and I am disappointed with the grip. His is more of a silicon case which I prefer. I can no longer exchange it.
 Love this case!! Way better than Otterbox, would definitely buy again! Nice tecture, fits perfectly and love the lanyard option!! 👍🏼 Great buy.
 Really nice case.  Due to its design, very easy to grip in you hand.  Once you take off the belt clip, not a very bulky case (easy to place in a pocket).  Very happy with this case.
 It’s a tough looking case too bad it was all warped and pressed all the buttons at same time causing it to shut down and the screen protector didn’t stick
 So far all is good.
 The phone case seems nice but the holster clip broke before we even got to use it.
 This case is sweet can't wait to put it on my iPhone  and it's even packaged kinda cool haha !!
 Love my case!  It is rugged and still small enough not to feel bulky. Screen protector is great. It is thicker than most and doesn't take anything away from the "touch" of the screen. Above anything is the customer service and price. These guys are top notch.
 Terribly designed for the iPhone 7 plus. Don't recommend this at all it's also not as durable as it looks on the info. Doesn't cover the charging port either. That's a big one. Bottom is designed for a phone with a head jack and as we all know the 7's do not have a headphone jack
 This has been a good cover but watch out for the built in kick stand.  It broke within 2 months after recovering the case.
 Lock button and volume button would not work. Barely could get it on. Feels tough but not functional with my phone i guess
 My clip was broke as soon I took it out the box
 Great case, durable and sleek looking. It's great for my work phone and keeps it protected. The included belt clip has been really nice also.
 Love it!!!!
 I like the case, it is nice and sturdy. Also has a nice grip around it. I am still little skeptical about the holster, being that it's so thin. However, it is still holding on its own.
 Received item a day early. Very tough case. Not sure if it’s a protective as Otter but hope so. Very comfortable to hold and doesn’t slip around your fingers. I would definitely buy this again.
 Can is very sturdy, very solidly built offers outstanding protection. Assembling it to the phone was harder than expected which did not live up to assembly instructions. The protective hard face protector was harder to put in place than anticipated and it took several tries to get it on properly  The most disappointing aspect is the fact that the face protector need to be wider. There Is a small gap from side to side which is frustrating. One must try to center it perfectly for the proper fit. Disappointing to say the least. The hard part of the shell is challenging to put in place, there is no flexibly at all which is distracting. Once in place it fits very snug. This case protection is as good as Otters cases are except that Zizo should take a hint from Otter cases and incorporate the screen protector as part of the case itself,this would be easier to assemble as offer better protection. The face protector also does not offer any additional protection from moisture. Something this company should consider in future models.
 Looks good but breaks easy
 ***UPDATED***<br/>I purchased 2 cases and they made my iPhone 7 plus wig out...I cannot seem to get the issue resolved with Amazon or Zizo...<br/>I do not recommend these cases at this time!<br/>The tempered glass screen protector is great...<br/>Thank you!
 Hubby received his iPhone 7P today and immediately put it in his new Zizo Bolt case. The fit is great and the case is made of quality material. Depending on wearability of the case, he said he would definitely order again.
 Got it and it didn't fit.... even made sure i checked the size three times before ordering 😢
 I really like the quality! Like the idea that is is custom to my phone. Has cut outs for the inputs and speakers.<br/><br/>Thanks Zizo!<br/>Dennis Conklin<br/>Scotts, MI
 Love this case. However, some of the quality is alittle subpar. Only had two days and the kick stand snapped while trying to flip out to show the case off.
 Sturdy case but had to take off some of the inner liner to keep the power button from constantly being pushed. A bit too bulky for my taste.
 Nice well build case only disliked is that the holster only fit one way
 Great product. I love it. My phone feels so secure in my hands. I wanna throw this over the Golden Gate Bridge and most likely the phone will survive. (Don’t do that...)
 Zizo phone case is the real deal, good price. Safe case and it also came with a glass screen cover. Thank you again for deliver my case quick now am enjoying my new Iphone 8 plus.
 Gray case the one I received was to tight around the buttons so my volume continuesly adjusted and the phone tried to power down endlessly... so I just removed it
 Case seems to be made for left handed persons, and the belt clip has broken already, but I still use the case around the phone itself.
 Very good case, it makes the phone to have a grip.
 Very well made .I love mine
 Works well and fits perfect, exactly as expected
 Love my new Zizo case. Not too bulky, looks good at a reasonable price. Time will tell how the belt clip holds up. So far very satisfied!
 It looks good and it seems to be protecting my phone but I broke the thing that attaches to my belt to hold the phone I broke it today getting out of car😩
 I love my Zizi case. I really love that it comes with the tempered glass! My only problem is the same thing that I've encountered with other cases is that I keep breaking belt clips! Luckily the Zizo cases are a great price and hold up well.
 I liked that it fit perfectly with my IPhone 8 Plus, even though it was made for an IPhone 7 Plus. All keys and buttons work flawlessly, and works very well.<br/>No dislikes!
 I have loved zizo products throughout 3 different cases now. Very protective and durable and always the correct product.
 very stylish and keeps your phone safe.  If has three ways to carry your phone: in your hand with the great looking case, on your belt the belt clip case and around your neck with the lanyard.
 I love it!! Best case I’ve owned in quite some time!! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing case
 Customer service must not exist, belt clip broke with in 2 weeks and Mindy responded to my emails, built very cheap, not worth it if they won’t back their product
 Great products durable and looks good
 My customer was very pleased
 really tough case! good price! Thank you!
 There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product. It was that I have a different type of phone. I will use this company again.
 Perfect fit for my iPhone 7 Plus. I can see this case (and screen protector) saving my phone in an accidental drop. Quality, fit and operation just as advertised. I would purchase this all over again.
 Good thank you
 Very nice I don’t know why negative reviews mine fits perfectly and all buttons work fine
 Cheap made.
 Tuff glass works great made a mistake and ran over phone pealed off glass and not a scratch on it
 Love the color and look, haven't got to try it yet, still waiting for my phone
 Product sent to me defective by manufacturer.  Fits iPhone 7 plus in case but due to defect the camera lense is partially blocked by the case.  What's going on here Zizo?
 My mom loves this... protects well
 Great Case. No Complaints
 Awesome case! It's very durable and looks awesome!
 I absolutely love my case... the clip is handy and so is the detachable ribbon that can hang around your neck and be hands free.
 I'll call it average.  The kick stand broke the first time it was accessed.
 Great product at a good price.
 Just what I saw in the picture. Also came with screen protector and holder . Heavy duty , what I was looking for to prevent damage to my phone .
 Protects my iPhone and works as advertised.
 I love this case. It's very sturdy and the belt clip works well. It gets a 4 star however because the tempered glass that came with the case was already cracked when I received it.
 WOW!!  Great product for the price.  Feels great, fits phone like a glove, screen protector awesome.  Great customer service, will buy again.  Been using it for a month or so around construction, it's holding up great.
 I thought it would be more Heavier case then what I expected wasn’t happy with it but I kept it gave it away
 Clip broke within a week of use and screen protector cracked a week later. Loved the case felt good and easy to handle
 Nice
 kick stand broke
 Don't recommend for iPhone 7 plus it don't fit at all.. to make it fit I had to cut the lock button out just for it to work. And I dropped it and busted my screen
 The glass protector arrived cracked.
 Love this case!  Same size as an otter box commuter but feels like it's a lot stronger!
 The screen cover falls off and the case is hard to keep clean.
 It’s a great product, I just have to return mine because I ordered the wrong on for my phone.
 Good quality case for the right price. The belt clip needs to be made a little thicker I barley sat down in a chair and it barley caught the edge and it broke
 The case is durable and simple to install on the phone.. the kickstand comes in handy for me also.. best part is it comes with a good screen protector in the package so it’s all in one no need to buy extra pieces
 Very nice case, will be ordering more for others in our family.  Protective and cool looking.
 Perfect
 Power button did not work at all!!! Very tight fit almost afraid it would break my phone
 Just received my case, and I love it. Fits very snug and the case isn’t to bulky. Very nice color. I’ll be buying the orange one once they restock their supply!
 Love these cases light weight,slim,and very durable like these case just as good as a otter box but 1/3 of the price!!!
 Case is exactly as described. Has all the features that were important to me. It is a gift for my son who does remodeling &amp; construction. So it needs to be substantial! Product has 30 day warranty, but didn't see that in the description.
 Protective
 Amazing product !!👍🏻😊
 Material is hard. The power button is quite hard and puts some pressure to the button where sometimes my husband's phone would ask if he wanted to turn off the phone. Overall, it's a sturdy case.
 My husband really likes this case! He needed something very durable and that is what we got in this case! He has already put in a request for more colors!
 My grand son received a new IPhone 7 for a combined birthday and Christmas present<br/>I ordered this case to help PROTECT this expensive phone ... He LOVES IT!
 This case would have easily got a 5 star if the power button worked. It seems that it was pushed into the case too far. Case is very slim and feels like a high end case. The belt holster does the job and they gave it extra detail to match the look and feel of the case.
 Seems well built and fit well on iPhone 8 plus. Didn't care for the included lanyard but handy for people who would use it. Kickstand is a nice touch.
 Great product for the price! Durable, easy to install. I was very pleased.
 I love this item. The product fit very well to my iPhone 6 Plus, I recommend it
 Don’t order I bought this case, buttons were so stiff it never worked. Should have returned it when I bought it. Thought buttons would loose up but never did. It’s garbage I thru it away.
 good
 Got it for my 17 year old son. He is really picky about his cases so I was a little hesitate but I read the reviews and they were really good. He loves this case so much.
 I love this case for my iPhone 8+ vary nice and fits amazing. I will always make my purchase with Zizo. 😀 super fast delivery thx!
 Superb Design &amp; Perfect Fit for iPhone 7 plus. Great color too!
 I still don't know how to open kick stand.
 The only issue with this case is I could not engage the button to lock the phone.  After watching some videos online I saw that many people had this complaint and the resolution was to cut the button off of the case, after doing this I have had no problems getting to the lock button,
 Look is really clean, kickstand works well, screen protector works like it should, I just don't like the laniard piece at the top.
 Bullit proof case and cool looking too<br/>Only thing I'd change is to be able to remove belt clip.<br/>I had to cut mine off. Don't like belt clips but wanted the added protection on the front
 I have bought 3 or these cases for my husband.  He is rough on cases and works in extreme conditions.  This case has saved his phone every time!!
 didn't fit phone properly, buttons leave pressure on power button and try to turn phone off, its made for older model and they re selling for iphone 7plus, screen protector isn't right size, checked via micrometer its not worth the money
 Just that’s a little use to. But the product seems to be fine.
 It is a grate product. It has a slim design, kick stand on case as well as the hip clip. The lander I a nice option and it comes with protection glass.
 The fold out kickstand on the back broke while attempting to deploy it.
 Great phone case!! Much slimmer than the larger I Phone 7+ cases that are out there at a fraction of the cost.<br/>It came with a tempered glass, a lanyard and a belt holder.<br/>Highly recommend this product!!
 Great case, but belt clip broke after 2 weeks of having phone case. Had to purchase a whole new case.
 Very nice case and came with more than I was expecting. Very happy with the purchase.
 I really like the case it’s awesome and I can’t wait to buy a other from you guys
 This case fits tightly over my phone.  Love it.
 Cases for iPhone 8 seem nice ,buttons on 8+ did not work, did not come with tempered glass screen protectors but plastic. Clip broke off belt phone holder for iPhone 8
 Great case, lasted me a year on deployment in the desert, would buy again.
 Completely product in all ways!!
 Great case but kick stand is not very durable
 Sucked the buttons weren't even functional and it was way to hard to get off and on when needed!
 Case works great with iPhone 8 Plus they repacked the holder when it broke right away great Customer service!
 Clip already broken.
 This case did not fit the iPhone 7 plus. The design of it made the phone continuously turn off and on.  I could not return because I had it too long.  I also purchased a black one and that color fit just fine.  It is something with the with this color.
 Over all I really like it just was it didn’t look so cheap I doesn’t feel cheap or anything but just doesn’t look that way.
 A very light and easy to install case. Love the fact it has a belt clip and I use the lanyard to insure my phone does not fall
 Fits perfectly and looks great.
 I bought this for my dad. He loved it. It's a great case.
 The one for my I phone 6s the box was already opened before and the clip was broke on the holder I will not<br/>be purchasing anymore Zizo cases not a good product looked like it had been used already
 Works great for my phone.
 Love my Bolt! Lanyard, holster and belt clip.
 Durable
 Case pushes on the power button and had to take it out of the case.
 The case is great ! I do not trust the clip it made me change cases with only 1week of use .
 Phone case ripped putting it on my phone, first time my phone dropped on our house floor the plastic split
 very easy to use. the belt clip can be used as a stand like the case can be. the belt clip has a wider range of angles because of the rotation it does. i can see many years of great use and repeat business to come.
 Very pleased with my zizo case. It is durable and sturdy but not heavy and bulky
 My husband loves this phone case.  It's every bit as good as the Otter ( which we purchased from the Verizon store for our last phone ). It includes the screen protector. Had we purchased the Otter and screen protector at the Verizon store, we would've paid $100.
 It really was what they said!! I love it!!
 As for feel in the hand, this case is great, the kick stand however broke within a week of getting the case.
 This is a great phone case for the iPhone 7 Plus but, when I put the phone in the case, the sleep/wake button was being pushed in all the time by the case.  I had to shave off some material from the inside of the case to take the pressure off the sleep/wake button.
 As advertised
 Poorly and cheaply designed. When applied to the phone the lock button is constantly depressed making it impossible to use phone with case on. Belt clip is very thin plastic and appears it won't hold up for long. Very disappointing in something supposed to be "mil spec"
 Can't even press the power/lock button coz it's too tight. It's already pressing itself.
 Cheap, junky product.
 the kick stand breaks easily.<br/>I've had the product just for a couple week and the kick stand is already broken.
 Seen so many reviews about this product. Well I'll tell you all this was a GREAT buy. Now my IPhone 7+ doesn't fell so bulky, the power button works properly. If I needed to buy it again I would without a question.
 This is a super nice case the sides are perfect grip for the 7plus. I will order more zizo products. This case compares in strength and durability to a otterbox symmetry case for a fraction. Of the price With Temper Glass included
 Great protection
 Fit fine and seems to be a decent phone cover. Ask me in a year!
 It’s strong. Easy to put on. I don’t know how many times I’ve dropped it and not a scratch on it!  Best purchase in a long time.
 Loved this case until the part that clips onto the belt clip broke 3 months after purchase.
 I would not recommend this item to anyone! Zizo made it very difficult to return and were very argumentative!!
 Excellent case
 Broke off the clip after the first week. A week later the stand in the back broke off. Really not the best buy
 its nice i like the look
 This was a really good phone case there was a few manufacturing faults some certain things but it still a good case
 This comes with everything you would need to protect your phone. It comes to with a very sturdy case, a great screen protector, a microfiber cloth, and a belt clip. I couldn't have spent $20 better.
 Well made case, I love it.
 The clip has already broken off the case and we haven't had it 45 days. Disappointed! The clip was a must for my disabled husband. We are very glad the phone was not lost.
 I love the look and feel of the case. The ridges help with grip and the color is outstanding. Great response from the Zizo team to help resolve a glass issue. I love great customer service.
 Best case on the market. Love it!
 Great phone case!! But this one and you will not be disappointed!!
 It is made for iPhone 6 plus disappointed it looks much better in the picture
 Kick stand broke second time I used it.
 On the fence.  Feels cheap but has nice grip.  The loop isn't needed.  Came from an otterbox and might go back to it only because I feel if I drop the phone in this case the phone will pop out of the case
 This case is a great buy compared to a more well know protective case like the Otterbox. I work in the wireless industry and would have no problem recommending this product
 Great case!!! Works perfectly with my new IPhone 8 Plus. Adds a little bulk, but that’s to b expected with this type of case. Belt clip is awesome
 I have been using this case for more than a week. Dropped my phone twice and rubbed it against all kinds of not so phone friendly surfaces. So far this case has held up very well.
 The tempered glass cover is very nice. The stand is also handy. Offering a tempered privacy glass would be nice. Overall the product seems to be what I was looking for.
 The holes on the case for the clip should be on both sides kind of a pain to have to make sure it's on the said to clip in
 Great case I recommend it to anyone who likes having their phone on their belt. I like never forgetting my phone anywhere, its always on my side. And the case is about indestructible!!! 2 thumbs up!!!
 Slim, ergonomic, sturdy...exactly what I wanted! Fully recommend!
 The security of having a string to hold the phone if it falls out if your hand
 Great product
 I bought this for my husband for his work phone and so far he loves it. Nice color and very protective.
 Love this. Easy to grasp onto. All others seem to slip right out of my hands.
 Love this case.Fits my new 7 Plus perfectly
 Great case but it’s for the iPhone 6plus not 7plus<br/>It has the head phone notch.
 First of all, I was very pleased with the durability and look of the case.  it was very economical with a very good feel. Only, thing i would improve would be more variety of color.
 12 hours into putting it on my phone the belt clip broke. Bought this case for the belt clip. Disappointed
 Slim, heavy duty and great to look at!
 Works well and looks good. The screen shield isn't the highest quality but it works for now.
 It is perfect case for save life IPhone. I look many cases but this case fitting, grips, stronger looking nicer. And excellent price, most part is tempered glass is free. Cost half then otter boxes. It is durable excellent protective and very cheap on this price.
 Lightweight
 Did not like case phone fit but none of the buttons on side of phone would work when in case took the loss through in garbage and ordered a different case
 Very nice case for the price it would be nice if it was orange.
 Great case, very sturdy. Easy access to buttons/functions.
 Awesome case and holder! Give it a 4 of 5 cause the hole in the case don’t match up with the apple logo! Really?!? You can’t match up the apple logo with the case?
 The belt clip broke the first time I put the phone in it. Do not know who to contact for help.
 It’s a great case but too bulky for me! Would recommend if you’re looking for serious protection not small/slim or pretty look
 The best case I've used yet. I work in construction an it is as sturdy an simplistic as I like. Great job
 The case is nice, feels good and works good, but the plastic backing won't stay flush with the inner case by the camera. Tried to take off and reinstall with no luck, also the tempered glass came cracked. I like it but will probably return.
 Disliked the product.Did not coincide with the iPhone 8 plus buttons.<br/>Product to stiff. Beautiful color
 It’s a good case, fits my iPhone 7+ perfectly. The lanyard tab is a bit goofy but that’s just nit picking
 The design is great but the case is not made from the most durable material.
 4 months and still 100% perfect shape. Love the lanyard as a safety for butterfingers! LOL
 When case arrived, I put it on my iPhone 7 Plus and it was so tight that it kept the power button pressed down. I had to use a knife to cut the side button off of the case in order for it to fit properly. Wouldn't order this case again.
 Works great
 I rarely write reviews. But, they shipped really quickly, and I really love this case, so if you're hesitating, just go for it. You'll be happy with it for sure.
 Fits I-Phone 8S.  Not sure what they are calling a glass front. Plexiglass maybe. Does not completely cover screen also.
 I absolutely love my new case. I will be a returning customer.
 Great price
 Super fast shipping. Case is pretty sweet. Quality was really impressive also. 👍🏻👍🏻
 Okay so I love the case There is only one thing about it that I'm not happy about The kick stand is so hard to remove I have to use a knife or screw driver to pry it open that being said I'll have to change cases because that was the main reason I bought it
 Great case! Protects phone well. Looks great, and easy to install. Tempered glass screen protector is a nice bonus!
 Good durable case.
 Durable, protective, impressive.
 Pretty solid case! Holster is a little flimsy by itself but still serves its purpose. Happy overall and color is on point with what I was looking for!👍👍 Fit is snug too
 Lo práctico que es me protege todo el teléfono sin aumentar mucho el tamaño del teléfono. Lo recomiendo
 thanks
 This is a great case , shipping was extremely fast ,great buy for the prince ,cases like these are normally expensive,cheap price great quality. Thank you
 Love the design of this case, however  the case does not fit my iPhone 7 Plus.  The power button does not work while in the case and the phone keeps cycling off on its own.  I will be returning this case for an Otter Box.
 Good case, good glass protector !
 Great quality and very durable. Like the stand makes it easy use apps and read books
 This product is a no go.<br/>Power button too tight on case, and doesn't work.<br/><br/>Maybe next time they'll get it right...
 Would have been a great case but it doesn't rest properly on the power button and the phone won't lock. And when the button does acknowledge the power is pressed it keeps the button down until the slide to power off screen appears.
 Have only had it for a short time but from the looks of it, it seem to be a durable case. Fits my iohone 7 plus beautifully.
 Great case! The second one I’ve purchased... wanted a new color for that “new phone look”. Also fair price and it shipped/arrived fast!
 Excelente
 Nice case, good price and durable.
 I have a iPhone 8 Plus, the window to display the Apple logo on the back of the phone did not align with the case. Not satisfied, would not recommend this case 👎
 Great app
 Like the look of this case. Kick stand is a nice feature and flips out easily . Case is easy to put on and easy to take off.
 The case was very hard to put on and take off. While I had the case on it was impossible to be able to press the lock button on the side of the case to open and close my phone. The volume buttons didn't want to work either. Loss of money buying this case.
 Broken
 So far phone fit was great. Material light and durable. Kick stand cheap.
 I love it! Cool, bright color (I bought red). Extremely durable. I’m considering purchasing more in other cool colors!
 Everything that I hoped it would be. Stylish, strong, and not too bulky. It is price correct. Better than a lot of other high priced brands out there. I am a happy customer of Zizo.
 My screen protector was damaged when I got it.thankfully my wife already had me a glass screen.and the phone was very hard to put it in the case.
 Love this case. rugged, and secures phone well. Love the lanyard. That's what I wanted. Lots of people have asked me about it.
 Second time that I buy this case excellent product and really good price I'll buy again in the future
 Love it. Love the color and the durability of it.
 I have only had it one day.  But I do like it.
 I love it gives the feel of a bigger phone
 Nice case for the price!<br/>Received when promiced!
 Love the colors. Love the kickstand. Love the lanyard.
 Love it !!! And looks good !
 I just want my money back  I  recommend  not to buy this case it fits really good but you can’t use the  Buttons  I cannot turn phone up or down
 came a couple days early, fits my Iphone 7 plus perfectly.
 I love this case!  Very durable and great investment
 This did not fit for my iPhone 8 Plus sadly
 It’s made  entirely of plastic iven the holster and it most fragile part and the holster broke in two. When I contacted them they didn’t respond
 Love my case. It comes with a strap so u can hold on to it better. It also has a good kickstand.
 Ruggedly built and included free tempered glass cover for phone screen!
 Love this case, have no issues
 Strong product to protect phone
 I receive Screen Protector broken<br/>Frist time happen to me I don’t know what I do
 Product looks exactly like the picture!  My husband bought this in the blue and when we upgraded our phones we both purchased this same case, but different colors.
 You asked for it Rocky, This case sucks. The lock button is constantly pressed even after trying to stretch out from the inside sending the phone to the "slide to off" screen. Look elsewhere if you want a good case.
 Love it
 This is the third case I ordered for my family we love them durable , sheek, and protective. 2 thumbs up!!
 Great sturdy case. Love it will buy another color.
 I was very impressed with my phone case for the price I bought it for! I have to have the holster cases and I found this one to be well thought out!
 perfect fir for my iphone 8 plus
 Case looks great....fits good.Although the tempered glass was broken but seems sturdy
 It's ok but I had to "shim" the case away from the phone with a piece of tape because it was so tight it was holding my power button down!! Very poor design.. the Chinese haven't gotten this design mastered yet!!
 Great case, durable, sleek, easy to hold. Love this case.
 Awsome case but its design more for a left hand person.
 I am very happy with this purchase.  I have an iPhone 8 Plus and it fits perfectly
 Never heard of ZIZO- but LOVE it! Very thin case but solid construction.. has a bit of texture so has a good grip. I picked the rose gold so it's a "pretty" color for a safe, heavy duty case.  Very impressed!
 I actually didn't hate it, I loved it, but I had to return it because, like multiple other reviewers have noted, the case holds the power button depressed, which obviously makes the phone unusable.  Too bad. It seems to be really well-made, it's great looking, and the line has a super selection of fun colors. But...well, you know...the phone needs to be able to work.
 Not bad!!!!
 As described for iPhone 7 plus
 This case is amazing, it has saved my phone from so many drops as I work in an industrial environment. I will definitely buy one for any future phone.
 Excellent case. Very durable and the design is cutting edge.
 The screen protector was nice addition but the case eventually started falling apart
 I love it!  Customer service:  amazing!
 Great case I dropped my phone and it bounced
 Great case and excellent value
 This product is WELL MADE!!  Fits like a glove on my IPHONE 7 PLUS.  There are no holes that match to the  IPHONE 6 Plus... It also came with the TEMPERED GLASS... I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
 This is such a great iphone case and great to have out in the field! Love that the screen protector is included!
 Perfect fit for my iPhone 7 plus! Dropped my phone a few times already and no issues, very durable
 Like the case. It is study and the thing i like about it is that it is not rubber so it is easy to slide in and out of your pocket also it  is not a lent collector.  Only thing is the clip does not fit once the phone is in the case. So will probably be sending it back.
 Great case for the price! The case is very durable and has two different ways to carry your phone. My husband loves the lanyard option and then being able to put it on his hip!
 Very happy with the case. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and the OtterBox was just too big. I was like carrying a text book. The Zizo case has a mush better feel.
 The case fit my iphone 7s perfectly. The quality is excellent, As close to Otterbox as I have found. The only reacon I did not give it a 5 star rating is the tempered screen cover had a little damage in the corner. I would recommend this product highly.
 Love the price, the look, and the ease of installation
 This case is very cool.  I ordered the case, received it 2 days later and it is exactly as the seller advertised
 Like that it's a no slip grip case, and is very sturdy. Don't have to worry about damaging the phone if it's dropped. Love it
 Great. Tough and sexy.
 Excellent phone case
 Yes
 This case rocks!  It is easy to grip and to keep your grip, the screen cover was easy to put on too.  Thanks for the awesome product and service.  Appreciate you!!
 Is so great I am enjoying it thanks you so much
 Great product
 The bottom to the left side is too hard isn't work. Bad quality.
 The holster clip broke already.  I am disappointed.  I really like the phone case and have to carry my phone with the holster clip due to work.
 Very sturdy product. My phone has dropped soo many times with no damage
 So far I have no complaints. Fits nice and tight on my phone as it should. Belt clip seems more sturdy than most
 Clip was the weak link. Caught it on seatbelt and broke it first week.  But this is a nice case and I am happy with everything else that came with the purchase!  Would buy again.
 Case was too tight.  The sleep button on the side of the case kept pushing the sleep button on the iPhone.  Therefore, my phone was always want to shut down.<br/>When I sent the product back AMAZON charged me for return shipping.
 Was advertised as compatible with a Galaxy S8 plus. It was not and a waste of my hard earned $.
 Really like the weight of the case and the color was nice.Appeared to be solid enough to protect my phone if it is dropped.
 This case is by far the best case I've ever had for my iPhones. Great value for all the components included. The hard case screen protector w belt clip comes in handy when I play golf and can throw the phone around in the golf cart w/o fear of getting it damaged.
 It’s a good product I would recommend you buy this
 The case is great with all the options available on it. Holster clip, lanyard, and the kickstand on the back. Throw in the screen cover that comes with it and the incredible easy to open packaging and you have one great phone case. Would recommend it to everyone.
 I just recieved the case and my IPhone 7 plus yesterday! The case si exactly the way I thought it was. The iPhone still look thin and it is really easy to put it on. I'm really in love With this case.
 In the process of cleaning lint off the glass, it took me every bit of 30 seconds, to breK the “unbreakable” glass.
 Broke in few months
 Love the style and that it came with glass shield. If this came in silicone for more grip it would be even better, but this is great as is also.
 The case was a little marred on the front plastic. I have ordered many of these, and this is the first time I have seen this.
 Best case I ever owned and very easy to put together
 Product quality inferior.  I couldn't push the on/off button, adjust volume controls or get to home page<br/>with phone in case.  I had to go to my Verizon Store and get a case that works.<br/>  I want my money back.
 This was the second time I’ve tried the Zizo and both times the holder broke. I had this last one a week when the corner snapped off.
 I like the case a lot. The only thing is that it took awhile to get delivered. When the holster is not on the case is slim. Once you have the holster it gets heavy and bulky. Then again if you are going to have the holster is to carry your phone on your belt.
 Kickstand broke in about 3 days and case broke after I dropped it from about 3 feet
 I purchased this for my husband and he loved it ,very durable and lightweight and not bulky at all ,just right for him . Also great color (red).
 It’s an ok phone case, just not as “grippy” as it looked online.
 I just received an IPhone 7 Plus for Christmas and I purchased the case and it ended up a 6/6s Plus! The Apple logo on my phone is up and my phone doesn’t have a hole anymore.
 Love that it has a place to put a strap
 Very nice
 Nice color, quaity
 Had to wait over a month to receive the phone after getting the case, not your fault... Once I finally put on the case the lock button didn't work and now there is no way to return this item. Disappointing, could have been a good case.
 I gave it a low rating for the purpose that this case held down My right Button, But it fits My needs &amp; looks Amazing
 Comes with screen protector and keep a phone save all around
 Great case and holder for a very good price
 Great case for on the go..........like the belt clip
 I bought the green camo color. Unfortunately the power button does not work no matter how hard you press it. I messaged the vendor but there was no answer.
 The case is spectacular! Absolutely love it! BUT on the other hand the issue with the power button is driving me nuts so with that being said until that is fixed I would not recommend! I even cut out the entire slot to the power button !!!
 Everything was great but the stand up kit stand broke off easily
 Slim fitting case. Looks bulkier in pics, but is actually slim. Came with a short lanyard if you wanted to have a string attached and the belt clip is removable.
 Good quality , with screen protector include is the best . Easy to install , the best of the best , thanks .
 It’s an all around great case. Screen protector was easy to put on and it’s a durable case good features and I like it.
 Perfect fit doesn't add that much weight to the phone. Gives you some gripping support in your hands
 Great case for protection<br/>But kickstand was broken on arrival
 Easy to install and provides decent protection against damage. The "kickstand" is a nice feature and hasn't broken yet.
 This product is well made but it does not snugly fit my phone. It does not make me comfortable enough that I feel my phone is protected.
 Fast delivery and product is as described.
 Beautiful case.. fits and works great
 The product took less than 48 hours to get here and less than the next 48 to break.  The holster clip snapped after two days of use. Right up until that minute I was proudly showing it off. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED, my money right into the crapper.
 Fits and works great on my IPhone 8 plus
 Product is defective. Has a dimple in glass. Dead center of screen so can't help but see it. Also the clip does not line up with the case so it is useless.
 I love it to deaf.  The second best case that i have ever bought
 Been very pleased with this case so far! Seems very durable and easy to hold and like the kickstand Feature! Well worth the price
 This Case is great, but my hip clip broke after 2 weeks. And I don’t know how to get another one... so no soccer dad bod for me.
 It is to flimsy
 Really like the built-in screen protector, no need to buy a separate item
 I wanna thank all Zizo family for their great work that crowned with their products. I've found that the Zizo carrying cases are the most reliable and fashionable ones I ever used. Thank you and keep the good work up! :)
 Got this for my husband, he loves it.  The clip holster broke after just a few days but he doesn't seem to mind not having it.
 Nice quality. Ian not full enclosed as I thought. Still very satisfied.
 First off I received it and it wasn't sealed, the clip was broken and when case is on phone have no access to the power button functions.  It jams the power button.  Very hard to put on.
 I really like this case. Sturdy but not to bulky. The tempered glass is too small but whatever. Kickstand is nice. A little hard to open though.
 Wish it was easier to use when mounted on the right side of my waist as well as a bit better grip but that last one could be my hands are a bit smaller than most.
 Great protection. Great fit.  Great color. The belt clip could be a smidge tighter ... All in all two thumbs up!
 Great product
 I love this case love it love it love it!!!
 Love the case and it is protects my phone. I have dropped my phone a few times on the concrete and the case has protected my phone. Great product to buy.
 The clip broke the second day that my husband had this product. not very impressed
 Crappy case. The power button on the case is to tight against my iPhone 7 plus power button, so it keeps trying to shut my phone off. Also it has no move ability so you can't push down to shut your phone off or lock the screen. Very disappointed.
 Very Nice case, feels lighter than some other cases. like the tempered glass for complete protection.
 I just looked how fast it came and how I don’t have to worry about a cracked screen it protected
 Case is too tight on the lock button, making it very sensitive.
 Loving this case! it’s got a great design that just fits the hand right. It also has a place for phone charms to be hooked on.
 I did not like the case it came in and will not fit my iPhone 8 Plus but says it’s for it
 I haven't been able to use the holster for the reason I ordered it (a clip for my bike - I have a unique bike), so I'm not sure about that, but I like being able to have a bit of color to choose from.
 No good cheap product
 This iphone 7 plus case is is a excellent product. It fits tight to the phone all while providing outstanding protection. I have dropped the phone twice already resulting in no blemishes. I recommend this for any cellphone out there.
 The power button does not function on this case
 Perfecta
 Rugged and Stylish. Not my first Zizo case and when i change phones I'll probably buy another.
 Love the case very durable. However the corner of the holster clip already broke off hopefully the glue will hold so I can still use it. That's really the only reason I bought it to clip to my pants and purse.
 Fit is GREAT and like that it comes with the temper glass and holster.
 I drop my phone with this case on it and it Landed on the upper right-hand corner and left a crack from there to the bottom right-hand corner! SMH and the belt clip snapped  after the first couple days
 Just didn’t like the feel of it!!
 Good case holder no good broke in 2weeks
 Love this product; hoping future versions might be more girl-y
 Just as described! Bought for my son,  he loves the color and kick stand.  The lanyard is nice,  he actually uses it!
 Lasted a couple months until case no longer was effected. Took lots of abuse but still not an otter box
 Great case, absolutely no complaints.  Already has seen a couple of drops, zero damage to case or to the phone.  Don't let the $ fool you, this is a solid buy.
 It fits great. This is my second case. My first one lasted well over a year.
 Bought this instead of an outer box thought we would give it a try and save a few dollars. Well the clip broke within 5 days.  Buy and out of folks!!!
 Convenient
 everything I looked for in a case and it fits in my pocket nicely!
 Great I love it cause the clip for your waist
 Fit well. Strong casing for good protection.
 I love the case itself however the belt clip has already busted and will not hold the phone any more.
 Love it
 The case and clip great. The kickstand was broken upon receiving. Case is AWSOME!! Clip AWESOME.  Kick stand 👎
 This is a great product-easy to install and use...love the color combo! Can’t beat the price!
 I bought this for my husband for his 1 phone 7 plus. He loves loves loves his new case. Bought the orange one.<br/>This case is very well made would highly recommend it and would buy it again. Good job guys.
 I thought it was a good cheap case but after about two weeks of having it, it fell out of my pocket and shattered the screen. $200 later I will be getting a different case asap
 The product is a very sturdy one and fits phone well
 it broke in 2 days
 I love my new case. It fits well on my phone and feels good in my hands, as well as provides great protection for my phone. As a contractor I look for something that can handle a beating and this case does!
 Tuff case, but the kickstand broke in less than three days
 I have it on my 7+ everyday and have dropped it a few times with not even a scratch.  Excellent case with good grip nice design.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
 Just a great case and clip. Very strong and long lasting.
 Very rugged and the holster for the case. Also comes with a lanyard.
 It would be nice if the screen could face out when the phone is place in the clip.  Product seems to be very sturdy and secure.  Overall great product.
 didnr like that the case didnt have a built in screen protector and the back piece wasnt covered
 Very happy with my cover, I like how heavy duty it’s. This is the way to go when you do construction
 This was the worst case ever... doesn’t even work... I will never purchase from this seller again
 Great case! Fits perfectly and durable!
 iPhone 8 Plus case very sturdy, durable..
 Very good quality. It is not bulky but still durable and protects my phone.
 I have had two previous and the belt clips broke off. This is my third one because of this
 Its a tough case that doesn't oversize the phone. Love the strap makes it easy to carry and use on the fly. Grooves on the backside allow your fingers to have a secure grip as well. nice design.
 I work construction so I need a case that will hold up. The case I like but the holder is sub par it broke after about a month.
 Not for an iPhone 8 Plus
 Nice
 Love this product.  Great price. Made very well
 I received to phone case BUT NOT the SCREEN PROTECTOR, which it clearly states on the box is included.
 The phone case is decent but is not specifically for iPhone 8 Plus, it’s an iPhone 7 Plus case, the apple logo at the back Is a bit off, not centered.
 the glass screen protector came craked.
 Nice case but you can't use the power button. Also phone tries to turn off at random times.
 Good case I like a lot but only a few wrongs things<br/>The buttons on the volume and the power don't match or don't align with the ones on the phone so is hard to turn it off or to use the volume
 i don't recommend this case, the on/off button wont work, you won't be able to click it.
 Awesome phone case
 Bought for my husband, he is very happy so far.  He has used it for 3 days now.
 Fantastic case! I love it. I especially like the fact that I can add a strap to it.
 Priced well and very durable
 Kick stand broke very easily
 Not real happy with it but not by power button keeps getting bumped and turning phone off it was a waste of my money
 Great case! I would definitely buy some of the other colors...
 good
 I purchased this in February 2017. And a year later the case is only cracked by the volume up/down buttons.
 one star for looks and another for protection. That's it. The prop on the back takes a knife to even open. The back of the case keeps pulling off of the case. It's two pieces I think, or it's one poorly put tg piece.
 This Zizo case fit was perfect. It did not compromise the slim factor of the iPhone 7. And it came with a tempered glass shield included, which eliminated the need to purchase one separately. Fantastic!!!
 Great case! Would of gave it a 5 star if the glass screen protector wasn’t broken!
 Had to return due to would not fit my phone way to big
 Love it!  Only weakness is the holster clip.  I caught it on a chair as I was walking but and it snapped in half after one week.
 Awesome case.
 I received this case on time for my iPhone 7 plus. The case isn't bulky at all which is great. You can use belt clip if you choose to. The screen protector is great fit. Overall, I will repurchase this case, great job.
 Great protective case with good grip.  Fast personal service from the company as well.
 Absolutely love the quality and style of this case. Very durable. Don’t waste your time on Otterboxes or LifeProof when you can get a Zizo
 Received my case and I am thrilled. It is super sturdy and comes with the glass protector. Will buy from this seller again! Great product.
 I bought this as present for<br/>My stepdad. He loved it. He wanted a case that will handle his construction job. He also<br/>Loves the design and the belt clip that's include it with it .
 Well built case but specs must be off.  As with other reviews the button over the power switch was constantly depressing the power switch.  I tried to put case on multiple times with same result.  Mine is going back.  Very frustrating
 Had to trim power switch on the inside and belt clip broke very easily, but I didn't plan to use it much anyway and the case is great!
 Like the lanyard.Orange part of case cracked around sound button after a few weeks.
 Just got it today but the stand broke.  I will check on getting it replaced tomorrow.
 Love it except kick stand is hard to open.
 This makes the OB (won't say the name here) look like a second hand kids toy. This cover is amazing it fits like a glove and very easy to hold on to. It also looks Bad A. I would buy it again, great price as well.
 I really like the quality but only thing bothers me is that its so hard i have to push the buttons really hard
 This phone case is great quality and it protects your phone tremendously!
 I like the Coyote color with the faux bolts. Has a distinctive look and it stands out visually. The tempered glass works well and responds good with touch. Case grips well in your hands and the button covers on the case are very tactile and work.
 This a good product. Simple but well built. I have had it for over 18 months.
 This was a great deal
 Excellent product. Everything promised. Arrival was earlier than expected. Highly recommend this seller.
 Great case &amp; great price! Got here fast too! I think these are very comparable to more expensive OtterBox😊
 Very very good durable case...I have ordered 4 of them
 Perfect. However clip broke off after a few uses.
 Second one of these cases I’ve bought I am very satisfied. I have dropped my phone numerous times with this case and it holds up very well.
 Nice design , great color,  I am sure it will save my phone when dropped.  Not to mention the price was right,
 The case works great, so far so good.<br/>I only wish the clip on would fit on both ways so that I could still access my phone while keeping the clip on.<br/>Other wise, it protects it well.
 I purchased three cases one for my wife my son and myself excellent quality and save me a lot of money I would recommend the zizo case
 Love this case. It's a little hard to get on and off but the protection is there!
 The screen protector they sent broke in less than a month and the back side belt cracked by just opening and closing
 Worked great until piece broke off from one that hangs on your pocket
 I like the case, however it doesn't fit correctly over the power button so my phone is constantly trying to turn off.
 Really great product!!! I do wish it was available for the iPhone 7plus in the blue and green like it is for the iPhone 6 and 6 plus! But it really is a great product very durable and fits great!
 Absolutely Sleek, Designed Very Well, And Very Protective. No Defects Came With My Case So Wonderful Product. 💯😎
 Excellent product! Very pleased with the purchase of this item. Highly recommend this sturdy case. Thank you.
 Doesn't fit correctly and couldn't get screen protector to fit without being tons of bubbles underneath.
 Nice protector, I wished I would have found it before I bought my other case! I plan on spreading the word!
 The volume and power buttons line up but you can’t press them through the case
 Item broke from low drop didn’t even last a month.
 It was terrible
 Great product. Delivery was perfect.
 This is False advertisement the product said IPhone 8 Plus Case but when I got the case it said iPhone 6 and 7 plus
 I ordered 3 cases! 2 of the 3 worked perfect. The 3rd the side button pressed hard enough the the phone wanted to shut off! Company was very quick with refund and I reordered another!
 Clip broke after 2 days. No replacement clip available for iPhone 8 Plus. Had to order a brand new case and clip.
 Like the case overall, but would have liked it to be a little softer quality.
 Side buttons would not work. Not flexible enough.
 Well made, nice fit, really like the kickstand.
 Had only  A couple of months. The color is faded and dull already.  Rather than that it's a good case with a stand.  Not quite built for the iPhone 7 Plus they are extra holes for headphones that aren't there. Just a modified universal.
 My iPhone
 Great quality case, and looks good.
 Very sturdy material. Like the fact that protective shield is included with the case
 Case is not durable and is flimsy had an issue fitting my phone
 Phone is not made for the iPhone 8 Plus.<br/>Buttons don’t work after it is in the case &amp; Apple symbol does not align with the case.
 I have dropped my phone numerous times and haven't had a single scratch or crack on my phone since I bought this case. Highly recommend this case to anyone looking at this product.
 Rocky is one of the owners and they family will take care of you if your case doesn't fit or if you have problems they were very nice and took very good care of me . Thank You Zizo
 The case itself is nice. Very durable. But the belt clip broke within 3 days of using it.
 The pop out stand broke the first time I used it
 The case is not bulky, feels great in the hand. Clips into belt clip easily and has a kick stand for easy viewing. About 1/3 of the cost of some of the other durable case brands.
 Love this case!  Not only gave my IPhone a great look but is very protective. It is well made and feels great in hand.
 I bought this for my new phone since I have a tendency to drop everything.  It has already saved my phone numerous times when it has hit the tile floor or concrete.
 This is a very solid case. I haven’t had any issues with any of the access buttons but so far is am very pleased with the case.
 Great case!  One of the few that has a clip and holster that can handle abuse.  Will buy again for sure.
 Great price great bye
 Power button does not push in so I can’t use it
 I love this case it's very durable I drop my phone so many times and it have a broken yet iPhone 7plus
 This is the second Zizo case I have boiught. (got a different phone). Both cases were/are great.  Good protection, easy to hold, just a good phone case!!
 Great product, cool style, feels light, durable quality at a reasonable price
 Buttons on case are stiff and do not line up properly with phone, clip on holster broke within a week.
 Love the look and so far phone has dropped quite a few times and no damage
 I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of this phone case for such a reasonable price!!!!!!
 Bought my son his first phone and this case is amazing!!!!!!! Very durable
 Nice case for the price the kickstand is great to have when watching videos
 Best iPhone case ever! Awesome!
 This case did great with my iPhone 7
 Had to send back as the buttons on both sides would not press in for function on my I8Plus
 I have purchased 3 Zizo cases for 2 iPhone 7 and 1 iPhone 7 plus phones. They are very robust. The cost is also affordable. They have rugged designs and comes in various colors.
 Case is looks good, had a few minor issues with the power button side of case but nothing too serious. I would definitely buy another case. I gets lots of compliments on the looks of the case. Can't beat the price either.
 I bought this for my husband and he really likes it. He especially liked the kickstand part
 Just like it looked in the picture works great I love it
 Little tough to get on because it is tightly fitted but once on - wonderful!
 Really work well especially for ladies that don't wear pockets everyday. Very durable clamp works great flexible to wear around the neck. So far no problems.  They had the right idea when creating this.
 Liked the set even came with a lanyard, the contours of the case design make it easy to hold your phone
 like the look and the grip. Feels a little cheap but I’ve dropped my phone a couple times and it’s done it’s job
 It is a strong and awesome product, you will be satisfied!!!!
 Color great, grip great, kickstand great.  However, the case sits on the power button and constantly tells me to slide to power off or if I touch the home button it's taking screenshots.  It is really getting annoying...
 Exactly like it was advertised. Fit perfectly on my iPhone 7 Plus. Did NOT hold down the power button. All around enjoyable product.
 I ordered the case for my wife. It made her Happy and in turn I am Happy. The case is a great product
 Overall seems nice. But the color is much brighter than the picture, more like a crayon color.
 Great product and quality.
 I really like the case Nice and smooth design. Slim case and not bulky.
 I like the case allot even do the screen protector doesent have a perfect fit and the rear Clío on the one for my iPhone X broke the second day
 I just recently bought a second one for my daughters phone. I love these cases!
 My dad liked it
 I received my case a couple days ago and it is perfect fit for my IPhone 7+<br/>It has no negative issues with buttons or necessary holes.  Highly recommend this case... it seems sturdy enough for most drops
 Unfortunately I'm going to have to give this case a 3 star review because it randomly presses against the power button which means my iPhone 7 plus randomly shuts off.
 Great product at a great price!
 Anyone else’s white case turn pink after less than 24 hours of use?? Mine did
 Looks and feels good but the power botton did not line up so it didn't work
 The stand that holds it up broke within a week but the case works fine.
 Bought this case for my sons phone, he loves it. So far it is a pretty good case, he's dropped it a few time already and everything is ok. It's only been a short time he's had it, we'll see over time, but so far so good.
 Just Received today for my new IPhone 8 plus, fits ok, but "tempered Glass" cover arrived Already Broken...
 Great for the price love the gray one
 They are great. The look better in person than online. I would recommend them!
 Great product &amp; shipped really fast. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
 I really like the case but unfortunately the power button is unusable because it is too tight and keeps pressing the lock button. I am going to have to send it back and get a new case.
 Very poor quality. Light weight, thin construction, clip is not very strong.
 Nice case
 Love the look it added to my iPhone 7 Plus. Love the feel of the case as well. Well made, and at a fraction of the cost of similar cases.
 bulky but does the job, Do you have a slimmer version for evening wear
 I bought this for my son, it’s super durable.  Better case than I had even expected.
 Didn't fit my phone properly
 This was a gift for my husband and he adores it! It was sturdy enough for him being that he's a truck driver and he often drops things. Having the clip, was the ultimate bonus for him!
 Love the color of this case very sturdy really well priced  definitely would buy again
 good case
 This is absolutely the best case on the Market
 Good case fit my iPhone 8 Plus. Not  bulky compared to my previous cases.
 Worked great on I phone 7 plus
 I absolutely love this case!! I loved it so much that I ordered it in another color
 If I could put negative stars on here I would. My phone fell from waist height and hit the ground in the top right corner where the two parts meet and shattered the screen starting there.
 Color and durability
 Nice case. Stylish and protective. BUT cheaply made. Holster snapped on my hip when there was nothing going on. Went to tak my phone of and it just cracked. No way for me to contact the company so I'll just leave a review.
 Hi quality case, low price. Fits grate.
 This by far is the best phone case I've ever had and not only the it looks freakn awesome!!!!
 I love most everything about this product.  The only hesitation is the size of the screen protector was small for my iPhone 7plus and the kickstand is a little hard to pull from it's resting place to engage.
 Great phone case. I like the belt clip as well as the kickstand on the phone case too. Makes the case more versatile and very good quality. Recommended it to someone else already.
 My order was on time!<br/>It came just like the ad described, fits my ohone perfectly.
 Wrong color blue , much darker . Didn't come with a sceen protector .
 great producted as lasted over 2 years
 Great case love the screen protects and the stand.
 Product was OK just too plasticy for me me and to me didn't establish a high professional look more of an activity case which would be good for outdoors but well made
 Great durable case.
 i love it amazing product
 Will return it. Power button on cover hard to turn on/off. Cover too hard to get on/off.
 Love the case! Beats the heck out of paying $75 plus at at&amp;t for an otter box or life proof case. Great quality and value
 It's everything I thought it would be!!
 I love the look and design and for only $15 there’s nothing out there better.
 Fits and feels great!!
 Besides it's not getting here when it should, it is okay. The kick stand could stand up just a little higher. Plus a built in screen cover would not hurt. The way it looks from the screen, it looked like it had one.
 Excellent product, second time purchasing this style/brand. Work perfectly!
 I would recommend this item to a friend or colleague
 Nice rugged look, kickstand a plus. Only issue is with Home button. Nothing, casing does not engage. Not practical as main screen needs to be locked when needed not 30 seconds later.
 Had the case for a couple days now and I love it. It's easy to get off the belt clip but holds tight theme on my side. Only thing I would suggest is make it easier to open the kick stand it's a little difficult.
 Although i was trying to order samsung 8 case i was able to gift item.  Friend was very pleased with product.
 Very good case
 Most amazing case out right now!!!
 I have Zizo on every phone my family has!
 This product is awesome. After I put the case on my phone, I dropped the phone in a parking lot. I gasped initially, but it came through with flying colors.
 The phone case was priced reasonably and arrived promptly. The condition is new and good quality.
 Just got the case. Fits snug on the phone, but without testing it there is no way until you drop it to know if it protects well and I'm not willing to do that just for fun ha.
 ..bot for my Gen'l Bldg Contractor husband...stands up to abuse.<br/>Built tough for this rough guy.<br/>Preferred over Lifecase
 Very stylish phone case. My wife likes the look. She states the it's not the same quality as an otter box.. That being said she's going to keep it.
 It was exactly what I expected based on the description provided.
 Case is solid but the kickstand is junk.  Mine broke after 4 uses
 The clip is not all that great my clip broke the very first day. It pop a loose when sitting down
 Great case, but the belt clip was broken when it arrived.
 I was so excited about this case! I loved everything about it EXCEPT that the case constantly pushes my power button in and makes it completely unusuable for me! Have to return it
 Fantastic case. Great for protection and looks.
 worked perfect
 Love this product!<br/>I bought another one for my husband.<br/>Great color combinations.<br/>Highly recommend Zizo.<br/>Good product.
 I received this case today and am returning it today.  The buttons do not align with iPhone 7 plus!  Close, but not correct fit.  Extremely disappointed.
 I recently bought my iPhone 7 plus and wanted a case that would protect it.  I really like this case.
 This bad boy is rugged and still stylish! It can really hold up!!!
 Bought this for iPhone 7 plus.  One of the buttons didn't match up and wouldn't push... minimal screen protection, you get what you pay for. No comparison to the otter box.
 It started tearing up about a month into using it.
 Great phone case! My husband loves it . It was shipped out right away and we received it in two days!
 Received order on time, sooner than expected. Great quality, unique design and will order more in the future
 I just love my new case going to order the orange one next
 Nice product
 Amazing case and very much protection for my phone. Overall love it!
 Actually was worried about ordering this product instead of OttterBox but this cover is just as sturdy and protects my iPhone just as good if not better and it's cheaper. If prices don't jump I found me a great product at a great price.
 I wish I would've read the comments a little more! My case came bent as describe by other customer. My power button DOES NOT work and is too tight so it does not press down.
 Fast shipment accurate
 Just got mine works as advertised. My only problem was the glass was for 6 plus not the 7 plus. But other than that like the case
 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!
 Unfortunately the belt clip swivel broke on me right out of the box. So much for military grade ballistic etc....
 It is strong and pretty
 I like this case. My only issue is that the color fades quickly making the case look dirty. Been 2 months now time for something else.
 Great case except the on/off button does NOT work very well or at all. It keeps wanting to turn my phone off by pressing the button down all of the time.
 Best phone case I have ever purchased. Very slim and sleek design makes it easy to operate!! Will never own another phone case. great job
 Good case great colors
 A little heavy but nice case
 cover Its too hard can turn it off or get the volume up or down with the cover
 I’m in love with this case. It’s not too big and it’s definitely not too small. Thank you!!!
 Didn’t quite fit phone, couldn’t use buttons so had to return.
 Looks good,fits good, but belt clip broke off as I tried it on. That was one of the main reasons i bought this case for so that i could use the belt clip.
 Case is awesome, however the screen protector was cracked and couldn’t use it.
 Great product!  2nd one I have purchased. Fits iPhone 7 Plus perfectly. Great feel, durable.
 I have no problem with my Zizo iPhone 7 Plus Case I’m totally satisfied
 The case does not fit me phone well. It is already falling apart. The case is no longer white. I should have gotten a different color.
 👍🏻😄
 Love the design but not as durable as I’d hoped.
 I like it for the price
 I really love this case. It is very attractive, unique, and much less expensive than any of the other protective cases.
 Great product. Tough and rugged but still sleek enough to not feel clunky. We live it so much we ordered a second one in a different color.
 Great product just kinda dislike the clip side for the lanyard attachment.
 Exelente producto y bien resistente
 Best phone protection I’ve bought for my iPhone
 I like the way it looks, and ease of use and it is well made.
 It was a present for my husband and he loved it
 Good product. Reasonable price
 Love the case
 The only thing that needs improvement is the clip that holds the iPhone on could be stronger.
 The case is great, the screen protector is brittle. Just pulling it out of the box it cracked.
 Good, solid case.
 My second case like this. Prooven to protect.
 Nice, sturdy.  May purchase another for backup...
 Case is good but where the clip snaps on to the case broke off in a week
 Always have loved zizo products, but case for iphone 8plus didn’t fit right, couldn’t use the power button
 Sturdy but not bulky.  Great protection
 It’s alright the material I feel like is too hard and needs to be more shock absorbent
 Just got my zizo bolt cover case. I’m absolutely impressed with it. Love the design and the feel of it. I would highly recommend this case to anyone.
 Comes exactly as advertised. Great product, seems very strong and really not as bulky as I thought it would be. Overall great product
 Great Case!  You will not be disappointed.  Protects your phone from all sides!  Very Happy and will purchase again.
 Still going strong
 Returned product.
 Bulid houses great for my line of work
 Just got it but seems to be quality and I love the grip, color and design
 Love the color.<br/>Exactly what I expected.
 I like the color combination and its durablity
 Great protection for your phone
 Like
 Love the styling, and the contours help grip the phone better. Also great having a holster clip AND a kickstand.
 Rugged case. I will be buying a different color case. I have the black case. It is exactly what I wanted. My phone looks and feels protected!!👌
 So easy to install. The addition of the snap on clip totally surrounds the phone completely protecting it.  Best protection I've ever had for a phone!
 Very good love it
 Does the trick. Little cheap looking in my opinion, but well worth for price.
 Love the color.  Love the options.  Exactly what I wanted,
 I'm having trouble when I push the power button to turn it off myself it doesn't won't to work I'm having to take it out but then if I'm not pushing it the slide to power off button randomly pops up several times.
 Power button on case continuously pressed button on phone, causing phone to go haywire, and I was not able to turn on/off myself at all.  Otherwise, this case would have been fine for my needs.  Too bad!
 Did not work with my 8plus for volume or power button. Reordered and received a different size case that worked.
 Husband loves it
 The case fits well, the glass screen protector won’t stay on around the edges
 The case is ok.  However, I was a little surprised by the hardness of the case.  Also, it was not true to color.  It shows a royal blue, but in actuality it is more of a navy blue.
 Very Durable and noce and slim! love it
 The case was just as represented in description, very pleased with quality, shipping fast and follow up by seller was immediate to see if we were satisfied. I would recommend this product to anyone.
 Kickstand broke off but overall a good case
 What I like most is that I received the right cover this time. I also love that my shields were in the same box.
 I absolutely love this phone case. I have bought so many trying to find the perfect one. Thank goodness I finally find it. Zizo your are the BEST!
 Love the color and how sturdy it is.
 I love the look and the holster the only bad thing is the power and volume buttons won’t work with the case on
 It was defective when it was received.
 Horrible case broke the first time I used it.
 The product is a great fit and offers superior protection for it's value.  I like the built in stand.  It can be difficult to deploy at first but works nicely now.  I also like the many choices of colors.
 It is smaller than most cases so it will go in your pocket and clip on your side much easier than the others I have seen. The case is also very strong. The built in stand is great as well.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Michael
 Really nice case and rally good quality I'm very happy with this case
 The case was exactly as advertised. The fact that it comes with a screen protector is a big plus!
 It fits perfect and it does it's job. My husband dropped his phone and it didn't break! I highly recommend it.
 Purchased 4 for myself and family! We loveeeee them! Great quality! Super durable!!!
 Great case.  Has everything you need! Very pretty!  I love the kickstand!!
 I didn't get my phone yet but the case looks and feels good i can see they use excellent material i will review again after i get the phone definitely recommend this case
 I love it it’s durable and color is great.
 Belt clip doesn’t fit for the iPhone 8plus and the screen protector doesn’t cover the whole screen for my phone
 Hey it's a very nice product a give 5 stars on this review  we hope on the future see more products like this including case protector for mini iPod 2 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
 Exactly what I wanted. Sturdy, great protective cover and belt clip. Would buy again
 Their bulky and cheaply made. Wouldn’t pay over 5 bucks for this case
 Ears that hold phone on belt carrier break real easy. Have had 4 break
 Exelente
 Case is sturdy but don't fit properly with my iPhone 7 plus. My power button does not work when I put the case on
 Disappointing. Power button doesn't work in the case. It is so tight it wants to continuously shut off the iPhone 7 plus. Disappointing cuz the rest of the case and holster looked to be really good.
 Disliked nothing about the case.  Good fit and quality.
 Awesome product fits well and slides right in my pocket!!
 The stand in the back doesn’t stay closed
 Fits nice and tight but it doesn't align right with the power button it keeps cutting my iPhone off not very happy with this product will not buy another for this phone
 I just installed the case on to my new iPhone and I can't get the power button to work with it on it seems to be missing the plastic piece that goes inside!!
 Very durable clip is decent I’ve actually used the stand (which I didn’t care for before)
 Great case
 I really like the everything but the kickstand, that broke off the third time i used it. it basically fell apart. otherwise i would recommend this to everyone.
 Great case it is solid and easy to put on. They look amazing. Within an hour of having it had several people ask where we got them.
 the protective case is good but the clip is very fragile broke the next day. I could not return because the carton. so I stayed with the pure case
 I did like the color
 Amazing case!
 Looks great and the quality is fantastic.
 I really liked it when I first received the product but after a weeks use the kickstand broke. Extremely disappointed.
 Very cool I like it a lot
 This product should be taken off the market. It is worthless! It is impossible to use the On/Off - Sleep/Wake button when the iPhone 7 Plus is placed inside this case.The product is not as advertised.
 Love the look! Love the kick stand so much! Prompt shipping!
 This case didn’t survive long ..
 Has been holding up well.
 Great product!!!
 Not a bad case, but not something I'd say military grade, plus the outer shell for the one I got doesn't fit properly and looks as if quality control wasn't doing their job on a very noticeable short shot corner.
 Great value
 fits his iPhone 8+ perfectly. Arrived much faster than we expected as well!
 Fits good will have to see how it works
 The case is Great . I really Like the strap attachment
 Product was exactly what I was looking for, and less than an otter box.
 I got this for my husband. The color was dull dark gray.  I wish it was light gray like the picture.  But he likes it so it is ok.
 Everything I expected as good as otter box if not better
 awesome case!  durable, sturdy, and nice color!  i cant find anything wrong with it!!
 Well made, and fits perfectly. Not as bulky as I had expected, which was a plus.
 Very nice, durable case.  Very solid.  My only grip is the tempered glass I believe is plastic, but not a big stickler with me.  It serves its purpose in keeping the screen from getting smudged.
 I bought this case for my son.  It was delivered in perfect condition and he loves it!  Would buy again!
 Beautiful case (red and black). Fits as advertised. Would recommend to friends.
 This Product is Top Notch!!!! Thanks!
 Great case that has already saved my IPhone 8+. Rugged, love the stand and the INCLUDED glass protector. Will recommend and buy again.
 Great case
 That’s what I want .. I like it it’s help to protect my phone
 Bought to use at work. Holster works very well, not to big of a case.
 Awful!  Does NOT fit the phone.  None of my buttons are operational when the case is on.  Sending back!
 This case does not fit right. The lock button is pressed down all the time so it tries to shut off constantly.
 I bought this Zizo phone case for my son's new IPhone 7 plus. The case was very reasonably priced, came with a screen protector, fit perfectly, and seems very welll made.
 Nice case for a good price. And it came with a screen protector. Would definitely recommend.
 Great case. Fits snug seems sturdy<br/><br/>Fast shipment
 Nicely designed case with added bonus of a screen protection shield included. Love the kickstand and belt clip .
 Great phone case. Easy to install and the volume buttons are easy to use. Great fit and looks awesome. Very happy with my purchase!
 Awesome case and fits great! Rugged and not to bulky! Especially like the lanyard loop for easy clip to my backpack while hiking!
 Good deal
 Decent, the case is an iPhone 6s case being sold as an iPhone 7s but it serves its purpose!
 A very good case with excellent build
 Bought it for my hubby and he loves it
 Lifht weight, sturdy, not bulky
 Works  and fits as stated
 Not iPhone 7 PLUS case as advertised.
 I love my case and the color is awesome.  I like the how hard the case is.  Awaiting for the black/ black case for my son phone.
 junk i hated it sent it back cover does work close screen on right side of screen no matter how hard u push it wont close screen
 Awesome
 Love it!
 Iphone8+
 Nice case and all.  But like everyone else, the power button doesn't work
 It fits very tight for my iPhone 8plus but it’s sturdy great quality!
 I love this case, it's sturdy durable and the kickstand is very useful, now I don't have to prop my phone up<br/>with various things to watch a video.
 Study and looks good it was a nice gift
 Looked great and reliable
 iPhone 7 Plus best case for the price
 It fit great on my iPhone 8 Plus!  I like the feel of the case, overall satisfied.
 This was a gift for my husband &amp; exactly what he wanted to take pictures safely when he was kayaking.
 Over all, looks cool. Too bad it came broken...
 seam to be well made
 I loved it there nothing I didn’t like about it all
 Great item
 Volume buttons on this case don't line up with my iPhone 8 Plus phone, so I have no volume control.  Returning case for refund.
 If you have an iPhone 7 Plus, DO NOT buy this case. It will keep pressure on the side lock button which will make the phone unusable because it will constantly prompt you to power it off. I've tried a lot of different ways to keep the case from pushing the button in, but haven't found a way yet. This design is great, it's certainly durable and will protect the phones if they can find a way to address this. What's also nice is that it DOES fit the iPhone 7 Plus perfectly; a nice, snug fit. However, learn from other buyers' disappointment. Save yourself the time and money because it WILL keep pressure on the side lock button for the iPhone 7 Plus, making it unresponsive to everything else.<br/><br/>The glass screen protector is mediocre. Mine was pre-cracked for me, on the little area between the ear speaker and the top of the screen protector. It's a pretty thin piece of protector space so it's no surprise it was cracked. I call it "mediocre" because the glass has a thin filmy sort of look to it when you look at it at a certain angle. Ordinarily this is okay because it doesn't affect the view of the screen at all, but it does look sort of milky when you glance at your phone when it's next to your at your desk or angles like that. Of course, I've been known to spend a lot of time keeping my phones looking sparkly, factory clean.
 Great look solid product love the kick stand
 It arrived with a pretty noticeable scratch, for a brand that claims to be so durable,
 This case look good after putting on but overall fit of outer casing is way too tight. Outer most casing on rubber enclosure doesn't snap in perfectly. It doesn't stay flush with rubber enclosure.
 Really like the case. Makes it so much easier to hang on to.
 Works great
 Well made
 Made cheap phone fits ok but plastic has flaws and awkwardly fits in belt clip. Better to spend extra money on Otter Box
 Only had it for a couple of weeks but very satisfied at this point.  Price and quality are great.
 Phone fell out my pocket at 90 MPH on a motorcycle with case on. No damage to the phone. Case took the damage. Minor damage to the case
 Only reason for the 4 is the screen protector didn’t completely adhere to the screen but other then that I love it
 I had an otter box defender,big and bulky. Got my Zizo 3 days ago and wished I had changed a long time ago,<br/>Great phone case, light but durable with a belt clip. I will get one of every color eventually.
 Case is fine but the clip broke first time applying it to my belt
 Very sturdy case!
 This iPhone case is awesome is light weight and easy to clip and removed from your waist belt, I give it Five Star
 So far so good Only thing I worry about is that there isn’t anything to keep dirt and water out of my charger port.
 This is the beat phone case I have ever owned!!
 great
 My first day the back bracket broke so be careful sitting down.
 It showed up a few days late but all in all, I love this case. Especially the stand on the back of it.
 Works so well I bought it twice!
 Power button does not work with the case on the phone! My boyfriend ordered this same case and had the same problem with his! Very disappointed
 Great product I could not be happier
 Thank you for exchanging the phone cases...<br/>we just got it today! Fits perfect!!
 I purchased my zizo phone case not knowing what to expect, so glad I did it is hands down best case I have ever purchased
 Case is great.  Only minor complaint is that the kickstand is hard to lock and unlock.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied.
 Exactly what they said it would be ! Love this cover
 The holster clip is lousy spring has no tension. Snap latch won't hold the phone in placed. I did not mind  returning merchandise since it only worth $23.00 bucks. I'll go back to otter brand.
 Meets all my expectations
 It’s a good case !  I like it l,...  could be better with a snug fit on the outer shell of the case but does the job
 I have owned several of these Zizo cases and none of them have ever had a problem, except for this one the power button is so hard to depress it continuously turns my phone off
 Very happy with my case and it arrived on time!
 Looks like someone already used this item. 😡 There was dirt all over and the also scratches on this item.
 Very happy with the Zizo product. I would recommend this product to family and friends .
 The case is quite new but the lanyard string/wire has already broke.  I really wanted to use the lanyard too.
 great
 Good quality case.  Slim yet does not feel flimsy.  Kickstand is a terrific feature.<br/><br/>If I had to do it over, I would buy this case again.
 Came fast. Very nice, heavy duty case. My husband has that worst luck with phones. If he breaks his phone with this then he doesn't deserve a phone.
 Purchased 3 of these they are awesome!!<br/>Like the way it feels in the hand and sits so you can watch videos on the phone
 I was excited to get this case. I give it 2 stars because it looks great. However I have an iPhone 7plus. I cannot use the power button and home/Siri button when the case is on. Sending it back!
 It was what I expected, a sturdy case
 Not the correct case! Not for iphoen 8 plus
 Excellent case. Love the kick stand on the back, makes it easier to watch videos and movies on my phone
 fits perfect and is versatile
 Need a replacement case. It does not allow phone to be powered down because button does not depress. I will return defective one upon replacement being sent
 Very good quality
 Good quality
 I am excited to try out my new iPhone 7 + case! It looks amazing and I hope it prevents any breakage, as I've dropped by phone several times.  As soon as I receive my phone, I'll be happy to share my thoughts
 Great item with fast and easy purchase!  AAAAA+
 I didn't get my screen protector with my phone case. I am very unhappy with this order.
 The case is very durable and protects my new phone adequately!  I will be purchasing from this company again.
 This case is well made and protects the phone,my friend had one and after seeing it had to have.you won't be disappointed.
 Excellent protection and is tough as nails!!!
 Delivery came ahead of scheduled date. Case works great as I've dropped it a few times already without any sign of damage whatsoever!!! Would buy it again and have suggested this case to others!
 This is the second of this case we have gotten. Two different phones.
 Good case.
 Used this case Before on other phones, on the iPhone 7 plus it tends to try and hold down the power button causing it to try and turn itself off instead of locking and unlocking the phone.
 Great level of protection for the money.  Sturdy belt clip as well.
 Always the best!!! Wayyyy better than Otterbox.
 I had to return it because the case constantly pressed the power button, rendering the phone unusable.
 I ordered this for my iPhone 7 plus but instead I got one that fits my iPhone 6. It even has a hole in the bottom for the headphone jack keep in mind the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack.
 Great phone case, the screen protector went on without any issues, and the case looks and feels good in the hand I will be purchasing another one for all my other phones
 The kick stand broke the second day
 Awesome
 Case does not fit. Have tried to reach out to customer service and they have not been very helpful.
 I like it very much, thank you.
 The case works extremely well for my iPhone 8 plus.
 It is a great phone case.
 Love the case but the clip is horrible.  If your lucky, you can use it for a whole week before the clip breaks.  I've bought 4 so far and every single one has broken.
 Very nice sturdy case
 Love it!
 Product arrived early and pretty much works as advertised; only issue that I have is the stand would not open, but that is minor for me.
 Great product
 Excellent product i will buy it again
 Great phone case easy to install and awsome feel in the hand.
 Great case. According to the person I purchased it for it wasn't easy to put on, the only downfall. Such a good case I ended up ordering a second one in orange.
 Very Happy with case
 Case feels very sturdy, good fit, grip and stand.  Excellent value for the price.
 👍
 Great case, looks great, works well, not as heavy as the otter box
 Best case I’ve had so far
 Great case, but wish the belt clip was designed so phone could be placed inside of it face out as well as face inwards.
 I love it but wish that doesn’t have to add the hole for lanyard string.
 Great phone case fits nice and has a good feel to it... switched to this from a lifeproof case and don’t regret it at all
 It's a beautiful case that appears to be tough enough to protect my phone from the daily wear and tear of a preschooler.
 I loved it,
 Very food quality
 This seems to be a good quality case and I love the design and with the included screen protector I believe it will hold up to my teens abuse.
 The case is fine zizo. Tamer glass is to small,
 Wow! Very sturdy. I dropped my phone almost immediately after I put the case on, but it did not break! Very happy with my choice.
 I like the look and feel but when it came to functionality it did not work. The volume buttons would not work unless you put a substantial amount of pressure on them my wife could not work them at all.
 It’s exactly the protection I needed👌🏾
 I am satisfied with the phone case.
 My husband is very pleased with his iPhone case but the one we ordered for Samsung for some reason the glass protector did not stay on. But overall very pleased seems sturdy
 Just got my case and it looks great!  Taking it on a 3wk fishing trip to AK so I will put it through its paces. Confidence is high.
 He love it.
 Good case for money
 This is a great case. I've had this case on a few phones, never an issue. It's very well made. Protects well, but not bulky.
 Great product. The screen protector came with great instructions for installation. I've dropped my iPhone on concrete and it didn't get a mark on it.
 I've been looking for a cheap but durable phone case and I am so glad 😁 that I came across with this one. Thank you and hope to do more business with this company in the future.
 Can zizo or person shipping send a iPhone 7 plus case and not a Samsung case?
 Very sturdy phone case would purchase again.
 Quality product, well built with a high amount of protection. This is not nearly as bulky as an otter box and provides just as muck protection.
 Good case for the price and durable.
 I love it and I think that it stands out depends on anyone's favorite color.For the price you can't beat that.About to get one for iPad
 I drop my phone a lot, so this is super sturdy, and the kickstand is a huge plus.
 I was excited to receive the case as it has great features and design. However, the case does not fit properly and causes a problem with the volume buttons on the side.
 Very good product
 Great quality case, at a great price too! I edpeciallyed like that it came with the tempered glass.
 Excellent product, very high quality, perfect fit, sturdy and great looking phone case.
 My son loves this case !! Comes with screen protector so you can’t beat this price 👌🏼
 The phone case is great except for the screen protector after a few days of using it I notice a small crack on the lower right side corner of it. I thought it was tempered proof,that's my only concern. Thanks
 I loved great for iPhone 8 Plus
 This is a terrible product!! Do not waste your money!! The case is durable however it constantly hits the power button. It is definitely not made for the iPhone 7 plus!
 Awesome case I will be buying from them again
 Overall great product, sturdy. No 5 stars cause I thought the case was encapsulated kind of like the otter box, but do recommend
 Case is nice, but belt clip broke just a few hours after I got it
 Nice case got the black one worked 100% purchased the red have to send it back the power button won't work and when it does it makes my phone restart
 The power button does Not work, it's pushing the phone so tight that keeps phone shutting off, I had to personally cut it to leave a hole for it.
 Heavy duty built of the Protective case.<br/><br/>Dislikes, I have zero dislikes.<br/><br/>Number one #1 Case as well.
 Case does not fit the phone and the buttons don't work when case is sealed.
 It is really good in terms of quality and looking. I like it,  it is keeping my phone safe and protect it specially From my kids when they are messing a lot with it.
 solid case at a fraction of the otterbox.  Very pleased with this product.
 iPhone X &amp; 8plus, good quality &amp; very durable.
 Like the kick stand and Color
 The power side button stays pressed down when you install the case. Not good. Bad design
 Nice ..
 I love it..Thank you!
 Belt clip broke within a very short time of purchase. Fustrating!
 Great case for a great price. I've now had this brand for two phones and won't hesitate to get one again.
 Tempered glass came cracked all up
 Great product
 Ordered the blue/black case.<br/>The actual case I received is nowhere near the same blue as the photo.<br/>Returned.
 I love it and will definitely  recommend it to everyone
 Great color. Not slippery. Not too thick in hand.
 Like the feel
 Should have been hard rubber instead of plastic.
 Perfect for my phone
 Works perfectly, exactly as shown
 value
 Great
 Awesome
 I like it
 Perfect case for my daughters iPhone 8 plus.
 Case is very sturdy and the bright color allows me to find quickly in my purse. Price was right and delivery very quick. I am very pleased.
 Power off button doesn't work correctly. It constantly pushes on phones button. Other buttons work fine. I bought two of these and both have the same problem.
 I love the gold color case. Fits my iPhone 7 Plus perfectly.
 Great case.
 The tempered glass was not included in the box as promised
 Completely defective. Power button mold done incorrectly, just presses it down. Poor quality.
 👎🏿
 Nice
 Great case I bought 2, red and white so pleased I will buy another also, by mistake I ordered the wrong case and with no hassle or fuss they returned and exchanged for the size.
 Great product, great price and extremely quick delivery.
 Great product, only issue is my clip broke anyway to get a replacement clip at no cost?
 I wouldn't recommend this case. It fits the iPhone 7 plus, but the right hand button doesn't work. It continually turns the phone on and off. Don't waste your money, get a decent case.
 It fit really tight had to be careful putting it in kept turning phone off
 Everything was what I needed. I like how the case looks and feels and the kickstand is what I really enjoy that other case such as otter box didn't have and cheaper than them too.
 Okay
 Probably the biggest piece of crap I have ever see. The glass was already broken when i took it out of the box. The second time i extended the "leg" on the back, it came off in my hand.  The case was in the garbage before I stood up out of the chair I was sitting in when I put it on my phone. The only reason to buy this would be to give it to your enemy to frustrate them. looks like nice "good plastic" in the pic. After I got It it reminds me of the plastic used in making plastic easter eggs.  JUNK
 When I put the case on my phone the home button doesn’t work. The rest of phone case is good
 This was one of my many but favorite purchases from amazon. Thanks
 Extremely Ugly. Pictures don't do it Justice
 Excellent and strong case. It's a must have for IPhone owners that needs extra protection to their equipment.
 I like the way it fits the phone I don’t like the ear on one coner makes it hard to fit in to the carrier
 Looks decent and good quality!
 My wife likes this one in her purse, but see previous review on the regular iphone 7 and notice the screen protector is not 100% coverage.
 Yes
 Working great, great response from customer support, good product , I feel my phone is protected
 Very nice case and easy to put on the screen protector.
 Looks awesome fits perfect
 Excellent! Very pleased with this product!
 This didn't fit my iPhone 7plus properly. It continued to hit my power button, enabling me to access my phone. Plus the screen protector arrived broken. Waste of money.
 Great looking case. Easy to install. Love that it comes with a tempered glass screen protector. Great value too.
 Great durability w/ tempered glass protection.  Not fearful if I drop it or it the glass gets accidentally scratched-it is protected.
 Love the case but had it for a week and leaned up against a wall and the holster corner snapped off making the holster useless.  Now have carry phone in my pocket.
 Wireless charging does not work with the case
 Don't know how this happened. Got it less than a month ago. How or who would I contact for a replacement??
 Works great. Just what I was looking for.
 Case is way too tight on the phone and doesn't let home and on/off button work.<br/>Can't return because I had already put the screen protector.<br/><br/>I would love to get a refund!!!!
 Love it!!! Perfect fit for my iPhone 7 Plus.
 It needs to clip on both sides not just one side
 Very well made product for such little money. Would definitely recommend this cas.
 Durable
 Love the case, but be careful my belt clip snap right off when I bent over. Otherwise very neat and slim.
 I Had a Great experience with you guys the case is awesome looking forward to doing more  Business with you guys
 Great quality case and glass procetion.
 Awesome case!  Fits perfectly and ordering more
 This product is no good. On/off button doesnt work and the phone with case sits loose in the clip cradle . It easily comes out. Don't waste your money.
 Case looks good but on and off button on case does not work properly. Too much of a hassle to return small item just wanted to make sure seller knew about the defect.
 For the price, this product exceeded my expectations.
 Forth one I have bought they work great.
 This is a great case. It is enough to protect and fit my I phone 7+.
 Awesome,thin product!!!
 pretty cool case
 Great iphone case.
 Love the kickstand and how durable it is.
 Great case I have it on my 6s plus which is why I got the exact same one for my 7plus exactly how it looks in the pic and looks great great protection as well
 Like the looks and functionality
 Broke after a couple months
 Fantastic product very sturdy  and excellent quality for price
 Great product
 I bought this case for my fiancé and he absolutely loves it!
 Do not waste your money. Broke the same day delivered.
 Looks cool, but<br/>Outer case didn't fit. When installed, it prevented the power button from being pressed, and it would shut off on its own.
 Great product  over time I have bought more than one. All ways please with the product
 Love this case. Protects the phone very well without being too bulky.
 Best surprise is no surprise and it is just as described!  I would buy it again in a minute.
 Says on the box it is for an iPhone 7S plus.? the power button is being pushed inward the whole time the case is on so you pretty much cannot use the phone.
 great ! Fix perfectly, and love the lanyard that comes with it !
 Awesome phone case for a great price!
 Case does not line up with on/off, pic button. In process of returning. Same problem with iPhone 7 case purchased. In process of returning that as well.
 I need something with bright colors in case I was to leave somewhere to make it easy to find
 Love the protection. EXACTLY what it says.
 Tempered glass was broken on arrival, I like the case though, but disappointed that the glass is useless.<br/>Still worth the money, even without the glass.
 Outstanding product. Like it very much. Thanks
 This case is very nice
 The case itself is very durable, I can't say the same thing about the holster. The clip on the holster broke as soon as i moved it from vertical to horizontal.
 Be careful installing the glass protector. While taking off the backing it cracked on me. Then a week later the clip broke on me. The clip was more my fault but just be careful
 love this case....
 Power button didn't line up with my brand new phone. I didn't have the time to return the item but I wouldn't take another one for free.  I should of bought an otter box
 Love the case. Pretty sturdy.
 Great case, great price. LOVE IT
 I like the durability of the case. And it looks cool!
 used for my i-phone 8 plus
 Sleek with military grade protection.  Great price.
 This item fits my phone perfectly I love it comes with the tempered glass and the belt clip and it's reasonably priced.  Yay
 It came on time, but the case is not of such a good quality, the second week I had it, it broke, and it didn't fall on the floor, I was just using it.
 I'm very happy with the product. Thanks
 My husband uses it for his phone and has had no issues so far 😊
 Fast delivery and well made product
 The power button doesn't work when the case is on.
 case seems to be too small, it continues to push the power button, I may have to return if it doesn't strech out
 Case came cracked, also as many others have stated the volume and power button are constantly pressed by the case. Would not recommend at all.
 Had a minor problem with product, Zico promptly replaced the case, works great and gives sense of great protection.  I will recommend and buy again.
 Loved it at first but now the clip broke! Is it possible to return this?!
 Love this case perfect fit and protects my iPhone 7 Plus
 As described product arrived early. No issues whatsoever. Thank you for the expedited delivery.
 I love my iPhone case. Excellent quality I will order another one soon
 Screen protector did not completely stick at the sides..<br/>Case really hard to put on..
 Best ever iphone 7 plus case , will always recommend it ...
 Carrier clip was broken
 This is my 2nd case my clip broke and I got another case so I would have a clip but overall I love the case it's not bulky I love it .
 My kids love this case.  Cool looking and they love the two tone colors.  Great quality and great price.
 Got this for a Christmas gift. Very nice n fast delivery
 Case was as described.
 I'm a cop and needed a strong case that is functional.It has lived up to its description and the desert tan compliments my Marine Corps service.
 This phone case is great. Not too bulky and has several nice features. Awesome that it came with a really great screen protector too! I would buy it again!
 A very light weight case, but is very sturdy
 As advertised
 Really like the product. Much better than my Otter box defender that broke in the first month.
 I like the case the glass  screen protector broke the second day it was on
 Nice sturdy case!!!
 Let's put it this way, if I did not like the product, or had any issues, you would have heard from me days ago.<br/>Thanks I do like the product
 I had to send this one back due to I ordered the wrong size
 Fitz iPhone 8 Plus perfectly!
 Offers full protection
 Great product. Exactly as advertised. I would buy again!
 I phone 7 plus<br/>Great case for men
 Great case
 Nothing
 Love it
 Terrible.  I have iPhone 8 plus and buttons don't work. Going to have to purchase new case.
 One of the Best cases
 Neat design and durable.
 Great product. Well described in listing. Would use the seller again if needed.
 Very good product. Came on time and very well packaged. Thank you Zizo for a great case
 The price
 Already broken
 Love it. Bought my second one.
 Great!
 Very good case! Only case I buy got my phone now very durable and a great price!
 Good value
 I like very much the quality and the grip of this cover.
 Perfect for my husband!!
 Very nice and fast shipping
 Great quality at a amazing price. Love the fit on the iohone7 plus.the lanyard is a awesome idea and love it
 good quality and looks good
 The clip broke.
 Great for the price!
 None of the buttons on the case line up with my phones buttons, making them useless.
 Excellent case!! Mil specs and extremely durable!! I'm very happy with my Zizo case!!!!!
 The case was way too tight for my phone. It says that it will fit for a 7 plus but that is not the case. I had to return the case because it was just simply too tight for my phone
 Totally satisfied with product no complaints very well produced
 The design of the case is durable.  Like the kickstand and the design
 This is my second Zico case. I love there products. They are well made and fairly priced.
 Working great! 👍
 Bought this case for my new iPhone 8 Plus, but both on/off  and volume is working with cover on
 Bought 2 of theses cases same time for me and my wife and both top right buttons don't work and always turns mind and hers phone off. Don't buy!
 All good
 The lever on the back broke within a few weeks, which is one of the reason I purchased this item. Other than that it's a good case.
 Cool
 I really like the durability of the phone case.
 Like it great protection formyphi e. The only issue is if I hit one partwrong it try's to turn my phone off
 Absolutely looooove it!!! I love how beautiful it is and I already have accidentaly droped it several times and my iPhone 7 plus is intact.
 Was exactly what I expected and some! Very durable and pleased
 The case is awesome will be great for work thanks again keep up the great designs.
 I haven’t had the product long, but as of now I’m happy with it
 Looking for a cover for the iPhone is a overwhelming experience.  This case was recommended and so far it is GREAT!  My husband just ordered one too!
 This case was perfect for my daughter's phone. She dropped her phone while it was in the same and it well protected! This was definitely a great buy
 Looks and feels good but doesnt fit together perfectly.
 Wow nice and slim holds my iPhone snug I dropped it a few times and no scuff marks good built quality I'd buy another in a heartbeat
 Everything was wonderful
 Just as promised. Thank you
 I really like the case. It looks good and doesn’t feel so bulky.
 worse case ever!!!  i do not recomment this case it is super hard and complicated to put on. phone got scratched
 IPhone 7 Plus Case, Zizo Bolt is useless because the off on button will not work on the right side of the iPhone 7 Plus it is useless
 Good look. Solid build.
 It fit perfectly have dropped it couple times since with no issues, love it plus the kickstand comes in handy
 I love this case
 I love this case,better than expected for the price
 When I received my package the clip on the case was broken !
 Phone holder is horrible. Belt clip keeps coming off. Sent back for refund. Will never buy their products.
 Case is great and very nice looking but belt clip broke first day of using
 Very nice case. Excellent fit on my IPhone 7 Plus.
 Purchased 3 Better than the old Bulky Otter Box
 Second case we’ve ordered from this company! Love the way it protects our phones
 Liked the case until the clip for the belt clip broke.
 Love the kickstand.
 Great case for my iPhone 7 plus I would have gave you guys 5 stars but the clip that attaches to the belt came broken in half how do I get a replacement clip?
 Disappointed that this "military grade" iPhone 7Plus case cracked. Probably a defect as I have not dropped it.
 Love this case!
 Super fast delivery case seems like it's built good I'm still waiting to get my phone it's on back order but I'm sure this case will work fine it looks very durable
 Buttons do not line up. Worthless case. I'd return it, except I installed the gas screen protector before I found out the case was a POS.
 Love it! The case exceeded expectations and arrived earlier than promised!!! I would absolutely buy their products again!
 The hole thing
 Perfect fit dropped it like 3 protected the phone very well love it
 My husband loves the color and since he's a bit rough on things it's very durable...can't wait to buy the other colors
 The power button spot is too tight, it makes my phone to go off.
 Great quality case! And is a beautiful Rose Gold. I love the style and the side grips too. Better than expected
 Love these cases, rugged as hell. I throw mine around all day no issues. Love all the colors as well.
 good item. well worth the money. I don't like the loop for hooking lanyard to it.i don't have a need for it.
 Great product!  Seems durable
 Love the color, for and design..
 The case is great! Although the belt clip broke three days after it arrived.
 Very satisfy with this.  You receive exactly what you see in the picture.  The color is great and it's resistance I awesome too!!
 Great fit. Looks good too
 Nice to look at. The kick stand isn’t very good quality
 This was great buy
 Everything was just fine
 Very nice case!
 Made buttons hard to press or would not let buttons function bought two cases for IPhone 7 plus had to return them. Did like the style and look of these cases
 Great. Thin durable fast shipping
 Back snapped off after 2 weeks of use.
 This case is very poorly made. The clip broke off in the first five minutes of me haveing it totally disappointed in the purchase not worth the money .
 The glass was broken when it arrived.  I returned it for a refund.
 I like it, looks great, thank you.
 Case had a nice look and concept, However the phone fit to tight in the case and kept powering phone off.
 Durability
 Awesome IPhone Plus cover. Excellent quality! Fits the 7+ perfectly. I had the Otterbox on prior phones and the Zizo is far better protection and looks great.
 Im in love with this case. It glows when black light shines on it. It feels very nice.
 It’s Great!
 Why can't I lock my phone with this case on?? Someone please get ahold of me about this issue. It's not ok. Don't buy this if they won't fix the problem.
 The case is thin and works but the belt clip broke within days of having bought it!
 This case is not what they say! Doesn't fit...not happy with this product at all!! On a scale of 1-10 I'll give it a 1
 Excellent case
 The actual cover is not what the image shows<br/>The colours in the image are very bright and shiny, but the actual product is dark and dull in colour.
 Love the slim design
 Good quality made phone case. And it looks great too. I bought 2 more for my family.
 Easy to grip and is very protective!
 I'm very happy with this item. I will be a customer for life.
 Stylish and functional. Got knocked off my belt about 8ft off the floor, and the music didn't miss a beat.
 Got this for my husband. He loves it. The company quickly replaced the clip on portion when it broke. I have recommended them to others.
 The most awesome case I have ever owned this is my third case for my last three phones. I may get another one just to switch it up.  Love these cases
 Quality of Otterbox at more than half the cost. Definitely will purchase different colors
 Protective glass was cracked when it arrived...
 Great product great price
 The case completely covers the power button. Other than that I was satisfied.
 I would have thought it would be built better. I didn't even have this thing a week and holder broke. That's a lot of money spent for something that broke quite easily.
 Awesome AAA++++++++
 Great product
 Great case for iPhone 8 Plus
 Case called his phone to shut off due to pushing the home button
 Sturdy, love the kickstand feature, nice slim design and still get protection.
 Excelent product
 Pretty nice case....a little difficult getting the phone in until u put a little force but overall is nice
 Very nice case
 Love the case.  Screen protector needs to be a bit bigger to cover the entire screen. Not fond of the lanyard loop, but overall it was a good purchase
 my daughter enjoy army and i ordered this case for her,she loved it.
 The kickstand is hard to open up. It's also a bit bulkier than we thought it would be.
 Great case for a great price!  Light weight and stellar protection!
 The kick stand is not as strong as I like but the case is very sturdy.
 It didn't come with the screen glass protector. Other than that it's ok. One star for not sending it complete as advertised
 The case is well made. It has a great look, but most importantly it’s very durable.
 clip and case broke within A week
 Everything is fine, except for not being able to use the lock/power button, the case wasn't molded correctly around that button, and it won't reach it.
 Product came as described and delivered on time. I was very pleased.  I would recommend and buy from them again.
 Did not fit my phone adecuately. The phone buttons could not be pressed due to improper design .
 Case is awesome!!
 Great case, good price!
 It broke
 Case is super sturdy and just as described. Love it!
 Great iPhone 7plus case. Beyond my expectations.
 Worst case ever bought broke after 1 werk
 Good product, I ordered the blue case but actual color is more like dark blue besides that good quality
 Unfortunately as others have stated, the case I received doesn't fit my iPhone 7+.
 Overall not bad. Not sure why you would want the lanyard but other than that cool product!
 Love this case. Super good for a manual labor job. Screen protector goes on easy and belt clip works great!
 Great item as described highly recomended
 Very disappointed got this case and no matter which way I put it on the start button will not work very disappointed don't waste your money
 Damaged! I can’t press any key at all
 My son loves his new case.
 The cover is really nice and heavy duty fits really perfectly on my iPhone 7 plus I recommend this cover who ever wants a good cover for there phone
 This is a great case at a great price. I would recommend it to friends and family. Screen protector was very simple to apply
 Wonderful case.  Easy to hold, looks great, easy directions for front glass protection too.  Highly recommend.
 It doesn't fit my phone right the lock button gets stuck down
 We purchased this for our son and he loves the case.  I would recommend this anyone.
 I received the case a day early and it was just as described. If this is the type of case you are looking for I would recommend it.
 Pretty good phone case for the price. Would buy again.
 Good protection nice design
 I like the case. The screen protector doesnt really fir my phone though.
 I love the case, it protects my iPhone
 Broke next day tried to take off my belt and it got stuck and broke
 Cannot use the case with my IPHONE because it registers the home button as pressed constantly.
 Well guarded with a good look
 Good case I like it more than a otter box.
 The belt clip broke very easily
 asdsa
 Awesome company, amazing product!! My husband works for the Railroad and needs a tough case, this definitely fits the bill. You'll love it.
 love these cases. had one for my old galaxy phone and now for my new iPhone. Just as good as Otter Box but way less expensive.
 This case it great I just up crease to iPhone x and bought a case for it also
 The case has a design flaw which keeps the volume + and - from functioning properly. It was returned and I got my money back with no problem.
 I ordered for 8plus case and I got 7 plus case..
 That case fits perfectly and looks awesome. I could not be happier !
 It’s awesome
 My husband loves his case. Thank you. Its sturdy and looks great.
 Clip not sturdy enough
 Fast shipping and the case looks just like the photo!  Very happy with my purchase!
 I loved it ❤️
 I like the case but the belt clip broke within a few days of having it. I am waiting to see if they will replace.
 Good
 Like
 Great product, feels sturdy, screen protector is as good as all the other glass screen protectors.  Liked it so much I ordered another for my mom
 Junk
 Really awesome case !! I have had my iPhone 7 plus for 2 days now and I love it !!!
 beautiful and tough
 It would really be appreciated if it would be an actual Iphone 7 plus case instead of a 6 plus. It's all about business.
 Awesome product meets my every need.
 Great case. Feels light but is very beastly! Love love love!!!
 Keeps the power button down so phone keeps showing power down option.
 I had a Apple 6 plus and had this as my case. I upgraded to a 7 plus and I liked the case so much I bought it for my new phone too!
 The case is nice, protects and looks good. My holster broke as I was getting out of my car after only 4 months, disappointed.
 I got ink cartridges instead of the case.
 Don't not buy for iPhone 7 plus! Power button won't work with this case. This is a iPhone 6plus case made to seem like it's a 7 when all they did was change the name on the box
 Clip breaks to easily
 Great seller, great product. No issues what so ever. This is the second case I bought from this seller and both times were a great experience.
 LOVE IT!!!! Incredibly durable but not bulky at all!! The clip holds strong. Zizo will be my brand from now on.
 Was as described.  Thank you.
 good case, fits well!
 Very stylish and not bulky at all!
 great product, arrived on time brand new in the box
 Love it! I work in construction and i was always afraid of dropping my IPhone 7 plus, not any more worh my new case by Zizo!
 IT IS A GREAT CASE
 Very nice sturdy case love it it’s my 2 nd purchase
 Belt clip broke off within 2 weeks of use.
 Great case!
 This case is a guality product.
 This is a solid product.
 Case color fades in  2 months and company refuses to replace it ...
 I love this case. It is very comfortable to hold and use and doesn't slip out of your hand. I also love having the color match my phone.
 Hot looking with new new iPhone 7 plus.
 Great case, I love the cover. Thanks for fast shipping
 Case is a really good quality, the belt clip could be a little better
 Light weight with good protection.Onlly complaint is that phone can only be put in holster in one direction.I would like it to be able to be placed on either side
 So far so great, built very sturdy. Extremely quick delivery also. I paid for 2 day shipping it it was here the next day.
 My new case is awesome!  Very impressed with the fast shipping and the quality of the product.  Extremely easy to install and a perfect fit.
 Love the case actually thinking about getting another in the tan and green!
 Looks great, very happy with the quality!
 the belt clip keeps breaking
 Awesome case. Fits better than rubber cases like otter boxes.
 I received my Zizo case and am very happy with it.
 I love my case. Fit my iPhone 7+ perfectly. Bought two more for family members with the same phone, they love them too.
 I'm super decpcionado the product took a lot to get it came all wrong and missing freck
 This is the best case I've ever had! Fits to the perfect spec, keeps the device safe, and has the the rugged / sleek tactical feel. I couldn't be happier!
 It was recommended and i love the color and the style.
 Love this case hands down better then any case I have ever bought great product!
 Great cases would definitely buy again
 Great product!  love the kick stand
 The case was pretty decent. It doesn't have the best fit and finish though. Where the outer case meets the inner cover, there are some edges that need to be cleaned up.
 Bought for my iPhone 8 Plus.  Definitely doesn’t fit.
 No I did not like it it’s way to bug
 It fits perfectly this is a very good phone case
 Feeling good knowing my iphone is secure in this case.  Great fit!!
 excellent product
 Good item
 Excellent case love the color and the protection it provides. Very nice case
 Grandson loved it
 Power button defective, it keeps my power button pushed down causing my phone to turn off
 We are very impressed &amp; and highly recommend this case!
 Wonderful product ! Sturdy, high quality, beautiful and refined appearance, excellent price, better than otter box. Highly recommended, you will not regret this purchase.
 Great! I love it!
 The this case.i have bought at least 4 cases starting with iPhone 6s pluse.
 Clip broke as soon as I opened it
 This is a very sleek looking case
 Power button is continously pressed because of the casing
 Dad loved it. Great price
 The phone holder broke in half on the third day when clipping phone ito place. Don't buy this.
 The side "off" button cover was incorrectly made so that I cannot use it.  It will not depress.  It looks beautiful but is impossible to use.
 fit well almost too well.....had to work to get it on
 When we received this case it fit the phone great but the power button was unusable. Very unhappy with this case.
 Great fit and looks good, it is a welcome change from my Otterbox.
 Fast shipping! Love my case. It's great for the price! Would definitely recommend this seller and case.
 Good hard case and colors are vibrant. Have had many compliments on my case.
 The case fits and works fine. However, the tempered glass is not sturdy. It cracked after while in my pocket after a couple days of usage and had not been dropped.
 Fits perfectly on the phone light weight. Durable so far love it!
 Not impressed.  Back flap clip broke off.
 I am very happy with my phone case. Masculine and sturdy.
 Product says for iPhone 6 and 7 plus not 8 plus. Returning
 Totally boss looking and tough as balls!
 Really bad product didn't fit my iPhone 7, Its a tight fit. Makes the phone turn off.. disappointing
 Color fades and gets dirty easily. Mainly on front of phone
 Ordered this case twice and received cases for iPhone S and not 7 Plus on either occasion!!
 Love my merchandise it came in a timely manner and was very easy to put into use.
 Good case not to bulky, I really do like it except if you touch anywhere on the right side of the case it hits the power button... makes it hard to use
 I looooooooove it!
 Very happy with this product. Fit well and easy to put case on.
 great product, very durable, quick fast on time shipping
 Great case and price
 Works great for my work phone, heavy duty for my job. Recommend it 100%
 The only disapointment is that the free tempered glass protector came broken ...
 I like the case it's a light weight doesn't make the phone heavy.
 Can't wait to get one for my own phone.  The one I just purchased was for my husband...it is great!!
 The phone case fit perfect its extremely derible it's saved my brand new iPhone 7 from a few drops already deffently recommend zizo products
 Zero impressive quality
 The case was great but the screen protector was cracked/scratch when I got the product. Other than that the case itself was great!
 Hopefully this one doesn’t break like the last one only had 2 months.
 Boght this case and received it yesterday . While the case itself seems to be sturdy the holster clip broke as soon as I tried to spin the clip.
 Arrived as posted. Stable, sturdy, and convenient! Very good buy
 Love this case. Study and feels great in my hand. Bought it for my iPhone 7plus. My new first choice
 Really good case
 Phone case arrived broken.made of flimsy material do not waist your money
 Love the case but the clip broke very easily. Not a fan of the clip but love the case
 I love this cover because of the style and design. The added benefit that the case is strong and durable. However, the design and colors is what I truly love about the case
 The case it self is great the phone clip sucks it breaks easily
 I love it ....good product to have ...
 Great case
 Great case protects phone and camera.
 Do not buy this case. It is too tight on my phone and when you put it on you can't press and of the bottons on the sides.
 The power button does not function properly in this case. It is hard to push, and activates on it's own all the time. Very bad product.
 Love it !!
 Awesome case! Love the design and level of protection.
 Love The New phone case
 Tried to spin the clip and it broke off!<br/>I guess I was lucky enough not to lose my phone!<br/>Didn't even get the clip cover on the phone!!
 Very sturdy ❤️ As an emergency room nurse this is absolutely wonderful
 My husband loves his new phone case! Item looks exactly like the picture shown. Very nice case.
 Perfect
 very comfortable ,thanks
 Terrible clip broke on the 4th day
 Would recommend this product!!
 😺
 The worst built product and a complete waste of money. Buttons do not work correctly and cannot be repaired.
 Love the toughness of the look love the look of the case just a little bit hard When you first put it on
 great product. very happy
 Solid case, only compliant is that the blue is not what is shown in the picture....its a much darker blue
 Dude this case would be cool if it didn't constantly push the power button! Which causes the screen to go dark.
 Very good
 Poorly built, quality is lacking, feels very cheap. Fit isn't right, can't even use because the case hold down the side buttons.
 Awesome case, awesome price...you won't find a better case on the market for the price.
 Really well made case
 Great case. Works as advertised. I get asked a lot about it. Just wish it had a clip hole on each side, other then that I'd buy it again.
 This case is amazing and exactly what I was looking for.
 I love the case, but the clip came off the back of it the second day.
 None
 great case rugged, grippy and fits nice on iphone 7plus and it looks cool. Screen protector fits nice also
 Very pleased with this case.
 Awesome service! Shipping on time,  high quality product, great description.
 Fun funky sturdy great price  More than satisfied
 Great item and fast shipping
 It’s came just how it was supposed to and I love how it made!!!!
 Great product for a great price. The tempered glass was very easy to put on and the case is durable and fits perfectly.
 Happy with item purchased. Shipped quickly.
 I’m very happy with those cases.
 I love my new case!!
 I love the case; it protects the phone &amp; it has great features!
 Awesome case. Liked the color too
 besides that the screen protector came defective, I cant the turn the phone off while is in the case.<br/>Cool design but not what I was expecting
 Nice
 The case is amazing. Same quality as an otter box or speck case at half the cost... just as described.
 Great price. Great product.
 Very nice case- wish you guys would make iPad Pro case as well
 Love it!
 I bought this for my boyfriend who is rough with phone's. This is the first case that I have bought that has actually worked. He loves it and so do I!
 Belt clip broke. I need a replacement
 this case is terrible in every way its hard to get on and off and you can't use the home button when the case is on. It deserves zero stars!!!!
 Great buy
 Bought for my husband and he loves it
 Great product. Love the security it gives with my phones.
 Case is perfect and I love the sleek look
 It’s a great case I’m thinking about buying another color
 Super sturdy. Easy to grip.
 I love the case. looks even better than the picture. Included a screen protector as a bonus. It was very fairly priced also. Thank you Zizo!
 Great case for the cash
 Sturdy and durable.
 My new phone is very well protected by this sturdy case!
 I liked a lod good job guys<br/>Also the delivery and updates. The best<br/>And for last the way is on the presentation or box 👌
 Product great, was easy to put together......
 Great product. Husband likes. Two thumbs up
 Adore it! And I’m a serial phone breaker, so far this is the best!
 I feel confident my wife's i7 is totally protected
 Good solid Case. As advertised.
 The case is perfect. But my screen protector came shattered in the "protective casing".
 You cannot put the carrying case on iin the way where you can see the screen of your phone
 Awesome phone case! Fits comfortably in my hand and the glass screen was so easy to fit on. Best case I ever had!
 Amazing!! I loved great product
 This product is amazing!! Love it!
 This is the worst case to buy the power button is so hard it won't even shut off the phone. And the clip doesn't line up and doesn't work at all.
 This is a well built cover and I love it. Just got it and being in Construction, we'll see how long it holds up.
 Fits in the carpenter jeans pocket with great protection.
 Good solid case, great value.
 Great case for the price! Super easy to put on the phone, and it works great!
 Opened and the glass protector already cracked
 This is a great case, in construction orange too which is hard to find anymore.  Fit and finish are good and the price is nice
 Everything I thought it would be. Tough, rugged looking, and protective. Love the orange color (must be the Bronco fan in me)!
 every bit as good as otter,half the price and you also get a screen protector
 Cool case looks awesome, like me
 Case is fantastic...does exactly what it claims to.
 I like it a lot. :) i am actually ordering another one! Coming here on friday. Excited :)
 Love the case, but that little, cheap  clip just will not stay on my pants with any certitude
 I love this case great product I Recommend it
 Very nice case!  Protects the phone in every way!!
 My phone feels really protected with this case
 Good fit. Nice texture, great so far!
 The perfect blend of rugged good looks and toughness
 Brakes too easy very poorly
 This item shipped super fast. I'm talking delivered before I even knew that it shipped fast. Definitely recommend these guys and their products. A+++++++
 Great product! Feels good in hand. More protected than other more expensive cases. Well thoughtout design finally...thanks!
 My case was just what I needed at a very good price
 I bought this case for my son. He loves it!
 Opened the package and the belt clip is broke.
 The case very good and fit perfectly for my iphone 7plus
 I bought this for my husband and he was happy and impressed with the case. He really like it.
 Great product
 Product is awesome
 Very nice case
 Quick delivery, nice fit. Great deal for the price!! Will purchase from Zizo again!!
 I'm putting this at 3 stars for two reasons. A) so people will see it. B) because I had to modify the power button.<br/><br/>Bare with me.<br/><br/>I just used a razor and sliced the plastic behind the button. And used nail clippers to hit the side edges. Button is still intact and works great. You could use a Dremel or drill bit also.<br/><br/>Next! I used the plastic that came off the screen protector and cut out the corner so I could just throw it in the back of the case to protect the logo and back of the phone.<br/><br/>Camera is still exposed. Blah.<br/><br/>All together tho I'm very happy with the case. Most people probably don't think of solutions as I do, so thought I'd share. Could have easily been upset about the problem and said it didn't work. But with a little bit of work I got a great case for 20$ as opposed to other otterbox cases I've spent over 80
 Excellent product fits perfect very tough and looks great
 Ordered this case for my husband and he really likes it. Only thing the screen protector cracked already.
 Looks and feel just as I expected. The colors are true to the picture. It fits the phone nicely and feels great in my hand. Great product
 Love it
 Very impressed.  Would buy it again.
 Nice case. Super rugged
 Great case!! Easy to hold and not too heavy like most.
 Very nice case, love the design. Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank You!
 Is resistent and protective
 Similar to an otter box! very good!
 Great case
 Very durable case. Well satisfied could do without lanyard hole. But otherwise great case
 Power button does not work
 So far so good!  Love the Lanyard  great idea. I'm pretty rough on phones so time well tell, so for now 5 stars
 item was not usable. every time i would incert phone into cover &lt; the phone would turn off. poor design.
 Great product for great price with screen protector
 Amazing! Very durable, dropped phone right after installing
 The belt clip broke as soon as I rotated it the first time
 Upon arrival the tempered glass was shattered. Won't order again.
 I am really like this phone case
 Great product
 Great phone case. The belt clip is junk. Had it 2 days and it broke
 Very difficult to put on phone and glass didn't cover all of screen
 This phone case does NOT fit the iPhone 8 Plus.
 Solid case!
 Great case. Rugged but not too bulky.
 Amazing

 Very pleased!
 Very sturdy and good for us butterfinger iPhone users!

 Good solid case
 Better than expected very pleased !!!
 Case works great....but the clip part does not line up and is to small. So we can't us the extra piece.
 Didn't like it. You can use the power button  you need to remove the case to used power butten.  Disappointed
 Very easy to install, very durable.
 Love the color of it and it is so light to wear. Highly recommended for anyone who want a case for 7 Plus.
 Am very happy with this product  I recommend.
 Great product. Well made and not heavy.
 Great product very durable.

 The buttons on the case did not work.<br/>I've requested an exchange or refund.
 I liked the case, but it only lasted 2 months before the belt clip snapped in half
 Very durable case. Love the color options.
 Love the case it fits the phone perfectly
 Came in quickly and fit like a Glove!
 Great quality and fits phone perfectly.
 Had to return my case. It was making my on/off button stick. Poorly made.
 The case is awesome. Not too thick &amp; not too thin. Just what I need for my phone. The colors are also very nice
 Very durable! My husband loves it!
 It's wonderful. Love it
 Great product. Great price.
 I don't often write reviews unless they are deserved. I love my case, stylish protection at a good price.
 Great looking case came quick
 Great case and if you do have a problem with the case contact their 5 star rating customer service.
 Had to break it in a little, it kept trying to turn off my phone.  But after a few off and on's it was fine!
 Love the case love the price and it was shipped very quickly
 Awesome case, especially at this price.
 Great price great case
 Great case.
 I can now hold my iPhone without doing it.
 Cheap plastic for the mount pretty much came broken. I really had my hopes up
 Fit perfect, very pleased.  La.
 Great case, this is my 2nd one
 Was a gift and they love it
 The kick stand broke off after few days.
 Looks cool but glass screen protector isn't quite big enough and the on/off button is so stiff that it can't be used. Not very happy
 Great case. I love the clip and the stand for easy hands free viewing.
 Nice durable well made case.
 When I opened the box I found that one of the bolts was missing..i was disappointed
 the belt clip broke immediately
 This case is Lit. Two thumbs up 👍👍
 Buttons does not line up properly.
 I am very happy
 Really awesome, dropped it a few times and zero damage, I would totally recommend
 Awesome case , Great value , bought another style also to try out .....
 Quality, solid product. Fantastic buy.
 The case is fine; the belt clip cracked in half within five days of receiving it.
 Very good case
 Garbage
 It’s not the same blue that’s shown on the picture
 Very sturdy, excellent protection and stylish.  The best phone case for Iphone 7plus in my opinion.
 I love this case cover. Everything about it is great. Just as described.
 This are not actual iPhone 7plus cases. But in fact a 6s plus case... doesn't seem to work well
 Love this case!  I ordered the rose gold.
 Seems sturdy. The kickstand appears flimsy and when pulled a little hard will break
 Phone case is awesome. I was a little skeptical at first but my friend convinced me to buy it and I love it.
 Love the case, no complaints
 I am very happy with my case.....my son loves it
 Wife loves it
 Very satisfied with this product
 Nice case for a good price
 So happy with my iPhone case pretty good product love zizo $
 I love my case! Wonderful!  Even better than the picture! Gotta get more in different colors!
 Just received it quickly and  it went together great.  Looks good, I'm happy with it!
 Great case I love it and you can’t beat the price.
 Great case, worth the money. Love it
 Not happy phone does not shut off glass does not stick well not using case at all
 Feels sturdy, looks cool, clips on well.
 What a POS clip broke in 1 minute😒
 One of the best cases I’ve ever bought!
 Good products 👍🏽
 Awesome phone case love it!!
 Nice case. Fits iPhone 7+ very well. Really like the kick stand.
 Very nice case!
 Love it. Get compliments on it every day
 Love this case... best case for iphone 7 plus. And screen protector come with it which is good quality.
 Great case
 Great product  it's awesome
 It's to hard. Also if I'm going to turn off my phone its hard to press the off button
 Great Product. Was just as I expected and at a very good price. Recommend to everyone!
 Nice
 Buttons stick<br/>Either won't press or randomly tries to shut off the phone
 Sturdy and fits my iPhones 8 plus perfectly
 Great product
 case is molded wrong , holds power button in on right side , keeps shutting phone off
 Like it but, it seems like is too tight and the phone keeps on trying to power off or the volume goes up and down on it's own.
 I could give 5 stars but the color I received is not the same like in the picture. The one I get is navy blue .
 bought for my husband.  He loves it.  Very durable.
 Great case.  Great quality. Shipping was on time. Reputable company you can trust.
 Strong and dependable
 This case is great, better than any I have own
 Quality case and screen protector. Well worth the price!
 Good case
 It's A good phone case, beside the clip part! It's cheap and my has already done broke, only had it for 3 days!
 Really like the case so far.
 Thank you
 So far so good. And it looks great.
 Great item and great seller.
 This is my 5th time buying from Zizo! Excellent product, what u see is what u get! Excellent customer service as well. Keep it up Zizo!
 Awesome case and fast shipping!
 Great the hanset protection but heavy and designed for IPhone 6 Plus. The stand on the case back is weak.
 Crap
 Nice
 Had one for IPhone 6 like it so much I got one for my iPhone 7plus
 excellent quality case!!! No complaints!!!
 I am happy with the case.
 It was exactly what I wanted- perfect!
 Very poor plastic use &amp; my cover Brocken in 1st following down  my phone &amp; I never recommended this cover
 I bought my boyfriend and myself one and have not had a problem with it...we love the stand!!!!!
 I love it
 Very high quality, like the look too
 Looks good works good
 Clip doesn't even fit on case waste of money. If I just wanted a cover I would have ordered just a cover
 Did not like it had to return after 1 day. Power button fell off and couldn't shut off my phone.
 The tempered glass could be  stringer
 Great case<br/>Compact and strong
 Really happy with my purchase... thank you very much..
 Should of stuck with otter box but I tried to save a little cash .
 I love this case its light weight but durable at the same time. Great product for the price.
 The shut down button is very hard and does not work to shut down the phone - iPhone 7 plus
 Great case.
 I love this case
 Better than expected at a great price!
 Love this case. Way better than any Otter Box I've ever owned.
 great
 The whole thing!
 Very durable!
 My kickstand was missing a notch so it doesn't stay closed. Other than then that it's good.
 already had one and loved it so my friend got this one for him.
 Perfect fit, wonderful protection, great price, can't beat this buy
 Love this case! Very protective but light weight and not bulky.
 
 Very happy. Very comfortable product
 Really nice case
 Does not work for iPhone 8 Plus
 Love them
 The case looks great, but my clipper that holds to belt broke.
 I liked the case
 The case made the side on/off button hold down to keep turning it on and off. Which made it impossible to use.
 Very nice product sturdy but it fits backwards when u take out of clip. Very nice thanks
 Ok
 Durable and sturdy. Just what my husband needed in a warehouse setting. Great case
 Very good product
 The case was as pictured and I was pleased with my purchase.  My 7plus feels secured.
 Great phone case, very solid, highly recommend.
 Great quality!

 Love the case and love the colors.  Plan on buying a couple more in other colors.
 easy to install, compact, light weight, I would buy it again.

 Just as promised.  Love the look.  The on/off button covering needed to be messed with, however not a huge deal.
 DOES NOT WORK FOR IPHONE 8s
 Needed a 7 not a 7 plus

 Just received my case for an iPhone 7 plus, absolutely love it. Very nice case for the price
 Product arrived broken (glass screen). 1st day I got it it dropped while in the case and my screen cracked.
 It is a sturdy case and i really like the multiple layers of protection for my phone.
 Kickstand only lasted 6 weeks before it broke off.
 This case does not fit the iPhone 7plus correctly.  I was very excited to use it, but unfortunately it didn't fit.
 great case for the money.
 Really nice looking and good quality!👍
 Great case!
 Piece of junk. Fell apart at first use. Don't waste your money.
 power/home button not working and the case scratched my phone
 Works as advertised

 Not happy - the stand broke easily after having it for 2 weeks
 I like this product it jus broke but I had to buy another one
 Belt clip broke off 3 days after I got it... went to clip it on my belt and it just came apart
 As other reviewers have said... it did not fit correctly. Great look, just didn't fit
 The clip broke on the first day
 Very nice i love it thanks

 The case is to rigid and is impossible to use the lock bottom
 A lot better quality then I expected love the color variations to choose from.
 This don't fit my iphone7 plus, it's so tight and buttons won't work, if you put the case on
 Great quality case, better than I expected would order another one to have multiple colors.
 It's good a case and protects your phone well.
 love this case alot!
 Working out great. Product came in a timely manner and as advertised
 I could not unlock the phone or use it with the case on on my phone it is waste of money
 Case is very hard to get on and off. Belt clip broke after 45 days of use.
 Really enjoy the case but the tempered glass screen protector wasn't there. That was disappointing
 Prefect fit and makes gripping the phone better
 Strong cover
 I absolutely love this case.
 Feel of the case is good in hand
 Cool design. Awesome protection. Not as bulky as I thought it would be which is a plus.
 It started to separate from the edges.. the power button is to tight too it it protects well

 Very nice case
 I was disappointed with this case. When it first arrived, I noticed the orange was a darker shade of orange than the one pictured. After using it for a few days I saw that the material it is made from gets dirty quite easily (mostly from just holding the case). Sadly, I decided to ditch this case and went with another brand. I really loved the design of this case but just didn't live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>Edit: took away another star as their support keeps sending me the same email with "Please reach us at  e-mail address removed] and one of our awesome support reps will reach out as soon as possible!"<br/><br/>I cannot contact anyone without an email address. Get your ducks in a row.
 I would make this case assistant to the regional manager over Dwight. I mean, it protects, it covers, it looks great, and it's always by my side too. Besides, I won't have to hear Miiiichhhael coming from it!
 I bought this case before I actually pre-ordered the iPhone 7 plus and when it arrived at my home I was immediately impressed with materials that it was constructed of. I placed my iPhone 6S plus in it (because it too also fit) and I haven't taken it out, lol. Love the case, as long as you're making them.. I'll be buying them !!
 I didn't like this product at all for I bought 2 of your phone cases one for a iPhone and one for a note 7 withthen 2 mins of opening the product both cases broke. It say these cases are army tough sure hope our army don't use anything like it. Very dissatisfied!!!! Wasn't going to comment but u kept a asking so sorry.<br/>I would not get this product a half a star at all.
 After numerous emails to the seller, to get this issue resolved, they are non responsive.  The glass screen protector, they sent obviously has a manufacturing defect.  There is no opening in the bottom of the glass screen, to be able to access the round home button for the iPhone.  This screen protector covers the home button completely.  I'd suggest to find a different seller if you are interested in this type of case.
 Love my case and tempered glass! Directions were exact it snapped on and the glass was simple to place on. For me I did not use the belt clip but I adore the case.
 I absolutely love this case!! Sturdy and a very nice look to it. I have received a lot of compliments and when I tell them how much I paid for it, people actually think i paid more. I highly recommend this case to anyone who is looking to protect their iPhone. The kick stand is also a great feature. I love it and it compliments my new iPhone 7 plus phone...
 Me encanto!!!
 my screen protector cracked and I can not get in touch with anyone about warranty<br/>phone was not dropped<br/>it cracked while I was messaging
 Repackaged IPhone 6 Plus case does not meet IPhone 7 Plus case specs
 Like zero stars! The on off button does not line up! Piece of crap! The stand in the back hardly opens and feels like it's going to break, junk!
 Well, at first I had a problem with case fitting my phone in and then I emailed them for that issue. They told me that it was a manufacturing defect and they apologized for it. They sent me a brand-new package for free!<br/>I just love its impressive look designed for heavy-duty protection!
 I have not received my plus yet (of course who has), it is obvious there are several design elements on here that made it to the production line as a just in case the iPhone 7/7 plus leaks have this or that (for instance they left the hole in the back of the plus that was shown as the iPad Pro style connection port in several mock ups for the new phones). Having said that and having had all other major brands of cases, it just feels quality. This seems to be a legitimate case maker looking to get their legs in the business and is geared towards quality and consistency. Not bad at all!
 Well the cut out for the headphone jack doesn't really affect the case the lock button on the side does not work with this case .  The cell phone case is a rip off if you're buying it for the iPhone 7 Plus .  stay away
 Would love to give a complete review but I'm waiting on my new phone.  It looks good and has a great feel to it.  That's all I can say until I get my phone.
 So I purchased this for my brand new iPhone 7 only to be shipped a case in a damaged box and then to see that I was shipped a 6 Plus case instead not a 7 Plus specific case. Furthermore from the pictures it looked like a softer rubber outside similar to an otterbox but instead it's a very hard slick surface. It's a good thing the case seems sturdy as you'll drop this case often! Also the screen protector seems cheap and poorly made compared to comparable products.
 Do NOT buy. The case interferes with  lock button (on the side). After like a week of using the case was no longer white — became this like weird stained tan color
 It looks great, I’m concerned if it can protect my phone, I was hoping for a case that I would feel comfortable that would protect my phone...
 The clip has broken off already
 Horrible, power button did not match up. Ended up returning it
 Too tight a fit for the iphone 7 plus. You can't get the lock button to work b/c the rubber area is constantly pushing down the lock button on the side.
 The screen protector was cracked straight out of the box
 I do not think this case is for 7 plus!!!  headphone jack space still there and got my phone scratched
 lightweight, very pleasing to the eye, easy to install, very affordable, exactly as portrayed, A GREAT PRODUCT
 Excellent product
 The case fits so tightly (normally a good thing) but it constantly presses on the power button, turning the phone on/off or causing unexpected screen activity. It continued to do so even after several re fittings. Thinking maybe it was just slightly out of spec, I returned it, bought another one and got the same results. Too bad. I liked the looks and the protection it offered but its negative affects on the phone made it unusable.
 I purchased this as a gift for my Husband and so far he likes it
 This thing is junk it is not what it looks like I do not like it at all
 Bought this case for the iPhone 7 plus.  It looks like good quality out of the box, but it became delaminated (the hard inner case separated from the soft outer part in two areas) as soon as I slipped the phone in.  It also depresses the power button on the side of the phone constantly so the phone keeps asking me to slide to turn off.  I thought I'd try and save a few bucks by buying this case....but in the long run it actually cost me this case plus the cost of an otterbox.  Live and learn....  Don't buy this for iphone 7 plus.
 Mine arrived today but the belt clip is broke. Can I get a replacement?
 Best Iphone case ever!!!!!!
 Se rompió sacándolo del empaque
 The case was flimsy, and the holster was even less sturdy. Plus, the company sent me one for a Samsung Galaxy and I ordered one for an iPhone 7 Plus. After reading further reviews, they didn't even change the case from the 6 to the 7. The one the sent has openings on the bottom for ports the 7 doesn't have. Don't buy this case.
 My wife just received her case, UPS literally delivered it an hour ago and took 15 minutes to put the screen protector and case on. She tried clipping the case on her pants and the belt clip snapped clean off. Knock a star clean off.<br/><br/>The reviews stating it's a rebranded 6 Plus case, it is. The 3.5 mm audio jack opening is apparent. Falsely advertised as a 7 Plus but Zizo got off on an Apple technicality. Same dimensions between 6 Plus and 7 Plus and no real difference on the case openings other the audio jack and customers won't know otherwise unless they're anal. Knock a star off for that business practice.<br/><br/>The case itself is good but fits super snug. The power button is constantly depressed just enough not to have it constantly turning it on. The user can just squeeze the right side of the case to turn on the phone or squeeze the same side and hold long enough to have the option to turn off the phone. The user doesn't have to press on the power button on the case. Product kind of works as intended with that unwanted power side squeeze hidden feature. My wife doesn't like it, so knock another star off.<br/><br/>For the price, Zizo is probably banking on "Hey, you get what you pay for." customer mentality. For $17, not many brick and mortar stores offer a 3-layer protection system for your phone. Even with the belt clip snapped off it can be used as a hard screen protector. There's a tempered glass screen protector included which would usually run for $4-$8 on Amazon. So for the bargain for the amount you get, hang a star up for them.<br/><br/>3/5 stars<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>1/5 stars. Returning item. Cheap plastic. The stand is worthless and developed cracks without any usage. Defective product.
 I would have given it 5 stars, but the gray rubber bumper on the case was already lifting upon arrival.
 the back kickstand does not come out easily
 I ordered this phone holder because of its positive reviews and could not be more disappointed. Once I put my iphone 7 plus in there I realized the lock button did not work. Then I tried clicking and it will not even do that consistently unless I hold the case in exactly the right spot. Case needs lots of work, I am returning it.
 It does not allow you to use the lock button. Poor case.
 We were very excited about this product.  Saw all the reviews, even thought maybe just the one that we got was defected, so we ordered again.  The problem is that the case keeps turning off the phone, as though the lock button keeps getting hit.  The second one did it too.
 Generally I try to be positive in my reviews even if a product doesn't meet expectations and this will be no different. It is mostly well made. Two complaints though: the various parts are poorly formed not fitting together well; and, the "tempered glass" protective front cover is actually flimsy plastic. I took a chance on a "price point" item and lost out.
 BEWARE, This is NOT for the iPhone 7 Plus as advertised.  This case was designed for the 6 Plus now let me tell you why.  See photo 1 (there is no iPhone 7S Plus). This should say COMPATIBLE but not FOR.<br/><br/>There is a port on the bottom left which specifically is designed to allow you to plug in your beloved 3.5mm headphone jack.  See Photo 2<br/><br/>Although the dimensions for iPhone 6Plus and 7Plus are identical, the case doesn't fit perfectly as it should.  See photo 3.  The outer tan case doesn't fit snug to the inner part of the case as you can see by the slight gap between the green and tan.  The tan portion slightly bows out but only on the top of the case.  If you attempt to push it in to remain flush, it only does so until you grip the top portion of your phone to either click the power or volume buttons and then it pops back out, fit just isn't right.<br/><br/>The inner case has a detent for your power button. Mine was sitting improperly and without touching it would ask if I wanted to power down my phone telling me the button was resting on the power button.  Adjusted the case and still nothing, seems to be a problem with the molding for this case.  It required me to "adjust" the button so it no longer had inadvertent contact with the power button.<br/><br/>The overall case look and feel is nice.  Pretty light and a good feel (provided none of the flaws above existed).  Can't speak of the glass as I already had glass on mine.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this case for its design and style.  This need some tweaks.
 I received my new iPhone 7plus today and was very disappointed that I couldn't use this case.  First off right out of the package the glass screen protector was cracked.  Secondly when I install the case the power wake button doesn't function and it's putting so much pressure on it it keeps trying to power off.  Sending back for a refund

 Love the case but my screen protector is already broke and i only had it a week 😠😠😠
 It's a nice looking case. Generally, I like the quality and the looks of it. It's not bulky but seems to be protective enough despite that.<br/>For me, though, there is a one big design flaw with it. As far as I'm concerned, the case is good for lefties. But, for right handed operation, it's not very good.<br/>Let me explain. I like to hang the phone off of my right pocket for right handed access. And, I also like to have the single middle lid of the holster facing towards the front for easy access with my thumb and pointing finger. But, the only way to achieve that configuration is by putting the phone into the holster upside down because of the lanyard loop. So, when you get it out of the holster you end up with an upside down phone.<br/>I am seriously thinking about carving the loop out of the case. For now, I am trying to see if I can get used to using it the holster lip facing back. We'll see.
 I wish these cellphone case engineers would get it through their heads that some of us actually work for a living and need a case that can keep up with us on the job. In water, concrete, construction, plumbing, on ladders, sand, crawling under homes, farming, etc. We want BULKY we want THICK PADDED CORNERS, and NO, 1/16th of an inch is NOT thick. My old Galaxy had a Ballistic Tough Jacket Max case, and it was an awesome case, but alas it isn't made for the iphone 7 plus. I've bought 3 cases so far for my new iphone, and NONE have had sufficient front bezel protection. The pictures are misleading. The bezel is almost flush with the screen. One trip where you fall, and are holding your phone and it smacks the concrete and your gonna have a destroyed phone. My Tough Jacket Maxx survived 3 of those slams. My old Galaxy is still working. This case was a giant disappointment. Why so much back protection??? The back isn't what im worried about!!! The back isn't glass!!! Some of us have jobs that require us to be in unsafe conditions, with unsafe flooring, unsafe grounds, and crawling across beams. Accidents happen. Give us a case that can help US. There's plenty of cases for the n3rds with cubicle jobs.
 I like the bumps designed into the back of the case, I feel like I have better control of the device overall. The pictures make the red look RED, but the case I received is closer to maroon or burgundy, which I like more actually.<br/>My negatives are this- within a week the belt holder feature had snapped off and within two weeks the piece that comes out to ‘stand’ the device broke.  I’m not a wild and crazy consumer, so I don’t feel like I was overusing or abusing these features when they broke.<br/>The basic case still works fine, but I paid for more features than what I have ended up with. If you are looking for a case with a belt holder- look somewhere else.
 I bought this case for my son's new iPhone purchased March 2018. As of now (August), it is trash. My son is very responsible and takes really good care of his phone, but this case did not hold up at all. The coloration discolored (his was neon green/black). The neon didn't stay neon, despite nightly cleanings of his phone. My real disappointment is in the quality. Yes, these cases look really cool, but in the end, I wish I would have chosen something different for him, such as an Otterbox. His screen is completely shattered. Thanks, Zizo, for a cool looking case that just doesn't do the job. Don't buy this!
 I've had this for several weeks now.  First, it is very cheap, in a good way, in that it didn't cost hardly anything and included the screen protector.  I wasn't sure why a lanyard was included, but I have found it to be very handy.  I keep my iPhone in my shirt pocket and the lanyard makes it easy to retrieve if I'm wearing a coat and has caught the iPhone when I have bent over, preventing an impact.<br/>The kickstand requires some sort of a tool to open, I've only used it when I am sitting for a meal so I grabbed a table knife.<br/>I thought I would use the holster more, but I have not.  When I tried it out, it was effective.<br/>The device fit my iPhone7 perfectly.
 Let me start out by saying that I work in a retail warehouse environment. I am around forklifts all day and I will take my phone out of my vest while I’m on my lift. However while on getting on and off my lift and putting my phone back in my vest sometimes my phone will take the occasional tumble out of my hand. Nothing too far as I’m on the fairly short side. I’ve had this case for almost a year. Yes, I know in case terms that’s an ok amount of time. However, I’m used to an Otterbox that doesn’t break and will hold up. Also, they advertise that it’s “military grade drop”. Considering I’m only 5’3” and it’s just taking a tumble not a slam this is not possible. It broke in three spots- two on the side and one on the top. Also, the case was too tight. I couldn’t take it out of the case to do the occasional cleaning that I like to do. Honestly, I would save your money and get an OtterBox.
 I have seen videos &amp; read reviews for this item &amp; considering i got it at a better price (retails for $34.99 on zizo's website) this was a great price. The tempered glass is great easy to put on , only thing is no hole for camera, but does effect the front camera at all still clear photos. Now for the case itself, easy installment onto the phone but slightly tough to take off (I used the hole in the back to help). Also the kickstand on the back is difficult to open without nails. The case is very durable and tough nice rise in the front to protect the face along with the screen protector itself. The holster also is great to use or the lanyard for the bunkered edges great case for a great price ... just watch for the kickstand on the back
 I have an iPhone 8, not the 8 Plus. By my mistake and not being attentive enough, I placed an order for an iPhone 8 Plus case. Pretty easy mistake to make... Requested a return through Amazon, received an email from Zizo which would not pay for a label to return, will not reimburse for the return, and will induct a "restocking fee". All in all after shipping and fees, I will have wasted 13 out of 17 dollars for nothing. The case itself is cheap. The shock absorbing rubber insert is very tough, not very shock absorbent. I would not trust my phone with it, and I will not be buying another case from Zizo.
 The Short Version...<br/>+ Snug fit and raised edges help protect the phone body and screen from most elements<br/>– Case material is cheap, kickstand broke off of case<br/>– Screen Protector is very thin and does not have rounded edges so it does not fit the phone like it should. It broke before even being able to put it on my phone due to the bad design of the "Pull" ribbon<br/>*Verdict: The old saying it's true: "You get what you pay for." The case is on it's way back to Zizo.<br/><br/>The Long Version...<br/>First off, this is just my experience with the case, so I am not speaking on anyone's behalf. Please note, I have only had this case two days and I am drafting this review as a result of deciding to return the case back to Zizo. Whether or not it was my ignorance or perhaps the true quality of the case, I just want to be honest with my fellow Amazonian people.<br/><br/>Material:<br/>To start off, the case material is of cheep quality. It has a rubbery feel to the outside shell. The kickstand is a nice touch for watching videos.<br/>The case got dirty already, and not even alcohol will get off the stains around the edges.  But it's rough edges make it seems as though was printed by a college student on a 3D printer. The inside shell is made of a durable rubber that seems like it could withstand a drop from just about any height.<br/><br/>Fit:<br/>The case fits very snug around the phone. So snug, I'm actually afraid to take the phone out of the case to clean it in fear of bending the phone.<br/><br/>My Experience:<br/>I received the case a day before obtaining the iPhone 7 Plus on September 16. I was very excited to find it would fit my, then current, iPhone 6s Plus, so I opened up the cardboard packaging to take a peak. I was able to take it out just fine, but the screen protector and instructions were shoved in to the case so tightly, that the plastic "Pull" ribbon didn't help  at all.<br/><br/>I pulled on the ribbon and heard a loud snap. You guessed it, the tempered glass screen protector was now broken. I discovered that the instructions (located inside of the screen protector foam with the words "We've got you covered" on the front of them), were in the package with the screen protector not outside of it. These instructions say not to pull down on the ribbon,  but up. So I decided it wasn't worth making a fuss about. But even still, the screen protector lacks the rounded edges necessary to truly fit the phone. I have a feeling that between that and the thinness of it, it probably would have broken anyway.<br/><br/>The next thing I tried to do, was test out this kickstand. I put my nail under the small lip and I heard another snap. That time it was my nail. It was so hard to pull up, that I broke my nail and lifted it up from my skin, causing it to bleed. After using the kickstand for the last two days, it actually broke off as well.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>The case does not meet expectations, but I guess the old saying is true: "You Get What You Pay For." It's on its way back to Zizo now.
 This is a great case. I bought the rose tone and it is a dusty rose/frosty mauve color. The back and sides have a texture that works well for gripping, I haven’t really used the kickstand yet but it seems durable. It also has these raised bumps on the back so that it doesn’t sit directly on any surface which I feel adds to its overall durability and protection. So far I’m quite satisfied and feel confident that my phone is safe and secure which is extremely important. I have this 4 stars instead of five because I could have totally done without the piece that makes it clip on to things like your waist or belt. I just don’t prefer to wear my phone like that and so the piece sits in a drawer but if you would utilize something like that it’s nice because it sits on the face of the phone covering it up. I might give it a go when it warms up and I take it hiking. Overall I’m very satisfied.
 There are questions about this case. While it was advertised as specifically for the I7 Plus, and the price was right, the openings for the speakers appear to have been designed for the I6 Plus. There's even an opening on the back of the case that seems to have no purpose. The tempered glass insert didn't completely cover the screen, leaving an approximate 1/16 edging around the phone screen unprotected. The color was supposed to be bright blue, but it was a darker blue hue, which looks nice, but harder to see if dropped in the woodland/meadow areas where I spend a lot of time clearing brush and mowing during the warm months. Two days after installing the case, I noticed one of the four plastic bolts on the back was missing. They are decorative only and the recessed seating for them is sealed, so the omission was cosmetic,not jeopardizing the integrity of the case. But hey, it was part of the look that attracted me to the case. Lastly, installing the case was like trying to wrestle a bear into a child's automobile seat, which is the main reason I didn't return the case, because once I finally got it on and found that the buttons, camera ports and speakers worked, I thought removing the case might break the phone and was too risky. I hope the rubber corners absorb enough shock to actually protect the phone from falls. I've learned that after keeping the phone in my pocket for a day, body heat makes the rubber more flexible, so if the case is removed in the future, I'll make sure it has been warmed up. I do like the overall armored look and the case ridges and dimples are perfect for grip. It's practically impossible for the phone to slip out of your grasp. I have not tried out the lanyard, but like having the option. The folding stand in the back is also nice and a great way to watch a YouTube explanation while working, such as installing and disconnecting  a new grapple on my tractor. So I'm keeping the case despite the shortcomings and misleading advertising. Two or three years from now when I buy an I9 or I10, I'll be very skeptical of another Zizo because I think the company played too many games with this case.
 First, it's listed as Amazon Prome but it took more than a week for the case to come, the shipping date continued to change, Prime is two day shipping, as advertised on the listing, which is false.<br/> Second, the screen protector is to small for the screen, yet another iPhone 6 Plus screen protector.<br/> Third, the power button does not fit properly, its far to delicate, the mold set the regress to close to the iPhone power/ sleep button.<br/>Fourth, the black soft shell mold was not framed correctly, the edges are not straight, but wavy.<br/>Fifth, the orange hard shell is not molded properly to the black soft shell, there are areas where it is raised, and there are areas where there are missed cuts.<br/>Sixth, The mold is clearly for both the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 plus and maybe the Note, there are cut outs on the mold of the case that serve no reason. That can leave the phone more susceptible when and if dropped.<br/>Seventh the cut out for the apple logo is not center, which leaves me to believe that the case is to serve multiple phones.<br/>Eighth, the plastic screw covers are loose, they will soon fall off.<br/>Ninth, with the type of material used and the quality of the molds, there is no way that this "military grade" as advertised.<br/>Tenth, the snap on the case for the belt clip is for left handed people, when it should have been molded for both right and left.<br/><br/>What good I can say is the color is correct. The kick stand is nice, but because of the quality of the hing and slide of the kick stand, I can tell will not last long.<br/><br/>Needless to say I am not happy with this purchase or how long I had to wait for the case. I feel miss lead in both quality and shipping.
 I've been pretty happy with this case since I got it. First, the glass protector did its job and then some. Somehow I had cracked the protector screen but couldn't really order a replacement so just left it on. It cracked some more, but none of that ever transferred to the phone screen. The case itself has worked well. I had the phone slide out of my pocket over the side of a ship that's on "The Hard". It fell about 20 feet and had no damage, worked fine afterwards.<br/><br/>The kickstand is kind of flimsy, I can't remember when it broke but it did break and rather easily.<br/><br/>I need a new screen protector so I'm gonna order another one of these.
 I purchased this cell phone case and holster clip and within 2 months the holster clip broke.  I could not return.  I emailed manufacturer and no response.
 After being sent the wrong case the first go around, finally received the case supposedly designed to fit the iPhone 8 Plus. The main problem is that the power and volume buttons on either side simply did not function with this case on.  I could have gotten used to the apple symbol not lining up on the back with the circular cutout, but a case where the buttons don't work is useless.
 I recently purchased one of the Zizo Bolt cases.....The picture makes it look much nicer than it looks in person....I was very disappointed by the cheap look,of the case....It will probably work well to protect my phone , it seems made of a sturdy hard plastic.....But like I noted, the case does not seem finely finished, kinda coarse in the details, almost like the hard plastic is painted...That probably may not effect the function...
 I really love this case. Perfect size for me and the texture is great. Generally I’m clumsy and drop my phone a lot. The texture and ridges make it hard to drop and makes a large phone more usable. The one complaint I have is that the hard plastic exterior  cracked near the power button. It doesn’t hinder performance, just frustrating. I have the iPhone 8 and it fits perfectly. It was a very snug fit on install but fits very well.
 Purchased for style and color, but the tab that holds the phone on the cradle broke in about two weeks.  Don't know if it was a fluke, poor design/quality or what, but I would not recommend.  Seems to be much cheaper and not as durable as previous Otterbox I had with previous phone.  Should have stuck with Otterbox.
 I have two of these cases.  One for my phone, and the other for wife's phone.  She absolutely loves her.  Her favorite feature is the lanyard. It allows her to be "hands-free" and talk on the phone when she needs both hands.<br/><br/>I like the toughness of the case.  My phone fell from the bed of my truck and landed glass side down on our cement driveway.  No issues.<br/><br/>I gave four out of five stars because the tempered glass that came with mine was broken.  I also had to cut along the bottom crease of the power button on the cover to allow the button to actually be used.  Until I made this modification I could press the power button with the case on.  This wasn't an issue for my wife's case though.
 Gorgeous case and it fits perfectly.  Excellent condition, too.  Except for one problem... The protective screen cover isn't worth diddly.  Also be aware that the clip doesn't swivel.  Other than these issues, get this case and you're good to go. 👍👍
 The case fits good and seams to be made of sturdy materials. Also I like the temperd glass screen protector. Another thing I like is that it's not to bulky, and the plastic is not tacky like a lot the cases today. It's seems like it comes out of my pocket easier. My last case was $50 so I like this price a lot better.
 I have made 8 or more purchases of the same Zizo phone case since early 2017 and the reason for the multiple purchases is because parts of the case or the case itself tends to break. I'm an officer in the Navy who has to wear a Khaki Uniform everyday so the Khaki colored Zizo phone case is a good match for use at work but like I said I've had to purchase one after another after another...so if the quality and durability of the case can be improved, that'll be great.
 I bought one for myself and I like it so much that I bought another one for my husband.  I like how its very durable and the bonus screen protector and holster but most of all the reason I love this is the stand.  Unlike other stand this one if not flimpsy and hard to open up!  I definitely would recommend this!
 This is the 3rd case I have purchased. I really like my case so much I purchased one for a friend. With the kick stand on the back I don’t have to worry about  propping it against a book. Also with the extra kick stand on back of holster is A+. I have dropped my phone numerous times with phone not being damaged. I purchased 2 cause I changed phones and color. Always snug fit I know my phone is secured. Great Job!
 Just ordered it seeing the pictures and reviews. Have'nt got it yet(probably in next 2 days). Case seemed very appealing. Looks very solid with extra protection layers. Already loving it.
 My phone was in the pocket of my book bag and somehow it cracked. Nothing out of the ordinary. I was going to ignore it but Now it snags on everything. I came here to look for the warranty info and read the other reviews which reminded me that the on/off button doesn't work either. I have to take the cover off in order to turn on the phone. Good reason to not to buy another. Going back to the rock solid  UAG
 Pretty awesome case. Very strong, I've dropped my phone a few times and I know my phone is protected. The only complaint I have is that my stand broke off within two days. I'm not too pickey with cases so this did not bother me much
 By far my favorite case so far, you can tell the durability in it and shipping was fast
 I got this case yesterday in the mail. I got the gray/black one and it's a darker gray than in the picture but it is a nice gray. It seems like it is made for a iPhone 6s because of where the speakers are. The left speaker opening is bigger where you can plug in a headphone and the right speaker while is smaller where it's the best size for the speaker. The only thing I wished is if they made the left whole the same size as the right sense it's advertise for a IPhone 7 not a IPhone 6s. But other than that I really like the case. I'm just giving it a 3 star because of the speaker opening problem.
 So I just got this in the mail today, and when I went to use the part that attaches to your belt, I turned it so it would be sideways on my belt and it immediately broke, causing the clip to fall off and is now useless.
 I have had bought two within 4 months and both of the clips on them broke really fast the second one came with the cracked  clap because it broken even faster than 1st one
 As someone who gets butter fingers from time to time this case has a really great grip. The two way case holder was a real nice added plus. Finally I may not have read the product description (I tend to do dumb stuff like that) but the screen protector was a really welcomed addition. All and all good product. Fly Eagles Fly!!!!
 Poor quality in the construction of the product. Missing paint around the edges and very rough. I bought the tan model and can see the black primer underneath. To be completely honest I like the product but it’s no worth the price. Was looking to replace a worn out Otterbox and this didn’t meet the standards they advertised.
 It can survive any fall from the coffee table to a concrete floor from waist high it’s great
 This is a fantastic case..especially for the price!!! This case is very well built and secures firmly to your phone. The kickstand on the case is executed very well and functions like it should. The only issue I had with this case was that once my phone was installed the power button would not work; to fix this I simply cut down the power switch on the case (inside of the case not the outside) and it works perfectly now. Overall I am extremely happy with this product but will give it 4 stars for the power button problem
 I do like the case.  It looks just like the picture they showed.  The color is the same too, however, I think the edges just don't cover enough for me and that was my biggest deal when I bought it.  I should have looked at it better.
 Item came with the tempered glass already  broken.  There is no way that this phone case is “military grade”.  Would be afraid to drop my phone useinv this protective case.
 I did not receive an 8plus case. It was for a regular 8. Much smaller. After waiting an extended period of time to receive. Only to find it was wrong, was a little upsetting. So I reordered it again, everyone makes mistakes. I trust this will help to get the correct case this time.
 Love it! I had no fitting issues with my phone nor any issues with it interfering with the volume or power buttons. My son had the orange case which had a fitting issue with the power button causing his phone to shut off on its own. We were going to send it back when I suggested he try my case (gold); it worked perfectly on his phone and I had when I tried his case (orange), I didn't experience any problems whatsoever so we simply switched. It's all good.
 I got the phone cover for my husband and he love it the only pro is that the belt clip does not go to the sides, he like to put it vertical
 there's no long story to this. I opened the package, phone in the case, tested out the kick stand located on the back and it broke as soon as I opened it.
 Belt clip eventually breaks I have had 3 company would not replace
 I received the product pretty quick which was great with the type of work I do it has fixed my damage to my phone well.  Thanks......
 Bought this for my dad and he LOVES the case
 Case has a great feel... Even better protection... only one change I'd suggest... The clips latch is a bit stiff and breaks after a few weeks... This is my 3rd zizo case I love them but run through the clips too fast
 Bought for my iPhone 8 Plus...  just as the reviews say it does not fit. As the pic shows it even says for 7s/6s/6 on the box but the description says for iPhone 8 Plus.
 It fits good, but had issues fitting it with my screen 3D protector. Button hard to press on my Iphone 7 Plus, the off Button would keep shutting phone down or trying to, so I had to cut it off. But it is well made, very good looking.
 In no way shape or form does this case fit an iPhone 8 Plus. The power and volume buttons don’t work with this case.
 I like the price you more to than what you pay for very good quality material really durable I wor in the autotive industry and it very sutible for its purpose I recommend this to anyone
 This is an awesome case that fits perfect.  It's military drop tested, has a kickstand. It comes with a built-in keychain and lanyard. Awesome!!!
 The Zizo 7 Plus Cover is very well made and is excellent value.  I did not know that I had to separate the layers of the case in order to free the power  button so that the phone powered on and off. That step seems to be critical. Otherwise, the case is all that it was represented.
 The case is great, and fits my phone perfectly.  However, I have bought three different phone cases because the belt clips continue to break.  If the manufacturer would build a stronger belt clip they would have an awesome product.
 The product is priced correctly.  I have had my cover for about 6 months or less and it is already broken.<br/>I know it comes with a belt clip.  I know why now.  If you put it in your back pocket it will break over time.
 Excellent price and the recipient loves it.
 Good case, a little hard to put on. The side buttons are a little bent, and for me I'd like a little more rubber type grip on the back. This case has a soft velvety feel which is great for calming myself but I tend to have butterfingers and drop my phone a lot! I've only had it a week but so far so good. Order arrived on time and intact. I would definitely order agin and recommend to friends.
 This case is worthless for anyone that wants to have TRUE MILITARY grade protection and all that they are claiming for your every expensive phone!! The "tempered glass" cover wouldn't even FIT the phone!! And it didn't even stick to the phone either!! If they are going to claim that these cases are so awesome then they should make sure they fit the phone first!
 They tell you have a lifetime warranty but they don't.  They really have a 30 day warranty. Mine turned yellow after 30 days and looked terrible.  45 days later I'm stuck with a nasty yellow cover.  Going back to ballistic cases. They would not honor an exchange or return.
 There were enough positive reviews to outweigh the negative so I thought I would give it a shot. While it is a good looking case that is the only positive I can give it. Like others here, I had issues where it keeps the power button pressed in, so I'm going to have to send it back.<br/><br/>UPDATE-<br/>After reading through some of the other reviews, I decided to try shaving the inside of the power button and that fixed the issue for me. The holster snapped in half within 15minutes of use though, not that I really expected to use it.
 Bought for my new iPhone 8 Plus. Looks nice, but the volume buttons are not working at all and the power button is extremely hard to press mostly doesn't work either. Has caused my phone to freeze several times. Very disappointed.
 Loved the look of the case but after 2 months it began to slowly fall apart . Really disappointed!
 I have spent a lot more for crudy poorly made covers. I am a owner of a construction company and I am always working in extreme conditions. Dropping my phone is a regular thing. This case is awesome, all the features and even the lanyard are great. One thing keeping it from 5 stars, it does muffle the speaker a bit. Still the Best Buy for me
 The case came with a broken kickstand and it seems like it has been used before
 Very difficult to install phone in case. CHEAP material in kickstand. Broke in two weeks of use. Will not buy again, even though it is seems to be a protective case.
 Product arrived very fast. Good quality material, my son loves it for his IPhone.
 This case is junk. It's too hard and stiff and the power button doesn't work. I felt like I was going to break my 7 plus just getting it in and out. The case keeps constant pressure on the power button. No matter how you try to reposition the phone, this issue can't be resolved. One star is too many for this piece of junk.
 Case is ok - customer service sucks!!
 This case locked my iphone 7 plus  up until I took it out<br/>Not good design
 Great cellphone case out for it phone 7!!!
 Great product
 I purchased this case for my son and he is very impressed with it.  It is tough looking and is suitable for the men to have on their phones without looking feminist.  I loved the fact that it comes with a tempered glass screen protector.  It also comes with a belt clip which is nice to have.
 Very nice
 Sturdy case offers great protection. Dropped my iPhone 8 off the front of the truck in ramps into a concrete floor and not even a scratch on the case. We would definitely buy again.
 Fits the phone like a glove and i love the fact it has a place to put like a medallion or small hook on it to put anything even a hanger for wearing! 👍🏼
 Loved this case bought it for husband he loves it phone calls all the time and hasn’t broke
 My husband like it.
 Nice case, looks good. I’ve bought 2 of these and both kick stands broke within 3 months.
 I have been using the case for only a week.  So far I am extremely satisfied.  Seems very sturdy and comes with tempered glass cover which I like.
 NOT FOR iPhone 7 Plus! It doesn't fit yet they are selling it to people anyway! Great looking case that's good for nothing if you are a 7  Plus owner.
 I purchased two of the cases and one of them didn't come with the Tempered glass. Fortunately the other one did. I am not sure as to why one came with the tempered glass and the other didn't.<br/><br/>Rick F.<br/>Nikon: Field Service Engineer
 I work in a plant setting and my phone case definitely protects greatly. Great choice and good price. It’s been a couple of months now and still protecting greatly.
 SO STURDY! GREAT QUALITY
 Received broken, returning. This would have been my second one, first one lasted until I upgraded phones.
 The stand pin snapped completely off.
 Great Case As Advertised 👍🏻👍🏻
 This case does not fit a iphone 8 plus, although in the description it says its for a iphone 8 plus.  Misleading and incorrect.
 So far I like the case. I ordered two of them for my iPhone 8’s one of them was the wrong size.
 nice product ,valuable the price
 Broke within the first day of having it, lock button barely works
 Everything was great but the temper glass came with a big bubble
 very nice case. protects the phone well and also makes it SO much less slippery (the ribbing helps for sure) which makes it less likely to slip out of your hand. Kickstand and holster are great as well!
 Bought it for my sister. She loved it!
 This case is very sturdy!! The clip holds very well!! In case of an accidental drop of your IPhone which we all know is so delicate, it will be well covered!! Great price!
 not made for an iphone 7 plus case. this was made more for a 6s case. The lock botton does not seem to match up properly it forces the phone into a constant reboot. Sent them back immediatley
 This is such an awesome case, worth every penny. I also work at amazon but have never ordered from here personally but hands down the fastest place I have ever received an order from, also an amazing place to work \(^_^)/
 The plastic belt clip snapped within 2 minutes of owning this cheap piece of crap. I will not reorder this.
 Thank You my son loves it🤗
 This case is by far the most durable and amazing case that i have ever purchased--so much so that I ended up buying another one!!
 K Bradley.  Bought for my daughter and she loves all the features.
 Good case like the feel etc.
 I just received this cover but so for I like it. Very well built. Good quality product.
 All the colors
 Very nice case
 This case broke while trying to remove my phone from it, outer plastic shell is thin and didn't last a week.
 Great quality for the price!
 I needed a case that would protect my iPhone, this case is perfect.
 This is a great case, love the color and quality.
 The case is nice.  The screen protector was cracked when I received it.  I messaged amazon but have not heard back.
 This case has been perfect!
 Really good protection dropped my phone a thousand times and in perfect condition still.
 This orange is fire
 This is a awesome product! It protects my iPhone 7 vey well!!
 Awesome case , definitely recommend!
 I found the plastic to be very cheap looking.  The rubber also did not have much "cling" to the touch.  Returned
 Very nice case for the money.  Appearance, fit, function, and ease to set up were all excellent.
 Great product

 Great case
 On a recent river trip with a brand new iPhone 7+ I agonized over the possibility of being bumped and watching my iPhone 7+ sink into the Rhine river.  The case provides excellent protection when I am active and a lanyard, just like on a camera, that ensures the phone stays attached to my body.  Mostly I do not need this level of protection so I use a smaller less bulky bumper case for my day-to -day needs.  However when I have the need to protect $800 iPhone from falling on a hard surface, drowning, being pick-pocketed, or just getting separated this is a great choice.
 I pre-ordered my iPhone 7Plus...so I was a bit worried that there weren't many options for covers/protection for the 7Plus'.  I read a few reviews for the Zizo Bolt and the styling looked rugged enough to provide the protection I need, and certainly had a great value.  The case arrived on Thursday, and my phone was to arrive on Friday, so I had a day to play with the case and get familiar with it before the phone arrived.  I ordered the Rose Gold Zizo Bolt, because my phone was also Rose Gold.  The color matches the phone well.<br/><br/>It definitely appears to be an iPhone 6Plus case that was rebranded, but that is OK, because the phones are exactly the same size.  The part closest to the phone is a durable feeling rubberized black plastic that definitely seems able to take some impact.  The outer portion (rose gold) seems to be a moderate thickness painted plastic.  The kickstand was a bit snug when it arrived and took some coaxing with a butter knife to get it open.  I was afraid I was going to break that plastic outer case, but I didn't.  There is also a nice screen cover included in the packaging, and I was more than pleased that it came off relatively easily when I positioned it in the wrong spot initially.  It laid back down smoothly without any bubbles or issues and has held up well, so far.<br/><br/>After taking the phone to the farm this weekend, riding around on tractors and being fairly rugged with it, the case held up well, though there are some wear spots showing on the pink plastic.  I'm happy with my purchase, and certainly can't complain about the price point.  It is worth the money.
 This is the third order on this product. The first one I loved (Gold), then it easily broke when I took a knee in a retail store. I dropped from two feet and the “Holster” attachment Broke. I liked the product so I reordered. The second order was Defective... I ordered a different color (Red), not only was the style on the unit slightly different but the “Holster” attachment didn’t line up with the phone jacket at all... Then,  I decided to go back and  re-ordered my original choice of color (Gold) again. To my Dismay... The "Holster" Attachment matches the phone jacket but this time the phone easily falls out. The Holster Clip mechanism didn’t fit intot he slots on the phones jacket. I hate to leave bad feedback but this is ridiculous… i will not order from this manufacturer again anytime soon. So Be advised. You heard it from me. Good luck if you order! This is not a reflection on Amazon... I wouldnt shop anywhere else unless I had too!
 Great case all around... if you're not looking for one of those waterproof cases. I wasn't. Its ergonomically correct and aesthetically pleasing as much as it is protective.  Have you ever tried to get an aftermarket charger cord end past the tiny charger port on some of the overpriced cases?.... not happening! This case is much more compatible with aftermarket chargers as well.<br/><br/>Great job Zizo!<br/><br/>My only complaint/suggestion would be to change the case and belt clip relationship to be more flexible. As it is, you can only wear the phone in the clip in one orientation. It would be much better if we could holster the phone in various orientations.
 This product does not fit the iPhone 8+ properly and I would advise against using it.  The case fits very tightly and as a result, the power button is constantly being pushed in.  I had to take my knife and cut out the power button from the case.  problem solved, but case looks stupid now with a big hole in the side.  Don't waste your money buying this case for the iPhone 8+.  I'm sure this case fits fine for the iPhone 7+.  I did not contact the seller about this issue.  What's the point?  It's a cheap case and I got what I expected.  Plus, the rubber is very thin and slippery.  Spend the $$$ and go buy yourself an OTTERBOX case.
 These cases are sturdy and true to color.  Very protective case.  I have not gotten my 7 but sure it will be great.  Shipping was fast and hassle free. Nice red color, not orangey.  Can be used with or without belt clip/holster.
 As you can see from the pictures the quality of the material used to produce this case is extremely low grade. The first break occurred on day TWO of owning the case. The holster was attached to my belt and I simply applied normal pressure to detach it and the clip itself split right in half.<br/><br/>I contacted their customer service and Zizo sent out a replacement holster right away. They were very friendly.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, the replacement is now broken rendering it completely useless as it’s the upper thumb release of the holster that locks your phone within the holster. Of course now I’m outside the 30day mark of Amazon so a refund is not possible.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this case/holster whatsoever. I’ve chalked this up as a loss and have recently purchased an Otter.
 Had to modify the case by using a razor blade to shave material off of the inside of the button used to power off the phone (right side upper when facing screen) due to it trying to power off as soon as the case was in place and no longer working until I would remove the case.  Unlike an otterbox case this one only fits in the belt clip one way, and it just seems backwards when its on my right hip.  The color is nice (and the reason I bought it), but trying to get the stand to pop out of the back of the case practically takes a tool to pry it open, it is very tightly held in place.  I needed something asap and this was available, with my prime and an extra three bucks for faster shipping I ordered it after midnight on a Monday morning and received it Tuesday afternoon, about twenty five bucks all together.  I wont purchase another and am now looking for a different one. I figure if I have to spend a bunch of money I just as well get a battery case for it.<br/>It does protect the phone, it does work after modifying it, it is the color I wanted so I gave it 1 star for being functional and 1 for the color.  -1 for having to modify it, -1 for the belt clip only working 1 way and being rather flimsy, -1 for fit and finish, sharp edges on the molded seams of the case and the black rubber looking portions are more plastic feeling and slick, had it been slightly softer I don't think I would have had the button issue and It would absorb impact better.

The off on button doesn't work, I had to take a X-Acto knife and trim it out in order  to be able to use the button. And while applying screen protector the  top of the screen projector cracked in two different places,  was trying to place protector in perfect position and it cracked ,  with little to no pressure applied.  Not very good if it's supposed to protect your screen.  Check out my video about off on button
 Case would not work on my new iPhone 7+. I tried countless times to put it on correctly. Every time I got the case installed, it would hold down the power button on my iPhone and cause it to constantly ask to shutdown. If I pressed the Home button, it would take a screenshot, because of the power button being held down. I kept removing and reinstalling and no matter what I did, it would not seat correctly.<br/>The power button on the case would not even allow me to press it. It seemed like it was stuck. The volume buttons worked very well.<br/>I started to give this 1 or 2 stars, but the case itself is very well made. The tempered glass sticker is great too! Not sure if I received a defective case or not. I am shipping back. I really wanted this to work. maybe it will work for someone else.
 I like the case very much, especially for the reasonable price. It includes a glass screen protector and a robust holster.<br/><br/>It does have a few sharp/rough edges. There is a small amount of flashing on the sides of the case (see photos) and a sharp edge on the bottom corner of the lanyard loop. I'm guessing the lanyard loop is intended to give the appearance of military ruggedness, but I feel that it is unnecessary. These sharp edges left my fingertips feeling a little sensitive after a few minutes of use. I'm sure these edges will wear down with use, or my fingertips will toughen.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to learn that the inner plastic does not extend completely through the ridges on the back, leaving thin open grooves that are certain to collect debris.<br/><br/>It is definitely not as chunky as the Otterbox Defender, however it does not provide a deep bezel to protect the screen like the Defender. Hopefully it is adequate. There is no soft silicone anywhere on this case, so it won't stretch out of shape like the outer shell of the Defender. The color outer shell has a somewhat soft textured surface, as does the entire holster. The texture is effective for gripping the phone with your hands, however it's not grippy enough to keep it from sliding off a smooth slanted surface.<br/><br/>I know this is a lot of criticism, however I really like the case. It's a very nice looking case and is available in many appealing colors. Hopefully Rocky (one of the brothers who owns Zizo) will take note of my critique and initiate improvements.
 I purchased two of these for two new iphone7 plus.  The red one went on and the phone works fine with it.  The Rose Gold one turned my phone off when i first put it on.  Now every time I touch the volume side the phine asks if I want to turn it off.  And I casnnot use the home button either.  If I take the case off, the phone works fine.  I like the look of the case but i have to be able to use the phone.
 heavy duty case that works for me! minus one star because the belt clip broke off before i even tried to use it...which i wouldn't use anyway...so no big deal for me...i really like the way this case protects my phone...tight fit...
 This is the 2nd Zizo Bolt case I've owned. The first was on my 6s Plus and now this one for my 7 Plus.<br/><br/>The case itself is outstanding, particularly given the price. I've owned plenty of Otterbox and Pelican (also MIL-STD rated) to know that for the price, I'm convinced you can't find better all around protection.<br/><br/>As others have reported, this case, specifically the hardened rubber insert portion, is not created uniquely for the iPhone 7 and appears to just be another 6/6s Plus case. I've compared this to my 6s Plus case and they're completely identical. While that may be an inhibitor for some, I don't really mind as all 8 mini-speaker ports on what would be headphone port for the iPhone 7 are still completely showing. On that note, don't let this minor cosmetic difference be a deterrent.<br/><br/>However, there is one issue with the case...one that MAY require slight modification. The case's power nodule (what you press to turn the phone on/off) appears to have a bulge on the inside of the case which rests too close to the power button. This effectively keeps the power button on the phone depressed. Therefore, turning off the phone cannot be performed.<br/><br/>A slight filing or in my case Dremel action, on the inside of the nodule provided enough clearance for the power button to release entirely. Problem solved in about 3 minutes. This is an easy fix but I would implore the manufacturer to resolve the issue in production.<br/><br/>***EDIT***<br/>Turns out I was comparing against another 7 plus case. There is substantial difference between this case and the 6s Plus case, namely with the headphone port as well as the camera lens port. Still a tight fit as stated, and mentioned by others, but the minor modifications have fixed that issue.
 My #1 priority in choosing a case is a kickstand so that I and my children may watch videos on it. I am extremely disappointed with the kickstand on this Zizo case. As soon as I lifted open the kickstand I knew instantly that this kickstand will not last. The plastic is very thin and the hinges are made from very small and delicate appearing plastic. When I attempted to close the kickstand I heard and felt a click. The plastic broke! This is going back to Amazon!<br/><br/>Pro's<br/>1] Beautiful and unique design<br/>2] Power and volume buttons are "clicky" and easy to use<br/><br/>Con's:<br/>1] Cheap and flimsy kickstand that broke in my first every use!<br/>2] The case is surprisingly slippery. Image appears "grippy" but oh no. Very slippery plastic. Even the corners/edges are slippery. I see myself dropping this constantly.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice attempt at making a unique appearing case. Zizo, my recommendation is to make the kickstand significantly stronger and robust. Something able to tolerate thousands and thousands of opening and closing. And use materials that provide a little more grip in the hands.
 I ordered this case because of the high reviews on Amazon. I am not very excited about the case after having it for five minutes. After inspection I noticed that the kickstand on the case was missing the other metal pin that held the kickstand in place on the case. I have not even put the case on my phone and already it is missing parts. Not a good sign. Now I have to return the case and look for another one. I just got this phone and I want to protect it with the best. Now I have to spend another 2-3 days with my phone unprotected. Keep your fingers crossed for me.
 case looks nice and fits very snug. but too tight on the power button. I have the iPhone 7 plus and I can't turn/keep the phone on because the case keeps pushing the power button thus not allowing it to turn on. Also when the phone is on and i install the case when I turn off it won't allow me to slide to turn off because the power button is being pressed constantly.
 This is an amazing case.<br/>Its rugged and protects the phone from all sides.<br/>You will need something to cover the glass front, however.<br/>The kickstand is a nice added bonus.
 First of all, I do really love this case. However, there are a few things that I would change immediately. One thing is the lanyard loop on the case. This should be centered and not on the side corner. For one, the only reason I would use this as if I ever wanted a body cam. Centering it with bring the camera to center and level. This also, prevents the phone from sitting completely level when using the kickstand. Not an annoyance totally because you can barely tell. Also, due to the lanyard loop on the corner, you can only carry this in its holster in a left-handed fashion, meaning that if you carried on your right side it has to go in an orientation that you would not normally pick up your phone. The phone will be picked up as upside down and you have to flip it around. Also, there are no holster locks on the other side, so even if you wanted to carry this ambidextrous, It would not lock in the holster. Another thing that I would change, and this may already be changed by the manufacturer so don't quote me on it. The holster does need to be made stronger, As a couple of the reviews on YouTube have said that they break easily. Other than that, great case!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just had a brainstorm on the lanyard loop so I hope the manufacturer is reading this. The lanyard loop should be made like we see on many cameras, and 3DS's, and other electronics where there is a flush bar that you can loop a nylon piece of string like we see on camera wrist straps. That way this loop could be placed anywhere on the case to allow for horizontal and vertical carry, And since it would be flush it wouldn't affect how it was carried in the holster. #Zizo
 From a far this case looks cool but as you get close the quality just isn’t there. Maybe I am a little spoiled from my UAG cases of the past and I am being picky but for me I exspected better.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Looks cool from a distance. I love the orange<br/>- Super tight fit(almost to tight. Felt like I may break my phone trying to get it back out of the case.<br/>- Camera and Apple symbol aligned well.<br/>- Protective<br/>- Comes with a belt clip and screen protector<br/>- Reasonable price<br/>- Good grip but will still slide in and out of a pocket.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Fake screws feel loose and noisy.<br/>- Kick stand clicks if you tap it.<br/>- Kick stand is pretty cheap. Will beak easily in my opinion<br/>- Screen protector is Not a 3D edge to edge.<br/>Case was designed for the 6 thru the 8. (Big openings that collect debris)<br/>- Bad quality on fit and Finnish. I was really let down here. The manufactured joining of materials leaves much to be desired. And half of the plastic shell on this particular case appears to be dirty straight out of the box. I tried to clean it to no avail. I believe that half of the color plastic was not mixed well in the manufacturing process leaving the orange color looking discolored in certain areas. This bothers me enough that I won’t be using this case.<br/><br/>All in all if you are ok with the substandard quality and want decent price protective case than this is probably for you. I personally couldn’t get over the issues this particular case. Maybe others are better but I would guess that they aren’t.
 I LOVE the color and grip. It does not slip out of my hand at all like the otterbox I used to have. My only complaint is the power button cover. No matter what I did, I could not get it to work. The rubber covering the power/sleep button on the right of the iPhone 7 plus does not allow you to engage the button. I ended up cutting the rubber part out and once I realized I couldn't reach the button, I stuck the rubber back in. My modification fixed the issue, but because of this I will not recommend this case to anyone nor will I buy these cases in the future. Just a heads up to you all looking to buy this.
 I purchased and received this case before I actually received my iPhone 7 Plus. The day I received my phone, I held my breath and applied the screen protector. It fit perfectly! I then snapped my new phone right into the case. It also fit perfectly!<br/><br/>Back when the iPhone 6 came out, I did something similar. The results were not as favorable and my new case didn't fit nearly as well. Zizo nailed the fit of the new iPhone 7! I honestly can't think of anything to improve with this case.<br/><br/>Probably my favorite feature of the Zizo iPhone 7 Plus case is the color. Seriously, every one to two years, I buy a new iPhone. And every single time, I put the phone in a case, never to see the color again. The rose gold color of this case, matches the rose gold of my iPhone perfectly. Super happy about that! It is a perfect match. In over two weeks of usage, the color isn't flaking or wearing. It still looks amazing!<br/><br/>The case has a good grip, so it is easy to hang onto. I haven't dropped it in over two weeks of usage. (Knock on wood.) The case is made well and it sure seems like it is going to last for a very long time! The case seems to me made of a sense rubber type of material. It feels durable and strong.<br/><br/>I really love the fact that the case has a place to hook a lanyard to it. The lanyard that was included probably won't survive me, because I am really tough on lanyards. However, I am so grateful that this loop exists and I can explore other ways to hook something to my phone to keep track of it. Brilliance, I tell you! Brilliance! :)<br/><br/>If you have an iPhone 7 Plus and are wondering what case to buy - THIS IS IT!!! It is a perfect fit that will protect your phone!
 The case is sturdy and the tempered glass looks good and easy enough to put on. I really liked it until 1.5 weeks later when the belt clip got caught on the side of the sofa and immediately snapped into two. I used the belt clip everyday since I don't want to bend my phone by putting it in my pocket. I can't believe how easily the belt clip broke!! This would've been a 4 star (the case is a bit heavy and bulky with the stuck out corner for the clip on neck strap) if not for the cheap belt clip. If you don't want the belt clip, you may want to get this but then you can probably get a slimmer, less expensive case that doesn't come with the belt clip.<br/><br/>Attaching pictures of the broken belt clip
 Cool looking Case.  Not as refined as some of the more expensive brands out there but for the price its pretty hard to beat.  The slipcover is removable though not without some effort.  Its easier just to leave it attached to the outer shell when putting it on your phone.  The slipcover is more of a hard rubber not silicone.  This doesn't hinder the use of any of the buttons but I wonder how well it will work to absorb shocks.  I guess time will tell.  On the plus side the dust doesn't stick to it like it does with silicone. I knocked a star off because the outer shell is a little rough.  It doesn't seem like they took the time to sand off a lot of the burrs.  As a result the slip cover didn't fit just right and the kickstand was almost impossible to open, I lifted my fingernail off the skin trying.  But after a little whittling with a pocket everything is right as rain.  I just wish this attention to detail could have been done at the factory.  But again....for the price, its not a terrible problem.....if you're willing to do a little DIY.
 Just a heads up - this company charges shipping and restocking fee if you want to return it so it's yours if you get it - returning it is pointless (Amazon recommended a white version and it turned out to be a regular size instead of plus and they made it a pain to return it so I just gifted it to my niece instead - I'm not paying them to take it back - who does that these days?)<br/><br/>Also, the stand wont pop out unless you use something other than your fingers which is a pain.  Prying it open is difficult and your fingernails simply will not do it.<br/><br/>I liked the case despite the fit - they say it'll fit an 8 plus but it was awkward.  I didn't have the power button issue some had.  I liked it anyway and thought it was pretty.  Until one day after staying white for a month despite my makeup foundation being constant contact, which was cool cause I like white cases, it decided to suddenly turn the color of my makeup.  Color me shocked.  It was doing so well.  Yet in one afternoon it was beige as if I had foundation all over my fingers and rubbed them all over the phone - I didn't - I didn't even have makeup on that day - weird.  So I take it home and used EVERYTHING to clean it.  I even put it in a bowl of straight bleach - nothing turned it back.<br/><br/>Still the price wasn't terrible and it was pretty while it lasted.
 Bought this case for my new iPhone 7 Plus, and glad I did. This is one solid case to grip in your hand, doesn't slip and if you want to watch YouTube, or other videos, the back has a stand which folds out. Also I use it without the belt clip, your option. Plenty of room in the cutouts for your charging cable and fits the phone snug as can be. I like to use a case on my belt to carry my iPhone in so because of the size of the iPhone 7 Plus with this case attached, I use a camera case and phone fits fine without struggling to get it out or in.<br/>Also Zizo Bolt phone case comes with carrying strap that hooks on top left corner. I couldn't use it because of the carry case I wear on my belt, so I cut the attachment point off the case with a razor knife. It cut clean off and doesn't effect the looks or performance of the case.
 I love the features and design, but this does NOT properly fit the iPhone 7 Plus.  As a result of this incorrect fit, the power button routinely ends up being held down or pressed by the case.  You'll take more unintended screenshots than ever with this thing, not to mention find yourself trying to find new ways to hold your phone so as not to put any pressure on the entire right side.  The slightest bump causes the case to press against the power button....So just about anything you're trying to do will be interrupted or paused, if not shut down altogether.<br/><br/>They should really fix the minor fit inconsistencies that cause major issues, as I'd be happy to buy one with a proper fit for the iPhone 7 Plus.
 Cheap garbage. The screen protector included is not the right size for a 7 Plus and the case itself is thin plastic of the same quality you could get for a $5 gas station phone case.<br/><br/>The case is not dual layer unles you want to use the clunky-as-hell "belt holster, like having to apply significant force to remove your phone (which only goes in face-first) and want to wear your phone on your belt because you're 80 years old and think it's 1998.<br/><br/>Garbage all around.<br/><br/>{edit}<br/>While waiting for my Otterbox case to arrive, i dropped my phone while it was in this. It was less than 2 feet, but the glass completely shattered.<br/><br/>***THIS WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR PHONE***
 I had one of these for my iPhone 5S and I loved it.  Now with an iPhone 7 Plus, I hate it.  The larger case is cheaply made, the snap on cover does not fit tightly and it's cheap looking and feeling.  We ordered two of these, one pink and one blue and on neither, the kickstands are working, we can't pry the kickstands open with anything, I broke nails and almost even a key trying to get them open.  We've had them for an hour and are so disappointed we are returning them.  I would not recommend these for iPhone 7 plus at all, but I would for a 5S
 Good value I just received my new phone today and it fits great.  Lets see how long it lasts now.  I am hard on them that's for sure.
 I see all of the reviews here are years old.  I have to return this purchase as the buttons for volume and power are so stiff that they do not activate the buttons on the phone.  I pushed so hard on the volume buttons that the phone must have shifted so far inside the case that it activated the power button on the other side of the case.  I have an iPhone 8 Plus, and the phone fits snuggly into the case. Even though this case is marketed as for both 8 Plus and 7 Plus, the package marking indicates only 7 Plus... not sure if that matters at all.  I am also surprised that the opening on the back of the case doesn't line up to center the Apple logo.  This company may have manufactured a quality product years ago, but some serious quality control and product testing needs to happen before they ship cases that don't work.  Maybe the business model is to make money on shipping charges... I don't know, but this case is useless and will have to be returned.  I should have shelled out the money for an Otter Box rather than try to save some bucks and wind up with something that doesn't work.
 This is my second Zizo Boot case for my iPhone 8 Plus. The first one fell apart after a year and a half. The plastic became soft and broke apart easily. But that’s ok, 18 months of use is good. But the second one, the one I’m writing the review for now has some issues out of the box. The main one is the holster is not the one for this case. The clip with the two tabs does not line up with the two indentations on the side. Also, the holster isn’t wide enough for the case. I’m thinking this holster is for an Android phone of some kind, but I’m not sure. I need a case right now so I guess I’m using this one without the holster.<br/><br/>Also, the hard clamshell outer casing doesn’t want to go up over the buttons and bent out when I installed it. The last one didn’t do that. The plastic composition must have been changed, maybe so it doesn’t become brittle like my last one did.<br/><br/>Anyways, two of these have still cost much less than a comparable Otterbox and and it protects just as well.
 I've had 3 previous Tactical/Rugged cases in the past. I really liked the looks and feel of each of them. However, they were slightly on the heavy and bulky side. That didn't bother me. It was just something I noticed, and chaulked up to quality durability. Each was replaced due to a cracked screen protector, when it protected exactly when they were supposed to. But, being part of the case, it required a complete case replacement.<br/>I've only had this case for about a week on my iPhone 7. If any of you have held a naked iPhone, you know how slick and easy it is to have a quick loss of grip. This case has the right amount of grip for me, and the contours are excellent for my medium-sized hands (Medium Mechanix work gloves). The buttons appear to have no hinderence to performance. They're not bulky, and fit snugly to the actual buttons. No need to push hard, or for an increased distance.<br/>My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, so much as an observation, is the seperate screen protector. You do have to take care to get it aligned properly. And, the edges do not fully extend to the viewable edge of the screen. And, with the edge curves of the iPhone 7, there is a slight lift of the protector nearly the entire perimeter. The edge below the Home button is about 90% adhered. This is not at all an issue in my opinion. Other than dust/fine debris can get trapped at those edges. Now, as for the touch sensitivity of the protector, I notice Zero difference than when it was not applied. Also, the image quality is not at all affected. At least not where I can notice.<br/>Packaging: Excellent.<br/>Shipping: With Prime, 2 days as promised.<br/>Price: Nuff Said.<br/>Look: The title says it.
 I ordered a black case for my husband's iPhone 7 plus. It fit PERFECT! The buttons were all accessible, it came with a screen protector, it was great! So when my iPhone (finally) came in the mail, I ordered myself a black one too. It didn't come with a screen protector like his did (even though the box said it would) and I found that it was extremely hard to press the power button, and would sometimes randomly turn off the screen on my phone by itself. I decided to send it back, and order a new case. Amazon Prime is amazing, by the way, as I had the new case within 48 hours. This time, I went with grey on a whim. The two parts of this case did not fit together in the slightest. It applied constant pressure to the power button on my iPhone despite various attempts to reapply the case. The inner case is slightly bendable, but the outer plastic was deformed and did not sit in the grooves on the interior piece. Returned for a refund and reordered another case for the second time, again in black. This review would have been 5 stars if not for the multiple times I've had to return the cases! The only reason I keep reordering them is because I like the case itself so much and my husband has no problems with his...<br/><br/>EDIT: I just got the newest case. There was a bit of plastic sticking out on the back of the case, I just picked it off. It's still pretty hard to press the power button (my husband's is not like this) but the case finally works and I like it a lot.
 Do not buy, does not fit iPhone 7 plus. Received item, put the case on and case was pressing against the sleep button holding it in and the phone was trying to power itself off. Tried refitting the case several times with no luck. Also the "rubber" buttons on the side of the case have zero feedback and are very hard to press and cheaply designed. Complete opposite of say a speck case where they took extra care to give the buttons on their cases a click feel that lets you know each time you press them. The best part about my experience with Zizo was going to the UPS store, buying a bubble mailer to ship it back to them in, paying the return shipping label and reading in their return instructions that I would be charged a 15% restocking fee. I also paid an extra $5 for expedited shipping because it said it wouldn't arrive for 3 weeks so I have now paid more than the case is worth. I didn't want to bother with an exchange to have to go through the same thing twice as even if you do decide you want to exchange your going to have to pay to ship their faulty product back to them so you lose either way. I'm guessing Zizo doesn't have much faith in their products and needs to cover all their bases, wouldn't want to actually provide halfway decent customer service to someone for fear of losing a couple bucks but would rather lose customers for good. Skip this one. If your looking for well made affordable cases go with unicorn beetle instead.
 After breaking and replacing the screen twice on my iPhone 6, third time did internal damage, got an 8. I had used a wallet with magnetic back on the phone case, really liked that, but one of the breaks came when it slid out of the wallet. Saw this cover, more ruggedized and liked the look of it. Ordered it, the look was better than the ad.<br/><br/>Just now, had been on speaker with my truck on side of truck bed. Jumped I. The truck and drove off. Reached for my phone and instantly had a bit of an attack, knowing I’d left it. Stop, get out and see, laying in the curve of the road behind me is my phone. Pick it up and sure enough, cracked through the center of the screen. Look a little closer, the crack doesn’t go to the edge. Oh yeah, came with that thin glass cover. Peel it off and the screen is perfect. The cover system did what it said it would!<br/><br/>Darn it, now how do I justify buying a newer model?!?!?  Of course I’d have to reorder this case to fit.
 Good quality case. The case itself is very snug on the phone. It is actually hard to get the outer hard case on Because it’s so tight, I felt like I was going to rip the power button off of the softer case.<br/><br/>The case is easy to grip but can be a little slippery, especially when putting it in the holster. When putting the case in to the holster it has to be set in perfect to get it to clip in. I have dropped my new phone already because it wasn’t clipped in when I thought it was. If the holding corners were bigger like similar cases, this would be less of an issue. -1 Star for holster issues<br/><br/>This case does not exactly fit an iPhone 8 Plus. The Apple sign is lower than the hole in the back. See attached picture. The picture is not as it shows -1 Star.<br/><br/>My previous cases for comparison have always been OtterBox Defender series. This case is definitely lighter and smaller than the bulky defender.
 The case is designed to fit a 7+ not an 8+.<br/>Near the volume control buttons you can see it doesn’t conform and is separating.<br/>The 🍎 icon is not centered within the cutout on the back of the case.<br/>The tempered glass is cut to fit an iPhone, especially the speaker. The tempered glass does not cover the facing of the 8+ fully. Mine was also cracked.😕<br/>The stand is a great feature providing you have nails to grab it or have something to pop it out.<br/>The belt loop is a bonus that I will never use, but I’m sure guys would like it.<br/>See photos📸
 OK so like many of the reviews I had some issues. I ordered 2 cases, one Orange and One White. The cases are really great looking and a joy to handle. However, the power on button for the whit one had issues outlined in other reviews. The phone would go into a power on power off loop and when finally off my wife could not depress the button enough T to power on. So I sent it back. N the meantime I ordered a replacement from Amazon. CAUTION even thought I I specified 7plus our friends at Amazon popped up just a 7. I did not catch this and the 7 arrived. So I had to return it as well. BTW I never paid attention to returns befor but in case you did not know AMazon deducted to return shipping cost from my return so I only got $12 on an $18 case. I ordered it again and the third time was the charm. The case and power switch h work fine. I can not comment on durability yet but my wife is happy. I use the belt clip and have received several positive comments on how good the orange case looks. My recommendation is buy, but it migh not be painless.
 I purchased this in September before I even got my new phone. I was preemptively protecting my major phone investment. While I like the case and thus far it as kept my phone safe, there are a few flaws:<br/>-the lanyard tab sticks out way too far and is quite unsightly. I never anticipated using the lanyard and still don't intend to. It's a useless feature that is in the way for me<br/>-the kickstand only works with the phone horizontally. Not the worst thing in the world but how much harder would it have been to make it work either way? It is also impossible get open without some sort of flat tool or paper clip around. I thought over time it would loosen up-- month 5 and it's still a pain<br/>-finally, the grey part is starting to separate from the black part of the case. It has become quite loose and now it's a something I continuously play with because it's loose.<br/>Overall I wouldn't buy it again, but for the price it has held up. I got this before the iPhone 7plus was released so no one really had cases available.
 Buyer Beware... the box clearly states that this Zizo Case is for the iphone 7 Plus/6s Plus/6 Plus. The iphone 8 is not even mentioned.  This is an old case that is obviously not updated for the slight differences of the iphone 8.  For those of you who have 8 Plus phones... the cases for the iphone 7 plus, 6s plus, 6 plus do not actually fit exactly properly for the iphone 8. Read the reviews for iphone 8 cases. The title of this listing is completely misleading for iphone 8 owners.
 I’ve been using Otterbox for a decade and decided to switch it up. On first glance I was worried because the plastic screen didn’t cover the entire screen and it was just a sticker. I had this for two weeks when I noticed a crack in the screen but hadn’t dropped it, in fact it spent most of its time in my bag and on a charger. Then the kickstand... first off it had to be opened with a coin or key and the center piece inside constantly slipped out of place then broke by the third use. Even the lanyard broke. I mean common. Overall a bad buy and I wouldn’t expect this to pass a “12ft drop” as they claim. Back to otterbox.
 I liked the color. The case has the cutouts at the bottom for a different phone although the holes align okay. I question the durability of the case because of cracks already formed within one hour of taking case on and off two or three times. Also, not mentioned much by others - the case does not really have a lip to it - so that if you drop this while covering the phone, the screen will probably shatter.<br/><br/>Update: The material is exceptionally fragile and narrow parts have cracked and broken off after a couple of months. The case was taken off 3 times so buyer beware.
 We purchased one of these for each devise we have based off other reviews. They are very durable, fitted to exact specs of each device and also look highly presentable. The tempered glass screen protectors went on with ease. They do not make your device big and bulky. Highly recommend to anyone in the market for a great case at a great price!
 Description says it fits iphone 7plus and iphone 8 plus. When i received it, the side if the box said “for iphone 7 plus”. Put it on my iphone 8 plus that i just baught and although the phones are identical in size, it does not actually fit the iphone 8 plus. Please start selling as advertized. Nobody wants chinese crap.
 The rear case stand support broke the second time I moved it. The case had several spots along the edge where the plastic was overfilled in the mold and I had to trim it back to keep it from feeling so rough. The front sides of the case, are nearly flush with the glass screen protector making it dangerous to lay it face down if it does not have the outer clip-on case attached. The color is great and the fit is perfect but I was disappointed to have the kickstand break so quickly... The plastic that holds the kick stand up was the weak component and it just broke too easily. The outer case is really nice and has second kickstand potential (the case clip doubles as a stand) so it helps to make up for it. It is also nice that it came with a glass screen protector so for the price it's hard to beat.
 I've been getting "military strength" cases for my phone ever since my younger son (aka: monster) was born 9 years ago.<br/>This case is the lightest -- and still feels very strong and protective! I am used to my phone being the biggest thing around (had the 6 + before this, and I've been using the super strong super big cases even before I had a +) - and this case feels a little less big (if that makes sense).<br/>The color - so it matches the phone and somehow seems a little less as though I have a case on.<br/>The style - I have never chosen a case for beauty before, always for structure and durability, but this case is durable and nice looking! It looks more fancy than durable, but I know it's both.<br/>I haven't yet (had for about 1 week) used the clip - so I can't really comment on it's functionality (will in the future come back and edit) - but I have never had a holster with a clip that worked very well for these big phones and big cases.<br/>I love how the case does extend a bit above the screen so, if it were to fall (or *when* it falls) there is that extra protection, especially since this case does NOT have an integrated screen cover/shield/protection -- but it does come with a nice screen protector that you put on your phone separate from the case. This is fine for me now; it's not as dust/sand/moisture resistant as an integrated one - but it was clearly stated as such and I knew I was making this choice. This would NOT have worked for me when my monster was younger (he drops, throws, spills, etc - and, no, I didn't give it to him to play with, he grabbed and threw...), but all I really need now if drop protection and this is superb. I'm loving the case.<br/>Delivery was not fast -- but was within the specified time (and I didn't request next day or 2 day).
 I’ve had this case about nine months.  I am pleased with how it has protected my phone, and pleased with the way it looks.  The hard plastic shell is in my opinion too brittle though.  The back cracked near the hinge for the kickstand after only 3-4 months and I really haven’t hardly used the kickstand and certainly have never dropped the phone with the kickstand out.  It is just a weak spot in the shell.  I super glued the pieces to the rubber liner and moved on.  Recently the shell is cracking in other places..... it cracked at the other end of the opening for the kickstand and in several places along the left side of the phone where there are several openings for buttons and such.  I have sent an email to the manufacture but have received no response in about a month so far.  So it seems like you are on your own if you have issues with their product. They are not terribly expensive and they work, they just don’t hold up we’ll wither the materials they are using for the hard plastic shell.  I would forgo the kickstand if it was more durable... I rarely use it anyway.
 Just want to make buyers aware -  although the description says “ The Zizo  Bolt Series] is labeled as iPhone 7 Plus and is also compatible with the iPhone 8 Plus,” the opening in the case does not align with the Apple logo on the 8 Plus, obscuring part of it. See the photo. Also, installing the case is very difficult. I’ll probably need to break it to remove it. Other than that, I think it will do the job of protecting the phone, and the included screen protector went on perfectly.
 I like that this case is streamlined but offers great protection.<br/>This is my second one in less than 4 months. The little kickstand is fragile and my other one broke. Also the tempered glass screen protector didn’t bond well to my phone and because of that I picked at it and it cracked. I like the case so much even though there were these problems I got a second one, this time in the correct color as well.<br/>We will see if I am smart to try again or is I should have tried another brand.
 I have 2 of these cases. One fits the Samsung Note8 and the other fits an Iphone 8 Plus.<br/>Positives: I love the case feel and how well the glass works. Great protections. Regarding the Samsung 8 plus case, the buttons are extremely hard to push with the case on but they do work. Regarding the Iphone 8 plus, the volume button is extremely hard to push but works but the on/off button will not allow you to turn the phone off with the case on it. (Amazon replaced one of the Samsung cases but even the second case cover will not work)<br/>Negatives: When you install the case on the phone the buttons do not work properly and/or at all.
 Not sure I need to say much more than my concise heading summary for this product other than to ensure that I satisfy the minimum number of words to be considered for posting as a valid review. I simply love this case .. there is nothing I would change about it. Aside from the excellent look and feel of the case, the case itself provides outstanding protection, including considerable elevation above the screen for drop protection and easily accommodates third party (I use Zagg) screen protectors - though it's bundled with one. The holster is likewise well built and designed .. and what I found to be the weakest point in these holster designs (i.e. the flexible piece of plastic that wraps around and secures the case inside the holster, which in other brands I've owned soon breaks due to the frequent flexing fatigue) so far is not an issue with this holster design .. the material seems much stronger and designed to last. One more thing ... I've read some reviews about this case not really being designed for iPhone 7+ ... let me quell any concerns about that ... the case is an exact fit for every aspect, port, etc of the iPhone 7+ ... the confusion my be associated with the addition of a modified port on the bottom of the case, which actually makes it backwards compatible with the earlier iPhone 6+ as well, specifically the headphone port.  If you are considering buying this case for your iPhone 7+ just get it .. you won't regret it.
 This case does not come far enough over the front to protect your screen.  If it covered the way it looks in the photo it would have been perfect but because it barely came to the edge there is no buffer.  There is less than a 16th of an inch around the front of the phone.  Too bad because I love everything else about the case.  quality material good design and not slippery.  I am so sad that they didn't make it come around the edge as shown in the picture.
 I love this case and belt holster. I don't have room to fit my phone in my pockets, so I've used a belt holster for years. When I got my iPhone 7 I needed a new case and holster. The Zizo also comes with a tempered glass screen protector. The case offers good corner protection, and the surface provides a solid grip. I've always had black cases before, so this time I ordered the tan color, and I like it for a change. The holster is easy to snap the phone into and to remove. So far it's undoubtedly the best holster I've had, and I've tried many over the years.<br/><br/>Update: I've now purchased two of these cases with holsters. The glass protectors and the cases are sturdy and useful, however, I purchased these primarily because of the holsters. I use a holster to carry my iPhone 7 on my belt. The holsters have lasted about 8 or 9 months. The bracket that secures the upper right corner of the phone when in the holster has broken off on both holsters. From what I've seen on Amazon the holsters are not sold separately. If you use the holster all the time and If it's OK with you to repurchase the entire combination case, glass and holster every 8 or 9 months then this combination is probably good for you, but if not, you may want to shop for a sturdier case/holster combination
 This case sucks! To begin with it is very difficult to fit the phone into it. The worst part is that the case offers very little to not protection of the front face of the phone. In the photos it is shown to have a rim around the front face which in real life it is much smaller than as it is shown in the picture.  Also when attempting to return to It, I was informed that I had to pay for shipping to send the item back on top of that I will be deducted a restocking fee and I will be deducted if the case was open. So it boils down to a purchase with no form of return for reimbursement in the practical.
 It's too late to return this case, but if I could I would.  My initial impression was that it is great, heavy duty and good protection for my new iPhone 7 plus.  However my iPhone does not work with this case on.  The on/off button will not engage, cannot use slide bar on phone to open when call comes in.  I asked the Amazon community if anyone else was having problems &amp; some said they were.  I tried what they recommended to no avail.
 Pros: The case itself is great, and has a great sturdy grip and look to it that is unique from the rest our there. I get all kinds of compliments on it at work especially since we are upgrading all of our fleet iPhone's to the new iPhone 7/7 Plus. I have the 7 Plus for this review. I love the fact the they were cautious to leave the speaker openings fully exposed so to appreciate the new awesome stereo speakers on the iPhone 7/7 Plus. Great speaker output and clarity is great using this case. The holster-clip is made pretty sturdy and also has a nice grip to it, which I was not expecting, and the rotating clip is just tight enough to be reliable for a long time down the road (Note: Please read my "Cons" comments on this clip - nothing major though). The lanyard with attached detachable clip is also a clever idea. I using is more than I thought I would when it comes to carrying a bunch of items, but do not want to put my phone in my pockets and clip it to my belt/pants. This provides a nice sense of security knowing it is with me.<br/><br/>Cons: I wish the outer color part of the case (my color was the silver, but more of a gray color) fitted more tightly around the black part of the case. there are two areas of concern, but not a show stopper. It seems the area near where the lanyard connect off to the bottom left facing you is where the color case is not quite fitting snug against the black part of the case - see pictures attached. The other area is the back color part of the case connects to the black off to the right of the phones camera lenses, and again this is right below the lanyard area. I thought it was just my case with a flaw, but I actually referred a coworker to get the same case and he even got the same color. We both noticed the same issues on his new case when he asked me to put his new glass screen protector on it. Both areas on his new case had the same issue as mine - see pictures attached.  Maybe just a post production flaw and oversight on the QC side. One more thing that actually confuses me is that the nice sturdy holster clip has the option to position the belt clip so the phone can stand on it side, but the problem here is you are only able to insert the phone into the clip with the screen facing into the clip, which I know will protect the screen, but I like to watch my movies without having to remove it from the holster clip. Again, none of these items are show stoppers and is really why I did not warrant a 5-Star rating. If the case fitted a little tighter, and the holster aloud you to insert your phone with the screen facing outwards, I would've gladly gave a 5-Star rating.
 Bought this for an iPhone 7 Plus but I'm sending it back. The rubber On/Off button cover is so stiff that it won't activate the iPhone's On/Off button unless you squeeze or press as hard as you can. I even disassembled the cover parts and tried to work it in a bit to make it less stiff. No joy. I have to fight with it which is unacceptable. The kickstand is also incredibly stiff and you have to practically break a nail to get it to extend from it's collapsed state. The cover itself seems pretty durable, grips nice and looks great. But having to fight with the buttons and kickstand is a deal breaker. No thanks.
 I was planning on buying the new 7 plus iphone and ordered this case for it.  Well, after finding out the details on the iphone buyback program, I decided to stay with my 6S plus.  The case was already on the way and I decided what the hell.  The 7 Plus case fit my 6S Plus perfectly.  My wife changes purses all the time, why can't I change my phone case when the mood hits?  I'm glad I decided to keep the new Zizo.  It has a lighter, slimmer feel than I have with my Otter Box Defender.  I definitely like the rugged appearance much more.  My only concern is the glass protection.  I don't have as much faith with it as I do with my Defender, but enough trust to stick with it.  Be VERY careful when putting the screen cover on the iphone glass.  The least little bit of dust will cause a big air bubble that you will never get rid of.  CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN, before applying the glass cover.  Also, apply the glass cover from the home button end of the glass so that the cutouts on the top match up.  One major plus over the Defender, is the kickstand!!  Luv it!!
 Leaving 3 stars for the following reasons:<br/>- Power button was impossible to use while case was on. I had to add some cotton padding inside the case, to give my phone the ability to use the power button while case is on.<br/>- Case is for an iPhone 6 Plus. The bottom area has open space for headphones to be plugged in, which clearly the iPhone 7 Plus does not offer. So far, it doesn't really negatively impact the use of the case on my phone...but I don't appreciate the case being marketed as an iPhone 7 Plus case specifically.<br/><br/>Aside from those things, it's day one and the case looks tough! The rose gold is very pretty, just as pictured.
 I got this for several reasons: 1) my iPhone 7Plus is too big that I don't usually want to keep it in my pocket; 2) I liked the case and the kickstand; 3) the screen protector is really thick. Until a few days ago, this review would have received 4 stars. I couldn't give it 5 because the loop on the corner makes me keep it in the holster in the wrong position for me. It was always upside down when I took it out. Then, a few days after receiving it, I was running for my car in the rain. As I got in my car, it snapped. My phone fell on the ground in the rain. The cotter pin holding the belt snap onto the holster broke, rendering it useless. Guess where I am carrying my phone now -- in my pocket. I had higher hopes for this product. I still like the kickstand and the screen protector. I do not like the quality of the holster.
 After reading some of the negative reviews I was concerned. A lot aimed at the lock/power button causing issues. Decided to take a shot on the case. Have to say I’m shocked by how well it fits. There is no issue with the power/lock button at all. Works flawlessly. Will recommend this brand of case to others for sure!<br/><br/>After having it few weeks, I discovered a flaw. The kickstand is cheap and breaks off easily. I used it once or twice and by third time it snapped off and flew into pieces. Needless to say I put in for a refund. Sad, it’s a nice rugged feeling case without all the bulky feeling of other cases. I mean it’s thin but protects.
 This is my second case.  And that's a good thing.  I completely wore my last one out.  I'm rough on cases.  I've dropped it a thousand times.  It's gone flying out of my pocket a few times when I mountain bike.  I replaced it due to the kickstand breaking, but I can't fault the case since I use the kick stand a lot.<br/><br/>Pros: very durable, you can take the "clip" and reverse it so the face of the phone is covered, I purposely broke off the belt clip on the cover so I can use it as a cover and slide it in my pack or pocket without it being bulky.  It's slim but protective.  My previous one was orange (not available now) was rubberized and grippy.  It was nice it came with a glass screen protector.  I crack these a lot.<br/><br/>Cons:  I ordered the red one since the orange wasn't available anymore, but it's more of a metallic red.  It's cool.  I just want it easily visible, but I hoped for an actual red.  the new red one isn't rubberized and kinda slick.  the rubber inner black part that actually holds the phone was broken at a thin spot (see pic).  I just used my old one, which worked well.  I didn't try to get it replaced, but I would have been in a jam if I didn't have the previous one.<br/><br/>I will definitely purchase again and would recommend it.  For &lt; $20 it's a deal.
 Case itself is mostly ok. but the clip broke within a couple of months.<br/><br/>Case is sturdy enough. does well for most situations where the protection is needed. drops, scrapes, bangs, but the clip broke in half after a few times going in/out of the car. snagging on the seat. You would think it broke while the clip was empty but no. it had the phone in it when it broke.<br/>the other thing i dont like about this is that you can only clip the phone one way. you cant flip the phone nor use the clip as a stand. but the case did come with a stand anyway.<br/>I wouldnt buy this again. and if the case is the same material as the clip. i'm afraid it wont be strong enough to protect the phone in the long run.
 i researched cases, thinking that otterbox was king, i didn't like the higher price and that little tab that wears out at the charging port. i saw a youtube video of a test from an electronics show and this one won. i particularly like the styling and the color. it feels good and no slippage but a nice textured and grooved case. i don't need or care for the clip thing and the glass protector was ok, it didn't stick smoothly all the way around, but that's negligible considering you have to replace them from time to time. so i got something that works and it was really inexpensive for the quality.
 The case itself is nice, however I'm not sure if the one I got is defective or if it's not very well designed for the 8 plus. When I put the case on my phone it fit nice and snug, however the case was screwing with my buttons. I was unable to change the volume at all and the power button was being pushed just enough where hitting the home button would cause a screenshot to happen or it would bring up the Power Off slider. Then when I tried to hit the power button, it was like trying to push a rock. The button did not move at all. I tried several different ways of putting the case on thinking I was doing it wrong but to no avail. The tempered glass protector that comes with this is nice and so does the little strap so you can hook it to a bag or lanyard, that's really the only good spot of this whole case.<br/><br/>It's a shame, this case is really cool and I was looking forward to using it.
 Took the case out of the package and was looking over the case and decided to pull out the kickstand on the back and it disintegrated in my hand. The entire thing broke off in my hand. Also, the side of the case was loose where the sleep/wake button is for the phone. I did not even get a days use out of this piece of garbage! Buy something else this thing is cheap junk!
 Good customer service. The case and protective screen came when and as I had expected. Sadly however, within the first week of wearing the holster case it broke into two. I was simply getting out of my car and it snagged the seat belt as i was stepping out. I will post pictures below for a good visual. I had assumed wrong regarding its strength, due to the "military drop grade" performance test and many good reviews. The drop test must have been in relation to the case for the phone and not the holster it clips into. I would buy something a lot more sturdy and durable than this product if you are looking for a holster that lasts and can be on you as you work.
 I am not being compensated for this review, just an opportunity to help others. I first saw this case on Facebook for around $40.00 and was impressed by the look and description. I then decided to see if I could find it on Amazon and, obviously, I did and at a much cheaper price.<br/>Like most Apple fans, I've had all the cases. For the price and features, this one is hard to beat.<br/>The case feels and fits extremely solid. All buttons and ports are totally accessible and navigated easily. I love the belt clip and appreciate the fact that the company includes a tempered glass screen protector.<br/>I am totally pleased that the description and function of the case actually match the hype in reviews I read prior to purchasing. I will be looking for products from this company in the future.
 This is sold by Zizo so I contacted the seller because the screen protector is chipping. The product description states it has 1 year warranty. I contacted the seller Zizo and they say that amazon only covers 30 days and that I should contact the manufacturer. Below is  their response, signed by Zizo Customer Support - so no clarity of who the manufacturer is... if its a Zizo brand case, sold by Zizo, and I'm contacting Zizo, and Zizo is responding, who da heck are they telling me to contact?:<br/><br/>"Hello,<br/><br/>Amazon only covers 30 days warranty. After that customer needs to contact manufactures for any type of issue. We really apologize for inconvenience caused to you.<br/>Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns. We'd love to help.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew<br/>Zizo® Customer Support
 I bought this case for my new iPhone 7+.  Unlike some of the previous reviewers, this fits my new phone perfectly.  It offers good protection and is not slippery in my hand.  I also like the slight, I suppose you could call it an eyelet, on the upper left corner.  I threaded a small carabinieri and some para-cord through this and slipped it through my belt loop so that I never lose the phone.  I would recommend this product and the company.
 I hate having to write a bad review especially on a product that previously did as it promised.  I bought this product for my new Iphone 8 plus because I previously owned it when I had a 6s.  Sadly, it has not lived up to its predecessor.  The new one seems to be an afterthought.  The porthole in the back does not line up with the apple logo and the stand for hands free viewing came right off the first time i used it.  I am disappointed because I was so happy with the previous version and the fact that proceeds of this product goes to help veterans.  I would gladly stick with a vendor, foregoing all the fancy marketing but I may have to begin the search for a new brand.  Truly sad about this.
 The case itself is really nice. I'd give the case alone a 5 star review because it's everything I wanted. As for the screen protector and belt clip... that's another story. I really wanted a case with a belt clip and my first time using it I broke it with little force. I'm a pretty gentle guy. The screen protector is really glossy and get's greasy almost right away. Because of this case's accessories and price I had to give it a 3. If you just want it for the case then consider this a 5 star.
 I purchased this in May 2018 and was not used to using a phone case that would only fit in one direction. I enjoyed the ability to hang the phone around my neck with the neck strap if I needed to( maybe no place to hook phone clip). And there was a prop on the phone case and the phone clip which was very useful. Now my dilemma is that the phone clip has broken and there is no warranty for it. I contacted the company and it’s a no-go. Soooo, maybe I should have gone with the otter box, but I didn’t want the bulk. So I had to purchase another phone case.
 So first off, the value of this case is great, you get the case WITH a belt clip/holster and aa screen protector for under $20 you can't g wrong there.  The case itself seemed solid when I first put it on my iPhone 7, it slipped on just fine, fits well and allows room for headphones and charging cord, as well as the buttons for volume and power are as you use and work great.<br/><br/>The cons in my opinion:<br/>I noticed that my magnetic holder disk doesn't stay on like it should because of the texture of the case itself (it is not smooth for the 3m tape to adhere well) and I noticed that that same textured part of the case started to pull away from the rest of the case.  I didn't realize that it is NOT a single piece b the textured area is a secondary piece attached to the smooth part.<br/><br/>This was probably my fault for not thinking about the magnetic mount needing a smooth area but I am disappointed with the layers wanting to separate.
 Zizo had everything I wanted in a cell phone case/protector. I had just spent nearly a grand on my new cell phone and I wanted something that was military grade tough with tempered glass. Add to that the adjustable clip for belt use and the "kickstand" which is a MUST have for me so I can watch videos! All this and then I find a surprise lanyard in the box too! I am a 48 year old who wanted a rugged durable good looking phone case that would look sharp, not to bulky, and came in a variety of colors and that is just what I got! I love the rose/pink color! The price is unbeatable for what you get! I do my research and read reviews before I buy anything. I go to Amazon first to shop because I trust the vendors Amazon does business with and then I found Zizo. The look caught my eye right away! I loved it and after reading the reviews, Zizo was my #1 choice. I have been telling all my friends, you can't go wrong with this great product! Thanks Zizo!
 This case is legit! Whenever I see "military grade" tossed around im skeptical.  As a veteran I can tell you military stuff breaks all the time and there's no such thing as a military issue cell phone case!<br/><br/>That being said the "tactical" market that's so hot today makes very high quality stuff that typically comes with a big price tag.  This phone case delivers that high end quality, at a fraction of what an Otterbox Defender would cost, and is much better looking (in my opinion).<br/><br/>So the case comes as two parts, rubberized soft wrap directly around the phone, then a harder plastic shell that cinches around that.  The belt clip attaches to the harder plastic outer.  I don't use a belt clip, so i ditched that apparatus.  Also comes with "tempered glass screen protector" which i chose not to use, but was thicker than typical "screen protector" plastic.<br/><br/>The only knock I have is the kickstand.  It works, it feels high quality, I believe it will last.  But man, I gotta pry it open! This design likely will make it last a lot longer than previous kickstand cases I've had, which first start to go when the kickstand doesn't "click shut" anymore and starts slipping out.  That will likely not happen with this case until long after Apple changes the iPhone enough that you will need a new case.<br/><br/>Packaging was fantastic.  I highly, highly recommend.  For $16, this is a steal.  Look for these to go up in price as people discover this company.
 Just received the case and let me say WOW!!<br/>I was afraid it wasn't going to fit my iPhone 7 plus since I read many negative reviews after I ordered hah. But to my surprise the cover from ZIZO fit perfectly. I put the case on right away and made sure it wasn't squeezing any buttons on the side and made sure the port holes were open and clear as well as the camera on the back. Everything was perfect my volume buttons function great and so does my power button, there's no struggle at all. It is kind of tuff to put on but I feel like that only shows how secure your phone will be. The screen protector I received with the package was intact everything looked great nothing broken! Easy to use and love the color I got a red case and expected it to be a bright red but no it's a really nice burnt red color almost burgundy. All I gotta say is let's see how long the color on the case lasts. Happy with this purchase!!
 Style and impact protection. Only had 1 problem is that when I purchased it  The package said I phone 7 plus which I knew it would fit IPhone 8plus. The problem was the on/off button on inside of the case protruding inwards and applied pressure to the on/off button and wouldn’t turn on.  Solution I trim the inside button flush problem fixed.
 Its ok as far as the case goes but dont expect the stand to work well, first its angle is way to wide practically lays flat only lasted a week before the stand was bound up and then snapped off.  Another note the back of the shell is not flat so forget about using a popsocket in place of the broken stand.<br/><br/>If you dont care about the stand and just want a durable shell it is a pretty rugged case and I would recommend it for that purpose but its also bulky so carrying it in your pocket is a bit of a pain.<br/><br/>3 stars for its rugged durability.  Due to the flimsy stand that broke and didnt even work well before breaking I cant give it any more stars.
 Good Product but............. I think it was made from the leaked iPhone pro phone that apple never made the case has a headphone or mic jack plus a smart dock whole in the case that doesn't need to be their I think they made this case to early thinking all the leaked photos would be correct but apple threw a monkey wrench in on them lol now don't get me wrong it's a damn good case just has some unnecessary wholes on it I think the next batch they make they want have them on their but if it's like any other production they had to order 5 to 10 thousand to start a batch
 This is a good rugged case. I'm an actual purchaser. My daughter and I both have one. Hers is the white and gray one,mine is the rose gold one. The case is thick and adds alot to my iphone 7 plus. My only three issues are this. First the iphone 7 plus case the kickstand is cheap and doesn't go up and down well without trying to come out. My daughters doesn't seem to do this on her iphone 7 case. My second issue is on my rose gold one the color makes it shiny and a smidge slippery. But my daughters white one has a grippy texture and doesn't slip as much. Lastly I despise the clip loop on the top of the case. I will never wear a phone on a lanyard thats a silly idea to put a 750$ phone on a flimsy lanyard.<br/>With that being said the case is super strong and rugged. I have no doubt it will protect my phone.<br/>So I would recommend this case as long as those things that I mentioned don't bother you too much.
 This is the 4th of this brand of case that our family has own.  You will wear the color off before it breaks.  There are other more expensive brands.  It holds up.  I havd dropped this coming out of our bobcat and it has bounced my iPhone of the frame and the bucket with no damage.  Down side is that there is no cover snap for the charging ports on the bottoms and it is hard to hear off the top when the phone starts to wear out.  Upside is that it wears like iron and if you are hard on your phones and cases it is a great buy for a great price
 I was tired of empty promises as far as phone protection goes after 2 cracked screens and too much $$$!  This case is very sturdy just by itself and seems to be almost bullet-proof.  I know it's not but right after I put my phone in the case, I dropped it by accident on my ceramic tile kitchen floor.  Not a scratch, ding, dent, crack....nothing!<br/><br/>The case is good looking (I got Blue).  The lanyard strap is somewhat useless but I did not cut the case's attachment ring for the strap.  I figure it is added protection on that corner.  The tilt-up stand is a little flimsy but I don't use it much at all.  The case covers all the buttons and port very well and they all work fairly just like the phone without the case.  I especially like that it came with a glass screen protector.  Great value for the money!<br/>Overall, I really like this case.
 I like the product as it has been unintentionally "tested". The case is night because it is snug around the phone unlike other cases where there is a gap between the phone and the case. The other nice feature is the lanyard. This has been a benefit I was not expecting, but am quickly getting more attached to it. One point about the lanyard is I have special needs so I always have a pack on my back. With the lanyard, I have wrapped it around the strap of my pack, and that way it is available to me if I need it, not something I need to hold on to, and not something someone could potentially pull in an attempt to steal from me. The coloring is nice and bright, and the case is very light weight so you're not lugging around an Ottorbox case. I have not tried the tempered glass cover yet as I have been tied up with other things. Regardless, you can't beat the quality, price, and convenience.
 Ok so I’ve had this case for about a year. It’s been great but tonight it got put to the test. I accidentally dropped it from a height of about 12 to 13 foot straight on to concrete. It landed on a corner/edge and not a scratch or even a hiccup. The military grade description is no joke. This case is worth every penny plus.  As a matter of fact I’m going to find their cover for my iPad
 I love this case. It works perfectly for my iPhone 8 Plus. When I first got it, I thought it would be too small by the initial look of it, but it fits perfectly. I like the kickstand feature and the ability to attach a lanyard or clip to the top of the phone. It is hard to find this feature in a phone case, so I especially like that feature. Plus the case does a great job of protecting the phone if it is dropped.
 It is light, STRONG...STRONG...STRONG!!!!  I was riding my bike, had my 3 day old iPhone7+ on the handlebar clipped in and off it flies at 15mph!! It slid down the asphalt for a good 25 feet as I locked up the brakes and did a U-turn expecting to see the phone in pieces. It wasn't. I then expected the phone to be trashed as it slid face down... it wasn't. I then expected that the phone wouldn't work... well, it works perfectly!!  There was not even a scratch on the case! UNFREAKING BELIEVABLE!!  I know that I have sold at least 3 of these cases since.<br/>On top of everything else, it is well designed in that the clip fully and easily rotates, allowing you to position the case on your belt what ever way you want. I love that the clip also locks open to make the phone stand freely on it's own.  Plus, it is light, streamlined, simply a perfect case!
 After having this unit for a total of 7 days, it is broken already. Initially I really thought it was a great unit and in fact, 95% of the unit is still really good, except for the button/bolt assembly that attaches the holster clip to the holster. One of the small plastic ears that holds the clip to the holster snapped off and the fitting isn't strong enough to hold together with just the one ear. It's a shame because it seemed like a great unit. The case with kickstand, the screen protector and the main part of the holster are great. But the weak point is the round "bolt" that goes through the holster and into the ratcheting portion of the clip failed in barely a week.<br/>UPDATE After contacting the seller, they shipped me a new holster. They were very pleasant to work with. I'm being extra careful with this holster as when it's working, it's great.
 The construction for the flip out stand on the back of this phone case is poor at best. The little piece that holds in the support for the stand busted. It hasn't even been three weeks that I've had this case For my phone and now I can't use the stand. The stand was one of the selling points for me. I am extremely disappointed in this product. I do not recommend it to anyone
 I very rarely write a review unless it’s a crappy product -however it is quiet the opposite! I adore these cases. I purchased these cases 6 in total for my entire staff - we are co stably on our phones using them for work and outside with the elements in a fast paced environment. I love the teacher for the neck and wrist, the fact that it comes with the glass and a kick stand plus the clip- I got everything I needed from one company with one purchase- this amazes me that they touched on every thing ! It’s durable , designed well and with thought. Thank you for helping out me and my employees- I will be a life long customer now
 I have Purchased 2 of these since I got my I phone plus. The case proves durable except for the most important feature to me. THE BELT CLIP, on both cases the stand feature broke within 2 days. On both phones the clips broke within 3 weeks. Today the second clip broke getting out of a  vehicle(something someone in the military does frequently as a layman) when it broke my phone it fell from waist height cracking the screen and breaking my auxilliary adapter. To say the least I am pissed. Hopefully the charging port wasn't damaged as well
 I love the case. Seems sturdy and comfortable to hold. But the screen shield, well I personally believe that you need a clean room to put it on dust free. I followed the directions to the letter but I always ended up with tiny dust particals under it. After you pick up the shield to try to get them out more appear. It was very frustrating and after trying several times I still have dust particles under it and that leaves a good sized air bubble under it. I know I lifted the edges too many time because they won't seal now.
 (Thus far) this is exactly what I was looking for when I started looking for a cheap case. And by cheap, I mean inexpensive. It was under $20. There’s no reason, on Gods green Earth that a good case should set you back more than that.<br/><br/>It’s a nice and snug fit, though you’ve got to be careful on how you pop it in. The ports and holes are all clear and while the Apple logo isn’t centered, I like to think of it more as a “vent hole”, so what does it matter? As long as my phone doesn’t get hot, who cares if you can see the whole damn Apple?!<br/><br/>Provided the cases remain at the current quality and price (give or take) I don’t see a reason to purchase any other brand<br/><br/>The true test will come when my 4yr old gets ahold of it
 I got this today and immediately put it on the phone. I like the design and the feel. The fit and finish isn't so good. the corner by the power button doesn't fit so well. if you touch it anywhere around the power button it shuts the screen off. so you have to hold it and keep your hand away from that area. too bad really, I liked this case as soon as I took it out. I am returning it today.
 The Zizo case for my iPhone 7 plus fit great until I used the power button a couple of times.  The button froze the push button movement making the phone unable to completely reboot.  My phone would be in a constant loop; on, off, on, off.  I took off the cover and placed it back on a couple of times.  Still, no luck fixing the problem.  The tactile feel and ridged design are nice features  giving a more secure grip.  The lanyard is an added plus also for someone who is constantly on the go, and klutzy at times.<br/><br/>The Zizo case cover was ideal, except for the faulty power button.<br/><br/>Product update:<br/><br/>I purchased another Zizo cover since I tried to separate the layers and apparently it created a misalignment with the power button.  The directions inserted with the case did not caution about the layer separation, but it is indicated on the Amazon website.  The back cover with the buckle fits perfect.  However the first one I purchased fit the front face of the iPhone only.  This second Zizo case, the back cover fits the front and back.  I'm not sure of Zizo's quality control, but this second case fits perfectly for my iPhone 7 Plus.
 I really liked the looks of this case. I wanted orange and this was sharp, however, it didn't last very long with all the activities I am into. I have dropped my phone a few times, which is nothing new for me.. which is also why I needed a rugged case. This is my first case that was not an Otterbox, and it will be my last case of another brand. The first piece that broke was the glass on the front, which it is designed to do to protect the screen, however, it wasn't from a hard fall, but just less than 2' off the ground. Believe me, I know how to roll a phone accidentally across a parking lot! I was still able to use the screen even though it had a crack in it. The second piece that broke was the side with the loop hole for the carry strap. The loop hole did not break but the side that goes up against the phone. I have no idea how or when it happened, I just noticed it was there. My son bought the same case and his screen split as well, yet he did not drop his phone like I did. The features I liked most about it was that it was a great vibrant orange color and looked like it would hold up to my busy life, however, I broke its spirit :(  I also like the stand on the back that pulls out. I would use that to prop my phone up and watch tv on the go or watch movies and videos. This case might be ok for someone who has a delicate life and who is not clumsy... like me.
 Very thin yet very strong and durable. Would strongly recommend!! Plus it came with a good screen protector.
 I purchased this case because it looked rugged and came with a screen protector. I didn't read well enough I guess because the screen protector is a plastic screen protector, the kind you use to prevent scratches. Like the one you get when you purchase your iPhone originally. I have had this case on my phone for almost a month. My daughter wanted to see if it would work on her iPhone, she liked the looks of it and maybe wanted one. It broke while we were removing it, cracked right across the middle. Not cowgirl rugged, that's for sure. Going back to an Otterbox where I know it will take what my horses and I can dish out.
 I bought this case for my daughter iphone 7 plus.<br/><br/>She like the case too much, in terms of its build, quality and look. This is one of the best covers can protect your phone in every way, and keep its looking in the same time very attractive.<br/>I gave this case 4 stars only, because it seems that it not created specially for iphone 7+. It has a hole in the top of it, which dos not make any sense, also the left speakers hols on the bottom of the cover it seems that it was designed for iphone 6+.<br/><br/>Rather than that, its really the best case for your iphone 7+, if you want the best protection with a good price.<br/><br/>I forget to mention, that its comes with a screen protector also.
 It was worth the wait. I carried my phone with no case for a bit over a week, deciding on what case to buy. I looked at 6 different cases and saw the reviews and experiences of many. This one had a better ratio. I took a chance and waited for the color that was back ordered. Other colors were available but I waited for the one I liked. It was sooooooooo worth it. OMG! I love it. It’s like a glove for my phone. Very impressed and completely satisfied with my choice. Thank you thank you thank you. Somehow I’m always lucky. Great things happen to me.
 So far, this seems like a pretty sturdy case. I haven't dropped the phone or anything since I got it, so I haven't had one of those, "thanks goodness I had the case on" moments. Provides good access to all ports and buttons. I haven't used it yet, but I like that it came with a lanyard that can connect to the case. I generally put the phone in my pocket, but the belt clip for the case is sturdy and will come in handy when I want to free up some pocket space. The outside of the case makes it fairly easy to grab and hold onto. It's certainly not as slick as the phone itself! The "kick stand" on the back has come in handy, but it doesn't open easily, (maybe it will with more use?) - I need to slide something thin and sturdy into it to pry it open.
 Outstanding! is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of the entire experience purchasing, installing, and now using this phone case &amp; screen protector. The cover certainly lives up it's description; modern, well designed, light, durable, and the kickstand is a must have for a phone of this size (and cost). I was a little concerned when looking at it online but it actually is better than expected (how often does that happen?). The day I bought my phone the carrier sales rep put a screen protector on the table and simply said; "you're gonna need this screen protector". So I asked how much $? He said $39. I said no thank you. I found this on amazon complete with case, screen protector, lanyard, keychain and belt clip for less than $20 shipped. Great product!
 So far this case on first impressions. But one thing I hate is the loop at the top left means you can only put it in the belt clip one way.  Since I wear it on my right side and use my phone with my right hand I have to flip the phone to clip it in when done. Does not make it easy. They should design the belt clip with it dose not matter witch direction you wish to clip the phone in. Will keep it but will need to look for another one that is more versital.
 I have had many cell phones over the years and tried many accessories with them .  I've had several iPhones, androids, and windows phones.  This is hands down the best phone case I've ever had period.  It protects just as well as an otterbox but its lean enough to fit in charging docks without the belt clip. It comes with a glass cover so you don't need to purchase one separately.  Simply put this thing is robust.  The color options are super cool also.<br/>  The kickstand is an awesome feature.  I also have a Moto G5 plus and just discovered this case is available for it.  I will be ordering one soon.
 Updating this review on 7/18 to reflect the fact that the kickstand has broken off, the lanyard has broken and neither are covered under their warranty. I was going to order this case for a friend but since they have way too many exclusions for the warranty we'll look elsewhere.<br/>The case fits my phone. I was unable to use the glass cover that came with it as I could not figure out how to line it up the proper way and Zizo never responded to my inquiries. I am very happy with the case and look forward to having it for a long time. I do love the lanyard too, very handy when you have no pockets and/or you need to make that quick trip to the bathroom (that's always when it seems the phone will ring!).
 I ordered the blue;  NOTE: its a dark navy blue - Not the "electric blue" or bright blue" as depicted in the pictures - which is what i wanted.  I feelt the picture is VERY misleading. Also the lanyard that is included has a cheap plastic clip.  I don't expect it to last long at all.  It can't handle any significant weight.  Overall the case fits very good and has a nice grip to it (which is important to me for the iPhone 7 size).<br/><br/>update: had a fe mintues so i wantedto let purchasers know that the lanyard clip did break/fail in about 2 months.  Overall the case has been pretty good. and has help up well.  I have had to replace the glass screen once - Dollar Tree $1!! lol
 I got orange and love the color!!!  I had no problem installing it and my on/off button didn't stick.  I've only had it a couple of weeks, so I can't attest to durability.  My only complaint is the case offers no  protection for the front of the phone .  I thought the case would wrap around a little more.  I ruined one phone by dropping it, just nicked the corner and the phone was a goner.  I will probably get a different case simply because I tend to drop things a lot not because this is a bad case.
 Item arrived on time dispute disruption in weather. Pleased with the protection that it provides for the phone. The only issue is the location of the notches on the case that fits into the belt clip portion. It appears to be on the opposite side of what would be expected. When placed in the belt clip the phone is in a reversed position compared with all other cases that I have previously used. The case also could have more dept to ensure greater protection if the phone falls on the face.
 I got this for the IPhone 8+. I read the reviews concerning the button functionality interfering with IPhone, I did not see this issue when I installed my phone. I tested the function with the wireless charge function, don't see any issues at this point. The glass cover fit the phone perfectly, this is the first time I have used a glass cover, so I will have to wait and see if I like it or if it causes any functionality problems, so far I don't see any problems. I got this because of the protection and the belt clip, I don't like putting the phone in my pocket and I have always used the clip. Hopefully it will work and last.  I have seen some reviews where the case broke, but they don't indicate what part broke or where, so it's hard to take ambiguous reviews as valid since the reviewer may be the problem rather than the product. If I have any problems in the future, I will update this review then.
 It's a good case, the only issue i have with it is that it's too tight on my phone where the case presses on the power button while on the case. I had to cut a piece of rubber for a spacer to put between the case and the sides of the power button. It's still a good case though.
 We bought new Iphone 8's 2 days before traveling overseas for a month. We needed a quick solution to the potential horror of phone crash without  an almost equally painful dropping of $60 (plus screen protectors x2 = 120+) on otterboxs at the store.<br/><br/>We didn't love the look but the price point and reviews and our own time line sold us and it's a win.  Field testing has been solid- numerous drops on cobble stone and asphalt and NO cracking.<br/><br/>Update: Last week I left my phone on the top of the car- &amp; then drove away for 5 miles. It was still on top of the car. Win Win!<br/><br/>Yes- it's a real tight squeeze getting this thing on (recommend a small screw driver). It's not totally sleek<br/><br/>Good luck
 Love the color. Wish they had purple though!! Very nice looking. I have had this a week. I love that you have 3 choices of how to use it. With the clasp to hook on your pants, a necklace thingy that you can clip on your neck or just with the plain case. Only thing I did not like was that the plexiglass cover was way to small.  This is the 3rd one I have purchased the other 2 I have had for about 2 years.
 It is very hard to put on the phone. I felt like I was going to crack my phone or damage the on/off button trying to push the phone into the case. I took my time and finessed the case onto the phone. But I'm very afraid to try and get it off my phone if I ever have to remove it. Once on, it is a great case (look and feel) and I believe my phone is very well protected. Had a Spigen case on my IPhone 6P before getting the IPhone 7P. The Spigen case protected my phone from MANY drops and the Spigen case was thinner than this Zizo case. The Zizo case is a lot bulkier than Spigen but way less bulky than Otterbox! It also looks much better than Spigen and Otterbox!
 So bought two of these units this one and the blue colored variant. I have the iPhone 8 plus which is a model that is suppose to work with this model of case.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Overall decent  feel and weight.<br/>Easy to assemble<br/>Not Too Bulky<br/>Semi Stylish<br/>Good Color Pattern<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Unfortunately on the first day of getting this the belt clip pictured in the above picture snapped off.<br/>The tempered glass does not go edge to edge so the whole scree in not covered<br/>The apple logo is misaligned so poor design
 I bought this case in June of this year and the case broke within four months (see picture) and now the holder tab that holds the phone broke. The case was never dropped but the material is just brittle. It looks like a good design but the material is easily breakable without any abuse. I would not recommend this case.
 I bought this case for my husband back in Nov 2018. Today 1/5/2019 my husband had throw it away. He handles his phone pretty well and has never had a drop thus far and the case literally deteriorated. From day one pieces were just breaking off. Days after getting it the stand broke. From all my purchases of phones cases I must say this one has been the worse. I never had a case deteriorate within two months.  Actually never. Bad buy cheaply made.
 These cases are "meh". I have one for my iPhone 7 plus, and it's obvious a generic design. The case has cut outs for ports I don't even have, and the left speaker cutout has a wide bore for a headphone jack that doesn't exist, but has the cut length wise for the speaker. Also the buttons have no feeling. I accidentally press them all the time.<br/><br/>The belt clip is nice though. Very firm, and holds the phone very tightly.<br/><br/>Also the kick stand is half useless. It's cool that the case has one, and that the stand follows the slant of the phone, but it's impossible to pull out without a tool of some kind.
 I have had several of these in the past, they hold up fairly well to my abuse, still ruining my iPhone 6 after destroying 3 of these cases with it inside. The belt clip seems to break first, and usually within the first week, So I would say that’s the weak link in this product, but the case and screen protector have protected my phone on many occasions. My last case only lasted a week because I wasn’t able to find one of these Z’s as a replacement. These last me a good 6 months or more!
 Thanks to Zizo for having an iPhone 7 plus case ready before the phones were even ready! I bought 3 different cases online before Apple had even shipped my new phone, the Zizo and 2 other brands that I won't be naming. All 3 cases arrived ahead of my phone so I would be ready to protect it the day it arrived. They were all full protection cases with screen protection and a belt clip, I've got to have a belt clip because I'm not a 16 year old girl who keeps her phone in the back pocket, I'm a grown man and that's not what grown men do. I tried all 3 cases out, wearing them each for one day. I saved the Zizo for last because it didn't have a built into the case screen protector, it had to be applied to the glass. The new phone is water resistant now so this would not be a concern for me. I will have to say the Zizo won my competition. I think it was the best looking, best priced, and the bald tire finish on the well made belt clip made it a keeper. The glass protector went on smooth and easy with no bubbling. Will it do it's job? I don't know about that, only time will tell I guess. Any way these are my 2 cents, I like the case, it works for me.
 Bought two because the first one was broken in the box!(belt clip was broke in half!)  But both of the two I have press the side power button almost all the time!!! So frustrating- how can something look so cool but be so irritating!  It looks like the one I have now doesn't press the side power button on my phone as much:( please fix why it presses on the phone's power button!! I feel like mine now is half pressed all the time &amp; if I bump it, it turns my iPhone off:(
 Cheap construction. The back flip-stand is flimsy and will not snap shut (I had to glue it to the case). The belt holder broke in 1 week when weakly snagged on a seat. The left upper corner has a silly loophole connector that I had to remove.  I might as well have designed my own case on a 3D printer!  I have since removed this and discarded it.  Stick with Defender and OtterBox brands--much higher quality.
 I love this case. I had it on my 6Plus and wouldn't go for a different one for the 7plus. I especially like the ribs on the back which help me to grip it and operate with one hand. I've dropped both phones a couple of times and the case has protected it each time. Even the screen protector did its job. After a drop from about 8', the screen protector cracked but the phone was fine. I have gone through several of the belt clips as they keep getting snagged on something and pulling off, breaking the clip but I highly recommend the case.
 I have one for my galaxy s7. Love it. It's the only one. I thought I order one for my daughter for Xmas for her iPhone 7 plus. Haven't looked at it yet cause it's a Xmas gift but I know she'll love it. Great product and price right. Well protective case cause I have dropped my phone many times and no problems. Very good product!
 The case is great for protection. My biggest complaint is that the button that covers the power button is so stiff it doesn't work unless I push super hard and then it turn my phone off. I'm very disappointed and definitely don't think it's worth the money I spent on it. I'd attempt to return this item accept I threw the packaging away. :(
 One of the best cases I've owned. I have this for an iPhone 7 plus. It's fits great. It protects well and clips in and out easily, yet remains secure. It's durable while,being relatively thin. Compared to my old Otterbox case this is THIN. Yet it protects well,from drops and bangs. I work in an active environment and the belt clip is prone to bangs and bumps. So far it's survived them all.<br/>I love the slip stand on the back and the glass front. My previous cases had a plastic cover which got scratched and hazy. This one wipes up clean and pretty.<br/>I love it and will stick with the brand for all my devices.
 I love this case because it is so sleek and durable, with a cute little kickstand, and the tempered glass screen protector was easy to apply. I’m loving the lanyard and the sleek (not bulky) features of both the case and its belt clip. It has two kickstands, one on the case and one on the belt clip. The only issue I have is this case isn’t beveled enough, and there really isn’t a raised edge, so my fear if dropping my phone is that I’ll end up breaking it. The case is flush all around. I’ve only had it for a few hours, so I can’t give a more accurate review as far as the drop test goes or anything else.
 Dangerous. Clip can fall apart. Mine broke up into numerous pieces as I tried hooking it up to my waist band. And the supposed supplier’s guarantee is just that they’ll deliver the thing quick after you buy it. I’ll soon attach a photo of it in tatters.
 Looks nice, but...<br/><br/>• Cannot get the power button to work, possibly too tight or doesn't push in enough?<br/>• The back easel only allows you rest your phone in one direction only, which puts the volume buttons on the bottom.<br/>• The clip attachment is way too loose and the phone just falls out.<br/><br/>I would return it, but I tossed the packaging before checking it out.
 Works great. The kick stand is hard to get out. The kick stand is awful to get out and the pieces are small and broke. So now I have a case that has no kickstand and this is why I bought it in the first place. Also, a chunk of the case broke when I tried to get my IPhone out of it. I liked it sort of until about a month ago. Now it is a piece of garbage/ do you sell any of the pieces so I can fix the kickstand?
 Gave this case to my 19 yr. old grandson. He really likes the whole design &amp; functionality of this case. The Zico designers really thought of everything when they designed this. This Bolt Series could be priced higher like other brands are...I am greatful they even thought of the price to be affordable. Its' a complete cell phone care package. Materials used are high quality for long lasting and also make a sleek appearance when the phone is used. I will definitely be looking for more of Zico products to care for my families expensive phone investiments.
 I was attached by the road cone orange which helps me not misplace my phone but was surprised by it's nice and rugged design.<br/>I don't use the belt clip but the case itself fits snugly and fits the phone well.<br/><br/>One warning, the iPhone 7 case may fit the iPhone 8 form but the apple logo on the back doesn't line up so be sure to get the right case for your phone, otherwise it looks goofy.<br/><br/>You'll like this phone case.<br/>Try one.
 Fits like a glove! Idk what other people purchased for their 7+, but my description said 8+ &amp; 7+ case. It fits perfectly. There are pics shown in the description of the bottom of the case (one person said there wasn’t ). I’m not saying all that isn’t true, I just want anyone to know if you’re ordering the case with the description 8+ &amp; 7+, it fits perfect. Mine is for a 12 year old &amp; it’s held up so far (fingers crossed). It comes with a screen protector too! #bonus
 I have had my Zico iPhone 7 Plus Case for about a month now and I have been quite pleased with it. I did have problems with the power/wake button at first but realizing if I remove the inner rubber case from the hard outer shell and carefully insert the side of the phone with the power/wake button into the rubber case first and then reinstall it into the hard outer shell it eliminated this problem. The case I received has 2 slots on the bottom edge for the speakers and 1 slot for the power cord there was no slot for earphones. There are 2 round holes on top edge of the case. Not sure what they are intended for but they do not seem to effect the intended function of the case.<br/><br/>The case really seem to be well built and the holster clip is a real plus because I carry my phone in my top pocket most of the time and can clip it in the pocket so it does not fall out if I bend over. I cracked the screen on a previous phone that fell out of my pocket even with a case.<br/><br/>I gave this case 4 stars mainly because the kickstand is very hard to open as other reviews stated but since I do not use this feature often I would have given this case 4 1/2 stars If I could.
 Love the case, bought them in the past -  the belt clips break on me all the time, as this one already has.  I just use pliers and pop the broken belt clip off and still use the cover as protection.  My phone lives in my back pocket now, and that is fine.  -- also this one doesn't has a built in screen protector, I like adding my own and being able to replace them, so I like that also.
 Seems to work as advertised.  I've dropped my phone several times and it hasn't broken or chipped yet! It's also not all "soft" sided so slipping it into my pocket and digging it out isn't bad.  I did have to modify the back though because the ridges prohibit the bonding of the metal plate for magnet holders.  A dremel and a razor blade was all it took though.
 This is a very sturdy case and it fit my iPhone 8+ perfectly. It is a little tough getting the phone in and out of the case. All the phone controls worked just as they should. The case does add significant weight to your phone but I wanted protection so thats what I got, weight for me is not a real negative issue, it actually makes the phone feel sturdier. The case has both the belt clip cover and a kickstand...I thought that was great too, rather than just one or the other. Customer service was great too, case was missing the screen protector, they sent a replacement promptly.
 Have had case for a couple of months - it's an excellent case. Went on easy. Seems very protective and did great when I dropped onto hard surface a couple of times. Nice look and feel. Like the optional lanyard - I was surprised that I like having the lanyard attached though it occasionally hooks onto things and it's not real comfortable if hanging around neck with direct skin contact but you don't have to use it. I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons - neither too major.... the blue color is so "deep" it comes off almost purple in the light... and the stand works decent in horizontal position but could be more stable if slightly wider or positioned just slightly different. The stand doesn't work in vertical setting by not many do. My complaints are borderline picky and I would recommend this case.
 I like the case. I haven’t tested it yet, and hopefully I don’t have to find out how effective it may or may not be. The lanyard is a nice touch, and the belt holster seems easy to use.<br/><br/>The reason it only gets four stars: It’s hard to install the handset in the case. They include a slip in the package that tells you to text a code to a number to get a link for installation instructions. I did this (probably got put on a calling list too), went to their side, had to provide personal data (backs up my suspicion I’m now on a marketing list), and then the link to the video was dead for the installation instructions. Suffice to say this was not a good first impression. We’ll see how the case does as I go forward.
 The description said compatible with iPhone 8 Plus. I just received the case and tired it on. None of the buttons work with the case on. They’re just stiff and don’t move. I looked at the box it comes in and it says for iPhone 7s, not plus.
 I really like the design of this item and was looking forward to using it.....I have tile floors and hate to even take an iPhone out of the factory box without being able to immediately put it into a quality drop protection case.  Unfortunately, the sleep/wake button did not work.  I installed my iPhone 7 Plust per the instructions and when that didn' work, I took it out and tried re-installing with each different side going in first.....still no luck.  Bummer..... Returned the item and replaced it with an Otterbox Defender case.
 The case is sturdy but once you have your phone in it, don’t plan to get it back out without a lot of effort. The one thing I did not like was having to flip the phone every time I wanted to put it in the holster. There are notches only on one side so you either mount the phone in the holster where the face is facing out or you flip the phone where the bottom is towards the front of your body, unless of course, you are left-handed. If I were left-handed I would give it 5 stars.
 Very nice case. Looks just like the pictures. I normally get an Outerbox Defender case for my phone but decided to get something different this time, take a step down. Boy was I wrong! This is a very nice case with the stand on the case instead of the holder. Fits great in my hand and has nice a nice feel. Has a wrist strap you can attach if needed. I couldnt believe it even came with a tempered glass screen protector. All at half the price of the Defender case. Lots of colors. Only knock is it does not have covers on the charge port or silence switch but still an incredible value.
 The case seems nice, but it's not quite right. I'm not sure whether I just got a defective one.  The power button is constantly being held down making the Power Off pop up constantly, and it is preventing me from being able to take screenshots. I have contacted the company, but have yet to hear back from them. I will update my review when this matter is resolved.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I received a new case shortly after writing the company. The new case fits nicely and I have not had any problems since. Thanks for the fast response and great customer service!
 Bought two of these, one worked and one did not work. The defective one would hold down the power button on my iPhone and cause it to constantly ask to shutdown. I kept removing and reinstalling and no matter what I did, it would not seat correctly. Comparing the two, the defective one showed visible defects inside. I have seen other reviews basically the same... So I would think they would have more scrutiny, but I guess not.
 This was bought for a work phone so I needed a case that would hold up to drops and so forth. Haven't dropped the case yet, thankfully, however, I can say the case fits nice, the clip works well and the overall feel is a nice grip; so I would recommend it. The package stated it was for an iPhone 7 plus and I ordered it for an iPhone 8 plus but it still fit.
 This case looks very nice but I had two parts of it break very soon after I bought it.  The "stand" on the back of the case is very poor quality and after using it only a couple of times it would not close properly and finally just completely broke off.  Also, the main reason I bought this case was because I liked the black plastic cover that covers the glass - the part that latches to the main case snapped off making it useless.  I guess taking it in and out of my purse weakened it. Very disappointed...
 Great construction, solid, fits very well. - Updated review - Still really like this case, so much that I had to buy a second one due to the fact the belt holder on the first one broke. Received second one couple of issues the button for the on/off position didn't work on the new case, believe possible just not stamped all the way, was able to re-use the 1st case so not major issue for me, Problem came first day, phone belt<br/>clip came apart again and once again phone hit the ground, no damage to phone, case works great for protecting phone, at least this time I was able to find all of the pieces for the belt clip, the pin that holds the belt clip on needs to be thicker and pressed so it cannot come out. I was able to straighten the pin and luckily I had found the spring portion of the the clip this time and was able to reassemble. I now keep a close eye on the pin and so far it has stayed pressed in. The case itself is great, it has protected the phone through at least 7 drops from as high as 8', unplanned drops. Shipping has been quick, packaging is good in both cases.
 I absolutely love this case; it is my second one now and I just love the look and feel of it. My only issue is that i can not find a suitable place to mount the phone in my car without it being in the way of something. I tried pairing it with a magnetic air vent mount and the magnets strength is decreased and I'm assuming it's because of the plastic kickstand on the back. I'm going to try to keep this as my "nice" case and buy a different/less expensive case for work that I wont mind getting scuffed up a bit.
 I like that is makes a smaller foot print then other cases I've used. I would recommend removing the key ring holder, it is a pain to alway have to look to make sure the phone is facing the correct way to put into clip, in addition it causes the phone to have to be turned around to use it when taking it out of the holder (real pain in the butt). Your kick stand holder is impossible to get open without the use of something other then your finger nail to open it (really disappointed in it). Positive thoughts, looks good, comfortable to hold, light weigh and company appears to be open to this type of review. I would recommend this if you have no need for kick stand. Placement of the tempered glass cover was also a pain and instructions are minimal.
 My boyfriend loves this case.  It’s not bulky and provides great protection.  The only thing he doesn’t like is that the circle cut out where the Apple logo should be doesn’t line up right on the IPhone 8+.  The kickstand is already getting a lot of use &amp; it’s fully functional in every other aspect.
 I really enjoy everything about these cases except the kickstands don’t last very long. I continue to buy these cases for my phone because of the color combinations, the screen protector and I like the all around design. I just wish the kickstands were made more sturdy so they would hold up to more opening and closing.
 So far the case seems great, I’ve only had it on for about 3 days. It seems to have great shock protection but I didn’t look closely before purchasing. I work in a very dusty environment and with the open speaker, silent switch and charging port, I’ll be cleaning my phone daily. The texture &amp; raised spots on the case make gripping significantly easier. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad case and it’s a great price. It’s just not suitable for my needs. And the color I really wanted wasn’t offered for iPhone 8 Plus.. so a star was lost for that ( It’s probably Amazon’s fault for the misleading listing though).
 Perfect fit, excellent protection and construction. I like the option of hip-mounted, though I more often just shirt pocket my encased 7+, mainly for the functionality of wanting to listen to radio or music from the speakers when pocketed upside down. But the hip function and retrieval, locking back into place works well enough, when I want that option. All in all, a satisfying, competitively-priced product that I will enjoy at least for the next three quarters...until iPhone8 surfaces, that is. I will look for a Zico solution again then.
 I could not get any of the buttons for the phone to work through the hard plastic... the product looks nice and its a great idea however everytime I needed the phone I had to pull it out of the case...I really wanted this to work...I could not use the volume button or any of the other buttons on the side of my iphone 7 plus...since the mold for the case was not a perfect fit it would not function correctly... i hated this case... dont waste your money
 The case came with a lot of little accessories like cord you can clip to case, screen protector with clothe and dust stuff.  For the price I was actually shocked that it came with everything that was needed.  The case it self is pretty good.  It feels nice in hand, tough design rugged design. I wish the clip thing you see in top left of case wasn't there since I don't plan on even using it.  The flip out stand is hard to get out  Not sure if I'm doing it wrong but I would think it'll be easier to take out. The belt clip attachment worked well.  I just used it for about 30 mins just because.  I'll rather put phone in pocket.  The screen protector doesn't cover 100% of screen.  I'll probably end up with zagg protector at some point but for price you can't beat it.  If I had tried everything out first I would say it'll be worth double price.
 I LOVE this case!  Shipping was quick and case it  as nice as the picture. I got the red for the new red iPhone 7 plus. The color is the same beautiful wine red as the phone. The case is rugged as far as durability but still has a stylish look to it. It comes with a few added items that can be useful but the screen protector is most beneficial. It also has a lanyard, kickstand (on the back of the case) that folds flat when not in use, and a holster. I highly recommend this case. You won't regret it.
 Okay so first thing first-you’ll have to watch a video to get the case on.<br/><br/>It’s simple-separate the two parts-slip on the black-shake and shimmy it on.<br/><br/>Then get the plastic shell on it-that’s a bit trickier but it can be done!!!!!<br/><br/>Love the landyard-thankful it came with a tempered glass for the screen.<br/><br/>Light weight<br/>Easy to use<br/>Doesn’t restrict buttons<br/>Love the belt clip
 Robust and stylish case. Love the tempered glass cover for the face, love the kickstand too.  One minor design change I'd recommend is to make the corner loop slightly bigger to fit a small carabiner clip through ... I like to use that to clip the phone to a belt loop, or around the strap of my purse because I feel my phone is then less likely to fall off than with the clip (which could get pinched and release accidentally).
 I have had this case on my phone for months now and have dropped it several times. The glass screen protector is still intact and after all of those drop my phone is still in perfect condition! The only issue I have with this case is that the button on the right is touchy. I find when I barely bump it my phone asks if I want to power down. This product has saved my IPhone 7 plus many times!
 I like the look and the feel, but the kick stand is really flimsy and broke the first time I tried use it for a time lapse.<br/><br/>Update 12-28-18.  Vender sent new replacement case. However it too was just as bad. The two part case started to separate. It's kick stand also broke within a day. These are garbage. I just bought a Otterbox.
 This case has a lanyard anchor on the upper left corner.  Unfortunately, this limits the direction it can be holstered.  I am right handed and wear on my right hip.  When I release the phone to answer it, it's upside down in my hand.  It creates extra risk and movement to turn the phone around.  If I was left handed it would be perfect.<br/><br/>I like the fact there was a kick stand, but I broke a nail trying to open it (I'm not a woman).  I had others try it and everyone thought they were going to break the stand.  No one was able to open it.<br/><br/>I will be sending this item back.
 I’ve had a Zizo case for a while now on my iPhone 6s. It’s a great case! Well I recently got a new phone so I ordered a new case but I accidentally ordered an 8 plus instead of an 8 but the company won’t let me exchange it. Definitely a bummer &amp; poor customer service. I don’t think I will ever buy another Zizo case.
 I have always used Otterbox for my phones.  When my IPhone 7 Plus was ordered, Amazon suggested the Zizo Bolt.  I watched several videos and read reviews.  I decided to order the phone for less than $20, I figured it was worth a shot.  Man was I happy.  This two piece case is phenomenal.  The inside rubber is strong and sturdy and the outside plastic piece is strong but gives enough to make putting the phone in easy.  The case comes with a bonus tempered glass screen cover, the case has a kick stand built in and you get a lanyard. I highly recommend this case.
 I have put this on and taken it off several times. It doesn't fit properly. Either the volume buttons work and the power button doesn't. Or the power button works and the volume buttons don't. Poor design.
 This is my 3rd Zizo Bolt case.  I love the quality &amp; colors.  But, most of all, it is the only case that has the strap holder.  I take photos from piers &amp; fishing boats in FL and need the security that I'm not going to drop my phone in the ocean!!  I'm very happy to see that the strap holder has been improved with a harder material.
 Case is really good quality. The packaging is also high end. The screen was easy to put on my phone. The guide strips can be used to get rid of the pesky lint that gets behind the screen no matter how hard you kept the area clean. I re-applied my screen three times before I got it right. I'm incredibly happy with this purchase especially for the price point.<br/><br/>The only thing to note is the orange color looked nice online. When I got it, it looks a bit like a basketball. That's great for those that like that. I think I'm going to personalize it a bit with some sharpies to make it look like a cyclops monster or some sort of flower. I'm thinking of purchasing a second for my work phone. Each would need to be a different color anyways.
 solid case. heavy duty. disappointed with the kickstand. The kickstand is large unlike a lot of the other cases I have had. It is one of the main reasons I bought this case. However the large kickstand is supported by a smaller piece that broke very easily with a few uses. Large kickstand still works but leaves the phone on a steeper angle.
 I’ve been using this phone case for about a month and am very happy with it. I have dropped my phone a few times and it has kept it safe. The stand is convenient. Also, the surface is textured so it is easy to hold on to, unlike my old one which would literally slip out of my hand because it was so smooth.
 I purchased this case back in the fall. It only has a 30 day warranty so you've been warned.<br/>Whe<br/>I suggest purchasing an Otter Box because I have used their product in the past and they do stand behind their product when there is an issue.n I received this case in the mail, I made sure to have my tech support person in my office put the tempered glass on my screen along with the case.<br/>Within two months of this "military grade" case, my phone screen cracked.<br/>I contacted the company, Zizo.com before writing this negative review to see if they would stand behind their product and have my screen replaced.They said it was outside the warranty (30 days). Zizo said they would pay for a new tempered glass for my phone but that I would have to pay the shipping and handling fees.<br/>I will not buy another product from this company since they sell a product that does not withstand everyday use.
 Bought one for my daughters phone. Fit was great and so is the color. She loved it.. So, when my husband wanted one too, I didn't hesitate to purchase again. He picked the color and waited. It finally arrived and out of the box it went. Unfortunately, the outer shell is so tight that it keeps his power button compressed. Not sure if we can find a "fix" so he can actually use the entire phone case. Only problem we have encountered and the only reason 4 out of 5 stars.
 just received this product today. I compare the zizo to the outter case. For product quality rate them both outstanding. What I like about the Zizo is the size, it is very functional, protect my iPhone 7 plus. I also prefer the Zizo because it is just a little smaller in size to the Outter case and provide the same protection but is easy to handle. Outstanding product, recommend it to anyone who is look for and excellent case at a very affordable price.
 Bought two of these. Looks great and doesn't feel cheap. The arm on the back can be a pain to extend and has popped off once but got it back on with no problem.<br/>6 month update - the kickstand has snapped off the back of both cases numerous times while trying to extend the arm. We finally lost the metal pins in both cases that is needed to reattach the stands. It lasted 6 months so I guess that's good for the price.
 Gaps , exsesive plastic flash around the edges . Quality control needs to watch for fit and finish , because the entire top back of it is pealing back⁉️ Really disappointing .
 This was for my husband's new phone.  The case fit nicely and i feel has pleasingly looks but my husband was wearing it on his belt and hadn't even taken it off was just walking around and the clip broke and the phone fell to the ground.  the whole purpose of buying this was for the clip.  we just cant seem to find a clip that is durable they always break
 I'd rank this a 4+ if I could because it really is a very nice case for the price. Very good protection and the choice of color (orange for me) makes it easy to see in a darkened room and leaves no doubt whose phone it is, especially when you've got multiple iPhones in the household. Only two drawbacks being (1) snapping the phone in/out of its belt clip takes a bit of force, which sometimes needs two hands to accomplish, and (2) the screen protector was a bit harder to put on then other protectors I've had.  I think the belt clip issue will resolve itself as it either gets a bit more flexible or my dexterity improves.
 Great case for the price although the clip on the holster cracked after only a couple of weeks of having it but I’m also hard on my phones which is why I always have a case on it. Feels great has a textured back on it for a good solid grip, I would recommend for people who are easier on their phones( I work outside daily with repetitive movements such as bending and stretching and carrying stuff so I’m sure that’s how I broke the clip)
 I love this case. It feels secure but light in my hands. The design is unique and visually striking. I would buy this case again!
 It is true that it is an iPhone 6 case being sold as the iPhone 7 case but who cares it fits perfect and definitely gets the job done. The kick stand is a plus, it has a rigid look but does not look too masculine for me. I purchased the all black version but removed the neck stap and plan on replacing it with a wrist strap. I also like it does not have the annoying flap over the charger port. Has a Very snug fit and though it is tough, the side buttons are not hard to press like some covers make them.
 Love it, great protection. I have dropped my phone a few times and it is holding up well. I bought this back in November 2016 and it is now February 2017. The kickstand is also an awesome feature, I use it literally every day.
 Love the case. Tempered glass was broken upon opening box. Contacted Zizo and was quickly given option of getting another sent or getting credit for glass. Great customer service. Case fits my lifestyle and is not as bulky as my previous O.B.. I would recommend it and would buy it again. Not sure who would ever use the lanyard?
 Fits my iPhone 8 like a glove..a very, very tight glove. You will have to very gingerly and repeatedly attempt to place the phone into the sleep/wake side of the case as the soft silicone will get stuck on the button and prevent you from using it. After much effort my case is on and I like it.<br/><br/>Note: Unlike the iPhone 7/8 case, this will NOT work vertically. A bit disappointed.
 I picked black / red color . Having a string a big plus ! Also I used a cover with a belt clip for hiking and mountain climbing. I bought this piece for travel to Crimea being on the beach often . After reviewing multiple available iPhone covers I decided with ZizoBolt.
 Fits nicely. Came with a lanyard. The loop at the top of the case is a little flimsy so I am not sure I would want to hang a heavy iPhone 7 Plus from it. It seems to be pretty solid and protective. The kickstand works great.
 Phone is constantly turning off because power button is under pressure being pressed. Nice case but that does not help, I had to use a knife to cut the power button down so it did continue to push the power button
 The iPhone 8 Plus is very slippery and difficult to hold.  This is the best case for an iPhone that I have found.  The design is most impressive.  With the ZIZO case, the iPhone feels very secure in your hand.  The case is very rugged in the event the phone falls out.  If you want to clip the phone to your belt, it has an outer case that snaps very securely.  I now have the option to put the iPhone in my shirt pocket or clip it to my belt.  Another way you can secure the iPhone is to use the lanyard.
 I like that it comes with a stand and the belt clip. But it feels a little cheap, it does not have the shock proof rubber it’s more like a harder plastic. I ordered this for an iPhone 8+ while the case does fit correctly, the glass screen it comes with does not fit the screen completely. This does not feel as strong as the otter box defender series, so military grade is just more fluff.
 I was purchasing a new case and was looking for a UAG case and in the process I found this very cool case. I put it in my cart while I continued my search.  Nope, that was the one. I found the other but the reviews for the Zico Bolt was so good and looked so rugged. I ordered it and was not disappointed. What a great case. Solid and great protection! Has a little kickstand for hands free streaming or video calls.
 Incredibly disappointed. The on button does not go in enough to actually turn on the phone. Volume buttons work okay. I took it off several times and put it back carefully but the on button just doesn’t push down enough no matter how much I try. My phone is a brand new iPhone 8 and i don’t have any problems with the on button.
 The holster broke when I was attempting to attach the phone. Zizo referred me to the manufacturer. They had me provide pictures of the break. Once I provided the requested information I heard nothing from them. I didn’t abuse it and I was merely trying to put the phone in the holder. It is not a very good product.
 I was reluctant to buy this for my Iphone 7Plus.  I had been using an Otterbox Defender for a couple of years.<br/>I took a chance and ordered this case. Not only is it much less bulky, but seems "tough as nails" too!<br/>Love the easy to apply screen protector, and I'm absolutely crazy about the bright orange cover.  I like having a bright cover to locate my phone anywhere I leave it.  I don't use the clip much, but there's a nifty detachable lanyard which just makes it that much easier to locate and keep track of.<br/>This case is a great value for the money!
 Ive had this cover on my phone for about a week, its seems heavy duty. It fits snug and has a very rugged look but that's what i was going for this time. I haven't dropped my phone yet so i'm not sure sure how it actually works.<br/>Update: The case has cracked near the volume button and the kickstand has fallen off, I didn't originally buy it for the kickstand but it still should have lasted more than 5 months. The case itself is doing what its supposed to, keep my phone from breaking
 Product is fine as is. Fits perfectly for iphone 7 plus. Hard case and is awesome!<br/><br/>How ever 3 stars because - the color in the pic is NOT what the color that you receive. Please see the attached pics. Have no issue with the one that I received, but the marketing tactic of posting false pic instead of the original color is what gets me. So....
 I bought this case for my husband when we bought new phones. He is a machinist so he needs a case that will protect his phone should it fall onto the cement floor, or it gets his on his machine. He said it protects his new iPhone 7 Plus great and has had no issues with this case. He uses the belt clip with it while he's at work and said it is secure and keeps his phone in place at his waist. We would definitely buy this case again!
 My partner is a phone killer. This case has already saved the iPhone 8 Plus from death 6 times. It’s a beast and it DOES let the wireless charger work!<br/><br/>Amazing deal.<br/><br/>Only downside is the colors aren’t exactly like the pic and the light gray looks white and gets dirty FAST.<br/><br/>Otherwise this is the case for the person who has butter fingers. Well done.
 I've had my Zizo case for 2 weeks. I loved the way it looked with my phone and that it was not as bulky as previous Otterbox cases. However, I dropped my phone today from approximately 2-3 feet onto the floor of my garage. It dropped onto the back of the phone case. One of the little black round rubber bumpers flew off and my iPhone screen is now cracked. I  I have previously dropped previous iPhones with Otterbox cases from the same and more of a height and have never had any damage to my phones. I am not sure what " meets Military Grade 810.1-G Certification" means but it is not protective. Not a good purchase.
 I have on the phone now but it’s already broken!! The kick stand broke; the pins for it break easily!! For the price I got it for not too good since it broke already.
 This is THE IPhone case to buy for your new iPhone 7+ - I ordered one for myself and one for my husband - rugged, attractive and durable - just like my husband :)  has a faceplate with a clip for your belt and a wristlet option.  Comes with tempered glass front piece and has a convenient kickstand for watching videos/movies.  So worth the price and this is coming from a previous LifeProof and OtterBox case owner of many years!
 In less than a month, the kickstand broke off. Stayed on just long enough for my return policy to be invalid. Not worth the money!!
 I got this case today and was excited to use it. This case bent my iPhone Plus 7 because it was SO SUPER tightened. The reason I took the phone out of the case was because the power on/off button did not work. I had to grip a button which it was supposed to go sleep, but did not work at all. And the kickstand was so weak which might be broke soon in near future. So, I tried to take the phone out to return back, but the phone got bent.<br/><br/> Do not get this case or you will be risking your iPhone being bent. And best to get UAG case, yes, it is little expensive, but better. I should had listened to my friend whom recommended me UAG, but I got this case because it was cheaper and equivalent to UAG, but I was wrong.
 I bought this case by mistake and find it too much hassle to return it.<br/><br/>Parcel came and I tried it on my phone and it is not compatible with my full screen edge-to-edge glass screen protector, and breaking it in the process of inserting the phone into the case. By the way it came with a free glass screen protector but I have not tried it.<br/><br/>Next I turn the clip clockwise and then counter-clockwise, and the clip broke!<br/><br/>Otherwise, for the price the casing looks solid and extremely well built. I have no doubt it can withstand a 10 foot drop.
 This case is great and makes holding on to a much larger phone a lot easier!!  I am also very happy with the price and the protection this case will provide my new iPhone 7 plus!!  I went from an old iPhone 5 and upgraded finally to the 7plus so having the right case to protect my new phone was very important to me and this case is the real deal.  And I like the way it looks!!!
 Light weight, but very sturdy and strong.  Good overall features to include the flip extension to accommodate movie watching on a flat surface.  I spilled my coffee on it at work one day and to my surprise, the Zizo case protected my phone very well even though this is not an advertised feature of this model.  Good job Rocky on prompting me to provide this review as I had forgotten I really wanted to do this review.
 After looking at the case online and comparing it to others that were at a higher price point I was a little concerned.  However I figured I would give it a try.  And I am glad I did.  The quality is outstanding, easy to grip.  The kick stand is a nice feature as well.  Overall very happy with my purchase.
 The kickstand broke with normal use in less than 7 days.  Unbelievably flimsy.  I had a Zizo case before where the kickstand was quite strong so I'm really confused by this.  Also I don't why anyone needs a gaping hole in the back of a protective case but for those that actually want that, it is way off center for iPhone 8 plus.
 Seems durable. Not a perfect fit - lower left hand corner of the orange cover sticks out a bit. It will not sit flush like the lower right hand corner. Annoying and visually unappealing. Just got it yesterday so hoping it won't catch on things. Cover doesn't seem to interfere with button functions at all. Love the lanyard strap.
 Awesome product but not consistently well made. First I bought in gold then in white. The gold case is well made and fine while both the white case and clip both broke almost at first time use. I love it so much I gold though that I've reordered it again in white and am hoping for better luck.
 I just got a new iPhone 8 Plus and ordered the Zizo Bolt Series black and red case.  After I ordered it I started reading all the one star ads and started to get nervous.  I actually then ordered another different case expecting the Zizo to not fit correctly.  My husband watched the internet video on how to put the case on the phone and it fits perfectly.  All the buttons work, the apple in the back is centered in the opening on the case and I LOVE the lanyard opening.  So far I would totally recommend this case for the 8 plus.
 I love this phone case, it's easy to grip and will not slide out of your hand. I also like the rugged look. The only minus was that the off button<br/>would not turn off the phone. I assumed that the case button did not move enough to depress the phone button below it. I made a small cut on each side of the case's off button to give it more movement and voila, it workred.
 Very disappointed. I have I Phone 7 plus.  The button for power off and on right side of case wouldn't work. I removed  and replaced cover multiple times. Kept locking phone out. Clip on case broke.  Volume switches worked fine that's why two stars. Put case mate, case back on. All switches work well and makes the phone feel smaller. Casemate case slipppery and I have an affinity for holsters. I tried. Just unsuccessful, I'll continue with the casemate.
 great coverage and protection
 Kick stand broke immediately. Didn’t even use it. Case edges do not extend very high to protect screen from drops and cracks. Was hoping for a better protective lip that would absorb impacts around the screen edge more easily. Color and feel are good.
 This is my second case. My first one was for my iPhone 5s. This case is a perfect fit for my iPhone 8 plus. It is very durable with a belt holster and the pull out stand is a plus. I can also wirelessly charge my phone through this case. Geat job and great case Zizo.
 I will be returning this, it does not fit an iphone8 plus correctly. The button on the right of the phone to sleep it isn’t lined up correctly and you can tell in the back becaus the circle doesn’t line up with the Apple logo. I would have order another one because I do like it but looking at reviews it appears this is an issue with all plus cases and the iPhone 8 Plus
 I usually carry my iPhone in my purse, but when I started tracking my steps, I needed it "on me" for the function to work.  This is a pretty neat case.  It clips on my pants so when I walk I can get my steps counted.  Not bad looking either, I got the red one.
 This case is advertised for an iPhone 8+ but it's really an iPhone 7+ case. My iPhone 8+ Apple Logo is not centered on the back as advertised in the picture. Other than the the fit is fine. The kickstand is impossible to flip out without a screwdriver, hopefully over time it will get easier to open.
 Product did not last a year with minimal use. The lock and release tab broke. It is still connected to the case but now will not lock the phone in.
 I bought two of these cases and really like how rugged it is without the overly rugged look. Unfortunately I have to give this three starts because the plastic piece that holds the kickstand open has broken on BOTH of the cases. At first I was happy that I ordered two - one for a backup, but to have the same thing happen on both cases in less than 5 months is unacceptable.
 This is my second one i bought. literally within weeks of each other. Great case.  Needs a little TLC on the Stand on the back of the Phone. Other then that keep up the good work. But i didn't buy it for the stand i bought it for the tough case.<br/>Thanks
 Well I do love this company cases, I buy them every time I get a new Samsung, I bought this case for my friend,  she said it did fit, but it cover part of the apple and it would at times make her volume go down, so I'm asking for a refund and I'll wait till they make one for an actual iPhone 8 plus case
 I would give this a 5 because it's sturdy.  However, there are design flaws.  If you're right handed, the phone will only go into the clip one way and upon taking out of clip to answer, the phone will be upside down. If you wear it on your left side, no issue.<br/>I had to cut off the loop on top for the strap to make it fit in the belt clip so when I answer, phone will be in correct direction.<br/>This case is not ambidextrous
 This Zizo case fits my iPhone 8+ just right. The buttons line up and are operational when the phone is in place. Same for the camera lens. It takes some stretching to snap the phone in. There’s a hard front cover that has to be snapped off to view the screen. It has a strong clip on it that can be relied upon to attach the phone to a belt, etc. The glass screen protector takes some skill and patience to apply without air bubbles. All the features of the case truly are protective and functional. Take the phone anywhere in rugged circumstances, except perhaps water, and it is protected in the Zizo case.
 Product broke after 6 weeks of use . We actually bought two of them ; luckily the other failed earlier.  Good case design but total garbage quality. Avoid this product .
 This is honestly my favorite iPhone phone case so far! I’ve owned Otterbox, Apple, Spiga(so?) etc. Not only does this look good but it feels good in my hands. I bought it because of the color and the fact that it came with a clip. Funny - I haven’t even used the clip yet. It comes with a lanyard so you can wear it around your neck too. Just wanted to write a quick review on a product I really like! Btw- I purchased this off of Amazon and have not been compensated to write a review.
 Awesome customer service. The case is high quality and looks very very expensive. It arrived several days earlier than expected which was perfect. I am a retired Marine with 20 years of active duty, so I judge things as “Marine” tested, this case has been Marine tested and passed with flying colors. Dropped phone, it bounced and was not damaged at all! The price is great, I would have paid more!
 Nice all-in-one case. Easy to hang on to and really sturdy. I like the dongle for carrying around the neck, makes using the camera easier and more secure.<br/>I was concerned about how hard it was to get the phone (8 plus) into. It did go and won’t be coming out.<br/>Thanks Rocky.
 This is one of the best cases I have owned.  I like how solid it feels.  I like the kickstand, and I am not a big fan of the belt clip, but glad to have it just in case.  I am pleased with this purchase coming with a tempered glass protector... very much worth the money.  The only thing I do not like is that I cannot seem to get the button on the side of the case to turn off the screen... if you hold it for 3-4 seconds, it will want to turn off the phone.  I am just used to hitting that button to turn off the screen, and I cannot do that know... maybe that is a feature of the iphone 7... not sure... other than that, I love the case... I would purchase again.
 Wasn't happy at all with product. I bought this case because it seemed a little thinner than otter box &amp; much lower price. My major complaint is that the screen isn't really protected well at all. Although it is tempered glass it doesn't cover the screen securely, too many bubbles, &amp; leaves exposure to dirt &amp; the elements. I returned this product, as an outdoor contractor my phone protection is most important. Better to spend xtra money to secure $800. Phone
 I really like this case. Sturdy but not bulky. Fits my hand nicely and the clip on cover with clip is really strong.  Wanted a case that could stand up to grandchildren and this is perfect.  Have had case couple months and kick stand no longer stays shut.  Catches on things which is annoying.
 I wish they made the same style for my other phones.  One of the best I have owned.<br/>It's easy to remove from the holster, without worrying about it falling out.  The glass was easy to install.  It protects the phone well.<br/>The accessory loop is kind of cool, but haven't found a use for it yet.<br/><br/>The only negative feedback is, it was a little difficult to put on the phone.  However, I don't plan on removing it anytime soon.<br/>I hope they continue making the same style in the future, as I upgrade my phone.  This will be the first place I look.
 Bought this cover for my iPhone 7 plus.  After installed the power button won't work.  Phone keeps cycling on and off.  I  thought may be it was not install properly so I took it apart and try again several times.  Still no luck.  The same problem again over and over.  Will have to find a different brand/make for my iPhone 7+ now
 This is a fine case and well worth the money.  It is very attractive also.  Unfortunately, I have a weak grip, and this case is just a little too slippery for me, and I kept dropping it.  I need a case with a "sticky" or "non-slip" exterior, and this case does not have that.  Of course, their are millions of people who do NOT want a "sticky" exterior, and if you are one of those, you will love this well built and attractive case.
 Best cases ever---- this is my second time purchasing for my iPhone 7+...just wanted a change of color. Now, I went on Safari in the spring and I wanted a case that would permit me to have my phone hanging around my neck--- so it was easy to switch from my Sony camera to my phone---perfect, sturdy, love the little gadget on the back for angles---all in all---GREAT PRODUCT, quick delivery! Hope you will be making a case for the iPhone X!!!! Please! Love your screen protector, too!
 When I bought this case the description stated it was compatible with iPhone 6,7,8 plu. Now the description changed. It is not compatible. If you have an iPhone 8 the logo will not center. Also belt clip is junk, it broke off on the first day I used while trying to take the phone off the clip to make a phone call. Very deceiving description and product.
 It deserves a review. I just love it. It's so well built, looks amazing, feels great on my hands, and is superbly a well fit for my 8plus. It's very well protected and I particularly love the attached string! This is the one!!!
 Tough case that gives you something to grip without being overly bulky. The neck strap attachment is a) not needed or b) in the completely wrong place. If I'm going to hang my phone I want the attachment at the bottom. This makes it easier to grab and lift-to-wake in the right orientation. And it would allow Pokémon Go battery saver to work while hanging. As is, I don't need it. And it's just extra weight and bulk that's not needed. But otherwise, a good case.
 Wrong Case, Not even design for the Iphone 8 plus, Which the description says!
 This is a great case for my 7plus. All pieces are I. The right spot. Only downside is if you use magnetic mounts in your car, they really don't work with this case. I even used the shell case on the car but the plastic is so strong that it doesn't hold well on the Magnet.<br/><br/>My son and I both have this and it's very secure and very easy to use. I would have loved the option to ditch the glass and shell for your belt, since I don't use them but it was still a great value.
 Looks awesome and very sturdy but it’s not. Bought it 3 months ago and already cracked. Contacted CS to no avail. My phone didn’t even fall!!
 This case is even better that I expected.  I purchased  one previously as a gift for someone else and they are still using it.  They say it's the best case that they've ever had!  I'll be looking for a ZIZO case like this for my next phone as well!
 Really like this case.had it for a few months and is durable so far,I think it will hold up pretty good.I work outside around the house all day so I always have it on me,I've dropped it a couple of  times and no damage done,so no complaints .I like it .and the attached cord a plus.
 I really liked this case and thought the value was good for all you get, but today while listening to music with the kickstand out I noticed a crack in it and while trying to close it it just broke off.  I’m disappointed because I really did like this case. I’ve only had it for a couple of weeks.
 The case itself is nice enough and seems sturdy, as well.  However, I picked this particular case because it also came with a holster.  I had just received this package in the mail.  The holster clip broke within a hour of having opened my package.  I was merely trying to rotate the clip.  I previously had an Otterbox that I had had for years.  If you don't need the holster, this is a good case.  If you really want a holster... DO NOT BUY THIS set.
 Bought his for my husband for his birthday for his iPhone 7pus. Likes the fact that it has an 80ft drop test and passed. The case was slowly hard to get on over the rubber bit but when tried My someone else they got it on very easy. Finger strength is important. The clip has a strong grip and the screen protector was VERY easy to install with the guide stickers provided. Looks amazing on the phone.
 Zizo case is the best ever. Convenient sturdy and very fairly priced. Almost cheaply priced. The best quality money can buy at any price. I am Amazon Prime  amazed and greatful. A family owned business. Could it be better than that! Go Zizo! The best case for the lowest fair price. No need to buy a spare.  But you should advertise these products to anyone and everyone. Three Cheers for the Zizo brothers. What a family!
 this case looked good however we each had problems with the quality of it.  my sons case the side plastic broke off after about 6 month.  mine kick stand hinge snapped after only about 2 months.  I reached out to customer service and never got a response.
 I love my Zizo (Bolt) case.  I got it because I frequently do not carry a purse and my new phone is too big for a pocket.  I wanted something like I had years ago that allowed me to have the phone clip to my waistband or the neck of my shirt ( yeah crazy but it works) so I know where my phone is when going out for a walk/ hike or to the flea market.  I hate to carry to have to worry about a purse.  So I put a drivers license , a couple of dollars in my pocket and a bottle of water in hand and I am off... And if I'm just hanging around home... take off the clip and it has a good feel to hold it, or with just a little effort use the stand and watch a show with the Grandkids...
 This case is probably well designed, but definitely bad produced. If you are looking for a protective case, DO NOT buy this.<br/>The worst problem for this case is the on/off button on iphone 7 plus can not fit the design. when you install this case, the on/off button is always pushed down.  So your iphone will continuously restart, you can never use it at all.<br/>Another thing is it is really hard to install this case, you have to detach the whole case into parts to install it.<br/><br/>Update: I cut put of the inside part of the on/off button on the case, and now it works. The button does not fill good, but it no longer always push the on/off button.
 This phone case is a great case. I have always used Otter Box types but wanted to try something different. This case has two plastic parts. The inner part is someone flexible and the outer part is very hard. So putting this on the phone takes a little effort. It does not add much size to the phone overall and I can still easily put it in my back pocket (front is uncomfortable but even without a case the phone is also). The apple symbol is not centered in the back, but not a big deal for me. It has great grip even when my hands are wet. I would recommend this particular case to anybody.
 I really love these cases; had so many in the past in different sizes and colors. The only reason I didn’t put five stars is because, even though the 7 Plus and 8 Plus might have the same size dementions, the Apple logo on the back however is lowered on the 8 Plus, so yeah...it’s not centered correctly.
 Great cover looks just like the photo. Only thing the glass was to small for the screen.
 The phone case is very nice, when it is not in the front clip there is little protecting the front of the case (being my only negative comment). I purchased the red case for my work phone, I am very happy with this product in person.
 I liked the look of the case, but the hard plastic casing was useless.  Couldn’t activate any button on my IPhone 8 Plus.  The Apple logo was mis- aligned.  Just a cheap poorly conceived design.  Stick with SPIGEN cases.  They’re the best.
 I bought this in February 2018 and the little kickstand has already broken off. This is not due to rough usage either--it's just flimsy. Otherwise the case seems sturdy and the bright color makes it easy to find in my bag. But without the kickstand it's not useful for what I need.
 The case definitely protects my phone from falls. But I decided to try this case because it also had a stand. One of the support pegs broke within a week of using the case which meant it no longer locked into place. I continued using it that way. It's been around 4 months now and the stand is cracking. My previous phone had a different Zizo case with a stand and that case held up better for over a year.
 I've had this on my phone for awhile now. I've dropped in many times on cement, asphalt, tile, everywhere. I have not even had a single crack on the screen or protective screen cover. Love this case. Will be buying again for the next phone.
 1) the "desert tan" is more like a flesh color (the photo is desaturated by like 33%)<br/>2) the soft green layer goes on easy enough but the hard plastic flesh-colored part requires almost phone-cracking levels of pressure to get on<br/>3) mushy power button<br/>4) returns require postage to be paid by you, plus a restocking fee
 So in love with this new case!! Love the feel in my hands, makes my iPhone 7 much easier to hold, case is VERY durable, came very quickly, with a great screen protector and lanyard! Was easy to install on phone. So reasonably priced compared to comparable cases in the store!! I will definitely recommend to my family and friends!!
 I bought this hoping that it is what it was in the picture. I thought it would be in Navy Blue color, but it was a Royal Blue color instead. I wanted to buy the black one to be safe, but it does not have a Prime 2 day delivery option that's why I settled to this one. It would've been great if it was in navy blue color, but oh well. Plus, the screen protector does not exactly fit in the screen of the iPhone 7 plus that I have. I don't know if it should be that way, but I thought buyers of this case should know.
 Can't turn off phone with buttons and sound as well. The case is made of a hard plastic. The stand is hard to get out and didn't use it. Cheap product. Don't waste your time. I ended up buying an otter box symmetry and I love it. Get that one.
 Because I need a case with a belt clip my options are limited. I have tried over 10 options of cases and this one by far is the best I have tried. In fact, I ordered a second unit in another color. It states Prime but it's going to take over a week to come in so if it's not available ASAP then it's worth the wait.
 I was really looking for something to replace an otterbox, and this just was't it
 So disappointed. I had this same case for my Samsung and it worked great. The volume part does not work right for the iPhone 7plus. Can’t lower volume. Both volume buttons only cause volume to go up. Useless.
 I thought there would be a plastic cover for the apple logo and one for the front like some otter boxes have. But it also didn't say it was going to be like an otter box so can't complain.  As far as fitment issues. The cover for the power button is too tight, my power button is consistently being pressed I had to cut the power button cover out just so it would fit right. But I love the design and color scheme I chose. Black/Red
 This was the second identical case that I bought for my IPhone 8 Plus, both cracked and I had to through them in the garbage. The holsters both cracked it seems that the plastic is too brittle. The case seems ok, but the holster is not, it doesn’t fit my IPhone 7 Plus very well either. I have a Seido case for my IPhone 7 Plus and it has been great for the past 2.5 years.
 this is great armor and would have given it 5 stars except the clip broke off and the I phone hurled to the concrete floor,, the armor kept it from damage but if I had not been aware that it left me for the floor I would have lost my 1K I phone 7 plus 256gb...lucky for me I heard it hit the floor and was able to retrieve it. not like that soft holster that made no sound....one star for the clip and five stars for the armor
 I love this case it’s my second one was white witch got dirty so I got black because for the money great case every thing comes with your new case screen protector cleaner tabs to get it on even clip case they thought of every thing. Thank you great job
 1rst this is not made fo Iphone 8 plus as advertised. The apple is out of the hole, the buttons are too tight and will not work unless you do some modifications and your IQ charger will not work either. So , bad advertising. And that is a no no in my book. I was really upset until I did the modifications. I’ll try to update later with photos.
 Appears to be fantastic out of the box. BUT ... it's waaaay too tight and the power button on the right side is constantly pressed. Therefore, your phone is in a constant state of trying to shut down. At this price, definitely too good to be true. I wish I'd read all of the one-star negative reviewers on here - who ALL experienced the same issue. At the end of the day, this product is GARBAGE. Save you money, your time, and your sanity.
 Solid phone case that looks pretty sharp. It provides a good fit and excellent protection. (I've already dropped it a few times). I was worried that the "ridges" on the back of the case would make pulling the phone out of my pocket an issue, but it hasn't been at all. The fold out stand works perfectly and is quite sturdy. Given that this case comes with a screen protector, belt clip, and a lanyard, it even provides some nice value.
 Quality is excellent but the holster is backwards. I have used several different cases in the past including Otterbox and the clip part of the holster is always in the front (If you put it on the left hip) But this one is in the back and it's near impossible to release the phone without using two hands. Bummer because I love the case but I'll probably have to go back to Otterbox
 I am having the same problem as noted in several other of the reviews on this site. That is, that the case is too tight and doesn't align perfectly with the power button causing the power button to be constantly depressed making the phone not want to power on and not wanting to power off as well as taking screenshots every time I press the home button when the phone is on . Therefore, I have no other option but to return the phone. It is a nice case other than this problem but this problem is a dealbreaker. Very disappointed.
 I have it 3 stars because I put a beating on my phones and the 3 stars reflects the comparison between this phone and a otter box defender. If you have a office job great phone for you if you work in the trenches buy the otter box
 Its not great for the Iphone 8 Plus. Only reason is the button to lock my phone is very hard to press to turn my phone on and off. So I had to add the accessibility icon on my phone to use.  I will be buying new case in a few weeks, but just keeping this for now to protect my phone. You also clearly see the apple on the back of the case is not center correctly in the middle of the case. Half the apple is covered.
 I like it when i first put it on , i didn’t really like the front thing w the clip on it , but before i even got to use it the kick stand broke off i just got this earlier today so that’s not a good sign ..
 Best iphone case ever, best phone case over all of them. Reasons? sleek design, contour enables easy grip, kickstand for watching videos, visually stunning, very light case, and it comes with a tempered glass screen protector as an added bonus.<br/><br/>This particular green color design makes someone stand out from other iphone users. This is the only one that has a colored circle around the apple window, all the others have a black circle.
 I love the looks of the case.  It feels good in the hand, but it does not work with the iPhone 7+.  Once your phone is in the case it hold the power button down.  Which renders the power button inoperable.  I guess they did not test this before selling them.<br/><br/>Don't buy this case get one that works.<br/><br/>It's a shame I really wanted to use this case.  I guess I will go back to Spigen they make awesome phone cases.
 Your product was above and beyond what I had to subpoenaed I should've actually read the details more very nice and I have said multiple people at work and they were also very surprised at all the items included like the kickstand and the screen protector let alone the wonderful price I know people that I've paid $50 for the same type of case thank you again
 I love the fact that this case is blue, however I also love the fact that there are ripples on it which make it so much easier to grab and hold onto. I also love the foldout kickstand on the case, as I have never had a kickstand case before. It really helps when I’m listening to stuff on Bluetooth headphones.
 I absolutely love this case, best one I have ever owned! Only complaint: I purchased the bright green skin and outer black case. I would not recommend it if you handle and use your phone frequently. The skin becomes grimy and dirty.. nothing I have tried gets it clean looking again. I’m ordering a 2nd Zizo case because I love it but will be going all dark or the inner skin black and my color choice on the outside. Also, the kickstand is awesome when I need it. It’s the reason I chose to try this case in the first place.
 I ordered this case for my adult daughter. She wanted something that was pretty much waterproof as she is known to drop her phone in the ocean. She seems to be pleased with the case. The orange color helps to find it quicker in a pile of stuff or your purse.
 This case is really prettier  than the advertised picture. It's very lightweight and glad to know it's capable of protecting my iPhone 7 plus. To have it durable, lightweight, protection, thin, and pretty all in one is what a girl needs. This case have that tough guy look and a veriety of colors, I choose gold and it's so metallic 😀 Most durable cases are basic black, that's why I like this case. I will let you know if it keeps its zeal when I start using it. Be Blessed!
 Definetly not military drop rated. False advertisement. First drop from about pocket height and the screen is cracked. Now spending days of running around and phone calls to get phone replaced or repaired. Not a good case at all.
 I just bought this case thinking it was bright blue as shown. Mine arrived and it is a Dark Blue. This is a good case so far, the clip seems to stay on if you choose to use it. I bought this primarily because of the "military drop test" and the "kickstand". So far I like it.<br/><br/>Update - I returned the dark blue case and ordered the orange case. The orange case is true in color.
 The only thing that bugs me about this case is that there is a 'loop' for mounting a lanyard to the phone case right in the corner.  And it happens to be on the corner that would normally go on the bottom when the phone is in the clip. Because of this, I have to flip the phone end for end before snapping it into the belt clip.  I know, "That's TERRIBLE John!"  "You poor thing!  How can you make it through the day without wanting to just give up on life?"  I get it.  I also agree.  If that is the only thing to complain about, then it's pretty solid.  I would definitely buy one again.
 Aesthetically, this case is fun and futuristic looking! I bought the white one, and I love it!<br/>As far as the protective aspect, I feel like my expensive phone is now wrapped in all the protection it needs. I couldn’t wait to switch from the “book” style magnetic case I initially had. It did nothing to protect my iPhone 7plus.<br/>And, from an artistic standpoint, your package design is on point! I loved the black bag and the black box it arrived in. Very nice touch.
 Best case out there for iPhone 7+. I work long days in a tree nursery. A lot of heavy lifting, bending, twisting, and I'm always getting in tight spots with my phone being pushed out of it's holster or the entire holster falling off my belt. I can tell you honestly that in the week I've had this Zizo Bolt w/ holster it has really been tested. Not once has the holster left my belt and the falls to ground and cement (human error not manufacturer) this case has fully protected my iPhone. It's much lighter also than any holster I've used (and I've used many). I love it so much I'm buying another. Oh, and you can beat the price. So much efficiency and protection for so little. Thanks Zizo!
 I've had this case for several months now and it is by far the best case I have ever had. Extremely sturdy design, with the only negative being that it is very difficult to get the case off if you want to wipe your phone down at all. But otherwise, amazing case and would recommend!
 Volume button don’t line up and won’t control volume or power
 This is by far one of the best cases for the money out there hands down.  I like that they provide everything you need in a case(Clip, screen protector, stand, protection).  I have had several iPhones and cases in the 10years iPhone has been out and other than it being waterproof you don't need another case.
 Easy to install with perfect fit.
 I've had mine for a few months now and so far so good.  Dropped my iPhone a few times on the ground and my case protected the phone well.  I feel very secure having this case on my iPhone.  I would recommend to all my friends and Family.
 I recently bout the iPhone 8 Plus so of course I desperately needed a case for it. The minute I received it in the mail, I was satisfied but when I actually put it on and just so happened to drop it the minute I put it on 🤦🏾‍♀️ , I was more than satisfied. My heart skipped a beat for 2.5 seconds but it’s safe to say this case does exactly what it’s suppose to do. Not only do they provide you with a case, but it comes with a screen protector, an alcohol wipe and an actually lense/screen cleaner swatch. I’ll be ordering more but in different colors 😙.
 I was very disappointed with this purchase.<br/>I had just dropped my phone and cracked the Otterbox that was on it, so I decided to go for a strong, sturdy case that my clumsy self would not be able to break.  I specifically searched for military-grade cases, and this ZIZO case was one of the first on the list that came up.  It appeared to fully encompass the phone, and being the "Bolt Series" and appearing to have metal fasteners that held it together, I thought it would be a tough container for my expensive electronics.<br/>Wrong.<br/>It is a simple rubber shell and a piece of Gorilla Glass. Not only that, but the rubber case had a small ridge from the molding process that rubbed a raw spot on my hand while using my phone.  That ridge went the entire way around the case.  I shouldn't have to file down and buff a phone case just to make it comfortable to use.  I tried to place it into the belt clip that came with the product, but as I was adjusting the angle of the clip, the whole carry clip broke in my hand.  I tried to use the case for two weeks to get used to it but that was the final straw.  I put it all back in the box and chalk the whole bad experience up to a lesson learned.  Some products are best shopped for in person.  Phone cases are definitely one of them.
 Sooo disappointed!!! It's very difficult to put on and I can not turn it off ... the power button is so incredibly stiff . The kick stand will not open at all . I can not use this case my phone will die because the battery will drain too fast without being able to press the side power button. I am so upset.
 I was a bit concerned on how well this case would protect the phone.  After purchasing it, I was impressed with quality and sturdiness of it.  The case is very tough, and while it doesn't sport a 'military drop tested' label, it did hold up quite well in a 4-6 foot fall which I have experienced already with this case.  The belt clip is smart and works well.  The case should work with most glass screen protectors.
 I really like this Zizo case. It feels really well constructed and solid. The clip is a nice touch, but I don't use it. I'ts awesome that the screen protector is included, and everything is very easy to install. The only minor issue is that the grey backing doesn't hold perfectly to the black case in one corner, and the kickstand is a little difficult to pull out, especially the first time. These are probably not going to be a big deal AT ALL, but it does prevent me from going 5 stars. In fact, I'm almost inclined to go 5 stars anyway, because it's pretty sweet.
 This case messes with the iPhone power/sleep button....it holds my husbands button down so it goes to the power off now screen...we have 2 of these cases and both do the same....went to make a return and it seems not worth it after the email said restocking fee, plus paying for shipping....what a waste now of paying $17.99 twice(!!!!!!) and a waste of our time.
 Very nice case for the price and quality.  It is made well, and very durable for my new iPhone 7P.  It comes with a kickstand, belt clip, lanyard and glass cover.  Super awesome product.  I purchased one for my husband's iPhone 7 and he is rough on covers due to his work.  This is lasting just fine and he love it too!  Will purchase more items from this vendor!  Thank you!
 Excellent quality and great bang for buck. HOWEVER, the “tan” color. Is more or a ugly diminished gold. Only complaint is the color does not look like shown. Other then that price to quality, easily a 75-95$ case+ extras.
 After having used this for just five weeks, I can say that it has its distinct disadvantages and advantages as compared with other cases.  Disadvantages:  It simply cannot be used with Scosche Mount devices--and that is enough of a disadvantage to cause me to continue looking.  The lanyard design is brilliant, but the fine string broke after a month.
 Love this case! Nice quality, looks very nice.  My only suggestion would be having the angle of the ribs on the back go the opposite direction, which would make the phone easier to hold for right handed people
 Not what we expected, says it’s very durable. It’s very thin. Not enough protection
 I was in need of a new phone case for my work phone.  Due to the type of job I have I needed something very protective.  It seems like it’s made out of strong durable materials.  I love the color options too. So far so good.
 A good slim fit for my iPhone 7 Plus. I love the tempered glass that comes with the case. The case does look cool and the holster works fine. I returned the otter box defender case as it was easy too bulky and heavy. I gave this a 4 due to where the lanyard attaches ( upper top of the case), this makes the phone only go in the holster only one way which annoys me. Other than that I'm very pleased.
 Should have know. That this thing would not fit 6 through 8S. 🤦🏻‍♀️  I ordered for 7/8S. Received one that is clearly packaged for 6/7S. Return in progress. Seems sturdy enough but that’s all I can say. Very disappointing.
 Fits phone correctly, buttons are responsive however the flip out stand looks like it will be broken soon. The stand slide pins are made out of plastic and the thickness of a sewing needle. They need parts that move to be made out of metal
 This is by far the best iPhone case, rugged n durable. Good gripping, originally tried a clear case n came back to Zizo. As a mechanic n handy man I’m tough on products, Zizo thank you for making a product that’s easy to wipe clean, durable n affordable. Adding a tempered glass shield Rocks!
 Barely used and it’s already cracked and falling apart. I bought one before for my iPhone 7 that I liked from them but this one is crap!
 This was a great cover. I am a long time Ballistic and Otterbox cover user. The ribbed texture gave good grip especially with such a big phone. I ended up returning the phone and the seller sent me a return label to return the cover too even without the original box. Great service. Thank you.
 Love the case. Fits my IPhone 7 plus well and looks great. I expected more bulk because this was protective, but I'm so happy this still looks feminine. The rose color is a perfect match to my phone.  I did notice that there is an opening on the bottom left that looks like the case was intended for a different phone model.  The only thing I would change would be the clip. Like other cases, the clip only fits the phone with the face of the phone covered. I would definitely order  again.
 The only thing preventing me from really LOVING this case is the way the front cover attaches.  It requires a two-hand removal process.  I wish it was more of a sliding-removal for the case, instead as this would make it much easier to handle.  Otherwise, the case and materials are actually pretty amazing for the $20 I paid, and that includes a hard-glass screen protector.  I would definitely buy another case from Zizo in the future should I need one.
 I had to modify part of it to work with the buttons on my phone I have an iPhone a plus that’s what it’s made for I opened to get the screen cover to put on it it shattered and fill in the pieces let’s just say I won’t be buying from this company again so far Amazon on how to make their money it’s all junk
 Very disappointed when I placed the  iPhone 8plus in the case. The Apple logo is way off center and the space for the logo to show is smaller. I hope the green one coming tomorrow is not the same as I will be returning it. Are these made by someone else ? May have to order direct from Zizo
 The side button to turn off the iphone did not work plus the "tempered glass" screen protector is too thick and prevents some touch screen functions from working properly.  The screen protector problem is not really an issue and I wish that I just could have contacted the seller directly.  Now I have to waste time returning a $20 item to Amazon.
 THE BEST COVER FOR IPHONE I BOUGHT SO FAR THIS IS WAY ON ANOTHER LEVEL OF PROTECTION.GREAT PRODUCT AMAZING FINISH AND VARIETY OF COLORS TO PICK FROM,KEEPING THIS ONE IS A MOST.THANKS
 This case was a disappointment for my iPhone 8 Plus. 1. A part of the belt clip came broken. 2. Once I put it on my phone, the Apple logo on the back was too low and looked weird. 3. The on/off button does not work while in the case. The case as a button cover that is too thick and doesn't work on the phone. I'm sure this might be a great case for the 6 plus, but it is obvious that it wasn't made for the 8 Plus.<br/><br/>I found a case at 5 Below that I think is better quality and half the price.
 Ive owned it a year, still love the durability of this case and I have dropped my phone MANY times without any damage to the phone.<br/><br/>Kickstand broke with normal wear tho after about 6 months. Doesn’t affect the case in any way and I still love it.
 My husband loves this. He had the camel color for awhile and the clip broke. Ordered this one and he said the design was an upgrade. Color is great. He has the dark gray now. Fits on his gun belt perfectly at work.
 Phone case is nice but belt clip is all wrong. You can put it in there only one way and that way is backward. If you are right handed put the phone from your ear to the clip you have to turn it around instead of put it upside down.
 This case does not fit an IPhone 8 Plus correctly. When I reported it they told me to take a picture of the phone in the case......someone please explain......the phone was used for the picture. That was not possible. Bought a black for a friend’s iPhone 7plus it fit perfect.
 Great Phone Case, was a little rough getting on the phone, but finally got it. It looks sharp.<br/><br/>Now, for the weak little kickstand they put on the back of the phone case, you could have done without it, but it does work!<br/><br/>The Protective face cover, is already starting to come off and from past experience, these should last longer than a week. Just not looking to spending $30 for a good face protector.
 YOUR ADVERTISEMENT STATES Zizo Bolt Series iPhone 8 Plus/7 Plus Case - Tempered Glass Screen Protector with Holster and 12ft Military Grade Drop Tested (Black &amp; Neon Green) BUT THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED DOES NOT STATE IPHONE 8PLUS. WILL THIS CASE FIT THE 8/PLUS.
 I wouldn’t waste my money. It’s not the worse case you could buy but I would spend the extra money on a more durable brand. My husband and I’ve had ours for a little over a week. His glass protector broke while he was cleaning it, and the stand on the back has already broken on both of ours.
 This case broke after one drop.  From about 6 inches off the ground.  Phone is fine.  But amazed at how quickly I’m buying a new case.  I literally had the case for less than a week
 First off. The ZIZO packaging says the case is for an iPhone 6 Plus, 6s plus, and 7 plus. I have an iPhone 8 Plus. This case works perfectly with an iPhone 8 Plus.<br/><br/>I have seen first hand how much abuse the phone can take while protected in a ZIZO case. That’s why I bought one.
 This case is awesome. It has a smooth and pleasant texture. I just received it so time will tell of the durability. I have been looking all over for a case that will support a Steelie tablet magnet thickness. Every case I like is too thin and the magnet just sticks out the back. When I lay it on a table to type it just rocks left and right. Now it's perfect and lays flat! Best combo ever!!
 The look of the case is the only good thing going for it.  It fits too tight on the 7 plus and puts too much pressure on the screen and the power button.  I couldn't get the kickstand to open I even tried using a butter knife.  The last straw is that my tempered glass screen protector starts peeling while the case is on.
 I Just received this case and No, I am not being paid anything for this review . So straight up, this is a high quality case with a number of items included that are usually optional on other cases. What sold me was the case and the tempered Glass screen cover all in one. I won't use the holster as I carry this in a breast pocket of my suit most days, but is have it just in case. This case is very durable and looks great . I bought the "Electron Blue" version and the color looks great in person. So, if you are looking for a hell of a value for twenty bucks or so, this is a steal and you should buy it. You won't be disappointed.
 So far so good. I bought the case blindly and without knowing anything about the case. I must have read hundreds of reviews from different manufacturers and suppliers regarding their cases. After must hesitation I finally made the decision and purchased the case. After I received the case I was impressed but what I had selected. The case was a little difficult to put on however once I got it one I really liked the way the case felt in my hands. I have already dropped the phone a few times, and the case barely had any scratches. I like the case. So far so good.
 Got this case today. Yes it's very rugged, and a super tight fit. I had the same issues as others when I came to my power button.  It wouldn't work correctly.  I think that the plastic case is so tight that it's not allowing the rubber part to touch the buttons properly.  After an hour I picked it back up and it seems that the power button is working but not the volumes now.  Let that stop 10 minutes later.....I'm going to give it 24 hours, and if I still have this issue it's going back to Amazon !  Also yes it is built for the 6S plus. Very misleading.
 I did not like this. it was not for a I phone 7 plus. and the power button was to small and tight that when it is put on it constantly hits the power button.  I have already bought a new one. I'm so mad I will up date with pictures later. also the temperature glass sucks it is to small and cover only the small edge of the display not the entire front of the phone.
 The case arrived on time.  It was as described.  Looks good, fits well, and protects the phone.  The belt clip holds the phone and case securely but is a little bulky for my taste.  But I like that I can use it if I need it.  I really like the glass screen protector that came with the package.  Overall, you can't beat this for the price compared to Otterbox. I also like the built-in kickstand!
 Husband loves it for his new phone. He's a truck driver who has to carry his own load. His phone's take quite a beating. So he needs a very durable case that seems to do the trick.
 We had two of these before and they were GREAT!<br/>This time, for the 7plus, they were trash.  Not impressed.<br/>I would try them if you haven't before, I just didn't have luck this time around.
 Durable, cute case yet: Kickstand broke first day; cover for power button fit snug so phone kept going into sleep mode (now I have too use my nail to power on/off); purchased a white case but now it looks light red since anything with color has rubbed off on it.
 Absolutely love this case.<br/>Only one fault, but I fixed it.<br/>The piece of plastic that covers the On/Off switch on the right of the phone wouldn't press in far enough to activate the button.<br/>I removed the piece of plastic with a small knife and can reach in with my finger to turn the phone on and off.<br/>Other than that, it's a really good case!!<br/>I've dropped my phone a few times and the case has protected it very well.
 Love this case - received compliments since I put it on my iPhone 7 plus - It protect without all the bulk of the other brands - it fits prefect with all the openings in the right places - When using the clip you only have the option of covering the phones face. If the clip could be clipped on so the face was up (so you could see it) I would have given it 5 stars - but this is not a deal breaker - I still love it.
 I like the case a lot...and when they say it like the iPhone 6plus case they are right the left side of the case is for like a iPhone 6 Plus. I do like the case though. The shield protector I did not put on I got one from the store I bought my phone from because I know that screen protector works and keeps my phone from getting a broken screen and has a lifetime warranty with it. But I honestly love the case so far I have only had it on for a couple days I do like the clip on back to prop it up and the lanyard because I do it of dirt bike videoing with my phone so that will work perfect to have it connected to me. Other then it can fit a iPhone 6 and I am not sure on the screen protector it is pretty decent case otherwise.
 So I've droppEd my phone a couple of times with this case and haven't had any problems. Nothing broken, until today. Dropped my phone and didn't think to check it and later noticed that there was a crack! I immediately started freaking out thinking I broke my phone screen. Decided to take off the screen protector that came with the case and it was only the screen protector that was broken. Totally worth the money for the case and screen protector. In fact I'm going to order another case just for the screen protector!
 Nice case. Seems very sturdy. Too bad had to return. Not cutout for iPhone 7 Plus. Came without the Tempered Glass Protector. Seller was very nice in offering to send one. Will definitely get one of these cases when one is available for iPhone 7 Plus! Can't wait. I have a 9 year old that can abuse a phone in matter of seconds...
 Hubby ordered this for his iPhone 7... like others said, it's a 6 Plus case that will fit a 7. He too had issues with the case squeezing the power button, so he had to shave off some of the inside of the power button off of the case. Overall, he's happy with it. It looks nice, functions well, and he likes the kickstand for when he's watching videos.
 Just received it and it thin plastic cheep this is not worth the money I am sorry I bought this
 Great case. I’d like it better if the case would have holes in both sides, so the phone could fit it the holster either way. This is my second case, only bought another because I got a new phone, the case wasn’t worn out.
 Bought it for my brother who loves the design but wished that the belt clip swiveled like his old one. Unfortunately the clip ended up breaking but I think that's more because of his line of work. It might not be super heavy-duty resilient, but for casual, daily use it's sturdy enough. The look and design is absolutely awesome though and definitely the main selling-point.
 Very awkward feeling with the spiral grips. It appears to be bulletproof but I returned it an got another brand. Also, it didn’t fit my iPhone 8 Plus like it should.
 I love the kickstand, it's great for watching movies and other streaming services. The little loop or strap that comes with it is unnecessary and takes away from a streamline appearance of the case, because of the added need for the loop. My son, actually broke the strap shortly after I installed it just by pulling on it. I never use the belt clip, the case in sleek enough to fit right in my back pocket. Overall a tough and durable product at a great price.
 This is my third phone case from Zizo.  I break the clip on a regular basis.<br/>This case however does not fit my phone and the belt clip does not work well with the case. I will be sending this one back
 Otterbox watch out!!! This case is awesome not bulky but very protective and for the price no one can beat it!! Will definitely order again when I need a new phone!
 I installed my new case from Zizo and LOVE it. The tempered glass<br/>that comes with it works great and the case and belt clip are designed to<br/>function well. It also comes with a strap and clip to the phone case that<br/>you can use to hang it from or just identifying it in a case. It is great for<br/>the price and I highly recommend it.
 Great case, it fell while I was riding my motorcycle cycle because of my own error not the case and my phone was perfectly fine. Now my other friends that ride have all ordered this case. The only thing is the stand is a little hard to pull out put I don't watch tv or videos that often on my phone so it doesn't really affect me
 I really liked the look and feel of this case, but it broke after 5 days light use. Never dropped or abused but the kickstand broke off for no reason while watching a movie
 Great iPhone protection at a reasonable price.  Not a huge footprint like some other product... so it isn’t bulky.  I really like the texture... not slick like some other cases.  I recommend it!
 The case itself is very nice. My only complaints are that the rubber that covers that buttons for volume and power are so stiff you can not physically press them down enough to make them function. I took an Xzacto knife and removed them which means I now have to poke a fingernail down into the resulting hole to make them work but they are functional again. My other complaint is that the glass cover makes it much more difficult to get the Home button to function easily - although this could just be my inexperience with using that type of screen protector.
 I am content. Easy to install and remove. I use it at work unclipping it from my belt 5 to 10 Times in a day. I’ve dropped it on finished cement a few times and its protected my phone. I like the style, color, and durability.
 Why would I pay an Otterbox price ever again now that I’ve found Zizo? The answer? I won’t! Packaging was perfect. Delivery prompt. Product exactly what they advertised. Design of this protector is on point! Amazing quality for this price and they even tossed in a lanyard! I love it and I’ll be back for more!
 The fit of this case was terrible and part of it kept hitting the power button which turned the phone on and off repeatedly. The volume buttons did not work appropriately. After having this problem, we reviewed the other 1-star ratings and realized we were not the only one experiencing this - should have read them before purchasing.
 Case worked great until last week when the clip holding the phone in the holster just broke off.  Maybe life expectancy for this is not much greater then a year?
 this case is great for somebody who likes to have a grip on the phone without super bulky cases. I use a hard case when out in the field but for  everyday I didn’t want a super bulky phone case anchoring me down. Works well for my purposes. Not to mention the color options were nice since it is very frustrating not being able to have some choice in colors or options. Also the belt clip holster was not a bad touch I would rate it close to if not better than the otter box holsters that I’m used to using.
 This case is beautiful,,I’ve purchased like 6 in 2 weeks and this one def looks the best. Came with a free lanyard and screen protector also. Feels so durable too. Most iPhone case who holes on the back so the Apple symbol can show and a lot of cases have the wholes poorly positioned,,,but this one has it positioned perfectly. Case was like $20,,,definitely worth it
 Ordered it because it said it would fit the 7 plus iPhone. It was such a tight fit that the volume control button stayed pushed and the screen sleep button wouldn’t work. While trying to adjust it to fit the sleep button cover fell off and a corner cracked. Design is cool but it needs just a hair to fit snugly but not to snugly around the iPhone 7
 It was an okay Case but the kickstand broke pretty fast on it. Had to upgrade to something different. I use my phone as a Netflix device a lot.
 I work in public safety and I need a rugged type case. I have used several different popular brands and much more expensive brands and I seem to always break the clip to the belt. So far I am very happy, impressed and very satisfied with my Zizo rugged case. Clip is intact and the phone feels very secure in the case. Very satisfied customer.
 If you are looking for a case that has a kickstand this is not the case for you.  Yes, it does have a kickstand but the moment I put the kickstand up it broke.  I like the look but cheaply made.
 This is the second time I have ordered this same case for my husband and the clip on this case has broke both time. He has only had this for 2 months and it’s already broke.
 So far so good! I think this case is better designed than the otter box, I haven't had any issues yet and have dropped my phone multiple times from multiple heights and not any issues, daughter had otter box and her phone got destroyed and otter box did not stand behind their warranty, this item is not as bulky as I thought it would be, but I'm very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing a few more for the husband and my business phone!!!
 have been using this phone cover for some time - for the most part i replaced an otter box cover with this.. for the price it does just as well as the high dollar cover - Only thing that I dont care for is the phone will only clip in one way into the holder.
 This phone case is very comfortable to hold and look to be very well built but I have to returned to Amazon because none of the 3 buttons work. It’s very disappointing to say the least.
 Based upon customer reviews, I ordered this case for my iPhone 8 Plus.  It fits perfectly and is fully functional.  Easy to hold and obvious protection.... You will not be disappointed with this choice.
 Ordered this for iPhone 8 Plus, as it says in description that it fits, and it was made for iPhone 7S. Tried to put in case just Incase it was for both phone types and it was so tight it would press down all buttons on sides and didn’t line up correctly with iPhone 8 features.
 It's not very protective. It's cost effective, I suppose. A $500 dollar, plus or minus $100, should probably be ensconced inside a foolproof case such as LifeProof or Otter, something that will protect your phone when that 3 foot drop occurs.
 I wish I would've got this for my phone. Ordered for my husband and he absolutely loved it. It's very protective comes with the back piece that you can clip to yourself or anywhere. The color is really nice too!
 Yet again the kick stand in the back broke!! I printed out the return ticket but was delayed a few days and missed the opportunity to return this, very disappointing for an almost $20 case.
 The price was good for the quality and the contents. Not enough clear instructions on attaching the glass.  I wound up not being able to use my glass as it took too many times and by then I had bubbles under the glass.  When I purchased the case I was really hoping for a more rubbery case so that it would be slip resistant.
 This does not fit the iPhone 7 plus properly and is too narrow causing pressure on the power button
 The case comes as described. I like that it's thin and came with a glass screen protector. The built in kick stand is perfect. The company provides a variety of colors. The grib is not a hard cheap plastic but a soft plastic. When I have my 7 plus in my pocket, I hardly know and mostly forget it's there. Also the red color is what I picked, I love it.
 I think this is a great case,however,the clip on the holster broke,( it was like the second time I wore it on my hip)amazon sent me another whole unit and said they would credit my account,as soon as they do I’ll return the other one.i wish you could just get replacement clips.that would save a lot of hassle possibly.otherwise a great product.I would recommend it.
 THIS IS THE BEST CASE I HAVE EVER HAD<br/>MY SECOND<br/>BOUGHT NEW PHONE<br/><br/>You do have to buy the glass front.  But they are a couple bucks.  Then you can count on 100% protection
 This case looks awesome, feels good in the hand, and the screen protector fits perfectly. I had some issues with a case but I contacted Zizo through their website and they sent me a replacement. Their customer service was top notch. No complaints and I'm a very satisfied customer! I highly recommend these cases.
 The two types of plastic do not fit all that great. Straight out of the box it was pulling apart. I do not want to mess with sending it all back so i gusee ill just try to super glue it.
 This case is very well made and seems to be very durable. It's been dropped a few times already and has held up very well. The kickstand is great, very convenient for watching movies on your phone or just propping it up on your desk. I recommend buying this if you're looking for a durable case for your new iPhone.
 I could not be any happier with the case.It is everything that was advertised and more.It fits my Iphone 6 plus like a glove.money well spent and i would not hesitate to order again in the future.
 I like it, but like other reviews I don’t think it was designed for the iPhone 8plus...prob the 7plus. The apple symbol on the back isn’t centered, but doesn’t bother me too much, just the fact that if this was for an 8plus it would be centered. The case is tight and feels good, but the power button feels a little funny when using it now. BUT I got the black and it does look pretty cool.
 Power button is absolutely unusable and as such it pretty much renders my phone useless when ever it is in this case.  The button is just too hard to press down. It fails to register whenever I press it. I have to push down extremely hard to get it to register and when it does since I have to push so hard it try to turn of the phone. I am really disappointed in this case.
 I have tried 5 of these cases for on my 7 Plus. Only one has worked, which unfortunately is the one I got for my dad. I know it's not my phone because I have tried over 4 different brand cases and they all work. This is the issue that others are having, "the cover over my iPhone 7+ side power switch put a consrant pressure on the switch so that it could not be used. Even after putting the case on and off several times I could not resolve the problem"<br/>I was told some of the cases were defective. I finally got a return case that worked, my dad's,. So I thought I would buy one in the color that i liked now that they seem to have fixed the issue. Nope, came with the same issue. Now I have to return another one. They come in 2 days with prime, takes over 2 weeks for exchanges to be complete.
 The product came when my car broke ... including the belt clip. I just paid $ 22 for an inferior product
 Kick stand is cheap.  It doesn't work well. I also have no idea what it comes with a loop at the top of the case. Why would anyone want to strap it? The power button is hard to push and doesn't turn off the phone. Basically overall this case is not engineered with quality. I expected more.
 It is functional and black which my husband likes. I am personally disappointed that on the 8+ the circle on the back is not directly over the Apple icon like in the picture. He doesn’t care but my OCD tendencies kick in when I look at it.
 buyer beware.  right off the bat you can see this isnt for and iphone 8 plus.  apple logo doesnt lign up on back of case at all.  the buttons on the sides dont lign up so you cant control the volume or turn your phone on/off.  waste of money and time.  returning asap.
 My only issue is the temered glass doean't go all the way to the edge of the case, so it leaves an opening completely around the edge of the screen which catches lots of dust and debris ,  I like the durability of the case and the optional lanyard and the kick stand.
 Great feel to the case in your hand. Seems very well made and think it will offer great protection. It is a little bulky, but that goes with the whole look.<br/><br/>The lanyard hook is a good idea, but would rather that piece not be there.  Just to slim it down a touch.<br/><br/>Overall I love the look and think a great value.
 Horrible buy this was arrived as expected but did not come with the glass and the belt clip won’t even snap on the case,stay away from this seller!
 Outer case is broken after only 5 weeks of use.  Bought for 2 phones at one time and the red and black cover is still ok but the Gold case for my wife's phone already needs replacing.  I am ten days out of the warranty period that starts on the day you order??  No help from Amazon or Zizo... Buy some other brand!!
 The case is awesome. I have several. They are my absolute favorite. I have had many different kinds. The only thing that I don’t like is the belt clip keeps breaking. I have had 5 different clips that have broken.
 I like it okay. I got this so I could clip my phone to my purse so I could get to it more easily. I can never find my phone in my purse...so this does make it easier, the holder itself does not have a window for the camera.  you have to take it out of the holder to take pictures...that was another drawback. so we cut a whole into it, and it is fine now.
 This $900 phone now feels secure.  Easy to see and find with the orange case.  Attachments are helpful (removable clip &amp; lanyard).  Good so far after 2 months.
 For protecting the phone, it's great. The iPhone 7 Plus fits inside a tetra polyurethane soft case, which is inside a polycarbonate hard case. A kickstand is integrated into the hard case. Installing the included tempered glass screen protector only took about five minutes. The iPhone 7 Plus is too big to carry in your pocket but the Zizo package includes a lanyard which works well. I did have one problem. The first time I turn the rotatable belt clip (with 360 degree swivel), it  broke. I can still use the belt holster as additional protection, but I cannot clip it to a belt.
 The previous reviews were extremely helpful and accurate. The case was exactly how the description said it was . It feels well and snug and is very sturdy. love the color .
 I bought this case because of the phone Clip I took it out of the package and the belt clip is broke. Box was crushed. The case is perfect, but I could have purchased any case but I don’t have the belt clip I needed for work. It must be cheaply made or someone returned it.
 This is a cute phone case and it protects my phone great, but as soon as I got it it started to get dirty and would not clean off, it is very porous and holds the filth in, after just a week it was gross. I even used a toothbrush and soft scrub with bleach but it would not come clean. EW
 Nice setup. case is grippy without being sticky. I haven't had the phone come out of the holder yet, I do experience some difficulty freeing the phone sitting in the truck though because of the seatbelt. You might want to remove the phone before you sit down.
 I have bought this Product 3 times the first time it  came opened with missing pieces so I return 2. Time I received the wrong size . 3finally everything came complete and I'm satisfied , but was way to much of a hassle for a damm case if my dad didn't want it I wouldn't have bothered after the first .
 This is a very heavy duty case, and it's a snug fit and fits my iPhone 7 like a glove.  This case is loaded with shock absorbers so if your looking for ultimate protection this is the case for you.  And why shouldn't you want that ? Buying this case is a small investment in protection your very expensive smart phones.  Not only does this phone case protect the phone but you can keep it in your pocket or clip it to your belt.  Then finally my favorite part about this phone is the heavy duty kick stand which is nice to have if you stream movies from your phone
 I love  this case.  I owned various iterations of iPhones for many years and I was never happy with the cases I had including cases from Apple. This is the first case I got which meets all my requirements. Thank you.
 This case is good.  The only issue is that with the iPhone 8 Plus the power button does not work.  It is irritating as they are close to lining up.  I have tried to adjust the phone in the case, but no luck.  It is a good case other than this one, but important, issue.
 I just got my case today, the asthetics of the case are great, but when i went to put it on, it was very difficult to fit the phone in it. Once i managed to cram it in, the power button would not work. It took a lot of force to engage the buttons on either side. Looks great but not functional whatsoever.
 My husband is in maintenance and was needing a super durable phone case that he can depend on to wear on his hip or on his chest ( he mostly wears coveralls) he loves it mainly because how slim &amp; durable it is. The color is true as as shown &amp; other maintenance guys complemented on it
 I'm loving this case for my iPhone. I would buy a otterbox but I don't like the screen on the front of it. It puts a gap between your finger and the phone. You can't text with that! This one projects my phone from drops and I can clearly use my text..
 This case fits my phone perfectly, all buttons and ports are perfectly aligned. Quality case and screen cover.  Love the color too, helps me easily find my phone which I’m always misplacing in dark places.
 Phone case broke when simply taking the phone off the case and have been unable to reach company to discuss lifetime warranty. I have made multiple attempts via email and phone calls.
 Item came on time. Overall, the look and feel as good as other pricey competitors. However, to my disappointment the holster clip was easily broken. I don’t know what just happened. I’ve never dropped my new iPhone 8plus but somehow it did. See pic...
 Bought it for my husband. He has an iPhone 7Plus.  He wanted a case that could take a beating, looked nice and good texture. He is very satisfied with the case...the included screen protector is icing on the cake!
 If anyone is looking for a great I mean  EPIC phone case this is the one I've tried them all I have a iPhone 7 plus and it's just everything it says it should be and then some get it
 The stand on the back did not even last 2 months.
 I like the screen protector that fits wonderfully, the kick stand that's convenient, and the clip that makes this product a very nice complete package!
 My bf &amp; i got a new iphone 8 plus and i bought this case for him. The case arrived earlier than expected, in a very nice box and my bf loves it. His phone is well protected and the case is not that expensive. Its really worth it!!!
 awesome case excellent shipping speed. i am somewhat an expert on cases lol i've been thru many and i've shopped intensely and constantly looking for that one case that has everything i want in one this one was it. for the price i was surprised by the quality you can tell this case was designed and produced by people who still believe in quality without paying thru the nose. i love it.
 I wanted a case for my iPhone 7 plus that looked great and would protect it from a 2 year old grandson. This is it! I'm not careless with my phone but this kid grabs everything and throws it. Several bounces off both carpet and hard wood floors and my phone and the case are perfect. Ty!!! Excellent pricing, too!
 Excellent case. It was super easy to put together. Looks great and works well the cheap price. Don’t read the bad reviews I have no idea what they are talking about.
 I ordered the Zizo case in gold &amp; I love it!  It was easy to get my phone into, and it feels super sturdy.  It is really a statement piece!  I get asked all the time where I got it.  Shipping was quick and packaging was great.
 Very stylish and durable are some of the qualities I like about this particular iphone case. Great price and it comes with a free tempered glass screen protector. No hassles easy to apply. I am greatly satisfy with this iphone case.
 I was expecting a dust prof case.  It doesn't even cover the charging port. And the case compresses the sleep / wake button so it doesn't work correctly
 It looks cool but it doesn't fit.  I know I ordered the right model case, but it is too tight by just the tiniest bit, so that I cant get it on, and if I try to force it then it will smash the power button or the volume buttons.  I gave up trying to force it when I started to worry about damaging the phone.
 On my last iPhone I had a Lifeproof case. Since they did not have one available for the iPhone 7+ when mine arrived I thought I would try this. If I didn't like it I could send it back or just be out the $20.<br/><br/>So far I really like it. As long as my phone does not break it serves its purpose...and I saved $60 over the lifeproof.
 This is my second case/holder I purchased. Mcase got hooked on a piece of equipment at work and broke the clip on the holder. The phone fell about 4 feet, not a scratch or crack on the phone or case. Very satisfied with my purchase.
 The product is nice but I feel the warranty should be extended to whoever purchas the product. Because you allows amonzon to help you to sell your product. And to be quite frank if it wasn't for amonzon I wouldn't have even seen your product. So I feel it don't matter where you brought it from them/you. The customer should still be able to have the warranty the same as if I purchased it from your website now that I know you have one thanks to amonzon.
 Case is overall OK.  The "Glass" cracked within a week of getting the case as it is very thin.  I had to place an order for a glass protector from another vendor as the one that came with it had a large scratch on day 2 without having dropped the phone.  I do see the problem that others report around the power button which tends to get pressed quite regularly.
 I really like this case has nice solid feel to it great pop of color I feel my phone is safe I have even used the cord that comes with it  to place my phone around my neck when my hands are full. Great product at a great value!
 Bought it in April 2018, still like new,  Really good strong case well built and offers excellent protection, my friends think it is a very expensive phone case.!!!
 Beautiful nice sturdy case, but right button is unaligned. Protectective glass shield too small. Kick stand, cover, phone case is very durable,  great package. I would order again once they fix the one defective power  button on case the case which is a disappointment  because I otherwise love the case .
 This is the second case I had. I got one for my iPhone 6 and now for my iPhone 8 Plus. I like that it comes in various colors. It’s durable and it fits to size. The down size is the Clip. The Clip is cheaply made and not durable but I just bought the case and I’m not one to clip my phone on my side.
 great case, the only problem is the hole for the apple logo is not center.
 Love this case.  I loved the old style otterbox but they are now not as protective like they used to. Base this on Amazon and bought it.  Love it.  Tight fit but it is an outstanding product.  Very happy.
 Like:Looks cool and drop it couple time and protects. The screen protector works well.<br/>Dislike: the kickstand broke very easily after a couple of days and was hard to get out
 I have one for my iPhone 7 Plus, and I love it so much and it’s the absolute best deal out there for a dual layer cover that COMES WITH an actual glass screen protector.  I have dropped my phone (orange case) many times, and it has protected it.  So I bought another for my GF’s iPhone 8 Plus and it fits and works perfectly.
 I like this product because price is reasonable, its very protective and its cool looking. I have several colors of them.
 Most excellent in every way imaginable. Color, design and durability. Everyone compliments and wants to know where I got it.
 Clip broke the first day
 Case is great. Built very well! Only problem was, the piece that presses the power button is poorly made. I had to completely cut it off.  It's an inconvenience… But one that I'm willing to live with. Simply because this case protect my phone very well.
 Two piece case and glass screen protector also all in one I’ve had for a min dropped many times and no problems has kick stand also
 I bought this case for my husband and he has a love/hate relationship with it. It's great quality, however it is SO HARD to remove from the phone. This would be great if you were looking to never remove your phone case, but he damaged it when he needed to remove it. Such a bummer.
 At first I was unsure because you have to slide your phone into it &amp; it’s not a front &amp; back type case, but I actually like it. It works great &amp; it feels secure. I would recommend it to anyone.
 I love this thing! It seems quite durable but looks good too. I searched aa long time for a cover that would keep my phone safe and look good doing so. I like the fact that it is different from all the othes!
 I am so glad I found this product. I had been looking for a case for a while and purchased one that was of no use. I came upon this one and purchased it. It is amazing. It has protected my phone from both my children. I would buy it again if need be.
 Good case, waiting to see how the holster holds out.  With an iPhone 6s Plus being larger and catching on things I always break the holsters that attach to the belt.  Will give it time.
 Way to bulky, drop tested and cracked.  I put in for a refund, but Amazon can't honor it.  I has to go through Zizo so it takes awhile.  I'm not going to bother returning it.  There is a $5 re-stocking fee, plus I pay for the shipping.  So after everything is said and done i'll get half my money back.
 I like to look and feel. It looks very sturdy but unfortunely my new phone won't fit in it. Three sales rep from Tmobile store tried to put the phone inside the case but to no avail. I ended buying their very expensive case becuase I dont want to leave the store without a case to protect my phone.
 Awesome price and great case. The kickstand works perfect and I use it everyday to watch shows on amazon prime. The case is a b***h to put on and take off though. Also, the belt clip is stupid and trash worthy. Just throw that piece away.
 Case holster broke under normal wear.
 Look just like the picture had it a couple months and still in bed shape,  I would download from this company.
 This item is a great iPhone 8 Plus case, it was easy to get my iPhone 8 Plus into this case &amp; I like the design &amp; the anti-slip grip of this case.
 Just a quick review.  It's really an IPhone 6 Plus case and is very nice with a few exceptions.<br/><br/>- It completely seals the top speakers.<br/>- the screen protector doesn't cover the lit  part of the screen.<br/>- the kickstand is a nail buster to get open!!
 Worst phone case ever, too tight on power button, back snapped of immediately. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
 Was very excited about this product and also came in sooner than expected that's why I'm rating it a 2  but it does not properly fit the iPhone 7 plus the volume button works great but power does not. Have to wait for it to automatically lock itself  and can not take screenshots
 The case is a great design that’s why I bought it!! I have one major issue though, I opened the box and went to check the kickstand but it the brace inside the kickstand was broken so I can barley use it and when I do the angle is not right. I still like the the case just that one problem
 Excellent protection. I ordered Plus by mistake so exchanged it for the regular iPhone 8 size, which is identical. Perfect fit, very sturdy, and the belt clip is easy to use, or not.
 Ok, I would have gave it 5 stars but the clip holder broke so easily in one day. Plus I had to carve some of the power switch area because if was too tight on my iPhone 7 plus and kept shutting down. But once I carved it down...this case is awesome and looks great.
 This case would be good if only it was for an iPhone 7 plus. It's not at all. It's like they took the iPhone 6 Plus tag off and put a 7 on it just to make a sale. Sent mine back. Btw, the 6 plus and 7 plus are the same size but the ports don't match. This case covered my camera on my 7 plus.
 I love that this is a slim but seemingly protective case.  I love the easily installed screen protector and the color and texture of the case is great!  The little kickstand pops open, I was going to return it for another and did not want to completely disassemble.
 I love the case.  It is easy to pick up and hold with my arthritic hands. I gave it one less star because the film covering the screen needs to be a little bigger to cover the entire front.  Would recommend it to anyone
 I absolutely love this case. I had the black red case for my iPhone 7 and it was awesome and kept my phone in perfect shape for a trade in for my new and current phone iPhone 7 plus. I bought this case again for my iPhone 7 plus this time, and the delivery and service was perfect, but I just have two complaints with it.<br/><br/>1) Myself being innovative and great at improvising, this wasn't the most annoying problem, but it definitely needs attention. I have the iPhone 7 plus. The case I received is obviously for the iPhone 6 as evidenced by the headphone jack opening on the case. That's ok, however, the case was just ever so slightly tight for the phone, constantly depressing the lock button on the side of the phone, not allowing me to lock/unlock my phone and causing it to take screen shots every time I pressed the home button. To fix it, I just took the case apart and cut off the little plastic/rubber ridge on the inside of the case's lock button. Works like a charm now, but for some people, this could be a turning point that causes them to send it back and write a nasty review. I advise fixing that or even better, specially design a case for the iPhone 7 plus.<br/><br/>2) This is a minor issue that really doesn't bother me too bad, but does get on my nerves at the right instance. The phone case has a kickstand that flips out the back, which is super convenient for watching videos, movies, and playing games. However, unless you have finger nails made of steel, you're not pooping that thing open. When it was new, I actually had to use a knife to pry it open, but over time it wears down a bit, now only requiring a paper clip or anything small enough to wedge under there and pry it open. Either way, finger nails absolutely will not do it, atleast not mine that's for sure.<br/><br/>Besides those things, this phone case is fantastic. It's protected my phone from several impacts against pavement and tile floor. The temper glass definitely does its job in protection, the case looks flat out amazing and sharp, and the lanyard makes pulling the case out of tight pockets super easy and retrieving my phone from the pesky crack between my vehicle seat and console is a breeze with the lanyard. Love this case and highly advise it.
 Very nice phone case. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the case because I thought it was going to make an already big phone too big. That is not the case at all. I've had an Otter Box on an old phone and I wasn't all that crazy about it. And after seeing a friend's iPhone 6 Plus with an Otter Box, I decided "absolutely not". Way too big!<br/><br/>This Bolt case is well made, with seemingly tough materials and it feels good in the hands and doesn't make it fell like a rubber brick. Plus, it looks awesome! And for the price?!? You can't beat it.<br/><br/>My phones tend to see their fair share of abuse short of breakage, so we'll see how well this case holds up over time. But as of now, I'm thoroughly impressed and satisfied.
 Loved the color, loved the case, worked well for iPhone 7 plus. The screen cover though wouldn't Stay on the phone so we had to look for something different on that.
 Great phone case. I bought it and the holster cracked. I notified the seller and had a new one sent to me at no cost within 3 days. This is the best phone case I have ever owned!.
 My case has cracked. The part where it’s supposed to help it stand up broke off. I purchased this because I can be a bit clumsy at times. My phone hasn’t cracked. However it’s almost time to buy a new case and I’ll look elsewhere
 This is a very good case. I'd actually give it 4.25 starts. They lose a 1/2 start for the stand. It works good but it would be even better if it also worked in portrait mode. The 1/4 point loss comes from the nub in upper left corner. It's there to attach a strap but how often do you need that? It's a tiny bit annoying that it's there.
 This iPhone case is very nice. It looks good and fits good and seems to be very burable. It is also very comfortable to hold in your hand. The price is amazing for a good quality iPhone case.
 So far so good! All 5 stars for now. I’ll update if needed. Good fast service and it fits my iPhone 7 Plus.<br/><br/>Update after a week of owning case it fell apart sending back for return.
 Bought for my husbands IPhone 7 plus, he likes it so far, screen protector was fairly simple to install, but would be easier if it had an alignment device so you don't have to worry with getting it straight or getting bubbles underneath it! He likes the color and seems to be good so far, we will see if it holds up!
 This was for me and I love it it matches my rose old phone..  The kickstand is a little hard to get out but I guess that means it should last awhile.  Thank you!
 Really like this case. Looks nice. So far has kept my phone protected. The only thing I wish it had was protectors for the ports.  The Apple is not exactly centered in the window on the back of the case.
 Love this case even though it’s only made to be worn on the left side, as it only has one set of clips to snap it into the holster. So glad I chose ZIZO!
 I have only had this case one day, and I have already dropped my phone from about 4 feet onto a hardwood floor...it was ok! The Zizo case protected my iPhone perfectly.  I like the lanyard attachment.
 First case lasted almost a year. I’m always dropping my phone and it hasn’t cracked. Great case. This is my second case and will keep purchasing until they stop making this case.
 Got this case for my 10yr old son. And its already prevented several disasters. He loves it and teh bright orange is helping us not lose it.
 Love the style and durability with this product. Belt clip and stand are very nice addition.<br/>And the lanyard makes a great option when you just want to hang the phone over your neck.<br/>Great price for the product!
 Had to buy another case.  As reported by other reviewers, this case would not allow me to power off.  It seemed to interfere just enough with the power button that it started to affect other actions on the phone.  I started having problems answering the phone, I could not slide to answer when a call came in.  Everything started working fine again when I changed cases.
 Got 2 for my IPhone 7Plus's - while case is nice, when put on the Iphone's on 1 we couldn't use the power button,  the other one we couldn't use the volume buttons...  I really wanted to like these, but I just can't recommend them to anyone if you can't use the functions on the phne...
 The case is alright and the belt clip is standard. However the attachment on the back that’s suppose to keep the phone upright so you can watch it broke the same day I got it. So don’t buy it for that use. Very cheap.
 Pretty ridged design that doesn't afford a lot of cushion, but overall protection seems ok.  Had to use a knife to cut out the power button or the phone would constantly want to turn off.<br/>Has a great fit other than that and I've dumped my new iPhone 7 twice without damage.
 If you like a strong case for your phone and want a holster for your belt, this is a great alternative for the price.  If you want to put your phone in your shirt pocket or some other small area, this is not the case for you.
 This does not fit. False advertisement.
 The case is good as expected, with little pain to get it on and off. Too tight a fit. Looks and feels sturdy. The screen protector with it should have been a millimeter wider on the sides of the screen, there's disturbance created in viewing with current size protector if not held perfectly centered in front.
 The company is lying by saying it's for the iPhone 8 plus. It's only for the iPhone 7 plus the hole for the camera are wrong and the screen protector was backwards
 I Love my case!!! The case is made of sturdy material and the color is very vivid - I chose red, my favorite color.. There is a stand that is made within the case which makes it easy to watch videos. Very high tech for on a budget friendly price 😁
 Love the case’s feel and design, but the kick stand broke. Just got it and wanted to use the stand, slid it up easy..... when I was done, slid it back down gently, still got caught in the grooves and snaps. Cheap plastic kick stand is my only complaint.
 What an outstanding case. I purchased 3 of these, one for myself, my wife and my mother. All three of us are very satisfied with the materials and the fit on our iPhone 7 plus. I would say I would purchase another one but with the build quality I don't imagine I would have to replace this anytime soon. The case is quite snug but once you get it on it is perfect.
 We upgraded to iPhone 8, so we had to get new covers. Our 1st choice is the Zizo Bolt covers! Still love these covers as they are study and stylish with a range of colors to choose from.
 This case is so cool it looks so much better in person. Looks very solid and protective. My husband likes that it has a belt clip really seems like it will hold up well to his job and we like that it doesn't cover the charging port like most rugged cases do
 My husband is super happy with his case! He is so clumsy and this case has saved his phone a lot! He likes the clip in the back that stands his phone up. Very good buy!
 What first got my attention was the orange color of this case. Upon further review, I noticed how solid it appeared to be. Plus very grippy, which is a huge selling point when your 900 dollar iDevice Is at stake. The tempered glass screen protector is keeping my screen scratch free yet very responsive to touch. There hasn't been a single negative point from my end yet. The lanyard, belt clip/stand, and the little stand built into the case are all great ideas. I would buy this case again in a New York minute.
 Delivered exactly on time, product as described. My son picked it out and he uses it, he absolutely LOVES it and thinks his case is way cool.
 Great case, great price. This is a pretty rugged case and it looks nice. I am constantly getting people who say they like the case. Definitely recommend this case.
 I bought these cover over a year ago, it's the only cover I have and the only one I use, I'm pretty careful with my phone but any way for it not to have a scratch after a year means it's a pretty good quality cover. Love it
 good product, easy transaction, received the correct item within the quoted time-frame.  looks and works great!
 I am hard on cases but this has held up well. I still catch it on the steering wheel when getting out of the car but it has held up well considering. It has saved my phone when I dropped it a couple of times too.
 color turned out a little duller than the photo but it's alright. I'd give it a better rating but the back cover piece is sticking out and you can't push it in, so it's not flush. The kick stands pretty hard to get out too if you don't have nails.
 Love my new phone case. Like I said it is light weight and not bulky. Easy to install and a great color.  Got the orange
 Very happy with this product so far. The only thing I would change is to  not  have the round window in the back to display the Apple logo. But unfortunately most non-transparent cases have that feature.
 Busted it,  military grade,  which military
 Great case, I have purchased these cases for all of my family’s iPhones and am extremely pleased. They are well made, and provide great protection at a great price. Highly recommend!!!
 I am very happy with this package deal.  I have been using the lanyard everyday and I have full confidence that I will not break the glass if the phone were to drop.  I was worried about the weight and size because the pictures featured made it look so... But I was happily surprised it is not heavy or bulky.
 Great value. Many added features for about half the price of Otterbox cases. Impressed with quality and love the kickstand feature.
 Very convenient and accessible with the holster clip on my slingbag or belt. Very satisfied with the quality and pricing . 👍🏻 Will defined recommend to friends .<br/><br/>The only down side is that I have installed extra tempered glass on the back of my iPhone 8+ this it’s slightly bulkier and front screen is slightly flat with the case lifted  protection
 It looks great and feels great in ur hand and even screen protector was easy to apply. But how the inner case component aligns with sleep button rt side...is so tight that it keeps powering phone off. I kept repositioning this for 45 mins ended having making a cut where the button cover was to take the pressure off the switch for it to work correctly...
 This is a very nice and stylish case. very well constructed and the textured surface really makes it easy to hold on to. Its not overly big like Otterbox cases ( which I hate!). My only gripe is that I can do without the lanyard loop at the top corner of the case. I have pretty much only used Unicorn Beetle cases in the past, but this case is much better looking! Now if I can ever get my iPhone 7 plus to come in to stock I can start rocking this awesome case and clip!<br/><br/>Update!!!:: Finally received my iphone 7plus, one big issue with this case, if you carry holster on right side the phone only locks in upside down.! So every time you have to flip phone!!!! very annoying. That brings this case down to 3 stars.
 I really like the case, it’s lovely to look at and it is durable. The clip that goes on your pants is cheap, along with the kick stand on the back of the case.
 This is the 2nd of the same case for me. Liked the other one enough to get another in a different color.
 This is an awesome case, has a belt clip and attachment that can hang the phone from your neck. Love the durability of this product as well as the clip that allows you to view from a hard surface.
 Arrived as described and clip works well for case. I am heavy phone user so its been getting a pretty good test over last month and I have not had any issues with it
 Love the protection and price, I feel they should put a more versatile kickstand on it.  It arrived very fast.
 I like it, it’s heavy duty and light at the same time.<br/>What I don’t like it is, I have a red/black Zizo and the red part is starting to shade almost darkening . If  there is anything to keep it like new or turn it back to the question way let me know!
 While the case is great, the kick stand is hard to open and snapped off on the second time it was used. Case it too thick for metal plates to catch magnets if you use them.
 Nice enough case but really no protection for the glass on front for people who drop thier phones like me!
 I bought this product approximately a week and a half ago I just sent it back today cause the kickstand was not working properly and I did not get the screen cover on properly. I was unhappy with it because the kickstand would not stay in place.  I  do plan to order another case. hopefully the kickstand will work better for me
 Really nice case, very protective, returned it didn’t quite fit my 8plus iPhone camera was a little off, maybe it was just me
 I was quite happy when I received the case. It is sturdy and looked nice. Now after 2 month of use the plastic discolored and it is unable to be cleaned. I purchased the white case.
 Love this cover, protects my iPhone 8 plus just as well as Lifeproof and other expensive brands!
 I love this phone cover, I was wondering how good it was when I bought it because I'm used to the otter boxes.  This case is pretty durable, I haven't dropped it yet so not sure how much protection is there that they claim, but I love the look and functionality with it.  This case also works with wireless chargers too!
 I bought this case a week ago.  I like the case, free screen protector is great, but the belt clip (which is a primary reason I bought it) which worked pretty well, snapped in half when inserting the phone after only a week of use. If the seller had a way to contact and offered a free replacement my review would be much more positive but I have to buy a new case in its current state
 Second one of these I bought...I love them and they last a long time....I bought another one just to change the color.  Very nice case.
 Garbage!!! The case is too tight so the power button will remain on and want to turn off the phone.  I already opened the tempered glass so I can't return.  So I cut out the button and still pressed against the power button. So disappointed, get your crap together.
 The clip broke of after only a month. It was not treated badly and actually was babied.
 Okay so here is why the case is just okay. The case that I received was not trimmed correctly and it looks like someone had done a poor job of cutting it to make it look clean and nice. The edges have scratches on it and it just doesn't look good. HOWEVER it is a good case, I really like the fact that I can attach my lanyard to it and walk around with my phone around my neck so that it doesn't fall. Granted, I am not a phone dropper however It's nice to never have to put it in your pocket where it can be stolen or can fall out of.
 Product was exactly as described and shipped on time. It was also cheaper by a dollar or two here on Amazon than it was on other sites. Great quality product; seems very durable and looks good as well. I give this seller and this product five stars.
 This is an amazing product. As good as an Otterbox Defender and about one-third the price. Great that it comes in colors. Particularly like the little loop in the corner for a strap attachment which can be hooked to a carabiner for extra security. Thank you Zizo for making a great and affordable product.
 Note retired law enforcement and military 2nd case 5* protection excellent .Note after one year chip or nick corner rubber lupe bought 2nd in case. I ever need PCs
 I absolutely love this phone case. The iPhone 7s is so slim and sleek that it I found I was dropping it frequently. Nothing major but enough to make me choose a case with added protection. This case is everything it is billed to be. Best phone case I've ever used.
 Phone fits but very tight for an iPhone 8plus.<br/>More disappointed that the case does not work with wireless charging...
 very sturdy case very durable
 My son is extremely hard on cell phones and this case has done its job well for him.
 Loved the case. I like that it stands out when I place my phone down. I didn’t like how the screen protecter fit so I didn’t use it. It made it hard for my fingers to use the home key. If I’m being picky the cutout for the apple logo is off by a 1/4 inch bottom of apple logo is clipped.
 got one for each of my children and one for myself.. GREAT quality.. and protection..
 I’ve had three of these cases and they last they take a beating they’re just really good  and you definitely can’t beat the price
 Really great product. Looks terrific.  Easy to hold.  Had to return as i inadvertently ordered wrong phone type.  This is our 2nd like this.  Holds up great.
 Waiting on like FOREVER for this product. I dont believe I was told that this was going to take this long.<br/>Ugggggghhhhhhhh
 The iPhone 6s Plus version of this case is 5stars. The iPhone 7 plus is 2 stars because of the power button on the case. The button is stiff and holds down the phones power button. This causes the phone to want to shut off. Fix that problem and you got a most excellent case.
 This product started coming apart after 3 month. I am very disappointed.
 It is stylish thin and love the color! Our iphone 7 plus case from Zizo is fabulous protection against dropping and love the tempered Glass Included.<br/>Would buy this again.
 Great case I have the iPhone 8 Plus. It fits tight feels sturdy and the tempered glass screen protector came with it was easy to put on. I would definitely buy this case again.
 My husband loves this phone case.  He is a Manager in a gravel quarry and his phones and phone cases are exposed to a LOT of hazards i.e. dirt, dust, vibration, But most importantly is taking his phone off &amp; on his belt, pocket or where ever he has to attach it.  If it is taken off 1 time a day it is taken off 100 at the minimum, truly.  He is always having to either take phone calls texts, or emails.  This case has worked beautifully at least so far.  I will let you know after 6 months worth of off on use how it holds up.
 I love this thing. Perfect fit so easy to handle --It's just very cool --- The kick  stand is fantastic ---just great --nice looking as well
 First day of use clip broke trying to place on belt.  Very disappointed.  Waste of money!!!  Do not buy.
 The case was fine .  I would t suggest ordering the white to anyone.  It gets dirty quick and it doesn’t wash off easily
 These cases are horrible. I've had many different kinds of cases and this one by far is the biggest pain to put on than all of the others combined. Don't waste your money.
 Back cover blocks camera. Annoying to have to remove it when rushing to take photos
 Not as convenient to use as I thought it would be.  Quite disappointing but okay given the price .
 First, the pros..It's one rugged case and WILL PROTECT your phone.<br/>The Bad...It's so rugged, it's almost impossible to press any buttons on the side of your iPhone 7 Plus and for that, I will not use it.<br/>Just keep that in mind.
 The lock button would not work properly, and when it would, it would stay pushed in. I ended up cutting the button out so I could reach in with my finger. The loop on the top left is rough on your ear while talking. It does a good job protecting the phone, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
 I love this case.  I have had a competitor's case in the past.  I found this Zizo case to be slimmer and easier to handle, with the same level of protection.  The buttons are easily accessible and work much easier.  Even the screen protector that came with it fits better and allows easier use of the phone.  Great case!
 This is a flexible case. As in it bends easily.  The bolts on the back are plastic. I own a vast array of small sockets standard, and metric and none fit these so-called bolts. Can’t imagine what army would consider this military grade. This product is completely misrepresented in its advertising.
 I bought this case for my husbands new iPhone 7 plus, it's a very nice case . It seems to be made of good quality, I think it will provide the iPhone with good protection. My husband also likes it a lot .
 the stand is a little hard to get out but other than that no problems with the case itself
 Gold standard for cases. I dropped my phone with this case from the roof. A slight nick in the case is all that was suffered. THANK YOU ZIZO !
 Excellent phone case so far. Dropped it a few feet onto concrete a few times already and no damage to the case or phone.  I’ll likely buy Zizo for my next phone case as well.
 Love that it’s very durable and even cute! The stand is a little flimsy but I don’t use it much. Grandson broke stand first time I used it.
 Everything about this case is pretty good, except that the lower volume button doesnt work. If you take off the hard shell and leave just the rubber inner case on, the button will work sort of. With the hard shell on, not at all. Cant figure out why. The upper button works no problem. This is on a brand new iPhone 7 plus. Yes, if I take the phone out of the case, everything works fine.
 Gave it to a friend who said it was cool and enjoyed it came with a screen protector too.
 Product is pretty good but the clip broke on this one and I didn't put any undo stress on it. The metal pin came out and couldn't be put back in.  I ordered another case from them and that one has work flawlessly so far.
 What sold me was the design, what disappointed me was how the phone case actually carried out. For the design, it actually looks amazing. However, I struggled to even get my phone in it let alone work. The buttons don't press down far enough to even turn up he volume or turn my phone on or off.<br/>On top of that, the tempered glass was broken upon arrival. I open the package to apply it to my phone and it's cracked diagonally.<br/>2/5 for the design though, nothing else worked out for the phone.
 Excellent phone case. Bought it for my son. At 15, with a very active lifestyle he can be rough on his phones. Between soccer, jui jitsu sparring, school, and otherwise just being a teenager, this case has already proved its worth! Excellent value for a very sturdy product!
 Very Durable! Been using for the past 3 months, my iphone7+ fell in several occasions but not a single scratch! Highly recommend this product!!!
 2nd time buying a case for a different phone. Case is amazing. Comes with screen protector. All you need. Dropped phone out of a 20 ft deer stand. Landed on its face after it bounced off tree. Phone is perfect.
 My son loved the Iphone case. It feels very well built and I hope it can take the many "drops" in will certainly face.
 The case is really pretty, was delivery very fast, the protector screen is really nice! Nice product!!!
 Love this case ! Protection plus .. a rugged case that will protect your phone !
 So far it's a nice case. The screen protector application was nice compared to some others that always seem to have bubbles. Like others, I too have a problem with the fit around the power button. Slight pressure to the right side will turn it off.
 Purchased this case for my son and the kickstand broke off after only having the case for 3 days!! So disappointed!!!
 The screen protector doesn’t have all the holes that it’s supposed to have. (No front camera hole.) Went to clip the case onto my belt and the clip broke right off.
 This case is a durable case and does it’s job. I am in the HVAC trade and my phones take a lot of abuse and this thing is holding up strong.
 Very impressed, especially for the price. Seems very solid and well made. Fits well and stays put. I’ve paid $50+ for cases that are not this nice.
 Exactly as advertised! Fits like a glove, rugged, looks awesome, I can tell you take pride in your craft. I have already recommended you to my friends and coworkers that have asked about this case. I will definitely buy from you again, keep,up the great work!
 Wish the protective glass was a little bigger to cover the whole screen on my iPhone 7 Plus, the power button is extremely hard to use very very hard to depress unlike the volume controls. Over all I like the design but I would say I'm not Happy with this purchase. I ordered a diffrent case to replace this one. This was not made for the iPhone 7Plus if it was it was not thought out well at all.
 I have to return it because the sides of the case where the phone's silence, volume, and lock are, won't move, it won't press down. So while your phone has the case on you won't be able to manage none of the above.
 Love the way this case protects and looks of it. It is very difficult to use the off button on the right hand side with my iPhone 7Plus. It seems to be really stiff or too hard to mash and takes two hands. Very inconvenient.
 It did not fit properly.  Kept turning the phone off effected the buttons.  I kept it because I used the screen protector
 This is my second case that I have purchased from Zizo.  I had the other case for about 1 1/2 years.  The case cracked on the side, the reason for replacing, but my phone was not harmed, in spite of how many times I dropped it.  It is built tough, has a great grip and looks great!  I will order again down the road.
 Good price. Delivered on time. A harder plastic type case. I like the lanyard look option and kickstand on back. I don't use the belt/holster clip option (which you can easily remove). If you're looking for an all-in-one case/screen protector option at a decent price check it out.
 On my second case and they keep busting! And customer service is a headache - I understand why but they could be more pleasant about their phone cases busting.<br/><br/>That aside I do love that case and lanyard.<br/>I have just contacted about my case issues and will update once I hear from them
 Really like the case and holster but the tempered glass screen protector fit the 8 Plus although the case fits fine.
 Case looked cool and sturdy, my bf really loved the appearance of this case. We ordered the case to arrive ahead of his new iPhone 7 plus and put it on immediately. Then the phone stopped working! Took the case off and phone works again. Removed the tempered glass then put the case back on....phone stopped working. The case was pressing the power and volume buttons. So this was a waste of money....have to buy a new case to protect the phone.
 I really wanted to like this case. The one I received had an issue with the alignment of the power button. The case was constantly pushing against the power button.Causing the phone to try to power down and take a screenshot whenever I tried to unlock the phone.
 My husband and I recently moved into the 21st century with new i phones and these cases are wonderful.<br/>I needed something for him that would protect the phone as well as stand up to his "butterfingers" and this<br/>product hits themark.
 The case was as pictured with color!  Usually they are slightly different. Very well made actually compared to other brands. Price was good!  I would purchase again. So many cases to choose from, but I loved the set up and protection it has!  Awesome!
 I am very happy with this case. For the price, it fits and protects my phone well. The kick stand works fine. The case is available in many colors and it even came with a tempered glass.
 Poor product, this means all 3 ordered no good within 2nd week second one broke corners off. I’m not impressed with this product
 All in one, I received a case, belt clip, and screen protector all together.  Awesome.
 The case fits my iphone 7 plus snugly. It feels good in my hand and provides a very secure grip. The kickstand is neatly tucked away and only there if you need it- a nice touch. Seems to be well-made and a very solid buy. I definitely recommend.
 The only thing that I dont like it has no cover for the charger plug etc. Otherwise its great
 I wish this worked better but the power off button doesn't line up perfectly and either the button gets pushed by itself when you are in the middle of something or you have to move the case around while pushing the button. I'm not happy with this.
 I love this phone case. It is heavy duty and protects your phone well. I also love that it has that arm you can pop out in the back to make your phone stand up while watching videos.
 This cell cover was so tight on my phone that it was doing crazy things. I actually thought my phone was broken. When I took the cover off it worked perfect again. I did love the looks and feel of it.
 It's a great case as always and fits the iPhone 8 Plus very well. The Apple logo isn't centered exactly in the hole on the back but everything else is fine
 Loved the case it’s really nice color exactly that I wanted best part not bulky case. Feels sturdy an it’s stand works fine
 Very high quality case, fits my iphone 8 plus perfectly with the apple logo perfectly centered in the cut out. Did not contact seller but follow up communication excellent make sure everything was ok. If you want a bulletproof case, hard to beat this (check out the 2018 CES case drop competition)!
 Great case! Love the color scheme, it's rugged looks great, doesn't slip in your hand comes in and out of your pocket good. Looking for the all around quality case this is a good one. Plus the screen protector I'll never go without one again. Doesn't hurt to help out a family owned and operated company made here in the good ol USA!!
 Really like the case, don’t care for the slot at the top for the lanyard. My husband bought the same case for his note 8s and it came without it.
 Very nice case and it works. Dropped it yesterday and absolutely No damage to the case or the my phone. Great job.
 Just as described rubber grips no slip works will order red next time
 I like the fact that it was easy to put on the phone, that it came with a screen protector and that it has a kickstand and belt clip. It even comes with a lanyard for if you choose not to hook it to your belt.
 Good design, the grip and feel of the case is sweet. It fit the iPhone 8+ perfectly. Adds a little weight to the phone, but overall, very nice.
 Easy to grip and offers large variety of color options. Came with cool lanyard. No barriers to full range of screen.  Kickstand leans phone at odd angle, but who really uses that anyway, right? Front glass shield is difficult to work with - doesn't deal completely and affected touch. Maybe a thinner screen protector or a different material would make it easier to apply and use. Otherwise, happy and would purchase again.
 Very sturdy case , I had one previously with my iPhone 6+ . It did very well keeping it from crashing to the ground , when it fell from a couple of feet to the ground . As I climb into the cab of my Semi..
 Cover fit perfectly, nice having a new screen protector.  Applied that with no problem, fit well.<br/>Very pleased with quality and workmanship,
 This is a very durable solid case , very happy with it. It was a little hard to put on, but once I stretched the sides a little bit, it went<br/>on nice and all the buttons worked great. Love the belt clip, very easy to take your phone on and off. For the price it was a great buy especially<br/>with the tempered glass cover.
 Sorry to say but I was not impressed with the phone case. The power button keeps turning my phone off without pressing it. The stand on the back of the case is difficult to open and seems like it would break if I pry it open to hard.
 I love this case!  It fits my 8plus perfectly 😀<br/>I wish it had more anti slip backing for my dashboard.  But, I am satisfied with it!  Great price. Many compliments!
 I have an iPhone 8+ and it fits perfectly.. Product matches the disruption..
 Good but could be better. The extra protrusion for hanging the phone on the left upper corner limits the position for which this phone could be placed on the holster especially in the horizontal position. I wish it is not there.....
 Great colorful case. The rubbery texture makes it feel secure when placed in your hand. It also secures its place when placed on a table it won't slip on the floor as easily almost damage proof for the most clumsier users... I can vouch.
 The part that was to be used as a attachment as you can see it broke into several pieces
 Rugged exterior, holds up well.  love the color.  Been doing a great job so far.
 Very colorful.  Yet to be tested because it's wrapped for Christmas.  But I checked it out upon arrival and it's exactly how it was described.  Amazon delivered sooner than expected.  Thanks Amazon!!!!!
 Broke really easy
 Great product this is my second one! I had the first one for a year and was still doing what I needed it to do!! Protect my phone lol.
 Very durable materials. Easy to snap into the phone. Glass protector really nice
 bulky and the clip broke less than 3 months in...not impressed at all.
 The case is everything it promises and more.Well made durable and attractive. Puts Otter box to shame.
 My only complaint and it seems to be an industry standard the stand only opens in such a way that the volume buttons are on the downside. I would prefer it open the opposite way so that I can control volume without touching the screen or picking it up.
 Exactly what i paid for! Great case! I have dropped phone a few times and no cracks or breaks!
 The case is great but a little tight on the phone, causes buttons on the side of the phone to be pressed.  You have to flex the case to stop this from happening.  The holster broke from the belt clip after a week of use.  If that had not happened I would have given this 5 stars
 Love it. This is the fourth iPhone case I've bought from Zizo. Everyone in my family had one but me and I love their cases. I don't think we will ever get another ottter box. We've found zizo and there's no going back.
 Awesome looking functional protective device for your iPhone. Recommended!!
 Rugged quality, and it even came with a screen protector!  It fits my iPhone 8 plus!
 Looks good fits good I was just hoping it was a full cover to keep water and dust out.  It’s a good product just make sure your not in a wet and dusty environment.
 Very resilient case with all the right features.  Not too heavy or cumbersome.<br/>The kickstand is tough to get loose but that's the end of it.  I've drop it several times with no worries on it breaking.
 The case on the phone seems fine but the belt clip is flimsy and snapped off almost immediately when I tried to adjust it. Also the kickstand is very hard to pop out, can easily break a nail trying to get it to engage. I'm disappointed.
 Love this product I jade it for five months and I’m very clumsy lol so I drop my phone everyday and every way high or low places and. I have not one mark or dent on my case or my phone I’m ordering more for the different colors!! Great product
 Poor design. Once you put the case on, the power button doesn't function - the iphone keeps turning on and off - there is some alignment issue.
 Love these cases way cheaper than an otter box
 While the case looks and feels durable, it unfortunately is not. The case protects the phone however the rubber used to provide cushion is quick to fall apart, especially when in contact with water. Overall a great looking case that doesn’t last very long.
 Color isn't even close don't expect it too look like the picture. This is more like a dark grey. Phone case is okay seems a lot better in the picture.
 Screen protector started to peel the second day, case is nice screen protector is junk.
 We love this product because it's sturdy in our hands and hips. It definitely protects the phone which is a super plus. Most importantly, the kick stand to watch highlights on the phone. I would recommend this produce to anyone.
 Very unhappy I  receive my  iPhone or  I would put her in the case one of the rubber tabs broke ; too hard to put my phone in case!!!😒
 The case fits the phone perfectly. And how ingenious to include a guide to help place the tempered glass plate onto the phone. The case snaps easily into the ratcheted holder. A very nice product.
 Like the design &amp; features....looks like it will last the life of the iphone....
 Broke into pieces after about a month. But looks nice
 The case was extremely appealing. I love the feel of it, and the strength of it. However, I am sending it back. When I put my iPhone 7 Plus into the case, it started blinking on and off and would not stop until I removed it from the case. It appears that one of the button covers is putting pressure on the phone??? I'm not sure, but it's very disappointing.
 best case available.  This is my fourth, and I have bought for family too.<br/>Only regret is that the don't have the plugs attached for charging &amp; head phone ports any longer.....wish they were still there
 This case does not fit my iPhone 7plus properly. I can't use the power button at all. When I go to answer a call, the screen protector does react properly causing me to miss several calls. Although he case look good it functions absolutely horribly.
 Bought an a gift for 13 year old son. He loves it.
 This is a nice case but if you want to be able to use the kickstand it cracks and breaks quickly. I recently bought a new case because my other case was cracked the new case cracked within a month or so and l don't use it everyday. If you want to be able to use all the features I would recommend buying something else
 Looks just like it is pictured &amp; described.  It is a really sturdy case.  That's not always the way it is at times on other products I have purchased.  My only problem was getting it on; was hard to slide over the buttons.
 This is a really nice case but when it’s on my phone I can’t press the volume buttons or the power button. It is very hard to get on the phone as well. Good quality for the price but I definitely can’t use it!
 I like that I can still use my wireless charging with this case as well, and it still feels thick enough to protect the phone just in case of a drop.
 It’s very comfortable in your hands, the only problem I had is the my screen protector was cracked at the top small opening. So I went and bought steel 360 screen protector. The case it self is awesome. Thank you Geri
 Great looking case!!. Texture is great. Phone fits perfect in case with no wiggle. Screen protector went on the first time without any bubbles.<br/>Only problem I have is the kickstand broke five days after installing case on phone. I've had cheaper and more expensive case with kickstands and they have never broke.<br/><br/>I'll be shopping for another case soon.
 I love the case and especially the price. If I had one gripe about the case, it would be that you can only put the case in the belt clip 2 ways. The nub for the lanyard hookup prevents the phone from going into the belt clip in the way that I like but I can live with that.
 Very rugged case. I have used this case for all of the IPhone that I have owned. I have dropped my phone numerous times without sustaining any damage.
 I'm supper happy with this case and the screen cover that came with it.  It's easy to get on and off.  And of course my daughter had to drop it on the concrete the second day I had my phone.  Not a scratch!  My phone was shipped to me and I had to take it in for activation.  The sales man wanted to know where I had got the case from!  Love the color!
 Picture is totally misleading..it appears to be a shiny silver case BUT what was received was a drab,dull ugly gray..Zizo needs to correct &amp; insert a picture of the ACTUAL color you'll be receiving!!!
 Case looks good but was the wrong size. When ordering an item the phone type should not change when you select a different color.
 Very happy with the fitment although the screen protector came cracked.  Otherwise it would have been 5 star
 Love the color and my phone feels really secure. I would highly recommend.
 Came broken in several pieces. Junk. Bummed. Waste of $20 bucks. At least it broke before I put my phone in it.
 Too bulky and not what I thought it would look like... soon as I put it on my phone the black dots on the back disappeared:-(<br/>The heavy feeling of the case sure protects the phone though. Good product just not for me
 The case is excellent. The belt clip only accepts the case in one orientation and therefore is somewhat limiting. This reduces the choices of which side you wear the holster and/or if the securing lock of the belt clip is oriented up or down.
 This is the second case to replace the original.  None of these cases fit as advertised.
 Excellent product I would definitely recommend it it adjust nice to my waist.
 Good quality, little bulky
 Good protective cover but clip that snaps on phone keeps breaking off after about a months use..about 3rd time it has to be replaced with me having to pay for it.. I will be trying other case not this one anymore
 This is the nicest looking, most versatile, and highly durable case I’ve ever had! It’s easy to use and handle.
 I really enjoy this case, only thing I would have to say is that I had a tough time first putting my case on and the kick stand is a little difficult to first get out, other than that I am really enjoying this case
 Fits well, seems solid. Do not have it long enough to comment on durability.
 Love this phone case!! Fits perfect for IPhone 7 Plus. Great grip haven’t dropped it yet.
 I’m happy so far with this phone case. The first case I bought broke and u ask me for a picture of it but I couldn’t find out how to send a pic. So I bought another one. This one seems to be ok. Ps. Pic. I’ll send u a pic of the first case I bought. Both cases look good and fill good in my hand.
 Like the case but the clip is uncomfortable and the stand popped out the second day...
 I bought this case for my wife and she loves it. She really likes the kickstand to watch videos on her iPhone 8 Plus. She likes the style, color and how it feels in her hand.
 We just bought the iphone 7 plus through Verizon.  For some unknown reason, verizon doesn't carry anything remotely close to this.  It FITS, It has two options, it included the protective cover.  IT's WONDERFUL!!
 I really like this case. It is very sturdy and looks good. I like having the option of a holster clip. I just can’t get the kickstand to open.
 Horrible! Clips break within days, even without using them. The case itself was okay but bulky.
 I have bought these cases before and they lasted pretty long is the third one now I’ve had it in three months each one of those the holster is broken in different spots seems the plastic this is made out of is defective one broke on the clip that held the telephone in One broke on the swivel the other broke on the belt loop
 Installed screen protector and case, hopped online to give a 5-star rating and found out the clip case is broken.... Not happy, it was a xmas gift as well..
 Pretty nice case for the money, and it looks cool and futuristic, but it got stained very easily though, I would recommend getting a darker color, which is what I did after getting the white/grey one.
 I like this case. The stand is pretty sturdy. It's bulky with the extra clip on case but without it is a good size. My kids have dropped it and my phone has survived.
 HAd it for a few days.  I am very happy with the product.  Strong, water proof and has a great look to it.
 the case is really cool feels very safe and the screen protector was really easy to apply! Seems to be very heavy duty. Comes with a detachable portion that hooks up to your belt. Plus I love the kick stand for Netflix!
 I love my case. It is very rugged and durable.
 Very well built case. Fits my 8 Plus perfect. Tempered glass cover went on easy. Highly recommend
 My husband loves this phone case.
 The hard case is great fits perfectly on my iPhone 7 plus<br/>The reason I gave two stars is the screen protection was cracked before opening and unusable.<br/>After sending an email to the company I waited a good week before posting this review to see if I got a response. They never responded and I am an unsatisfied customer would not recommend
 You should consider selling the holster independently. The case is awesome but as with just about every belt clip/holster design ever made, you eventually catch it on something (car door, desk chair) and it breaks
 Item appeared to be previously returned, box was dirty, corners don’t line-up correctly and the tempered glass was broken. Was very excited to put it to work but unfortunately i have to return. I think I will try a different brand next time.
 Great case for my new iPhone 8 Plus. The included screen protector was so easy to install. I also like the built in phone stand.
 Product is a good quality and I'm happy with it had little problem with screen protector was busted on arrival and for some reason having trouble getting it replaced it would have been a five star otherwise
 Handles well. If you’re aware it’s plastic you’ll use care when opening the stand part. For the price it’s very nice
 Bought a month ago and the case has already broke . Poor quality. Not durable at all. Would never buy again
 This is a wonderful case!! The material it is made of and the way it is made makes for such a great grip of your phone.  For the price and with a glass screen protector it is the best!!!
 Great phone protector for half the price
 Awesome product. Great fit and finish. Colors are vibrant and seems like it will protect my phone even against my grandsons use of it.
 I like the concept, but the there was one very serious problem with this case. The power button was continuously pressed due to the stiffness of the case.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this case!!!! Also bought the one for a LG V20. I have the iPhone case my husband has the V20. We both LOVE our new cases.
 Absolutely like this case. Bought it for my clumsy accident prone boyfriend and it has done its job for sure. The material is very thick and durable and he has dropped his phone several times and no cracks yet.
 The screen protector broke in my hand when I was trying to take the backing sheet off. Not happy about that. The case itself fits like a glove. Has good feel to it. Case is very good quallity. Arrived on time.
 Phone case is great. Belt clip broke on me but I didn’t use it often so no worries there. Screen protector is easy to install and case covers phone perfectly. I wanted a tough case that can handle my outdoor job and this one is perfect. Phone fell 10 feet yesterday and phone is still perfect. Wonderful product and wonderful quality.
 Case is nice. They sent me a cracked screen Protector!!! Not cool I won’t purchase again!!!
 Ordered for my husband's iPhone 7 plus and it fits perfect. He loves the color as well. Exactly as described.
 Absolutely love the case and the color combination. But there's a huge problem. My power button doesn't work with the case on. It's like you're almost guessing the location for it. And if you press in the general area it'll ask if you want to power down. Rarely just go in standby. So I have to wait for the screen to time out every time. Huge bummer
 I strongly advise no one to buy this product as it is to tight for the I phone 7 plus. It made my power button flicker on and off multiple times and the power switch would not turn my phone on and off correctly. It would power it on and off when my phone was angled in different positions when I wasn't intending for it to turn off at all. The only thing I was able  to use out of this entire package was the screen protector.
 Not as sturdy as I expected. You can squeeze the case with one hand and it has a lot of give. Also the rubber out shell dies not cover the entire case. It seems ok for normal use, but not a heavy duty cover
 I give it an A+, works well for me when I’m working this is what I needed thanks
 Bought this for work with the belt clip got the black on black seems durable and well put together the belt clip is nice, only flaw is the lanyard hole on the case probably going to cut that off who is carrying a phone around their neck?
 Overall a good case but I just didn't care for it.  Didn't feel comfortable in my hand. Also a little cumbersome putting it back into the belt holster.  Great case if you tend to drop your phone a lot (protection is not an issue)!
 Love it, already dropped my phone a few times since I got the case and no damage to the case or my phone!
 The case itself is Beautiful! However, the clip is flimsy and have already broken. But again - the case itself is lovely.
 Got this case for my 12 year old son, he is rough with his things but this case is still protecting his phone. Great buy.
 My son ordered this phone case for his new iPhone 7 plus but we are returning because the area that covers the buttons on the phone would not allow him to turn the phone off/on or access the volume control buttons.  It was impossible to use them since the part of the case that covers these buttons didn't fit properly.
 Like the sturdiness. Not thrilled with the bulkiness.
 I like the product and the idea of a case with a kickstand, tried to open kickstand first day broke the case, now other parts just broke off.  Very easy to break when taking off phone
 I the Quality looks exactly like the pic. Amazing purchase
 It’s exactly what its advertised to be. Fit my iPhone 8 plus perfectly. Seems durable. The clip on accessory grips well and is not flimsy.
 Excellent case. Love everything about it except that I can’t use my wireless charger with the case on.
 Excellent case and very durable. So far protecting my phone quite well. Also feels good in the hand.
 Great phone case! Colors are exactly as pictured. Belt clip actually snaps into the case so it's less likely to fall off by accident. Also comes with a screen protector which was very much needed.
 Hard to get on phone. Bent one side out while trying to put on and it won't bend back.  Also its to tight around the off button so it is always turning its self off.
 This is a cool, very protective case. It's just not easy sliding it into your pocket. If you don't pocket your phone and you like rugged, cool lookin cases then buy this one.
 very nice, only one problem was with the protector didn't sit along top of phone, there is a air gap and its popped up
 Fast shipping, extremely durable, hands down one of the best cases I’ve ever had for my Mobile telephone
 I love this case! It’s very strong. The clip busted off last night at work and I lost a piece that goes to the clip. I purchased it mid Oct. of this year. I still love the case, but not happy the clip broke so soon.
 It's lighter and a lot less bulky than other cases I've had in the past. The screen protector that came with it is an added bonus.
 Looks good on iPhone 7 Plus. Very happy with it.
 This is my second case and both have been great.  Durable and protective.
 So far the case is holding up. I even dropped it and it was ok. Pleasantly Surprised!
 Owned for almost a year now and case has held up great. Dropped phone on occasion and this case has absorbed the abuse. As advertised
 Liked the case but it seemed like it was made for IPhone 6 plus. On my new 7 plus, the on/off button would not work and the home button wanted to lock up. It felt like there was too much pressure on the phone. I was exited to get the case, but had to send back and use an Otter Box Defender.
 Excellent quality and as described!  Fits my phone just perfect, nice and snug for protection! Super Fast shipping!  Highly recommended!!!  AAAAA++++++
 They are gifts so have not seen the reaction but this is what they had wanted so i am positive they will be very happy with them
 We received this case on Friday, and it broke on Saturday. My husband was getting out of the vehicle and it caught on the seat belt and the case, not the clip, snapped right apart. Not sure if I would recommend this or not.
 Very nice case for IPhone 7plus.  Perfect fit to phone and all buttons function correctly.  The charging port is easily accessed and speakers are not muted.  Tempered glass screen protector was included complete with installation instructions and materials.  Holster clip holds the phone securely in place.  Overall, this is a great case for protecting your expensive phone.
 This is a great case that is durable and comfortable to use. I like the kick stand on the back, it makes watching videos easy when flying.<br/><br/>After destroying multiple more expensive cases, I am really impressed with this case.
 Easy to put on
 i used this same brand for my note 8 too and in both cases this cover is great.
 The loop that the neck string go’s through, the string ripped through it. Other then that it is a great case.
 The case fits perfectly. I'm very happy with the color and design and the inclusion of the glass protector was an added bonus.
 Color as expected. Fits tightly so seems to be ok in event of a drop.  Tempered glass screen protector is slightly too small but just barely enough to meet the very edge of the lighted screen. The kickstand is too hard to get to open, but after the first time, it gets easier.
 IT WAS A GIFT AND I THINK IT WILL BE JUST FINE I LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CASE
 Protects phone almost as well as an Otter Box. What it lacks in toughness it makes up in looks.
 Fits phone perfectly and loved the color. Great buy
 Had a version that worked well with my Galaxy S7 Edge. Bought this one since I switched to an iPhone 8 Plus and it was much harder to put on and take off. Not only that but the buttons are really hard to press for some reason.
 It is very nice and at the same time gives security to the Iphone. The cover fits very well to the Iphone 6 plus, 6s plus, although this cover is for the Iphone 7 plus.
 The clip broke inside of 30 days
 It looks great
 Horrible case for the Iphone 7… Doesn't fit right &amp; doesn't square up all the buttons and it's not worth to try to trim it out… They should've worked from the beginning
 I have an iPhone 7 Plus.... it’s fits perfect, no complaints here. Grey and black looks awesome.
 The color is pretty and I was looking forward to my new case; however, the downside is that you cannot turn the volume up or down unless you press it very very very hard.
 Outstanding design and provides excellent protection and a very secure feeling.
 wow so I'm sending back the third one with problems.  They have a big problem with the iphone 7 plus case as the on/off button will not work in the case.  It also has a problem with the belt clip that tends to break easily.  Guess I need to order a different brand.  I really liked the design and looks but... it needs to work!
 Sent my iPhone 7plus case back... power button didn’t fit right. Unable to use functions.. cool looking case, bad fit on mine 🙁
 This is a good case for the money.  It is a hard case, not rubbery but not slippery either.  Although i don't use the stand for viewing videos it is a added feature that snaps in place nicely and stays put.
 So far so good. Fits and works good.
 Does not have tempered glas that adheres to very expensive phone. Cheap plastic with no backing, not even the correct size. Belt clip covers camera len's, No wonder so cheap
 So far, so good!<br/>My husband has been very pleased so far.  Well made, great screen protector kit and seems to be extremely durable.
 power button does not work. can't lock nor unlock the phone with case on. returning the case. disappointed because it is a cool looking, durable case with a nice grip/texture to it.
 Love this case! Super secure.  I no longer feel like if I hand my phone to my five year old and he drops it I won’t be losing my mind.  In fact I have dropped it and my phone was in tact.  I felt like the case laughed at the floor as it slammed down.  Great product
 High Quality, my phone has been safe through many drops.  I would buy again!
 Ordered this by mistake because I have an iPhone 6s Plus. I'm glad I ordered it because it fits my phone perfectly.
 My daughter is Very hard on cell phones. She chose this case for durability. She is very happy with it.
 Great purchase for my sons iPhone 8 plus. Also came with a lanyard.
 Nice color. Easy to grip
