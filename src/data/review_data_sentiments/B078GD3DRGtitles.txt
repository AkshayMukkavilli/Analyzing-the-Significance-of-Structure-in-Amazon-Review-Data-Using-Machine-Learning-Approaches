Too unrealistic to enjoy
This is the one - this is THE book you cannot put down
Take your time and savor every sentence.
A moving story about survival in a way that most of us can't imagine.
Did I read the same book as others?
OMG Wonderful Wonderful!
Disappointing
Debut Novel is captivating!! Could Not Put it Down!
Most overrated book of the year
Most irritating book I've read in a long time!
You'll NEVER Want To Leave
Almost Wonderful
Promising start that tanked.
One of the best books I have read
Really? Not a thumbs up from me.
I wanted to like it, but...
Really not worthy of recommendation
Very disappointing.
Frustrating Geography, Ecology, etc!
Overrated, Dull, Unbelievable, Trite
Beautiful prose, but the story line is lacking...
suspend disbelief
Must Suspend Reality A Little Too Much
A waste of money!
This was not a "must-read" for me.
this book was terrible-terrible writing, terrible plot went on forever
Ending ruin a great book
Sand County almanac?  Really!?!?
Didn't live up to the hype
Nature writing meets romance novel
Waste of time
Improbable, unlikely, unbelievable.
Unreadable.
Best book I've read in awhile!
Not terrible, but unbelievable and unbelievably overrated
Puhleeze!
Well written, but a downer
writing with depth!
Lovely Read for Those of Us Who Love Nature....But.....
Maybe I'm Too Old?
Overrated.
In the minority.
So Disappointing!
Unrealistic in so many ways
An unbelievable fairy tale
More of a fairy tale than a novel
Ending was Upsetting
Feeds the senses
Seems very inaccurate.
NC geography
More Crawdads and Less Silly Plot
Suffocating dullness throughout
Right Story, Wrong Time Frame
Unbelievable
Abandoned child lives in swamp
Good story, simplistic character development
Stunningly bad
American magical realism
Dull, disappointing...Are people getting paid to post all these 5 star reviews?
Not one of those deep books that makes you think
Nothing more than a coming-of-age story
Great book with one glaring problem--poor research
They ain't no crawdads in a salt marsh.
A Rarity
LOVE LOVE
Regretfully written
A poetic delight
Meh.  Why all the 5 star ratings?
Beautiful, haunting, and lyrical...
Did we read the same book?
Mystery, romance, adventure, and nature pulled seamlessly together in this phenomenal story
Yuck
Sad Tale, but Worth the Read
Lovely Descriptions of Nature but .  . . .
Very disappointing.  If you're looking for an uplifting read, pass this one by and look elsewhere.
To long
Expected more from a best seller
4 3/4 stars  Beautifully written, but with some plausibility issues
Don‚Äôt waste your money!
Such a wonderful book!
Insightful and heartwarming
No good!
Painful to read if you're from North Carolina
This book will last forever and forever.
Not My Favorite
The Marsh Girl resonated with me.
Spellbinding!
Worth reading BUT...
Could Have Been Better
The Best Novel I Have Ever Read
Wonderful--But Geography is Bad
Tried hard to suspend disbelief
Disliked the Ending
Disappointing
5 stars and then some!
Stupid story
Good...and then not.
4 Stars
A bit slow here and there but so atmospheric
Setting was my favorite character
Girl Raised Off the Grid is Accused of Murder
Coming of Age in Nature
‚ÄúUnrealistic‚Äù Fiction
a disappointment
Don‚Äôt waste your time or money
I'll  crow about this novel!
Terrific first novel, but strains credulity
Mediocre at best
not whatit promised
Wonderful!
Compelling read!
Over rated
