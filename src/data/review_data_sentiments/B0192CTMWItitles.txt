Applause to another enjoyable book.
Same Strengths and Weaknesses
Wilder Than Ever About Harry!

Worth the two year wait (no spoilers).
Harry grows up
The darkest, and in some ways the best, of all seven
Wonderful...
50 points to J.K .Rowling!
Left me wishing book 7 was here
Love
Building up to the end...
Book 6 nicely fits into place in the series.
Suffers "In-Between-Itis"
Astounding. Easily the Best of the Series Thus Far.

Review of the AUDIO book
Another winner in the series, filled with courage & poignancy
Amazing as usual
J K Rowling is a genius
The Half-Blood Prince(Shape) appears to have shown his true colors!
Slow Start, Jaw Dropping Finish
HBP is good, but it's not the best book in the series
Great set-up for the final installment
Awesome edition to the series
Tragic and Terrifying
Harry is growing up
Yay! Fun for Muggles!
Highly recommend Potter book audios read by Jim Dale bringing them to life
This is not Harry Potter 6 in German.  Read carefully.
Good book
Excellent book for all ages
Didn't live up to the standard set by the previous books
Predictable, but great
Still Good the Second Time
Fairly good condition
Time spent with old friends on a summer evening- fighting Death Eaters!
Not as good as the last 3

Spoiler-free first impressions
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
Another Amazing Harry Potter Novel
A fun ride (contains spoilers)
Further adventures in Rowling's universe
The plots just keep on thickening
Returns to some of the brilliance of the earlier books
good Hogwart's fun beginning, heartbreaking ending
Leaves me with puffy eyes...(might have spoilers)...THIS BOOK IS DARK!!! BUT FANTASTIC!!!
The Half-Blood Prince ain't half-bad
Great book
Hang in there, Harry
Harry Comes of Age
Wax On, Wax Off

Great Story But Several Holes In The Beginning
Best book of the series
Inferior to other books in the series

Goodbye Teacher, Mentor, and Friend
The book that made Harry Potter grow up.
The Penultimate Harry Potter novel
Mediocre Start, Superb Ending...Mature Subject Matter
This is my favorite Harry Potter book

All Harry Potter books are great
Fun and entertaining, well worth reading
Beyond Brilliant

Dark, Dreary, the Best of the Series, yet questionable for the younger readers
ONLY ONE THING TO SAY
Not the best of hers, but an excellent setup
The Skies Grow Darker above Hogwarts in This Beginning of the End
Perhaps the most important Harry Potter installment yet...
Hype? Or is it something deeper?
A Series in Transition: 3 and a Half Stars
The Sixth ...
My favorite of the Harry Potter series!
Good plot setup to book 7, but a bit disappointing
Good, but does not stand alone
Great Addition to the Potter Series
Good story, but...
Insightful development of characters
Predictiable. . .yet amazingly good
Heartbreakingly Perfect!
Well it sure kept me interested but for what?
Great series,
J.K.R. Delivers a Punch
Harry instead wades through dark and murky memories of Voldemort’s greatest strengths and weaknesses
Do regroup here before the final installment!

Shorter but better then Order of Phoenix
Did Rowling Play Fair?
Wow! I loved it.
Not the best HP book yet
Bow Wizard Triumphs Again
Really good, but more of a set-up for Book 7
GO ROWLING!

Better & Better

HP 6 - disappointing or enjoyable?
"But when I became a man, I put away childish things."

Questions and Observations for Half-Blood Prince Readers
Deeper, darker & more grown-up
Cold and Dark - Stir the Cauldron
Harried for Harry! Potty (a Britishism) for Potter!
Starts out with a Bang and Becomes a Real Page-turner
Coming of age and magic--strong stuff
Best yet
alot seems to be lacking: including the editing on my copy
The Half-Blood Prince Is More Important than You Think
Well worth reading, if you already have an O.W.L. in Rowling
The Penultimate Book
HBP falls flat
It is not for kids anymore!
I am now a Harry Potter fan
The Story Gets Better and Darker Each Time
Harry Potter Speeds Headlong to an Exhilerating Conclusion
Wonderful
Mysteries a-plenty -- maybe a few too many
"Dumbledore's Man, through and through"
A Well-Worth-It Long Wait
The Best In The Series To Date
Perfect
well-told
not for children anymore
A bit of a dissapointment, but good non the less.
A revealing look into the past...
Enjoyed it a lot
Very satisfying!
Another great novel in the Harry Potter series
I cried for some time. (possible spoiler)
They're Growing Up
WOW!  Totally worth the wait
Great novel, keep it coming
Angst, amore and alchemy
Only one word is needed...
Loved it
A powerful, emotional, unbelievable entry into the series
Wonderful classic but can be "dark"
Over too quickly
A year of teenage emotions as war threatens the wizarding world...
A worthy continuation....
The movies are wonderful, but I'm really glad I'm getting into the books now
Rowling thrills you, chills you, in this involving tale
Better than i expected
Another good installment
Magical Book

Flawed but still outstanding
How could anyone not love reading J. K. Rowling!
Yeah, It's the Best One...
Fantastic book. Who said adults couldn’t read kids books? They are wrong!
Another spellbinding masterpiece!
Better pacing now, surprises to come
Best Yet, and My Favorite of the Series
Don't let your children read it alone
Another classic
Not her best, but still one of the best stories
Excellent addition to the series
Whew!
Beginning of the End
Harry The Teenager ..
Best HP book yet!

Excellent addition to the series...
Prince of a Book
Rowling is still magic
Most emotional of the series thus far
Have a box of Kleenex ready
Excellent Continuation of Harry's Story!!
Pleasantly surprised!
Enjoyable even for an old guy.
A return to a nobler Harry
Good Good Good!
Much talked about, but backed up
Timely themes (terrorism?)
Predictable...but still fun
amazing book,like the others
one of the best in the series, character depth at the heart of story
Quite Good
This Grandma/Great-Grandma Loves This Series
Wonderful and woeful at the same time!
Fascinating; if you're bored, you missed the point
Possibly the best in the series
Not the best, but a decent prelude to the final book in the series..
Review of HP and the Half Blood Prince
Like it or hate it, this is GREAT literature...

The best in the series.
Observations, a review, and a guess
Superb Story -- but solidly In the grip of the Dark (Story) Arc
Honest Review without any Spoilers
Harry's not a child any longer...
Rowling's Pen Is Sharp And Her Imagination Is Unbeliveable!
Tastes Great ... Less Filling
Good ... But not up to the standards of the rest in the series (spoilers)
Truly magical
Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!
A worthy addition to a popular series
Building up to fantastic finale
Not a kid's book anymore...
It is all coming together
The ultimate penultimate
Go, Harry!
I was Disappointed
very simple paper engineering
Warning - Spoilers, and questions, questions, questions...
Wow... just wow...
Awesome Set-Up for #7
Darker and more frightening as we move to the end game
Warning: Spoiler !
Riddled With Riddles About Riddle
I really enjoyed the book

Rowling's best so far
Dragon Is Awake
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood  Prince
Good, but too much tell rather than show
Long in the middle but an exciting finish
(4 1/2 *)  Another Winner From Mrs. Rowling!
Sad but Brilliant
Pace is a little too hurried.
I WILL NOT LET J.K ROWLING REST UNTIL SHE MKES A NINTH HARRY POTTER BOOK!
HP Half-Blood Prince - building to the conclusion...
Dark.  Sad.  Fantastic.
A profound and interesting set-up for the finale
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
Not too bad, but...
More heartache for Harry
rereading it was like a trip down memory lane
Ongoing enjoyment again

Dumbledore's Man ------------ Spoiler inside!
Excellent addition
Made so much more sense
Not Disappointed
Half-Blood Prince
dark  tale of evil, betrayal and priceless treasure of love!!!
Excellent New Adventure for Potter!
The darkest book so far, and one of the saddest.
JK Rowling knows her stuff!
Toys with emotions and plot-lines, but well worth it!
Gripping, the best book yet
For me, the magic has ended
Great addition to the series!
Magical
A TOTAL Convert!
Good story and excellent audio version
Missed the feel of the World of Harry Potter
Love the Harry Potter books
HARRY POTTER is AMAZING
the series gets darker
Typical Harry Potter book,,,, but was expecting MORE!
Ignore the negative reviews, this is the crowing achivement so far in the series.
Characters in Depth
Fabulous read, sets up the final book well!
Tough but worth it
Potterhead love
Clever as always , a must read for anyone!
Another slightly disappointed adult fan...
Ruddy Brilliant!

To thine ownself be true.
A Magnificent Book
Frustrating but essential
Plodding, then has a knock-out climax
Could terrorism have influenced this book?
Depending on Book 7, this may be the coolest or lamest  HP ending ever!
A mixed experience for Harry Potter fans?
Miltonian end elevates installment.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: The Best of the Series so Far
The Darkest but still magical with some romance on the side
Worthy successor, worthy bridge
One Half of the Perfect Volume
I love love looooove this book
My two cents
Good Read With Some Minor "Buts"
Want more, but!
The magic continues.
The Wizard Formerly Known As The Half-Blood Prince.
What to say?
Dying for the finale!
Ms. Rowling's Writing Style Evolves and Improves
Who is the mysterious half-blood prince?
Don't think this is just for kids!
Attention to Detail Missing
As the book gets darker, the story gets much more interesting........
Lean mean Harry Potter machine
definitely the best yet
An Important and Fun Book in the Series.
Hopeful
Rowling creates another masterpiece.
The most unbalanced book of the series
Oh.My.God!
Cruel author who is going to kill Harry Potter
Marvelous
"nitwit", "oddment", "blubber", and "tweak"
A little disturbing, but otherwise a terrific read.
Quite unexpected
Too much Lurve, Not Enough of the Un-Mushy Snape
my teens call this Harry Potter 6. the filler book
An excellent book, of course
Not quite as good as Book 5...

best harry potter book ! even more than the order of the phoenix
Still good, but needs a summary of previous books.
Why movies rarely do literature justice
umm....slow moving but alright...
SO GOOD!!!!!
Half-Blood Prince...
Mixed Feelings About the Ending, but Still Excellent!
It's Harry Potter duh!!
(Spoiler Alert) Saddest ending but an amazing read
The Penultimate Potter!!!
Great book, but not the best in the series
Lumos!
What can one say that has not already been said?
One of J.K. Rowling's best
Great Reading for Adults Too!
More Intrigues
'Half-Blood Prince' proves wholly great
Give J.K. Rowling a credit!
Another winner from Rowling
Not as good as some of the others
A page turner, equiped with anticipations & anxieties
Sad
Spoiler-Free Review
And Now The Gloves Come Off
Three and a half-stars, actually!
i cant wait to read again
Wonderful and heart wrenching.
Lacking in "zest" and humor of the previous novels
Good; but not the top
A change from the rest
Oh Dear...What Can The Matter Be!
A lackluster effort
Best Harry Potter Book
The best so far... Better than what I expected
Love Harry Potter
A Major Evolution in the Harry Potter Saga
Worth the Read!!!
I have been enchanted with the Harry Potter series for years now, but are chinks starting to Show?
good but not great - but is that inevitable?
Magical!
Great Set-up for the finale
Not my favorite Potter Book
Not terribly surprising, but solid and sad
Unsettling at parts, but marvelous all the same!
If you have a choice - don't read it yet
Not for the youngest readers
A little slow to start but ends with a bang.
If you like the movies you should read the books!
An emotional roller coaster would be an understatement
A considerable improvement
Why JK Rowling allowed the book to be released in such a condition is the biggest mystery.
Intriging
"We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on."
mmmmmmmmmm.......  filler
The Wonder and the Horror
Half Blood Prince is serviceable
The Half-Blood Prince continues this great story
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Soul
Can't put it down!
Harry Potter best book series ever
Good, but not as great as the others IMO
Breath Taking
Harry becomes a man
Simply excellent...
Half blood Prince - almost done
This is my favorite of all Seven
Awesome! The best book yet!
Muffliato!
Things are not always as they appear to be, Harry....
Rowling weaves another wonder!!!
Great read but does not stand on its own
I tried to resist Harry
Powerful
Return to Top Form
Harry Potter doesn't disappoint!
Mature reader review of book 6
Still tugs but no tears this time.
read it in a day and a half
Not the best, but still very good
Best Potter yet
Actually would be 4.5 - my favorite so far
As with many other so-called children's books such as "Winnie ...
Not a child anymore
Simply Amazing
Another great book in the Harry Potter series
Extremely dark and many shockers!
Provisional Rating....
Half Blood Prince is a Whole Lot of Dazzling
JKR Sacrifices Dramatic Sweep For Brevity;  Result Is A Little Flat
Half-Blood All Action
J K Rowling is a master storyteller
Love and Sacrifice
Harry Potter - you just can't get enough!
My favorite Potter book
Saying goodbye to a major character is never easy, but at times necessary
The Chosen One Returns . . .
Great, but parents should screen it for little children
There are two types of reviews...
Chilling, Gripping, & Positively RIPping
Half... baked (Some spoilers)
Another Brilliant "Can't Put It Down" Book by J.K. Rowling
A bit of disappointment
As good as any Potter book yet
Things continue to get darker...
Great read
Half-Blood Prince only half baked
Dark n twisted
Dark, mature and more fun than ever
Yes, it sets up the next book nicely...but it's more than that!
Harry Potter - a triumph spectacular!
Harry just gets better with age
Ambiguous
A Transitional Book
Snape Snape, Severus snape.
Fantastic penultimate installment (no spoilers here)!
Astonishing, dark, engaging and complex, HBP is the best yet!
Spoilers!! Now gimmee book 7!!!
Great, but Still I'm Worried
Not the best in the series
Its a trust issue  (SPOILER)
Satisfactory, but missing the magic
Love the Character Development
bloodless prince actually (but still okay for kids) some spoiler stuff here
definetly what i expected
JK Rowlings scores another 5
My favorite book of the series

Wonderful books for all ages

Gripping, startling ending, if long
Excellent addition to the series and great set up for the finale.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
Another Rowling masterpiece
Darker, Scarier, Better. Ms. Rowling Keeps The Suspense (And More) Going. Great Set-Up For No. VII, The Final Novel.
So much more emotional than the movie. Even more than I remember from having read it before.
I heart Harry Potter
Disappointing, but still an interesting read.
this book screams READ ME!!!!!!
Not as good as some, but quite adequate, all in all
book of the year?
Great Story
YES I CRIED!!!
Another good one. Really
Another phenomenal Harry Potter book - and this one is the darkest in the series

More muggle than magic
A wonderful series
Very good, but a different read
Sad, but very good PLOT and Characters
Good for kids and adults who still recall being kids
Rowling, Rowling, Rowling!!
The darkest and most complex novel in the series
Say It Isn't So...
A gem of a book
Engaging, but ultimately disappointing
Another instant classic!
Bloody brilliant!!!!!

Living this series

It Left Me Wanting More!!
I have to admit it was good
Remarkable read!

Finally read it!
Love!
We're all Dumbledore's Men (and Women) through and through

Weaving the web
My opinion on the Half-blood prince
Surprised me!

The plot may be short, but it's anything but thin.
Just as good the second time
More Mediocre Than I would have Expected.
Not perfect, but not bad either.
Good book
Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince
Harry Potter as teacher
Not overhyped
ending is a doozy
4 stars and 1/2
Blurs the line between good and evil...
PURE CLASS!
My favorite out of the series
One of Rowling's best yet!
PG-13
I Love Harry Potter!
The different writing style doesn't flow with the precious books
Just Kept me reading page after page
Another great installment, from a terrific author.
Awesome
The worst one of the series
Cant wait for book 7!
Potter & Rowling still going strong!
like all the others
Harry Potter duhh
Something wicked this way comes
R.K. Rowling Keeps us in detective mode

Loved always
I liked it a lot!
Worth the Wait.  Well Worth the Wait
another great installment of the Harry Potter series This volume takes ...
We have to wait HOW LONG for the next book!?
Tension building for the finale...
Rowling's Best One Yet
The boy who lived becomes the boy who grew up...
More Substance But Less Magic
Precursor to the Finale
an ATTTEMPT at criticism . . .
Emotional rollercoaster and well worth the wait
A great addition to the already wonderful series
Would recommend
The Potter Saga Continues....
Well done audio book
SNAPE!!!
Fantastic all the way, Rowling does it again!
Lost the plot?

Good, but my least favorite in the series.
Unashamed Adult Fan
Awesome building block to the Seventh!
THE BEST ONE
Fast read, but not compelling
Keep Getting Better
Starts slow, picks up, but doesn't quite make sense
Not just children's fiction, it's a classic!
Onward, Harry
Extremely Disappointed
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a delight! The continuing series is mind blowing in detail and depth!
Feeling Jerry-Springered...
A Review of the Product, Not the Plot
In Keeping with the flow
Rowling's best yet!!!
Better than previous but a little long again
Coming of age for Harry

Good Stuff
Another hit in the series
amazing!
An excellent read
Three stars well-earned
Brilliantly written!

My favorite book (An Audio book review)
The Verdict:  Four Out Of Five Stars (No Spoilers)
This is a series!
I liked it very much
Will you enjoy this book?  Depends on your expectations
Not something you'd expect from children's lit.
Fun at times, but ultimately disappointing
Harry Potter and the Half Baked Plot
The battle is over... the war has started!
These books continue to thrill!
Five Stars
Thrilling, Suspensful, Heartwrenching, Joyful...It's Got It All!!
good ... but not great
Harry By Numbers
But I must say that I felt Harry to be pretty naive in this installment and it was kind of ...
Extraordinary
JK Rowling's Brilliance
Grade O
Excellent Series!
Harry Potter.
Glass Half-Full/Half-Empty?
Surprise Ending
My review is brief and positive!

A few notes on the hidden chapters . . .
My 2nd favorite of the series

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

A Very Appealing Read
HBP: Good, but could have been better.
Harry Potter mirrors our own dark world
Probably my favorite of the series so far
Part of history
and the survey says. . .
Year Six Baby!!
Well written book
Not a review, but a chance to discuss the HP series--WARNING:PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK DON'T READ, IT WILL SPOIL IT
Not for kids anyore...
Closing In on a Resolution, but Character Writing is Weak.
Not the best one of the series....but still didn't put it down.
Harry and Ginny Forever!!
Hazy and distant writing makes for mediocre book
Different from the movies
Amazing
HP :)
The end is near
Not the best in the series.
Set up nicely for the finale
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
A much needed turn in the series that provides a smooth transition into maturity
Five Stars

Guaranteed to Provoke a Remarkable Finish to the Harry Potter Series!
Rowling's depth hits again
Again, Rowling hits one over the fence
Great book
I still really enjoy
It's almost over :-(
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
J.k Rowling does it again
Setting up the pins for the final throw...
Enthralling (and Much Darker) to the End...
FANTASTIC
Such a great read.
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
The change in mood and increased maturity show a great deal of planning and forethought
Unbelievable events of betrayal, injustice, heroism and sacrifice
JK Rowlings proves herself an incredible author once again!
Still gets me after all this time.
Great
Wonderful read
I went at midnight to buy it and wasn't disappointed!
10 Stars

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
"I'm not afraid, Harry. I'm with you."
Darker...and Better
One of the best out of the extraordinary series...
One of the best from J.K. Rowling
Great, but do I have to wait another 2 years?!
Not a children's book
Amazing! But sad!
Loved it

Good, not the best though
I could not believe it!
Great Book!
Dutifully Disappointing
I was in such a bad mood when I finished
Couldn't stop reading
Harry grows up....
Not up to JK Rowling's standard
All my love
The strongest of the books so far
I don't know how she does it...
Has J K Rowling lost some of her magic?
Remember the 3 Ds
Loved it but am very mad about it too !!!!!!!!!!
to the idiot 5 below me... and this book is also ecxcellent :)
Maybe I can stop crying now...
Must-read
Set Up?
So many questions, and we have to wait another 2 (?) years for the answers!
Book 6 is important no matter what readers may say...
It’s Harry Potter, need I say more??
Nothing bad to say. Worth every minute spent reading and rereading.
Fantastic fantasy
More
Brilliant
Ending Didn't Feel Right
Not so fast there, buster!
Just gets better and better
... time and then draws out a few events -- like the Goblet of Fire
Good but not as good as the hype
Only Potter book I hadn't read. Continues the Potter ...
Just fantastic!
Worth the Wait
My second fav HP book
Praises for the Half-Blood Prince
Simply Outstanding
Another Winner for Jim Dale and Harry Potter
I am less than half-pleased
to those who are stupidly reading reviews of HP6 before finishing it, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!
The Plots Thicken....
Best of the Series
My boy loves it

Can't wait for the last book!
A Jaw-dropping chapter of a great series
Breathtaking
Amazing!
In response to previous persons, and a continuation...
Good, not as great as one would expect..

Jk Rowling as usual wrote an exciting and immersive story ...
Another classic
I can't WAIT for the next one!!!
Happy
The best in quite a while
J.K. Rowling HAS NOT lost her touch with these wonderful books!
A Truly Wonderful Read

Smiley's review
Harry Potter jumps the shark
Number 6 down....
A quite different experience...
Delicious & Nutritious...J.K. Does it again!
Good Harry Potter suspense.
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
90% back story, 10% exciting action
a bit of a let-down
A Fan of J.K. Rowling since the begining...
We all expected it, but we still love it
Nothing compares.
HARRY POTTER IS MY LIFE!!!
Half Bad Prince
More low keyed than the others - I smell a major diversion!
But he loved it. He read it at 9 years old
Perhaps my hopes indeed WERE to high...
though this (review, book) may not be what you expect,
Bigstickdaddy
Love Harry Potter
HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!!
Unfulfilling
Harry the man

These Harry Potter books are my all time favorite books, and I have read a ton of books!  This is my second time reading the series (I  have read The Sorcerer's Stone twice, The Chamber Of Secrets twice, The Prisoner Of Azkaban twice, The Goblet Of Fire twice, The Order Of The Phoenix twice, now The Half Blood Prince twice, have started reading The Deathly Hallows for the second time, have read Harry's text book Fantastic Beasts, Quidditch Through Th Ages, and The Tales Of Beadle The Bard all once, and have watched all the movies once including Fantastic Beasts.  You may realize it sounds as though I've been reading your books for years, but I really only started a year ago!  Thanks so much for writing the best books ever!  I also would like to let you know I am looking forward to seeing the new movie on Grindelvald!
