Tested against the negative comments, all but one are true! Love this Fitbit!
Fitbit Customer Service is the WORST!!!
I didn't like the product itself
FITBIT for SENIORS and Retirement
I was very happy when the Fitbit Alta HR was announced
I love my Fitbit
Worth it!
Slit fit, but not slim capabilities
Meh
Worthless, Inaccurate, Returned  :-(
Defunct product
I don’t know what happen all I know I have never had an issue like this. I spent extra money on extra large ...
Love this!!!!!!!
Always a fight to sync and Fitbit support is completely useless.
WARNING - Has Charging Problems with this Model. Be ready to send it  back under warranty.
Perfect for me.
Malfunctioning, and Broken IOS App= Useless
Dead on Arrival
Doesn't illuminate without smacking and whacking
Wonderful!
Worthless for exercise
Sleek look and great battery life
Heart Rate drops completely during workout session
*you can set up multiple fitbits under your account :)
I like the concept of how this product tracts sleep
Looked nice for a little while, but failed to unusable about 60 days post warranty.
Quick death
Defective
TWO Defective devices...more work needs to be done
Fits very tiny wrist, mine is just under 5.5 inches!
Sleep Tracking Doesn't Work!  Stay away!
Does Not Sync With Most Android Devices or Mac Seirra OS -- DO NOT BUY!
Horrible Product
Battery defective
It has got everything but the charge.
We love that you can use a phone app to track ...
NOT WORTH THE MONEY
Read the product warning about sun sensitivity
Walk firmly
Total waste of money
Cheap product and poor customer support
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!  NIGHT SHIFT NOT ALLOWED TO USE FEATURES!!!!!
Very disappointing! Worked for two days now won't sync ...
Effective and efficient for an office worker with no gym membership
Good movement tracker, USELESS for workouts, dim in bright light
New?  No Charging cable?
Eh... Loved it at first.
Because of such great reviews, exchanged it & got a 2nd one
Must be worn 24/7 to work properly!
Nice HR Tracker
Worth the extra $50
I bought this product mid-June 2017. It died mid-Sept ...
Unreliable
Battery tanks after 9 months
Disappointing compared to Garmin
Not worth the money for what it does and it stops doing it after a while anyway
with money i got for Christmas i shopped until i felt like i really foud the perfect fitbit for me
Good, but I think it can get better!
Alta doesn't do much
So far so good...
Love it so much I bought stock in FITBIT !
Adjusted steps and it is great.
battery not staying charged
Good for steps and heart rate, not good for much else
Never get a Fitbit again, especially through amazon. No refund!
Very happy!!!!!
DON'T BUY THIS!
Fine Tracker, Awful Android Support
Small and smart looking
Do not waste your money
Soo good, I got my Mom one!
Alta HR
Very Disappointing Product
Today unboxed it and totally in love. My wrist circumference is 16cm and was in ...
No Strava HR monitor integration or cycling
Poor construction
Don't know what I did before my FitBit Alta HR!
Falls off wrist
I wish they stood behind their products better
Great upgrade from Alta.  The rose gold color was not worth the extra cost.
Wish I had done more research before wasting my time and money
Sleek and Sleep - best features
Worth it! I love it! Holds me accountable and provides information about my activity I've always wanted to know.
Poor Quality
***So accurate it's scary. Why did I wait so long to purchase?
Fitbit Alta HR Sync Issues
Great purchase at discount prices.  Phone app blocks some biking functionality needlessly.
Great slim look with big capabilities
I have went through so many fitbits
Wear it in the correct position on the wrist. It makes a difference.
Lovely but not completely 100%
Great fitness tracker, attractive watch, LOVE interchangeable bands...good job, Fitbit!  :)
Good step counter, heart rate monitor is very inaccurate
Meh, I should have gotten the charge 3
Take control of your health!
Love it.
Pretty much, any other product is better
Love my FitBit!
Life changing tool!
which is great. But
I love my Fitbit!
Good Motivator But Didn’t last- Battery died in 9 months
Steps tracking is a hoax/joke
Christmas gift defective out of the box
Great product, small footprint
Walking active time not accurate. (Update)
Fitbit no longer stocking replacement bands
Wristbands have a design flaw that results in them breaking
Unreliable tracker & poor-quality product
I really like the sleep monitoring feature
Best device I've purchased this year, and I didn't think I would like it, ha!
Worked for less than 24 hours... but i liked it while it worked
Tracking Not Consistent
The Band Will Eventually Break
Overrated and awful. Not recommended.
Only 14 months and it's DEAD?
It work, but the Charge 2 is much better
Did not have good experience with this product.
Bought this for Nana!
Taken care of
I've just received it and started tracking my exercise. ...
Works great.... while it works
HR monitor A+
Inaccurate heart reading
If you're just looking for basic data, this is a good fitness watch.
Doesn't track all exercises
NOT DURABLE!
Lasted 15 months
I read reviews about how good the HR monitor is and I got excited
Love, love love my new Fitbit
Very Unhappy with the Fitbit Alta
Doesn’t keep count of the steps correctly!
I would say that I like the Alta’s size
It died right after after the warranty died!
Did not work from Day 1
Very disappointed with this product
Does not meet expectations.
Fitbit
Best purchase of the year!
Return window too short
Can't imagine my life without it!
Absolutely Great
Issues
The pink band does get dirty pretty easily
Bluetooth Sync Syncing Connection
Expensive sleep tracker
Defective Battery Issue - Beware!
Like the watch but has limitations
Worked great for 1 year, then died a few months outside of warranty
Bluetooth connectivity is frustrating.
I really like this product
Pretty good alternative to the Charge HR
Excellent Product, Worth the Buy
Last 3 to 6 months. Dies at one year. Purchase warranty

Wife loves it.
Sleek design and replaceable band
I had been pleased with the Alta HR so far but the band ...

What is required to make it work?
Will not receive phone (Android) notifications
Love fitbit!
Great for my needs
Great little device, easy set-up.
Nice Device WHEN IT WORKS !!!!
Don't sure if mine was defective or what but I'm VERY disappointed that many of the ALta HR features did not work.
Quality and support issues
I do like it but the larger version for about the same ...
Only lasted 6 months before it DIED!
Solid data, user-ability not perfect
Bad Bluetooth
5 stars because I haven't had any issues with this ...
Really enjoying!
Worth the extra $$ over the silver version
Has Pros and Cons
Change in lifestyle
Sweat causes inaccurate HR during workouts
Discreet and comfortable
Doesn't Sync
If you hold yourself accountable and use the tools, it helps make major lifestyle improvements!
Dirty too quickly!
Not worth the money, it broke after 2 months ...
Customer support

I probably would have loved this if I could have gotten it working with ...
Exercise-lovers: caution! No button! Returned for a different model

worst Fitbit model I've ever used
Great for tracking steps & sleep
Small wristband & difficult display
The Fitbit hr Review
Good, almost great
not accurate
Band Broke and Screen Cracked in less than one year of use.
The tracking is good. I like it
A few things lacking but over all good.
Poor Design: 1) Alta HR module failure, 2) band failure
Great.
Around 90%+ accurate
Much better than Fitbit Charge
Size matters.
Just doesn't work
It looks beautiful, very sleek
Expensive and inaccurate tracking
Prefer Alta HR over Charge HR - so far so good
Fitbit Alta and Allta HR
Fitbit works great but band breaks far too easily
95% amazing
less then 3 months and it's dead.
Don't forget the dongle if computer doesn't have Bluetooth
Love the size
Good, but could be better.
Health at a glance
I love it! When I had my old Charge HR ...
The fitbit and the app are good. My main complaint is about the wristband
I really want to love this Fitbit Alta HR
Love it so far
Extremely disappointed.
Beware of wrist strap breaks and Fitbit falling off
Replacement for an older Fitbit model

Awesome Fitbit with Heart Rate
Wife very happy with it.
Fell apart in 3 months
Unimpressive
I like it, but have to get used to it after having a Charge
BE WARNED - FITBITS I'VE PURCHASED IN PAST ALWAYS SEEMS TO MALFUNCTION JUST AFTER  AYEAR!!
Make sure your phone is on the list.
Not accurate
I like the constant heart rate monitor
Never thought I would want an activity tracker, but loving this one so far.
All I wanted except counts some extra steps when I bump my arm ☹️
Favorite FitBit yet!
Disappointed
Not worth it
Item arrived defective/unfixable
Sleep tracker
Great except for Heart Rate feature.
Poor quality glass
Worked for 5 months before it stopped
Disappointing
All and all, I love it!
That encourages me to sleep better.
Worked great for the first month
I am very happy I decided on the Fitbit Alta HR
Sleep cycle not consistently registered
Inaccurate HR makes this no better than a regular Alta
Love my Fitbit Alta
I like the band for the Alta HR
Great service!
What a waste.
Surprisingly easy to use and set up
Not for sweaty arms
Awesome!  Best tracker yet!
Defective
Be aware of the band
Stops syncing with my phone!

Good Tracker, TERRIBLE plastic band
Battery fails just after warranty period
Fabulous features.
Very good Fitbit
Counts arm movements
Inaccurate step counter
There is no option to manually track an activity while doing it.
Stains quickly & easily
Bluetooth Clunky, strap comes loose.
Disappointed  in  product quality
Nice but needs a couple improvements in my opinion
Love my fitbit
Not as simple and user friendly as I thought.
jeez
... flip your wrist because the light doesn't stay on like in the Charge HR
I'm very happy with this product
1. Be prepared for a little frustration swiping/tapping through the screen readouts, until you get use it. Charge before setup.
Don't buy for sleep stage tracking.
Love love love
very nice
Upgraded Fitbit
Failed after 2 months due to APP Maintnance?
Constant stream of buggy patches and updates makes an initially good device too problematic to use
Functional with comfortable design
Would not pair
Comfortable and accurate
Great motivation
VERY Expensive MISTAKE $$$
Great Upgrade
Does not sync to A LOT of phones
On my 3rd device in less than 2 months.....poor build quality

Great for tracking steps and sleep tracking
I got the Alta HR and I love the way it looks
Good, but should've not only retained but added to the Charge 2 features.
So far I love it. I tend to be rough on Fitbits
It's not waterproof which I think is apart of the design requirements but really sucks either way
Akku is not charging correctly. After hours of charging, it still shows “Akku half full”
Not the unit for me too many problems
The Alta HR is pretty good, I am being a bit critical here
Thank you!
Absolutely LOVE my new Alta
Sad
Highly recommend!!!

Good motivation for being Fit !

Piece of Crap (second fitbit to die inside 1 year)

terrible customer service from fitbit
I like my Alta HR
Waste of money:  dead at the two year mark
It’s good
Well-made with great features... BUT BEWARE! Check compatibility before buying!!!
NO BRIGHTNESS OPTION SO I CANT READ IN THE SUNLIGHT
Not a good product.
Screen cracks easily, known problem
Be Aware of Rose Gold Light Pink Band Discoloration
Good... but...
Love it! It's slim and feminine
Not reliable
Heart rate monitor off by 30+ bpm while exercising
What I wish I'd known before I bought a FitBit
Inaccurate Step Count.
Under Reports Steps..
So inaccurate it’s useless
Cheap materials and not worth the price
A decent vital stat tracker but a terrible watch.
One Star
Motivating if you ignore the faulty HR
COUNTS DOG PETTING AS STEPS!
Inaccurate in every way
Completey inaccurate heartrate, wrong steps, eventually stopped syncing
This device is awful at everything that it purports to do.
Don't waste the money for rose gold/pink
Avoid
Go! Go! Go!
Pretty good but wish now I had got the larger one with less clunky functionality

Nice tracker, but some flaws
Caused strange twitching, had to return
Very accurate readings, great app, but charger inconvenient

Great tracker
Mine was defective in several respects
Fun toy, but not for serious training.
Somewhat Let Down
Exercise tracking stopped working.
Lasted just over a year before malfunctioning
Fun and useful watch
Nice tracker in principle, but prone to glitches
Awesome sauce-get with the fitness already
Heart rate accurate, sleep monitor interesting, step count completely inaccurate
Extremely Inaccurate
Considering Fitbit vs Apple Watch?

Not a good replacement for the One - just not accurate
Dies just after warranty

Heart Rate isn't Accurate
a year later I have a useless Aria scale
If move hands a lot is not accurate
wish it was waterproof.  tracks my bike commute.
My Nike watch worked a lot better than this one did
MUST HAVE!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!
Bluetooth is finicky and interferes with headphones
Grocery store steps don't count? Boooooo
Great color, fits well.
Lots of customizable bands!
Husband loves it. Has him more exercise conscious.
Happy with my Fitbit Alta
Warning: NOT A LONG LASTING PRODUCT.
So useful and pretty.
