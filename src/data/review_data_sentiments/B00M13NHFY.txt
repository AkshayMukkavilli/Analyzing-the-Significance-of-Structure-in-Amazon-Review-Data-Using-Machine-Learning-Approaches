 1 Body has lost a loyal customer in me this morning, when I realized that they have switched the formula to a cheaper version of B12, while the listing images and description state it's a good form of B12 (Methylcobalamin). It's false advertising. I believe the customers have the right to know that they will receive a different formula than it is advertised.<br/><br/>I have been taking 1body Thyroid support for a few months. It has been working great - my sleep has improved greatly and I started feeling better overall. But for the past couple of months it went back to where I used to be - no good sleep and being fatigued all the time. So I started thinking that I need to stop this supplement, because it is doing no good to me, just makes me feel worse. In addition, I started having constant nagging pain in my liver area. From my past experience, I know it is caused by B12 Cyanocobalamin. I double checked the ingredients and sure enough - it's wasn't Methylcobalamin anymore, on both bottles I had (one was already empty, and one just started).<br/>I have chosen this brand specifically because of the good ingredients, as stated online. But I haven't been checking the ingredients of every single bottle I bought from 1 body (just the first order). I have no idea at which point I started taking the bad form of B12 without even knowing it.<br/> Should I have known about the ingredient change, I would have stopped buying it immediately.<br/>I’m looking for a better formula and more trustworthy brand now.
 As we age, our thyroid may lose some of it effectiveness. This can result in thinning hair; dry skin, gaining weight, feeling tired- just no energy, yaydyayda...and who has to deal with this the most- why, women of course! As if we haven't had enough to deal with throughout our life...just sayin'.  Anyway, 1Body's Thyroid Support has given me just the boost I needed. I have been taking this now for about 5 months and I am more energetic, my hair is shinier and my appetite has improved- with no weight gain- actually a bit of weight loss. Can all of these terrific changes be attributed to this product? Maybe not, but I sincerely feel it has given me the boost I needed- at age 71. I have to say, any boost at my age is greatly appreciated!
 I took these supplements for a month, as well as the adrenal ones (I'm going to leave the same review on both), with one Adrenal Support capsule in the morning and one Thyroid Support in the evening. I then stopped taking them for a month and now have started taking them regularly again. Here are my experiences:<br/><br/>I was always tired and had difficulty sleeping, and would wake up in the morning feeling like I hadn't slept at all. I have also had chronic pain related to fibromyalgia for a long time. After having some tests done, my doctor told me about Adrenal Fatigue, and I did some reading about theories of how fibromyalgia is related to the body being stuck in "fight or flight" mode after a physical or psychological trauma. I had also had difficulty losing weight over the last five years, stuck on a plateau no matter what dietary changes, supplements, or excercise routines I tried. So the Adrenal Fatigue (and other hormonal problems related to the thyroid) diagnosis brought into view what could be causing or contributing to all of my problems. Reading about various natural solutions, I came across 1Body's products and decided to give them a try.<br/><br/>Oh My Goodness. I wish I had found this sooner. I started sleeping better, waking up feeling rested, and that alone can fix so many health issues. I was also feeling more energetic throughout the day, not even feeling an afternoon slump or desire to nap. And to top it off, I didn't change my diet (I already eat a "healthy" diet, I know that's subjective, but most different dietary points of view these days agree on eating lots of vegetables, fish, and plant proteins and fats) and suddenly started steadily losing weight. I lost 10 pounds without changing anything but taking the 1Body Adrenal and Thyroid supplements, AND I started fitting comfortably into clothes that used to be too tight.<br/><br/>When I stopped taking them for a month, I rode the high I was on for a while, continuing to sleep well and feel full of energy. It gradually declined, and before starting to take them again a few days ago, I felt like I needed to stay in bed all day and still not feel rested enough, again. I'm not saying I think I will have to take these for the rest of my life. My suspicions are that my hormonal levels took years/decades to get as bad as they are, and so I shouldn't expect to fix them in only one month. Hopefully, taking a month's worth and taking a short (not another month) break and then repeating the cycle, will eventually get my body re-programmed to function on it's own again. I'm trying to undo the physical damage of PTSD and I think this product is what I've been needing to do that.
 This product has been a life saver.<br/><br/>I realized  I was suffering from hypothyroidism. Extreme hair loss and bald spots, exhaustion, rapid weight gain no matter how much working out or clean eating. Swelling and water retention, dry skin &amp; hormonal imbalance, TOM would be extreme and last weeks!!<br/><br/>Within just a couple days of using this product, I noticed a huge change.  I have tons of baby fine hair growing in all my bald spots. My skin is no longer dry and cracking. I am finally seeing weight-loss results from working out and eating healthy.<br/><br/>I love Thyroid support. Nothing worse than not knowing what's wrong with your body and feeling terrible all the time. I am so thankful for this company.
 Recent bloodwork indicated my Free T4, Free T3 and TSH numbers were slightly below the normal range.  I was experiencing some fatigue  which led to my physician’s desire to check my thyroid function.  Once these measures were known, I discussed taking a natural approach with my physician so she reviewed the contents of this product and approved my use.  I purchased my first bottle of Thyroid Support two months ago and I feel so much more energized now.  Just had my thyroid numbers checked again last week and all were well within the normal range.  I was delighted!  I began the monthly prescription program so I would not forget to keep this wonderful product on hand.  I prefer natural remedies to prescription medications - this product delivered for me.
 So I have Hypothyroidism and have been researching &amp; buying products non stop trying to do everything and anything not to feel like a fat, exhausted, stressed out zombie anymore.  I have been taking this along with the Adrenal Support product (same brand) for less then a month and have noticed a dramatic positive change in my mood and energy increase.  I would not count on taking this alone and think that all of your symptoms will just magically disappear- this is a great tool but you have to start eating healthy if you want to get your metabolism back and to feel even better.  I have cut out gluten, soy, wheat, and have dairy sparingly, I take my levothyroxine, B1 vitamins, this Thyroid support along with the Adrenal Support, drink almost a gallon of water a day, and I have noticed huge-huge-huge changes from only less then a month ago.  Everyone is different but if anyone is reading this- pay attention to the way you feel after eating certain foods...if you feel bloated and tired after eating a certain food then you should cut that out.  I also cook with coconut oil instead of any of the other oils.  I hope this helps someone!
 It seems to be helping with some of my physical symptoms (dry/scaly skin and half moons returning in finger nails) already. I am not, however, noticing benefits with always feeling cold, depression/anxiety or energy yet! The bottle I bought did not have B12 as METHYLCOBALAMIN. It has Cyanocobalamin instead and I am allergic to that form of B12. I may have to stop taking this product for that reason alone and do not want to. Who wants to ingest cyanide (poison), even if in trace amounts anyway? Can you please send my free bottle with METHYLCOBALAMIN, so I can see if that makes a big difference for me? On Amazon it is advertised that it contains METHLYCOBALAMIN, so I didn't expect that to be an issue at all and hope it will not be in the future.<br/><br/>Will update rating and review, if my free and future bottles contain METHYLCOBALAMIN, as advertised. That is the only reason I rated this product with one star.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for a great product otherwise,<br/>Healthy88
 I have been complaining to my doctor about my fatigue, constantly feeling cold, lethargy, thinning hair, dry skin, and every time he checks my thyroid guess what he says?  " oh not to worry you're in the normal range." I almost feel like it is a conspiracy against women.  Because every woman I have talked to says their doctor says the same thing when they complain about the same symptom.  My hair was falling out ! I took straight iodine for a little while and it did nothing for my symptoms.  Well, I just finished my first bottle of this thyroid support and I swear to god I feel like a completely different person.  My boyfriend says "you're not cold anymore."  I have energy and vitality throughout the day and just yesterday the boyfriend says "Your hair is getting thick." My mood has lifted, I'm sleeping better at night.  My appetite is different too.  No constant carb and sweet cravings so it feels like my clothes are fitting looser.  You know that feeling?  I just ordered another bottle since i just finished my first bottleI don't typically like to give reviews but this stuff is great. I told my doctor about it and he snorted and said "oh SUPPLEMENTS" and rolled his eyes.  Like that's a bad thing that I haven't felt this good in years.  '
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a little over a month now and have lost 15 pounds. I also just started taking Nature-throid with it. I have been struggling with hypothyroid for 5 years. My doctor put me on synthroid only and I could not lose weight. This product is wonderful!
 6 weeks in and this product has truely changed my life. I had been to the doctors to get tested for thyroid issues because I had a growing goiter. They said it all came back perfect but my thyroid kept getting bigger, so I tried this.  Effects were noticed around 3 weeks and keep improving: goiter shrinking rapidly, acne completely clears up (30 years old and have ALWAYS had adult acne), chronic back pain gone, lost 15 lbs, less bruises, better hair, decreased forgetfulness, more energy.  You have to try this product!  Even though my goiter didn't start up until last year, these results show me that I have probably had thyroid problems my whole life, even though my tests results came back fine.  I have always been made to feel like problems were all in my head, but clearly they were not. This fixed so many problems that I had no idea were all related! Stick it out at least 2 months, it will be the best $50 you spend.
 Does it work? Should you purchase this? Can you trust the reviews???<br/><br/>I've been ordering Thyroid support for over a year and for me it has absolutely helped. I haven't received free samples for a review. I'm someone that tried out the product due to my condition of feeling internally cold/freezing all the time. Thyroid support has about 90% eliminated my freezing problem and taken care of other conditions I wasn't really paying attention to; waking up sore and aching, excessive running nose, hoarse voice if talking on the phone for several minutes.<br/><br/>I recall waking up in the morning and feeling like somebody used me as a punching bag, even after a good long night's sleep. I used to feel so cold internally that there was times I'd violently shake - now, sometimes I might feel cold but it's like a minor distraction and the aching soreness is completely gone. The running nose is greatly reduced as is the voice hoarseness.<br/><br/>If you're reading this review because of your symptoms, I hope this product (or even a competitors' supplement) works for you as well as it did for me.
 Having recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism after suffering with symptoms for a couple of years, I immediately began researching for a natural supplement versus the doctor-prescribed Levothyroxine. Based on other great reviews, I selected Thyroid Support in hopes that I, too, would experience positive results. And I did! Within five days of taking the supplement as directed, I no longer had joint pain and stiffness in my toes, ankles, fingers, and wrists. The daily headaches and extreme fatigue also subsided. Now after taking this supplement for nearly three weeks, I have more energy when it comes to facing daily tasks. I have also regained my focus, and I no longer feel overwhelmed when my day takes unexpected turns. Many of my digestive issues are much improved, and losing four pounds is a nice bonus, too. Overall, I feel like myself again and have happily returned to enjoying an active lifestyle with my family and friends. I am hoping for positive results with my upcoming lab tests. Thank you, 1 Body, for this wonderful product and for your top notch customer support!<br/><br/>UPDATE: After taking one 30 day supply of Thyroid Support, my TSH is now within normal limits--from 5.97 to 3.92. I'm so happy with the results I have since ordered two more bottles!
 I noticed a dramatic change within several days. I workout as a bodybuilder, powerlifter and weightlifter, and runner,not to mention that I’m a personal trainer who trains 50+ hours a week. I was still experiencing bloating! So my body depletes of its nutrition very very quickly, so having a hypothyroid was causing serious fatigue, foggy brain, very depressed days, lack of motivation, hair falling out, waking up very tired even with a full nights sleep. AND NOW- oh my goodness! I woke up this morning feeling completely rested! Ready for the day. I can see my mental state lifting. My body is burning fat like it used to when i was in my early 30’s.
 I had been complaining to my doctor about my fatigue, constantly feeling cold, lethargy, thinning hair, dry skin, and every time he checks my thyroid guess what he says? " oh not to worry you're in the normal range." I started seeing a more holistic doctor and she is finally figuring it all out for me. I am almost finished with my first bottle of this thyroid support and I feel like a completely different person. I am not cold anymore, I have energy and vitality throughout the day and it seems like my hair is improving, too. My mood is better, I'm sleeping well, and I don't have constant carb cravings so it feels like my clothes are fitting looser.
 The reason? Because I have the energy to carry on a conversation with another person, and the energy to type a letter. Go back, fix my mistakes, and edit it. Because I have the mental energy to process regular thought again. Read below to find out why I just bought 6 more bottles, even though I'm not done with the first. Read below to hear about my battle with depression, and social anxiety. My battle to stay awake every day for the past 8 months. I have lost a ton of weight (unexpected side effect!) - after having gained 70 lbs in the last 12 months.<br/><br/>Long story short - I got TIRED of being TIRED. SO TIRED. I had to do something. This product has saved my life and I've only been taking it for 3 weeks.<br/><br/>Over the summer I went on a family vacation. When I saw my wife who is older then me, and weighs the same as me doing things that I should be able to do with relative ease - but was unable to do, I knew something was wrong. I'm 27 and she's 32.<br/><br/> I've had a life long issue with depression and social anxiety all of my life. 2.5 yrs ago I was prescribed Zoloft, Seroquel, Gabapentin and Remeron. It's been working great - it's turned my life around for the better. Up until around January of this year, I experienced a severe downturn in my energy and motivation. I talked to my psychiatrist. That was 6 weeks ago. I was diagnosed with atypical depression. Which means - you likely won't have problems with anxiety/depression. Instead you'll have issues with motivation, emotion, empathy, feeling, energy. That same day 6 weeks ago I was prescribed Wellbutrin, and was told to ween myself off of Gabapentin which I found of no beneficial use. My anxiety and depression since January have been in complete check, but my energy was SO washed up. When I say in check - like my parents could die and I would just shrug my shoulders. Everything just bounced off me, and it was increasingly difficult to connect with my wife and son. This became a huge issue, but I did manage to overcome it. My motivation for doing things was gone. My involvement in social activities was non existent. It didn't matter if it was raining outside or sunny. Details didn't matter. I'd wake up - with little to no energy and just did not care about anything anymore. I wasn't suicidal, but my emotions were extremely muted. Another problem was - every 20 seconds I was yawning. I could barely keep my eyes open all day - not without taking several naps during the day, even after sleeping 10 hours/day. In all I was probably sleeping 12-14 hours a day with naps, with the rest of my waking hours being taken as very light/minimal activity (computer surfing, watching movies, etc). I'm self employed so I'm very fortunate to set my own schedule.  Walking across the room was a chore. Sleeping and waking up after 8-10 hours felt like I had only slept 2 hours max.<br/><br/>After 3 weeks of being prescribed the Wellbutrin I noticed my motivation to do my daily routine and work was getting much better. I wasn't feeling like a zombie emotionally as much anymore - but my energy levels were still WAY WAY off. I thought, there's got to be more to this. I was now on Wellbutrin for 4 weeks - which is the week this stuff really kicks in. That's the final week after it's to have built up in your system - and at that point its either going to work or not. While I experienced and started to care about things again, showed more empathy towards others - my energy was still WAY WAY off. Several things went through my head at that point. I knew that I didn't always used to feel like this. I forgot that there was an actual "normal" waking energy. It had been so long however since I felt normal that I didn't know I was suffering from anything - of course not until the Summer family vacation trip.  I knew something was wrong, but didn't know where to start. I asked my parents if thyroid issues run in our family. My mother said her mother had thyroid issues. I thought, I might as well give it a shot. I bought the product shown on Amazon by 1 Body (this listing - it was the best ranked and seemed most legit), and tried it. 3 days later, and after taking it once in the morning once in the evening I noticed my energy and anxiety were much better. This was after 3 days - and only after the previous night of getting a solid 9 hours worth of sleep. After 72 hours, and that first morning - I literally flung up out of bed. That was the first day I noticed like - whoa... I'm alive, and I can move and walk and talk. I remember the next day waking up, and just laying in my bed for another 2-3 hours with my eyes wide awake. Not because I didn't have the energy to get up, but because I felt so calm and so serene in that moment. I felt not a care in the world. Not in a "zombie-like" Zoloft type of fashion, but just thinking over how thankful I am, and what sort of goals/plans I had that I could set out to do that day. I felt like I was floating on clouds. My mood was much more stabilized, and my nerves were MUCH calmer. I didn't have the daily jitters. I just had a great sense of overall wellbeing. I've been taking this daily now for 3 weeks. I'm actually taking it about 3 times per day. And I'm at a loss of words (well not really, I did write this review), but I'm COMPLETELY shocked.  I'm a huge skeptic for these types of products. I've been burned hardcore in the past on probably 9 out of every 10 supplements.<br/><br/>During the last 12 months I gained around 70 lbs. From 190 to 260. Everyday during the last 12 months my diet hasn't really been that great. In the past I would write down what I would eat. I've done rabbit diets, juicing and keto (low carb), and a bunch of others. More recently I would just eat anywhere from 3000-5500 worth of calories. Whatever was in the fridge, freezer, pantry of closest fast food restaurant. A few Cheeseburgers, Doritos, Coke Zero, Frozen Dinners, whatever. A very VERY unexpected but VERY welcoming side effect from this product is the EXTREME curb of appetite that I'm experiencing. For sure I give that benefit to the Forskolin, I'm sure a few others as well. I'M NEVER HUNGRY ANYMORE, NEVER. The medications I'm on (specifically Remeron) is actually prescribed to patients with Cancer/AIDs or severe eating disorders due to the fact that it causes an extreme case of munchies. Think - marijuana times 420.. Zoloft does this too (but not as extreme). Seroquel is in the same boat. I'm prescribed 30mg Remeron. For 2 weeks last year during 4th of July - I was prescribed 45 mg Remeron. I remember going to a BBQ, and eating 12 Cheeseburgers and still being hungry. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy. My wife had to pull me away from the table, and reminded me to save food for others. That's how crazy strong these prescription medications are. I'm now back on 30mg so the increased appetite affect isn't as bad as it used to be. I remember in 2 weeks I gained 16 lbs last year during that month - immediately I made my doctor aware that while I do have problems with Anxiety/Depression, nothing was worth my physical health along with risking T2 Diabetes - so I opted for a synergy of Zoloft 50mg + Remeron 30mg instead of just a higher dose of Remeron 45mg.. Luckily I have been relatively fortunate to get by with little side effects from these medications, with the exception of weight gain. I guess we all pay a price to get better sometimes.  That's part of why I've gained so much weight in the last 12 months.<br/><br/> Now that I've been on this supplement for a few weeks, everyday since I've actually had to force myself to eat, just to get through the day. I'm going 6-8 hours at a time just completely forgetting to eat. Which in my position is a great problem to have. I'm having to adjust my diet to fix this - but I'm going to make sure it's done right, and most importantly, healthy. I'm not stuffing my face with Ice Cream, Cheetos and Pizza. In turn - when I actually am hungry I've chosen to replace my daily intake of foods with MCT Oil, Fruit/Vegetable smoothies which include Flax/Chia/Psylium/Acai Powder/and concentrated Green vegetable Super greens, Greek Yogurt, Hummus, Soup, etc. No more junk food like pretzels or Cheetos, but foods that are substantial. No simple carbs, instead opting for complex carbs. No more ice cream, instead pasta. I actually bought a few cases of Ensure (220 calorie protein shakes) from Amazon today - to be delivered in a few days to myself, because I'm forgetting to eat! I gained about 50 lbs during my atypical depression phase (last 8 months having started this phase in January) . For the past 8 months I would just wake up, roll over, watch TV, go back to bed, rinse and repeat. Luckily for my job I'm self employed so I have the freedom to make my own hours.<br/><br/> During the last few weeks after being on Wellbutrin and this supplement - I've already completed 50% of my yearly to-do list done. FINALLY got my taxes done. Got my drivers license updated. Scheduled a bunch of house repairs. Cleaned up the garage. Doubled the work load with our office. Prior to taking this supplement AND Wellbutrin I hadn't even STARTED work on this list. Even 4 weeks after Wellbutrin I hadn't started either - not until adding this supplement. I made this list in February of this year. I've also lost an astounding 8 lbs in the last 3 weeks. I have the energy again to clean my house, do work on the fly. Early in the morning, and late at night. Conversing with other people - I'm able to have a conversation with them for 30 minutes to a few hours, without feeling like every word spoken is the last breath I have in me. I'm having to FORCE myself to eat - which is a much better position to be in than just eating a tub of ice cream and praying THIS tub doesn't trigger Diabetes 2 (which runs in my family). Prior to taking this, I found myself looking in the mirror every morning and just being dissapointed in myself.<br/><br/>The skeptic in me wanted to get something for energy. The skeptic in me didn't think this would work. The skeptic in me has tried to prove to himself in the past that other herbal supplements gave me SOME benefit even if I couldn't prove it.  I've tried weight loss supplements non stop over the years. Spending upward of $500 on different products over and over. Garcinia Cambogia, Green Coffee Bean Extract, Kidney Bean Extract, Thermo Products.. anyone?? You know, all those products Dr. Dre endorses and then some. I've scoured the Amazon Top 500 list in Health and Personal care, looking for the latest, greatest and best - for weight loss. I've gone through all of those. While I WANT to admit to myself they work - I could never really see a difference. Instead, I'd just buy them again a few more times - eventually just stopping because it became a money pit and I may have lost 1-2 lbs in 2 months. Could be water weight. I bought this to aid myself in the energy department. Instead what I got was something WAY more than I could ever ask for.  I didn't buy this for the weight loss. I didn't buy this for the calmness and serenity. I bought it because I had problems with energy. For a PRESUMED issue I may or may not have. It was a shot in the dark. Right on the money. My energy problems are fixed. My energy has done a complete 180. Instead of eating 2500-4000 I'm eating 500 calories/day if I "forget" to eat or 1200-1800 calories when I force myself to eat.<br/><br/>Within the last 2 days I've re-incorporated MCT Oil back into my diet. I figured it was a MUST have. This will also aid in energy and increased weight loss BIG time. In the last few weeks there were several days in a row where I woke up feeling like absolute crap. I put it all together and it was because I had been forgetting to eat. Not getting enough calories, or fat. I've corrected that, and started drinking around 80+ oz of water a day instead of just Coke Zero. Still love Coke Zero but I'm forcing myself to drink more water than before.<br/><br/>I forget all of the ingredients in this supplement.<br/>I believe the Ashwaganda is good for calmness/serenity.<br/>Forskolin is good for appetite suppression.<br/>L-Tyrosine for calmness/serenity.<br/>Iodine for the actual thyroid issue.<br/>I'm sure all the ingredients work synergistically. I'm no scientist, but if I was I'd say this is some sort of miracle combination. Miracle being my scientific conclusion.<br/><br/>Right now I'm taking 3 day. 1 when I wake up, 1 in the afternoon, 1 before bed. I know it says 2/day, but there's no harm here in taking 3. I actually find it working better to take 3 instead of 2. I see myself taking this for a long time to come. Infact I bought 6 more today from 1 Body, and saved 25% (coupon is listed on the page, if you buy 3,4,5,6 you get X% off as of August 22 2015) so instead of paying $25 bottle, I ended up paying $18.25 per bottle including 5% cashback on my Amazon Storecard. Incredibly happy and unlike any other supplement I've ever tried and experienced a noticeable effect on.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way. This review would not have been written if this product didn't work. Instead, I'd be laying in bed - not even posting on Amazon that the product DIDN'T work, because I wouldn't have the energy to turn my laptop on for that matter. I would like to mention - if I forget to take this supplement for a day I WILL feel awful - like I used to.<br/><br/>I think my story is pretty unique to mention that - NO I'm not being paid for this review. NO - I wasn't offered a free bottle to write a review (although I think some people said they got the bottle for $1 for writing a review) - Maybe 1 Body will hook me up and send me some free swag for putting in such a great word - *cough* 1 Body you reading this? I accept free bottles of Thyroid Supplements in compensation for such a GREAT review. You couldn't pay me to write this review. I'm glowing over the total effectiveness of this product, it's really changed my life:) NO - I have no affiliation with this company. Rarely do I ever write reviews anymore because I'm slammed for time and have a family to take care of... but I seriously had to put this together to share my story. I hope this was an enlightening story for those that suffer with daily fatigue and maybe someone can relate to this story.
 Clearly not Methylcobalamin B12 as Amazin’s label has posted on website. Falsely advertising!!!! This is one of the reasons it’s not working!!!! Wrong ingredients!!! We’re tired of having to write these reviews when all we want is what’s advertised!!!
 I'm not going to make this long.  I was NOT given a discount or free product for my review!  This is something I relied heavily on reviews before buying, so I thought I owed one in return :-)<br/>My thyroid tests kept coming back (barely) within limits, yet I still had all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.  I ordered this because, like I said, the reviews were really for it and the price was fair.  I feel like my old self again.  I have my energy and motivation back!  It is really working, thank God.  Since I've also been suffering from menopausal hair issues, I went ahead and ordered the "Hair, Skin, Nails" product from the same company.  They've got my trust now.
 I had a total thyroidectomy last year and was placed on Synthroid. I noticed that my energy level had significantly dropped and had no motivation to do anything. I am a mom of two young children and work full time. I would come home completely exhausted, though I work at a computer most of the day, and knock out on the sofa. I had no energy to interact with my children, make dinner, or even do regular house chores. As I began to look around for supplements, I read many reviews on Amazon and found 1 Body Thyroid Support to have the best reviews. I have been taking it along with my Synthroid for about a month. I have found that some of my energy is slowly returning and I actually want to do things after spending the day at the office. I plan to continue Thyroid Support and try Adrenal Support as well.
 I like what is in this product (and what's not). I haven't started taking it yet but I'll update after a month.<br/><br/>It's been 3 weeks now. I take 1-2 tablets a day. I'm down 2 lbs and definitely notice I have more "get up and go" energy during the day. Looking forward to what the next month brings.<br/><br/>**just FYI- I was hesitant to buy this bc it seemed to have a lot of reviews by people who got the product at a discount in exchange for a review. Here's how it works: after you buy the bottle on Amazon for the full price, they ask you to write a review (good or bad) and as a thank you for taking the time to write a review, they send you a free bottle. I truly like this product and would never write a fake review. I buy a lot of things on Amazon and rely heavily on reviews. I think it's important to give real, honest reviews
 I have been trying different thyroid supplements for about a year or so, st least ones with lower iodine levels and vegetarian.  I have an overall positive impression of Thyroid Support.  It's always hard to tell which supplement is effective and which is not when taking other vitamins, but I'm fairly confident in saying this thyroid supplement has been effective.<br/><br/>The main things I have noticed now after a month or so of continuous use (2x/day) is I have been losing fat much quicker, and my hair seems to have nearly stopped thinning altogether.  These were the two issues I was struggling with.  No matter how clean I ate, how stringent I was about taking my multivitamin or how much I exercised, there was something not right with my body's chemistry.<br/><br/>My workout partners have always seemed to have visible results quickly, and I always seemed to be going harder than them!  Lately that hasn't been the case.  I would like to think it's because I eat well, workout and don't drink alcohol, but I don't really think that tells the whole story.  I'm now a believer.<br/><br/>Thanks to 1 Body for the great service and follow-up, I will be continuing to buy Thyroid Support from you, and I can say unequivocally that anyone looking for a good product with fast shipping and great customer support, you should do the same.
 I have hypothyroidism for about 20 years. My thyroid issue makes me have fatigue, hair loss, anxiety, depression, brain fog etc. Since I've started to take Thyroid Support Supplement, I could notice drastic changes in my life. It has been helping me with all these symptoms. My doctor says my thyroid had improved 30% in the past 6 months. I highly recommend this supplement with paleo diet, exercises, and meditation. You will get better for sure, as I am so much better.
 I had my thyroid checked due to lack of energy, weight gain and hair loss. They told me my levels weren't off enough for medication but were borderline. I searched for a supplement to help and found this one to have the best reviews. I started out taking it twice a day but noticed my heart was racing a bit. I cut back to taking it once a day in the morning and it went away. I am so glad I found this product! I have had so much more energy, my mood has been so much better and today I noticed I have new hair growth!! So worth the price!<br/> ******UPDATE******<br/>After taking these for 2 months I had to stop using them. I noticed a rash on my wrist and my scalp itched all the time, it woke me up every night it was so bad. I thought it was the shampoo I was using but changed shampoos and it continued to itch. Finally it occured to me to try stop taking this product. Within one day of stopping my scalp stopped itching and the rash on my wrist is healing. It may work for some people but I was obviously allergic to it. Disappointed I had to stop because it did give me more energy. 😔
 I buy all kinds of supplements and rarely, if ever, have I noticed a difference.  I definitely noticed a huge difference and I am only three weeks or so in.  I am ordering another bottle tonight because I feel better enough that I fear of running out. I can't put my finger exactly on it, but there are a couple things that are markedly different.  The long haul to my office from the parking lot isn't so fretful now.  Getting out of the bed for work, while I still don't like it, is much more tolerable. My focus is improved and so has my mood.  Each day, I feel myself, coming back to who I was before.  For three weeks into it, I'm a believer.  I will review again after a couple of months just to see if I get a big "kick" after about 6 weeks like some people have said.  Definitely worth the money more than any other supplement.
 At first I was skeptical about purchasing this product. I had a partial Hysterectomy 3 years ago.  3 years later I have suffered from major brain fog, extreme fatigue and DEPRESSION. I would forget just about everything, cried everyday about any &amp; everything, I could sleep all day &amp; all night and still wake up yawning, ready to go back to sleep..My doctor ran just about every test known to man and sent me to every specialist and all my test came back normal and the doctors kept saying they didn't see anything abnormal and I would get another referral to a different specialist. I became more depressed because I knew something was wrong with my body I was truly at my wits end. I felt my life literally fading away. I read just about all the reviews over and over and I decided to make a purchase. I have been taking this supplement for about 2 weeks.I just want to say the last week and a half has truly been A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE!!!!!! I'm surprised that its working so fast.No more extreme fatigue,No more sleeping all day and night and still feeling tired,I go to sleep at night wake up and Im refreshed. My depression is gone( my major concern) and my memory is getting better.Im NOT getting paid for writing my review this is honestly my testimony and I thank God I found something that WORKS!!!!! My husband and children have noticed the changes and they are happy. I canceled my upcoming appointments to the specialist. I found my answer to my problems.. I'm still on my first bottle and I<br/>purchased 2 more!!!. Im beyond satisfied and ecstatic that I found something that WORKS!!!!!!
 I actually noticed a difference within a day or two of taking it. I bought it because it contains l-tyrosine and iodine; in other words, it has actual prelimary components of thyroid hormone and isn't just an "herbal" supplement. I am naturally very warm-blooded, and this supplement didn't seem to intensify that as might be expected. However, I consistently have more energy after work and wake up feeling more alert and alive in the mornings. The only possible explanation is this supplement. An important note is that this supplement is not merely for those with some kind of hypothyroidism. This supplement delivers the building blocks for thyroid hormone, and even someone with a normal, healthy thyroid will notice and potentially benefit from a more active thyroid.
 I have Hashimoto's.<br/><br/>I took this product for 4 days. During that time, my anxiety steadily increased and my body felt briefly over-energized with nervous energy, then extremely tired throughout the day, but gave me insomnia. My last 3 nights' sleep were 6 hours, 5 hours and 4 hours. If I took it today, I bet I would never get to sleep.<br/><br/>I had a persistent headache that got stronger by the day. I almost never have headaches.<br/><br/>The anxiety was a level I've never really had before. It felt like I had ADD as well. I did not accomplish anything Monday through Thursday except for researching herbs that help Hashimoto's.<br/><br/>What I found during my research is quite a bit of conflicting evidence. Some people like Dr. Brownstein say iodine deficiency is the cause of Hashimoto's while other people say it can very easily make Hashimoto's worse and is very dangerous. Dr. Brownstein says kelp is a terrible source of iodine because it contains bromine in every sample he tested, so he does not recommend kelp. This product has kelp in it as well as iodine. Also, there are many people who say ashwagandha is bad for Hashimoto's. That herb is also in this formula. Funny thing is this: before I got diagnosed with Hashimoto's I had been taking both ashwagandha and kelp supplements for about 6 months and my anxiety got so bad that is why I went to the doctor (to get Xanax or something). He did blood tests and realized I have Hashimoto's. I wonder if these herbs are what caused it in the first place. If I had Hashimoto's before recently, then it was never as bad and I would bet for sure the ashwaganda and kelp pills I was taking are what made it worse.<br/><br/>Other reviewers here have noted there's some kind of pepper in here that is not good for Hashimoto's and someone else said schizandra is not good for Hashimoto's as well. I don't know if these are true, but I just started reading through the 1-star reviews to see if anyone else had my experience and, to my surprise, there were a lot of people who did!<br/><br/>I ran this product through fakespot and reviewmeta to check if the reviews were fake and it passed, so I was even happily suggesting it to other Hashimoto's sufferers based on the thousands of positive reviews. If I was 1 Body, I would not want more Hashimoto's patients discovering this formula and giving more 1-star reviews.<br/><br/>It would be great if they formulated a version SPECIFICALLY for Hashimoto's sufferers without these ingredients. I would buy that. Hashimoto's patients are TH1 dominant and there are several herbs you should and shouldn't use to improve this condition. Several of these herbs are TH2 dominant and make Hashimoto's worse.<br/><br/>I think the next supplement I am going to try is MSM. Supposedly that is very good for Hashimoto's, hair growth, and everything else.<br/><br/>As for this, I'm going to request a refund.<br/><br/>Hopefully, they will give me one like they have given to others. It's a pretty expensive formula and I think if I kept taking it I would end up in the emergency room or... (I hate to say this)... commit suicide. Seriously. I was losing my mind yesterday and felt like giving up.<br/><br/>Today, I didn't take the pill and I feel much better. I might even sleep tonight.
 For 6 years I have been plagued with brain fog, fatigue, thinning hair, no energy, weight gain, etc.  Two local Drs. told me my thyroid was fine, but I knew better. I have been taking Body 1 Thyroid  Support for about 3 weeks, and the instant I took the first pill, my energy improved.  I have lost weight, no longer depressed and irritable. Body 1 Thyroid has worked a miracle with my health, and I am so much happier!!!!  THANK YOU BODY 1!!!!
 I wanted to save this review until my doctor ran tests and we got the results.  I am allergic to Levothyroxine. It makes me itch worse than chicken pox.  My doctor suggested taking a supplement instead of the Levothyroxine, so I have taken this for 3 months and as of yesterday, I'm in the normal range for thyroid.
 I think this is probably an awesome product, but for me not so much. I have a lot of stomach issues including ulcers, not even taking that into consideration, I took these and the stomach issues began anew after having them controlled for quite a long time. I only took them for a week and did notice calmer moods and clearer thinking though. I wish I didn't have the stomach issues, because I really think this is a good product. If you have intestinal problems just be aware that this may aggravate them.
 Not B-12 Methylcobalamin like they advertising!!!! Is (B-12Cyanocobalamin).. cyanocobalamin is the form of B12 most used in supplements because it’s the cheapest.. Methylcobalamin the most bio-available form of Vitamin B12, i.e. it is the most readily absorbed, it remains in the body for a longer period of time and at higher levels than cyanocobalamin, which means that your body is supplied with vitamin B12 for longer if you use methylcobalamin than if you use cyanocobalamin.<br/>Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient for the body, and is needed to protect DNA and RNA, support energy, protect nerve and brain cells, stimulate serotonin production, contribute to red blood cell formation, support immune function, and maintain a positive mood.<br/><br/>There are two forms of vitamin B12 that you’re likely to come across – methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is the most commonly supplemented form of vitamin B12 and is chemically synthesised. Methylcobalamin is found in animal-based foods and is therefore obviously naturally occuring.<br/><br/>Methylcobalamin is rapidly gaining popularity over cyanocobalamin and in all likelihood methylcobalamin will ultimately dominate the industry.<br/><br/>What's the difference between methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin?<br/>Methylcobalamin has a methyl group (just carbon and hydrogen) while cyanocobalamin contains a cyanide molecule. Although the amount of cyanide in a normal B12 supplement is too small to be harmful, your body will still need to remove and eliminate this compound. As it has no use for the cyano-compound itself, it will set about converting any cyanocobalamin you take into methylcobalamin as soon as possible - it’s the methyl-compound that the human body needs to function properly.
 Buyer Be Aware.  This pill may be OK, I used it for 2 months 12 months ago and then stopped because I did not see any difference, plus it's expensive.<br/><br/>BE AWARE that that the formula for this pill is the same as about 80% of the other  listed Thyroid Supplement pills on Amazon.  These 80% appear to be relabeled versions of the same pill.  Different name, price, packaging, description and sales pitch but same contents.  This quantity of listings makes it hard to find pills provided by established suppliers, of which there are about 10 in the first 50 listings.<br/><br/>The adds usually say made in USA from global contents.  I guess this means the pill is loaded and packaged in the USA with contents from somewhere else, perhaps China.<br/><br/>The reviews for some of this 80% are also suspect.  You can check some of the review statistics at ReviewMeta.com, copy and paste the Amazon ASIN number to ReviewMeta.<br/><br/>I guess this is the modern Made for Amazon version of the Made for TV marketing schemes.<br/><br/>Again, the pills could be fine, it's the marketing that bothers me.  For this particular pill if you see Cayenne Pepper in the contents (usually last), it's probably one of the 80%.
 I absolutely love this supplement. I used to feel drained and tired all the time and I have more energy after taking this. I also have lost 15 pounds and don't get as hungry so it definitely boosted my metabolism as well.
 Awesome product ,I bought the first bottle and noticed how sharp my mind was, I also was less bloated and did not add weight despite no changes in my activities and diet. However, I noticed that the bloatiness and the tiredness and unexplained weight loss was creeping in soon after I had finished this product, I had to think back on what changed in my daily routine and then I remembered that I was on Thyroid support when things were better. I ordered a new one and have noticed a major change in my activities and also my weight fluctuations.<br/>This is an awesome product, very much worth the price!!!
 I have only been on 4 days but I can already feel a difference.  I used to take Levothyroxine but diet and exercise healed my thyroid enough that my blood work came back normal however I stalled on weight loss entirely. I take it when I get up and when I go to bed.  I take it before my other supplements and with my teeth brushing at bedtime.  The scale has already dropped 3 lbs since I began.  Hoping this continues - my brain fog is better and I am warmer.  I was starting to get the symptoms again.  I think this will be come part of my daily routine. Update: On second month. Started taking 2 in morning for ease though think splitting dose might have been better. Weight loss stalled but I blame that on dietary choices. My other symptoms have stopped so I will keep taking. I like this one.
 I was dragging myself thru life. I had no energy, I had RAI on my thyroid 4 years ago. I am on Armour Thyroid, previously took Levothyroxine. I just was always tired! I started taking this along with other vitamins (just started researching them) &amp; I feel so much better. I didn't notice until after a month of taking them. I just noticed one day that I was naturally waking up earlier &amp; feeling better! I also like Thyroid support complex w/iodine, something for adrenal health, vitamin D, magnesium. You just have to figure out what works best for you &amp; stick with it for a good 4-8 weeks. What works for me may not work for everyone, but don't give up. I was feeling awful. It was making me depressed. I was so tired. I feel so much better. Also, make your dr test your vitamin, hormone levels etc. demand it! You know your body &amp; know if you don't feel right. Also, if they say your "levels are in range", make sure they are in optimal range. Good luck! I hope this helps someone.
 I am really liking this product! Especially since it's vegetarian-based.  I am updating this because of all the different supplements I've tried, this is the BEST!  I am now on my third bottle.  My energy levels are up, and the best part, I seem to be losing weight because I am not always hungry like I used to be.  That is the best part.  I was also given a coupon to receive a free bottle which really helped out. I will definitely continue using this product because it is worth the money and it does work if you have the patience for it to help you.  It does not interfere with my prescriptions which is also a plus with this product.  I don't feel sluggish in the mornings or during the day like I used to... I can go on and on, but I think you get the idea!!
 Although this may be a good product exponentially more effective than any alopathic thyroid medicine or synthethic hormone, I highly disagree about some recommendations that come with the free ebook and I have to warn everyone who buys this product: that yes, this will definetly improve the health of your thyroid and inmune system as a whole, if it doesnt then you need to improve the health of your adrenal glands because there is a balance between the cortisol released by your adrenals and the function of your thyroid, when either your thyroid or adrenals are over functioning the other gland will have a lower function.<br/><br/>However what I'm concerned about the ebook is that they encourage the intake of iodized salt and soy beans.<br/><br/>While iodine is good for the functioning of your thyroid glands, excess iodine can be harmful and this supplement already contains enough daily intake of iodine. Also, the iodine found in iodized salt is in a form that cant be absorbed by the human body and it will not help, you should always avoid sodium chloride and switch organic forms of salt like himalayan pink salt or hawaiian black salt.<br/><br/>As for soy beans, over 94% of soy in america is transgenic and has anti-nutritional properties, bio-engineered soy was developed to produce industrial lubricants and was not overlooked for its nutritional values and wether it was safe or not for humans to consume, even organic soy isn't that great nutritionally so avoiding soy as a whole is the safest option since many GMO foods are being sold as organic these days.
 The pills were a dark green, not beige like the first order. Concerning!!!!
 For the last ten years I have had bloodwork after bloodwork done with all of them saying that there was nothing wrong with my thyroid.  Everything ALWAYS came back in the normal range.  My T4 was always right in the middle, but the T3 was within normal limits, but on the lower side.  I had every single symptom and they kept wanting to blame it on menopause.  I started taking the pills a week ago tomorrow... I had lost so much hair that I went to the hair dresser to give me a perm so that I didn't look so bald.  In 3 days of taking the thyroid support - my hair started growing back!  I was touching my forehead and thought I had my exfoliating cleanser in my hairline - it felt like sand - i went to look in the mirror and it was my hair!  All over my scalp - coming back in!!!  I have more energy, my mood is much better!  I am very excited about this and will not stop taking it!  Highly recommended.
 I have been using this product for 2 weeks.  I was amazed when I first started taking this supplement. I saw immediate improvement - the first 3 days were remarkable in terms of energy, hence productivity, as well as better sleep at night.  Since then I have not experienced consistency in its effects, and am currently working on determining a 'schedule' for spacing out thyroid medication and supplementation.  So far, I think I see the need to leave several hours (4 or 5) between the pharmaceutical medication and this supplement -- I do not know if Thyroid Support is affecting the Levothyroxin, but when taken too close together, I see no benefit from the Support.  I've also determined that, for me, this supplement works best when taken with a moderate meal and when taken without any oil supplements such as, specifically Evening Primrose and Vitamin D.  That said, the energy and general sense of well-being that I experienced at first are worth the effort of determining a schedule.  When it is working, instead of having to drag myself through the day, I am able to accomplish so much with much more energy, and I feel more balanced in general.<br/>I will change this to 5 stars as soon as I see consistent benefit.  In my opinion, if you are looking for help with thyroid and energy issues, this product is DEFINITELY worth trying.
 I just received this a few days ago. I have only taken one a day. Like the company recommends.  I have had all the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Within hours of the first pill my head fog disappeared! I couldn’t believe it!!! The first pill I took around 2 pm. Day 2 I took the pill at 7am. I felt a little foggy around 10pm. Today is day 3. I took my pill again at 7am. I might take a pill with lunch in hopes of no foggy head later tonight.  I will update my review in a few weeks. I am really hoping this will help my hair. My hair has always been long, thick and super curly. Now it resembles the hair of a scarecrow. I hope to give it 5 stars soon!!!
 This Thyroid  Support supplement has definitely helped to increase my clarity and focus, and over all energy.  I have been on prescription thyroid medication for at least 30 years. When given blood tests, the doctors always say that my numbers are OK, just stay the course. I'm sick and tired of doctors telling me all is well, when I feel so lousy. My picture could be used as the perfect example of every symptom known illustrating low thyroid! I have been taking this only about three weeks, but I am definitely going to reorder. This supplement must include ingredients that the thyroid needs, because I know that I feel about 35% better in this short time.. I can't wait to continue with this supplement and improve even more with time. I highly recommend that you order one bottle and see if it works for you.  If it does for you what it does for me, you will be ordering much more. Only one who suffers with the same disorder can fully understand what you tolerate just to feel normal.  I wish you luck in finally getting a life!
 Hi all, so the first thing is the product got to me quickly.<br/>The reviews were on point.<br/>I am 63 female post menopausal, I was suffering from a low grade malaise, irritated easily, hair following out in bunches. No energy almost a fatigue. Waking up at least twice in a bight. Not motivated to do anything. And eating like I was insatiable. I’ve been taking this for over a month now. The things I notice. Im not as agitated;im able to handle changes without being irritated. I can actually get out of bed at 6:00 without feeling like I have gotten no rest.<br/>Feel emotionally more balanced. Sleeping better. I also try not to eat heavy food after 5 just to allow my body tune to process.<br/>I feel the difference and just ordered my next bottle.
 I have subclinical hypothyrodism. Ohhhh, the weight gain, tiredness, foggy brain has been exhausting. I started taking 1body thyroid support for approximately 2 months.  Within the first week, I noticed a couple of things.  My energy level has been higher, do know how refreshing this has been!?  Let me tell you, it has been so awesome! My craving for sugary treats has dropped, and the scale has shown weightloss.  I all around feel good!  My sister who hasnt been diagnosed with any thyroid issues also is taking these pills.  She has been feeling better also.<br/>I havent had any issues with feeling sick after taking these pills.  Example: If I take iron pills I get nauseous.<br/>44 years old and I feel so much better.
 I was having some signs of hypothyroidism - cold extremities, fatigue, unable to lose weight despite low calories, etc - and was looking into something to try. One sign people mentioned was low body temperature. Before purchasing the product I took a 5 day average of my temperature when waking up, it was 97.3 (avg over 5 days). After purchasing this product and taking the same temperature readings my new 5 day average is 98.3, including a 'normal' 98.6 reading today. Additionally I've went down about 2.5 lbs over the last ~8-10 days without changing my diet &amp; have had significantly less issues with cold fingers/toes. Overall seems to be perfect for me.
 ** UPDATE-I have been taking for about 2 months now and I am so so happy I found this product! My happiness is back, my energy is back, my hot flashes are literally gone during the day-still get random hot flashes in middle of the night but nothing near what I used to get-I am finally losing weight too (changed exercise plan and eating habits too so cannot say the weight loss is all this product but I know it is helping). The biggest thing for me right now is that my mood is back to happy- even with my husband being out of work for over 8 months now, things suck but it is not getting me down! I was not paid for this review- I am not someone that writes reviews on things- I truly believe this product has given me back a part of me I had lost!  Have only been taking for 5 days. I purchased because I am in menopause, (started when I was in late 30's and has gotten increasingly worse into my early 40's). I refuse to take synthetic hormones and have been researching for natural options, stumbled upon this on Amazon and read hundreds of reviews that were all pretty positive so thought I would give it a try. I deal with hot flashes/night sweats/sudden weight gain of around 15 pounds in last 6 months ( I work out 6-7 days a week and eat pretty clean)/ have had increased joint pain/feeling tired sluggish all the time/feeling very unmotivated to do anything. In the last couple days (since I started taking the thyroid support) I have noticed I am feeling much more like my old self, positive, energized, motivated. I started taking collagen about a week before these pills so not sure which product is helping the joint pain or if it is a combination of both but my joint pain is literally gone. The first day I took one in morning and one that night (as the bottle says) and I was up all night with really bad night sweats- I cannot say if it was the thyroid pills or not because I deal with that on occasion but I just noticed it was pretty intense that night so I have only been taking one in the morning since then. Will try to remember to post another review in a couple weeks on if I notice any more results.
 After blood tests, my doctor cut my thyroid medicine in half.  I started gaining weight and sleeping all afternoon again. After gaining 15 pounds, a friend suggested I try another Thyroid Boost product, which I did, with no results.  I googled my condition and Thyroid Support was mentioned.  I was impressed buy all the positive reviews on Amazon and ordered it.  What a difference.  I've been taking it for about 3 weeks and am already loosing weight and able to get into the evening with just a short afternoon nap.  Believe me, that's a big improvement.  Thank you Thyroid Support.
 I started using 1 Body Thyroid Support about a year ago when I added several other beneficial supplements. In an effort to save money, I cut this one out. It took about 2 months to start losing hair and feel completely fatigued again. I am so grateful that I could easily add it back into my daily routine. I've been taking it again for about two months. I'm happy to report that my hair is health again and I have enough energy to make it through a day without taking a nap. Thank you for a great product that really makes a difference.
 I bought this because it advertised methylcobalamin as the form of B12 but the label I have says cyanocobalamin.  I've uploaded a picture to show.  I contacted the company and they said they only use the methylated kind and it must be a printing error....That seems like a very odd explanation to me since if they only use methylcobalamin, why did they have the wrong label at all in the first place???  For those who can't take the kind with cyanide, I would beware and not take a chance.  Other 1 star reviews going back a year have the same complaint...
  I was told back in May my t3 and t4 were low. Since that time and especially the last 4 months I've been watching my weight slowly rise 15 lbs. Exercising alone wasnt helping and I was determined not to rely on synthetic hormones to attempt to fix the problem, so I started looking for natural supplements that could help boost my thyroid. I found these. 6k plus reviews, with a great star rating and all of the reviews i read being positive I instantly ordered them. After only 5 days of taking them I was scheduled for a blood test to check my levels, I hadn't told my doctors yet that I was taking these supplements. Within the first week I lost 4 lbs. That following monday they gave me a call. My thyroid was completely fine, I questioned them on my t3 and t4, were they low at all? She said no, everything was good. I'm so grateful. This product has earned a new loyal customer. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product.
 The website and box show the methylated form of B-12, but the bottle shows a different B-12. For those of us with MTHFR, we can’t take this. Very misleading as far as the pictures online!
 I have actually never written a review on any Amazon purchase until now but I felt compelled to do so with this product. I have had thyroid issues for more than ten years now and have tried every prescription possible to no avail...regardless of the dosage or whatever cocktails the docs thought might work. I’ve also tried innumerable supplements, read articles, books, tried diets...whatever I could find just for a modicum of relief. Nothing worked well or at all. I saw this product and read the reviews and ingredients. I was skeptical since most of the ingredients had been in other supplements I’d tried that did nothing but leave me frustrated and suffering. But...in my quest to find the golden thyroid ticket I hit the “add to cart” button and waited. I am SOOOO glad I did. I’m not even half way through the first bottle and already can see huge changes both physically and mentally. My skin was dry, ashy and prone to tear easily. My fingernails were thin, brittle and would peel of in layers and the crescent had completely vanished years ago. Now, my skin is smooth, more supple and elastic than it has been in at least five years. My nails are beginning to grow again and there is less layering and the half moons are starting to reappear. My mind is sharper, more clear and my mood is brightening. I do need to point out I am bi polar but have not added or removed any other supplements or scripts during this time, nor am I taking any scripts for hypothyroidism at this time so my positive changes could not come from any other source. If you are searching for help with the issues I was and are about to give up, DONT! Just try this product! If it can help me when nothing else has, it can probably help you, too. Thank you to whoever in this company who designed this supplement.! You rock!
 I have to admit that I was skeptical...but I am just under the border line of thyroid numbers and my insurance denied paying for a thyroid prescription, so after reading the reviews on this product I decided to try it. I have not noticed any energy improvement, but I had a large lump near my thyroid that has completely disappeared!!! The other significant improvement is that my hair started growing where I had prior bald spots!!! Since I am a 55 yr old female, this was like manna from heaven!!! I do believe that I am getting the right combination of things to help jump start my thyroid and will definately continue to use this great product!!!!I would highly encourage those with borderline thyroid issues to give this a try....it's obviously working for me!!
 This is the best THYROID support I have had , I have tried other brands but no results,<br/>with one body thyroid support I get a nice energy boost in the morning so that I am able to get going and do what I have to throughout my day ,<br/>I always ha a feeling of exhaustion ,i now sleep better , just hoping i can loose a bi of weight , this is my second bottle , i'll update<br/>so far i don't see myself using another product , its balanced  with vitamin b 12 , an more read ingredients , i feel its complete .<br/>i have thyroid nodules blood work shows normal but i din't fee well , thanks to this supplement i have much better days .<br/><br/>  Maria.
 Great product!!! Started taking for hair loss after being told multiple times that my thyroid was fine. Began taking April 1, 2018. The difference isn’t ridiculously noticeable but it is noticeable. My hair has grown about 1/2 an inch since April 1, but I’m excited to see hair growing in spots it wasn’t before... I am happy I have found this product. They have other amazing products as well. I would definitely suggest trying these and see if it can help change your life
 Thyroid support hasn’t stopped the slow weight gain and hasn’t eradicated my symptoms but it’s made them manageable and made me feel better overall thus far. Less fatigue, less bloating, less body aches, less headaches etc... I notice a marked difference when I take it and when I don’t take it. I do believe that it’s causing some acne as a side effect and hope that will decrease. I’ve come to realize that my liver is sluggish and my adrenals are fatigued as a result of the Epstein Barr virus that is attacking my body and causing the issues with the thyroid. I am adding adrenal support to my supplements and have completely overhauled my diet. I am also getting my thyroid biopsied etc but simply feel that my body is having difficulty achieving homeostasis and is off balance. I am hoping that the adrenal support coupled with the thyroid support along with the diet changes I’ve made will return me to optimal health. I eat healthy and exercise and am very self aware. I believe that thyroid support contains some of the ingredients that the “Medical Medium” advises-and I am now a follower of his program and regimen. Thank you for creating a supplement for those of us that suffer from a myriad of issues and get dismissed or thrown with the all encompassing “auto immune disease” tag with no real answers and regimen that will work.
 This has been a game changer! I’ve been taking these a month... stopped dieting because nothing was working with any measure of consistency. But I’ve been losing weight (although gradually - about a pound a week or every other week) while eating only reasonably while taking these. Is this what it’s like to be a normal person?! My energy levels feel more stabilized as well, and it could be a fluke, but I am not getting sick. I work at a daycare, and trust me, I’ve been sneezed on - pooped on - you name it, in the last month. I am ordering my second bottle because I’m almost out, and I’m at a new low weight even though I had pizza the other night.<br/><br/>I’ve never had my thyroid tested. Because of the results I’ve had from these, I know that something wasn’t working right. Hoping these continue to do good things for me, and that I don’t have to follow my mom’s footsteps and get on the artificial stuff later down the line. It’s a big fear of mine, as I’ve seen her struggle all my life. Thanks 1body!!
 Eleven years ago, an END prescribed me Synthroid because I had all the symptoms of hypothyroidism but my TSH levels were still considered in the normal range. A year ago, my PCM convinced me to stop taking the medication because my TSH was still in the normal range while I was on the lowest dose. Since I stopped taking it, I noticed all my symptoms returning in full force (fatigue, coarse dry hair and skin, increased hair lost, weight gain and trouble losing it). I knew I needed to get control of the problem but didn't want to go back on the medication, so I decided to find an alternative. After much research, I decided to give Thyroid Support a try. After a month, I have already noticed a difference in my symptoms. My constant fatigue has decreased significantly and my energy levels have increased. I actually have the energy to work out again and have slowly started losing weight (this is not a weight loss product). I also noticed my hair and skin look much healthier. I am happy I found this product and plan to continue using it.
 In October, my routine yearly lab tests came back with a TSH of 8.230. My doctor wasn’t too worried about it because I didn’t have any visible thyroid symtoms, but agreed to recheck in a month. I started taking a multivitamin with 100% iodine and 70% selenium just in case. Looking back, I was having sleep disturbances, insatiable hunger, and mood swings... but they hadn’t felt sufficient enough to tell the doctor. I happened to go on a trip to visit a friend for 3 weeks to help her preach the Gospel from the Bible, and the only changes in my diet were less starch and more nuts, including a few more Brazil nuts per day.<br/><br/>When I retested a little more than a month later, my TSH came back as 42.020!!!!! I wasn’t even that tired!!! I was praising the Lord Jesus Christ for holding my body together. I was on Thyroid Support for a little over 2 weeks, and re-tested a few days ago. My TSH is down to a “better” number of 22.290.<br/><br/>My thyroid was 5.07 last year, and I brought it to 2.53 with 3 months of Thorne Brand’s Thyrocisn. I guess I should have stayed on something long-term rather than hoping it healed me. If one doesn’t pull through, I’ll try that one again. But I chose this one because of the more well rounded ingredients. And I’ll pray about everything, asking Jesus Christ for help and direction. Because no matter how healthy we can be, all our our bodies are going to fail and die one day soon. After this will come Judgement Day. God will judge your sin individually. Have you broken His laws? Have you’ve lied? Stolen? Taken His name in vain? Committed sexual immorality—or even looked with lust? Murdered, including abortion—or even hated someone in your heart? Then you are guilty and will receive the just penalty for those crimes (sin) which you’ve committed. Tge just punishment for sin is eternal hell, the lake of fire. The ONE WAY out is to REPENT, turn from sin and follow JESUS CHRIST! He is God’s only Son and lived a perfect life. He died on the cross, averting God’s wrath for us. He was  resurrected 3 days later, having victory over sin and death. To be saved, you must die to your sin with Him and be resurrected to walk in newness of life—righteousness in Him. Reading the Holy Bible (not other books, not going to church) is the only way you can know His will for sure. Read the Bible devotedly to know and follow Him.
 Amazing!.... this stuff works! for the first time in my life I can live a normal life..no more brain fog, no depression or anxiaty or stress ...  and I'm loosing weight even without trying.. 1lb a week steady, too many things going I can say enough....
 2 weeks after starting this product, I have more energy, less brain fog. I’m remembering people’s names easier. I’m getting back into exercising again, instead of barely having enough energy to get up out of bed like I use to feel before taking, Thyroid Support by, (1 Body)<br/>My mood has improved, I’m not so depressed because I’m getting my energy back to want to clean and cook everyday like I use to before I found out I had Hashimoto disease. Starting to go and see my friends on my days off from work again. I can’t wait to see what I feel like 2 months into taking this product from now. Loving the improvement in my mood, energy and ability to think clearly again.
 I wanted to take this supplement for a while before I reviewed it so I could give a honest review. I’ve been taking thyroid support for about 6 weeks now and I’m seeing real results. I have been on prescription thyroid for 20 years after I had 1/2 my thyroid removed. I took compounded thyroid with T3 and T4 become I can’t convert it over. I have felt forever it wasn’t doing me any good but test low normal. I had very little energy, plus I’m one of those who can’t loose any weight. I started this and went off my prescription thinking if it doesn’t work I can start taking the prescription again. For the first 2 weeks I didn’t see a lot of change, but 6 weeks later I’ve lost 11 pounds, and I feel like walking  again so I started walking 4 days a week around my mall for around 2 miles a day. I asked my husband if he thought I could have done that before and he said he didn’t think so. I haven’t had any thyroid testing done yet, but I’m feeling a lot better and I want to stay on this because I’m getting real results with thyroid support
 I want to add a couple more things to my AZ CHERYL reply.  When I began taking the Levothyroxine from my hormone specialist, she said, I don't care if you take the name brand or the generic, but whatever you choose STAY ON IT.  DO NOT switch from generic to name brand or vice versa it will seriously goof up your thyroid.  Also MAKE SURE you get the same Manfacturer EVERY TIME.<br/><br/>Also be serious about taking it at the SAME TIME EVERY DAY.  This along with all the other stuff I said in my reply to AZ CHERYL makes this the fussiest darn pill I take.  But ANY deviation makes my hair fall out, etc.  So I am religious about it, along with NO CAFFINE 2 hours before or after the Levothyroxine and the 1 body Thyroid Support, which I found out about in the ebook they emailed me.<br/><br/>I'm gonna throw something odd in here too, because maybe it affects other people on Thyroid.  I had a slew of little things wrong.  A scab near my eye duct that itched all the time (had it 5 years) and wouldn't clear up.  Bumps on my scalp.  Crust on the sides of my nose, sideburns, inside my ears, all of it itched, and all of it 5 years,  etc.  I tried a new thing created in 1912 called Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar with the "mother".  HOLY COW.  Everything cleared up.  That scab near my eye duct went away in 1 day and NO ITCH.  Took 3 days for scalp and nose and ears.  I laugh now that I have VIRGIN EARS like a baby's.  NO ITCH, NO BUMPS.  You can also drink 2 TBS, 3 times a day.  WOW.  Fixed a cough and my diahrea.  $4.19 for 16 ounces at your local grocery store, much more here on Amazon I'm sorry to say.  32 ounces $5.99  I swear I bathe in it now.  With a cotton ball, I wipe down my neck, chest, arms, legs, toes, I don't ITCH anywhere.  This stuff is a MIRACLE.  My urine has gotten cloudy, but I am POSITIVE it's because it's clearing something up.  Put it on salads, pork chops, anything.  I've used 8 ounces in 8 days.
 First thing I noticed was how easy it was for me to wake up and start my day. I felt rested. And I continued to feel a calm, peaceful energy the rest of the day. I took no naps and felt like getting things done. That was just the first day. I've now been taking daily for almost a month and I love the change in how I feel. My body loves this stuff. I'm losing weight and I don't have cravings any more. Food seems to actually satisfy me. And to think I've always had a "healthy thyroid". It just goes to show, just because test results from the Dr office say I'm healthy doesn't mean I'm performing at my very best. This product really has made me feel great. I'll take it forever.
 I have hypothyroidism and have been on RX for about 15 years.  I'm always tired, my memory is very foggy and I have body aches, weight problems and dry skin.  I have been taking these for a few days now.  At first I was forgetting to take them and didn't like that they were large capsules and have a mild taste.  BUT I decided I needed to take them regularly to see if they helped.  I have to set an alarm so I don't forget...lol. Well, after a few days of taking them regularly, I have more energy.  My brain fog is clearing and my husband noticed I am sharper against his quick wits.  He doesn't know about this supplement.  I have been taking two in the afternoon, but would like to take 3 to see if it helps even more.  I would love to get rid of a few pounds, but nothing yet.  I will definitely order more and update in a few months.
 After suffering for one year with unexplained weight gain, hair loss, exhaustion, insomnia, and constipation, I was very frustrated! I'm a small framed person and had begun to look like I was 4 months pregnant. I've never had a problem with mid section weight gain before and none of my usual remedies were working.<br/>I began taking Thyroid Support one week ago and already feel better! I'm sleeping well and wake up fully rested! My digestion system is also much better and I'm feeling lighter around my stomach every day! So thankful to have found this product and the bonus free bottle will make sure I feel great next month too! I will definitely order again!<br/>Thank you 1 Body for helping me feel like me again!
 Just took the first pill today. Too soon to tell I am hoping like others that this would be a miracle pill and all symptoms will disappear. I was worried I would feel worse after taking this pill but I am still here 😊 feel slightly warmer. So far so good will try to write an update if I feel better or worse. 5 stars for great customer service and free bottle.<br/>Update: I began taking this supplement since March 2016 and since then I have shared with all my friends and family how wonderful this product is and how much it has changed my life. I was very happy with the product until recently the last two orders I received looked completely different and the effect is not the same. I contacted the company and was told that they have changed the capsule and not the ingredients and they offered a refund, However I find this hard to believe because the color is different and it tastes different. Because of this I changed my 5 stars to 2. Please bring the original formula back 1body!
 About a week after taking Thyroid Support at half the dose I began to feel more energized and my stomach issues started to elevate. After one week I began to take the full dose, I noticed that I began to lose weight. I have lost a total of 5 lbs, and I am hoping to lose another 5 lbs. I have IBS and Thyroid Support has helped me so much. I have recommended to friends and I plan to continue taking Thyroid Support. Thank you so much.
 I've only used this product for a few days but I've already noticed a HUGE difference in relieving my fatigue! I struggle every morning with waking up and getting out of bed. I have the alarm clocking running an hour before I have to wake up and hit snooze for that hour. If I don't do that I cannot get up in time. Even so I barely make it to work on time...actually I'm usually late. This has always bothered me because I'm a really hard worker and I do an amazing job at work but really how good does it look when I can't get there on time. I get at least 8-9 hours of sleep a night. There is no reason why I'm soooo tired. I could hardly believe how much this has helped. Now it's not a miracle over night type of transformation BUT enough of a difference that I really wanted others to know and encourage to try. Hope this helps others like it has me!
 This product made me extremely sick. Gave it a second chance and had the same result.
 I chose this product because it seemed to be the most natural and it is from a company within the USA.  Fairly quickly after starting this supplement I noticed I had a bit more energy and mostly that I was not losing so much hair.  I had been losing hair by the handfuls when washing and combing and now seem to just shed a few hairs.  I am very pleased with this supplement and will continue to use it.
 Ever since I was 15 years old my cholesterol levels have been totally through the roof. When I went to my Primary care Dr for my yearly physical I had already been taking thyroid support for a month-and-a-half when I had my physical and blood work. When my lab results came back my doctor asked me what I have been doing different? The only difference I've been doing was taking the thyroid support I never expected it to help my cholesterol. My doctor could not believe it all of my cholesterol levels were the best they have ever been in my life.<br/> I have all around been feeling better..<br/> I have to say the only thing it could have been from is the thyroid support.. I'm very pleased and my Dr is impressed as well as amazed. So thank you very much. I will continue with thyroid support.
 I had purchased this last year and took it for a few months and after a month I realize it was working and I had much more cognitive clarity and physical energy.  I had to undergo surgery, so I was taken off all medications as well as told to stop Supplements.  I never started back on this, and kind of forgot I even had it.  Well a few weeks ago I found the bottle that I still had and started taking it again, and yes I can see again that it is working for me.  So I am back to order more.
 I am so thankful I saw 1 Body Thyroid Support mentioned on a Thyroid Support Group. It has absolutely been life-changing! On my thyroid meds I continued to suffer with hair loss, debilitating fatigue, serious depression, absolute cold intolerance, constipation, a growing goiter BUT on 1 Body Thyroid Support, everything is the opposite! I am a believer and will continue to purchase this product. My neighbor who suffers with thyroid issues as well, and has been on thyroid meds for years, and was against me taking this supplement, now wants to try it! Even she noticed a complete change in me! I am down two sizes, feel amazing, my hair is coming back...I literally could cry with joy - I feel normal again, I feel great again, I feel happy again! Can't say enough in support of this product!!!
 My wife has been taking thyroid meds for hypothyroidism for 20 years (she is 43) and been feeling hypo symptoms, low energy, poor memory, lack of motivation, joint pain, anxiety and depression. Although stopping meds is NOT reccomended she decided to take a few weeks break and then get blood work done to see where her thyroid levels fall as the her dosage has changed throughout the years without much testing. As she did this she has added in this Thyroid support supplement. Myself and her grandmother both have noticed a positive change in her demeanor and seems to be feeling better. Her lab appointment is next week but plans to continue this supplement no matter what her thyroid level results are at and medication adjustments become. Also we are both taking the Adrenal Support as well, we recommend both and have friends that have started this supplement recently.
 I love this product!  I developed hypothyroidism as a result of radiation cancer treatment  I never had problems with weight or anything associated with the thyroid but since taking these supplements for 6 months my thyroid is getting back to normal and my weight is doing great.  the Dr said i can stay on the supplements instead of the medicine if my levels stay normal.  i plan on staying on these
 I feel great!  But I can't honestly say what caused it.  I started taking Thyroid Support around the same time I started taking extra calcium, a mineral supplement, enzymes and a liver support supplement in response to a digestion and fatigue issue.  I have noticed one other change other than having more energy and just plain digesting better and that is the missing fullness that I've always had on my throat in the area of my thyroid.  It was't a bulge, just looked like a strong toned muscular column that curved with a slightly pronounced roundness at the base of my throat in the front and curved upwards and then blended in...and now that's gone!  At first I just knew SOMETHING was different but wasn't sure what and then one day it dawned on me that my throat area was slimmer in that spot for the first time in my life at 58 and why I looked more like a certain member of my family.  Kinda bummed because that was the only part of my anatomy that I still kinda liked...LOL...but feeling better is a great tradeoff...plus, I've been able to reduce the A/C 10 degrees because persistent menopausal hot flashes aren't as severe.
 There are a lot of reviews that say this is a great product and if you haven’t tried it you need to especially for those of us who have had your thyroid removed. I was skeptical and only saw one other review similar to my situation meaning I only had half of my thyroid removed. It’s been almost two years now since the surgery and my doctors were saying that my numbers are good, but I didn’t feel good or myself yet. I was really struggling with how to get back to myself again. I’m married with two children and it was difficult. I started doing research on what else I could do to get help. I found this product and decided to try it, I had nothing to lose by trying.<br/><br/>Honestly, it’s the best decision I could have made. I feel normal again and I haven’t felt this way for a long time. It’s hard to explain to those who haven’t gone through this. I couldn’t be happier and I will continue to take this forever.<br/><br/>Try it, no matter what your numbers are! You won’t go back to being without it. This is the first review I’ve ever done in this much detail, but that’s how strongly I believe in this and want others to know. Hope you give it a try.
 I love this product- my thinking has improved, energy levels is up, sleep much better &amp; experienced shedding a few pounds of weight too- no exercising...so my metabolism is slowing improving as well.  I ordered my next bottle!
 Wife of user: I have tried every supplement out there to no avail. I didn’t expect this product to be any different.<br/>I was suffering from fatigue, weak muscles, lethargy, irritability, weight gain, thinning hair, dry skin, horrible periods... and the list goes on. I was absolutely miserable. Every task was daunting. I even began to dread the fun things. I knew something was wrong so I had my dr check my hormone levels, thyroid levels, iron and b12. Everything came back in the normal range. I was devastated. Not because I wanted something to be wrong, but I wanted answers.<br/>So I turned to trusty google. I had textbook hypothyroid. I also read that just because blood work states normal range; it doesn’t necessarily mean your thyroid is working properly.<br/>After as little as a week, I could see a difference. I felt more energized. I was sleeping better. I didn’t feel so angry or hopeless  anymore. This product is a life saver! I know a lot of the reviews on here are bogus; but I assure you, this is real. I see no need in writing a positive review to claim a free bottle of a product if it did not work.
 I have been feeling pretty blah for a few years now...My Chiropractor suggested that I may have a issues with my thyroid.  After researching what my symptoms were...I had no doubt that I did.  So I immediately went to Amazon.com because I trust what other consumers say about what they purchase ~ Like it or Love it comments, and came upon this supplement.  I ordered it immediately and within a few days, I received the bottle (very fast shipping) and began taking them as described on the bottle.  I am happy to be one of the customers that is very happy with their purchase!! I am starting to feel better already...sleeping better, more energy, more focused, more motivated and I know after prolonged use of this product, I will be good as new with all of my other issues.  If you can answer yes to the following questions (list below), do yourself a favor and try this product...you'll be happy you did!<br/><br/>Do you feel lethargic or fatigued?<br/><br/>Experience any Puffiness and/or Joint pain?<br/><br/>Want to lose weight?<br/><br/>Do you want to feel stronger &amp; sleep better?<br/><br/>Do you have peeling skin or dry and brittle hair?<br/><br/>Do you feel Cold?<br/><br/>Experience periods of forgetfulness?<br/><br/>Have mood swings?
 I'm a 41 year old guy with Hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea.  I was initially skeptical about all the "glowing reviews" until, I decided to purchase the product,and use it. I suffer all the symptoms of hypothyroidism, even though my T4 and T3 levels are in the right range. This product really does give me more energy, and makes me feel better.  It works so well, that I plan on re-ordering, before I run out.
 Nice product, can feel my goiter going down a bit. I've had a lifetime of thyroid problems (been diagnosed with Hashimoto's and Graves) my thyroid is the one that swings back and forth for many years ( I was diagnosed for the first time at 12 yrs old, now I am 54)...been told 2 times after having both my children to have thyroid removed - sorry don't believe in cutting things out we need? (Drs. just want to cut things out (happened to my gallbladder - now I have to take the Liver suppliment because cutting it out made liver work super hard) So no more cutting things out for me. Besides I know of people that had their thyroid cut out and they are still very sick!) Also I know people on those damn big pharma thyroid drugs....and still sick...years later?<br/><br/>I have to live with this the rest of my life, it is an Autoimmune disease (and that will NOT go away by cutting it out, taking the radioactive iodine to destroy it or taking thyroid meds (big pharma "poison"). I even have nodules on my thyroid since 2011, but no $$ to get them biopsied...(not sure if I really trust their diagnoses about things, even if it was cancer?) - because then they put you on chemo that kills, because most people I have known have died after they go back on the chemo when it comes back (you are wiping out all good in your body) I just take natural things, relying on my spirituality and doing research on all of my conditions. I have given up on the med system, they do maim and harm...it happened to me, and they do NOT know what is going on nor do they seem like the want to help (Hippocrates would be rolling in his grave, how they treat people today!).<br/><br/>Go to www.EarthClinic.com to get educated on YOUR HEALTH,, the Eastern/Alternative/Holistic medicine has always had it right for thousands of years...go natural, it's why God/Spirit put these plants and herbs on this planet for! Too many people rely on their Drs as "gods" when you listen to your own body what it needs, then you can start to heal! Great company and has all the super good ingredients that are natural. I am not a "paid" customer or "paid to do a review. or connected in anyway with the videos below...just tired of "those" that do not have our best interests at heart and tired of the medical merry-go-round!<br/><br/>Here is a real "eye-opener" you might want to see concerning your health (connect-the-dots people) please watch, even if you don't have an autoimmune disease/disorder...this video is for every man, woman and child out there:<br/><br/>"The Exploding Autoimmune Epidemic - Dr. Tent - It's Not Autoimmune, you have Viruses "<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/>and see this one too:<br/><br/>"Headaches - Dr. Tent"<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/>I wish all of you well and may good health find you!
 My doctor refuses to treat me for thyroid related issues because I tend to fall just barely within the 'normal range,' but I have all the symptoms. I am on anti depressants and other supplements too, but this helped take the edge off the 'fog' and fatigue. I can exercise without feeling like a dead weight and have some control over cravings. I like it!
 The reason I decided to try this product is because of those that had previously provided a review.  I was excited to receive this product and see if I notice any difference with my personal state -- being tired all the time.  I have noticed a difference.  Two different doctors told me to start prescriptions, metformin for PCOS -- it would help with depression, sleep, and losing those last awful pounds, so I was told; and Synthroid for slight Hashimotos.  I didn't want to start anything when I didn't understand what was going on with me.  I ordered this product and Sea Flakes to increase my iodine, since what I read with someone having thyroid problems was to increase your Iodine.  Last week I went to see an Endocrinologist.  He actually did an ultrasound of my thyroid.  Where I'm high is antibodies, but his recommendation was to do nothing -- my thyroid is working.  But I am feeling some relief on Thyroid support so I will continue.  I'm again, not taking any other prescriptions, so I know the support is helping some what.  but we still haven't ruled out why not sleeping -- we are in the process of digging through that -- running some other tests, etc.  My doctor (new doctor) was very proud of me for just NOT jumping onto prescriptions and trying to find the "reason" why.  So if anything I've learned, so your research, ask lots of questions, and get second or third opinions.  Natural stuff can assist during the process.
 I don't know how much this product is helping me because I have no thyroid due to cancer, and take levothyroxine. But I do know that the ingredients listed for the product are what my body needs, regardless of my situation. I take it for the nutrients. I also take other herbal supplements to help my body heal, and it's hard to figure out where one begins and the other ends. But when I take it as directed as well as eat right and do some form of exercise (which I have to do to lose weight since my metabolism is almost nonexistent), I do feel better. I try to remember to take it twice a day to get the maximum benefit. My body needs a lot these days due to my illness, which I hope is in remission! Going to try your other products as well.
 For 30 years, I have tried so many different medications for thyroid and nothing has helped. I told my dr that I don't notice any improvement and he always say give it time. I need to be on thyroid meds every day. I've tried oral appliance, CPAP machine, sleep studies, different meds and natural supplements for sleep and still no improvement.  I would be so sleep deprived that there were days I had to pull over the side of the road to rest my eyes before completing my drive home. My lunch hour was spent in the car napping.<br/><br/>I never gave up trying to find a solution. I did research, talked to friends and finally a friend recommended I Body Thyroid Support. I couldn't wait for my order from Amazon to arrive. The first night I took it, I noticed a difference. Even my husband said I wasn't turning and tossing as much. I couldn't believe that I FINALLY had a decent night of rest! I have my life back! OMG! I can't believe I suffered for so many years. Glad I didn't accept this as a way of life. Can't wait to share this with friends! My friends are always asking if I'm sleeping better and I can finally tell them yes!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 I have had the hardest time losing weight after menopause. I just kept gaining even with a healthy diet and exercise. After taking this product, I am happy to say I am on my way to my normal weight and I am feeling great and energized.
 Your experience with<br/><br/>Thyroid Support<br/><br/> I was diagnosed with Hashimotos at age 6 and have been on Synthroid my whole life ( I am now 32 years old). This past year, however, I decided to go off my medication for the first time. I tried different supplements to replace my prescription medication, but was not completely satisfied with them. 1 Body Thyroid support has had me feeling better than I have in years. Very satisfied and have already recommended it to at least 15 people!!
 I have been using together with turmeric to help with and inflammation that I had for the past 7 years. Have been taking this for 3 weeks now and have noticed a few things that I believe can be attributed to the use of this product. This Thyroid Support supplement has definitely helped to increase my clarity and focus, and overall energy and my appetite have decreased.I highly recommend this product, I haven't had any negative side effects at all and I love the way it has given me the extra boost that I need!
 Ok. If I could give this 6 stars I would.<br/><br/>I’m 32. Mom of three kids under 6. And own a business. I spent several months hardly being able to get out of bed or function well enough to care for my home. I always felt so exhausted. I’d sleep for 10 hours and wake up feeling like I needed a nap.<br/><br/>I started doing some research on thyroid issues and came across this supplement. All the great reviews sold me.<br/><br/>I’ve been taking this supplement for two weeks and I’m significantly less depressed. I have more energy and motivation. And I’ve gotten a lot of projects done the past two weeks that I’ve been needing to do for months. Like deep cleaning, projects for my business...and I’ve gained 20lbs the past six months so I got a gym membership and I’m starting back into a gentle workout routine.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this supplement and will continue taking it. I’m also taking 1000IUS is Vit D a day at the recommendation of my Dr.<br/><br/>I feel much better and am so thankful for this great supplement!!!!!
 Since taking Thyroid Support I have had a blast of energy daily.  I can not imagine life without it.  I have the symptoms of a sluggish thyroid, but have not been diagnosed.  I am now able to workout daily.  I will be ordering again!!!!
 I have tried everything. Every. Thing. I have hashimotos but am unable to convert t4 to t3 so I take Cytomel. This causes my hair to fall out, which is so distressing! I try to take less cytomel to decrease shedding but then feel exhausted. I have been taking this for a few weeks and seriously there is a major difference! I need so much less sleep and wake up actually feeling rested, which I haven't felt on years. I'm 42 so definitely should be able to make it through the day without a nap. I have taken SO MANY supplements and never noticed a difference but this one must have a different blend. I never leave reviews like this either because they can seem insincere but really, try this one. I am not sure if it will help with hair loss. Will check back after a month or two.
 This stuff is amazing .Since taking it I have noticed my hair is not falling out as much and that the hair on my eyebrows are no longer missing in certain areas, but growing normally now. You have GOT to try this product for yourself. You won't be disappointed .
 I'm finishing up my first bottle and have noticed that it's aggravating most of my Hashimoto's symptoms. About an hour after I take it my mood changes and I'm ready to burst into tears. I was very excited from all the great reviews, but it's definitely not for everyone. I gave it a shot, but it's making me feel hyperthyroid instead of helping.
 I don't care what anybody says, this product has helped me lose 5 lbs without trying. Goes to show that I've been complaining about my thyroid for years and my doctor said my results are always in the normal range? Apparently they're not because I feel so much better using this product. I recommend that anyone that is thinking about trying this product just try it. I'm only 5 days in and feel so much better. Thank you.
 I am having serious problems with my thyroid; it has caused my speech to slur quite badly. It turns out that some speech nerves run through the thyroid. I also had a lump forming under my chin. Things seem to be considerably better. I see my doctor next week to see if my test results are better. I'm taking my doctor's pills as well as these vitamins. I hate to take two things at once but, I have one life to live. I have a gut feeling that these vitamins are doing a wonderful job.
 I guess I'm still figuring out if it works. Here's my thought. Matcha instead of coffee greatly increases my daily energy. Taking these boosts THAT. 18 months ago I got half my thyroid taken due to tumor &amp; i've avoided going on a synthroid. Honestly I should probably be on a synthroid. But I don't want to be a slave to a pill &amp; numbers/levels are eradic &amp; the body WANTS to heal. My numbers go between miraculous &amp; borderline. I go between productive &amp; energetic &amp; crashed out, stressed out. I actually think these help &amp; they help right away, within the first day, maybe second. But coffee will leech them, possibly leech whatever else you're taking, or maybe it's just the caffeine overload that messes with energy levels. But I've noticed days when I drink matcha instead of coffee AND these pills I'm pretty much my normal self. There might be an outlier day of rest, but for the most part I'm great. I think these dehydrate me slightly! Give them a try. Also try the matcha. I'm very in tune with my body &amp; I am not 100% convinced this works but I do think it lends a bit of support - you just want to do it in conjunction with other mindful loving actions, lifestyle choices. This is a wonderful company too, nice perks. It cannot hurt to try this.<br/><br/>Update: I tried 2 bottles, then switched to another brand. I changed my 4 star review to 5 bc I can honestly say this brand worked - I just didn't realize until I switched.
 I have just ordered my second bottle of Thyroid Support. I bought this product in hopes that it would help me. I have been experiencing zero energy, just feeling lethargic and slow. Fogging thinking, stubborn weight gain, tired all the time, all miserable symptoms to experience. After a month of using 1 Body Thyroid Support, I have noticed a huge improvement in my energy levels. I now have more clarity and focus. I have the energy to want to exercise. I added this to my monthly deliveries, as I don't want to run out. This product is a great way to feel better naturally. I am enjoying a better quality of life now because of it.
 After I took this product for a month I felt a little better decided to take it again for another month. When I received the pills they where a green capsules. Amazon was unable to verify that they where the correct product. I’ve tried a different supplement in the meantime. Nothing compared to this product. With this supplement I felt energetic and my legs where less swollen.
 I suffer from multiple endocrine disorder, having a metabolic disorder where my body is constantly needing an extra boost is a difficult challenge. On top of thyroid issues, I am also a type 1 diabetic. I decided to try this product on top of the prescription I take for thyroid function and have noticed a discernible difference in my energy level and mood. I would recommend this natural blend to anyone looking for a positive change in energy.
 I showed this product to an endocrinologist and he stated that this formula has everything needed to keep my thyroid healthy.  This is important to me as I had to be treated for hypothyroidism with prescription medication from 2010 til 2012. I regained my thyroid health under the supervision of my doctor by living a healthier lifestyle. I was able to gradually cut back on the meds until my thyroid was operating normally. I have been off of thyroid medication for 4yrs now. I take this supplement daily.
 Absolutely love this stuff! Thyroid support is helping me lose stomach puffiness and gain energy and mental clarity. I'm remembering things I usually can't or struggle with. Also feeling much warmer and need much less sleep! I feel like I used to only feel with coffee without the jitters! It worked best for me to start on one capsule a day and work up to two :)

 Before taking this supplement, I would usually get tired later in the day at work and numerous times after having dinner. Afterwards, I would want to lay down to rest and often fall asleep for 1-3 hours at a time. Some days were worse than others and a few days weren't too bad but I knew my thyroid issue was wreaking havoc on me and not getting any better but slowly worsening.<br/>I have been on thyroid medicine for 9 years and the doctor has been slowly increasing my dosage to help with my levels. Still, I was having problems getting good quality sleep at night, feeling good throughout the day at work without fading, keeping focused, and not crashing and burning at night having little energy left.<br/>That's when I decided that I had to find a means using a natural approach to hopefully alleviate my problems and possibly reverse my thyroid back to a closer state to being normal.  It only took a few days of being on this supplement to notice a significant difference in my stamina during the day without fading later in the afternoon.<br/>In fact, many times after coming home and having dinner, I was still feeling good without going into that "crash and burn" mode wanting to sleep. I am also sleeping more soundly at night and have better focus with concentration that thyroid is notorious for affecting.<br/>Have I noticed a change in my energy levels, better stamina, getting better sleep, keeping focused? Absolutely, YES!  And by the way, I've lost 8 pounds without trying since taking this supplement for the past month.<br/>I'm looking forward to my next visit with my doctor in June to review my lab work and see where my thyroid levels are and let him know this product has helped me without a doubt.
 I did not get a chance to try this product since the seal was broken on both the original bottle and replacement bottle. The bottle comes in an outer cardboard box (that is not sealed closed) and has a plastic wrap around the outer lid. The plastic cellophane wrap was only partially on the bottle and the lid could easily be pulled off with the wrap still affixed. The inner most seal on the top of the container was already off and stuck inside the lid. I returned it for a replacement. The same exact thing was wrong with the replacement bottle. I would assume this is a quality control issue, or something else.
 I absolutely love this product.  I lost 5 lbs in the first week I was taking it and it keeps me energized without the jitters.  Highly recommend it.
 My Husband has had hypothyroid and taken levothyroxine over the past 15 years but it doesn’t seem to do anything to help him. His skin is dry, hair is thinning and he has been gaining weight for no reason. I ordered both the gout supplement and the thyroid supplement close together.  My Husband had a severe gout flare up, just before both supplements came in. (Also, I should mention my husband is an Air Force Medic, a private sector paramedic and went on to get his Masters Degree in health care administration, so he is extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of medicine). Since the gout flareup was extremely painful he decided to use the Utica acid supplements along with the gout pain cream. These is helping him but it is going on three weeks now, and just starting to get better. He did not want to mix both the thyroid supplements with the Utica acid supplements while having such a bad flareup. So he is just starting to take the thyroid supplements and so far he has not noticed any change. Hopefully it just needs to get in his system for a little longer and I am hopeful that the supplements will work. Do you think taking both the thyroid supplements and Utica acid supplements together are safe??<br/>Thank you
 I have been using this for about a month now and just ordered my second bottle.<br/><br/>I have been struggling with hair thinning and hormonal imbalance for a couple years now. I've done blood work, and everything comes back fine. But I know my body and I know that something isn't right. I began taking these and within a couple weeks it feels like I have my life back. My energy levels are great, I'm eating normally again, and have gained the couple pounds I lost. I've had oily skin my whole life, but this past year my face was so dry to the point of massive dry patches that peeled regardless of what moisturizer I used. My skin is going back to it's oily state, which I used to hate, but now it's such a blessing haha. I'm taking these in conjunction with a hair supplement, in hopes that I can regain a full head of thick hair, as it used to be. But so far, I have absolutely zero complaints about these supplements. When all else fails, go the natural route, you'll be surprised!
 This seems to be working very well for my thyroid issues. My mental and physical has improved since taking Thyroid Support. I am so glad I tried something different before adding in meds. I hate that once you're on meds doctors won't even listen or try to help you get off them. I plan to continue taking these. I have also recently ordered 1 Body's Brain Supplement for my husband as he is getting older and needs the extra focus at work.  I look forward to receiving my free bottle.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement with Iodine - Metabolism, Energy and Focus Formula - Vegetarian &amp; Non-GMO - Vitamin B12 Complex, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more 30 Day Supply</a>
 I’ve been taking Thyroid Support for almost 3 weeks, and so far I’d say I haven’t been taking it long enough to notice the full effects.  I started taking the supplement when the iodine supplement I was taking wasn’t working enough to get rid of the overall inflammation and joint pain being caused by my Hashimoto’s.  While this is keeping the minor symptoms at bay, like night sweats, hot flashes, brain fog, restless sleep, I’m still having problems with chronic inflammation, joint pain, and overall irritability.  I feel like I’m in a cycle of inflammation at the moment that I can’t seem to shake.  After reading a lot of the reviews, I think I’m going to add the Adrenal Support to the Thyroid Support and then review the product again.
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support supplement for a little over a month. I was feeling tired all of the time, was losing tons of hair and my face was very puffy and swollen. I am 32 years old and have had a few health issues over the last year. After trying different supplements suggested by my doctors, friends, and family, I went on my own search. I read great things about this Thyroid Support product and with the affordable price tag and and nothing to lose attitude, I got started. In the first week or two I didn't notice much difference. As I continued taking the supplement I noticed a gradual increase in energy level and mood, my hair fall decreased and now at almost a month of taking the supplement my puffy face is even much better. Added bonus, I just submitted the request for my next bottle free. This awesome company sent me a claim for product with my first order! Awesome! I plan to continue using this supplement and I would encourage anyone else to try it!
 After reading so many positive reviews, I began taking this supplement a few months ago. I definitely felt a big difference in my day to day life. I felt like I had more energy and did not feel as sick and crummy all the time. Once I ran out I got to eager and bought another kind of thyroid support supplement from the health food store. That was a bad idea. The other brands supplement made me ill. I think the other brand contained way too much iodine. So I stopped taking all thyroid supplements for about a month until I reordered 1 body's Thyroid Support again. One thing I am noticing, this time around, is that I've seen a drastic change in my daily hair loss. I am usually pulling out clumps of hair at the end of the day but now I am shedding very light hair. I am very satisfied with this product.
 On day 5 and not noticing anthing yet, except a little nausea about an hour after taking it.  I'm hoping to start seeing some differences within a couple of weeks.  I suffer from all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, like many of you.  I hope this is the answer!  I will update as time goes on.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  Ok, it's been about 2 weeks and not noticing any difference yet.  I may be like some of you who didn't notice anything until the end of the month?  I'm sticking with it, and will let you know!<br/><br/>UPDATE:  Week 3!  Starting to notice subtle differences... I have a bit more energy, and I'm actually visiting the bathroom each day without using a laxative!  This is a big deal for me!  I wish it did more for my appetite, but maybe it will in time.  I'm going all the way to the end of the bottle!  Will update you next week.
 I love this product! I am a night shift nurse and even before switching to nights, I ALWAYS felt tired, regardless of how much I slept. I also have a long history of trouble using the bathroom regularly. After a week of using this product, I have was much more "regular" and felt so much more rested and alert. I am confident that how I feel is due to this product actually being effective and not just a placebo effect. I also got a free bottle after purchasing my first one!
 I have Hashimoto's and Lupus and I've been walking around like a zombie for more than 15 years. Both of these autoimmune diseases zap all of my energy and wreak havoc with my sleep and ability to focus. I've tried so many supplements, etc., even B12 shots, but until now none of them were worth even 5 cents! Enter 1 Body Thyroid Support - my hero!! Within days I had so much more energy and stopped tossing and turning each and every night. It even helped my 'brain fog' and allowed me to better focus and concentrate. My mind was no longer wandering in a thousand directions.<br/><br/>I  haven't lost any weight but I hold out hope that it will happen. Until then I am going to keep re-ordering my new best friend - 1 Body Thyroid Support - and will be recommending it to my fellow Hashimoto's and low thyroid sufferers!<br/><br/>If you suffer from thyroid issues do yourself a favor and order this product! You won't regret it.
 I wasn't sure what to expect, so I kept my expectations low.  I usually have trouble losing weight even though I eat a clean 1200 or less calories per day.  After taking this product for 2 weeks, I was pleasantly surprised that I was down a half a pound. (This was after a weekend of eating out due to celebrations  - I expected to have a gain)  I will continue to take the product and see if I notice continued changes. No noticeable change in my energy as of yet.  I started with 1 each morning to see how my body reacted and moved to 1 in the a.m. and 1 before bed  after a week. No side effects.
 So I'll try to make a long story short but in September 2017, my mental health took such a bombing that I ended up in the hospital due to a suicidal plan. That was the first time anyone in my life checked my thyroid hormones and it turned out I was hypothyroid (among depression and anxiety). So they stuck me on Synthyroid/Levothyroxine and one of the biggest things that did was stop the suicidal thoughts that ran constantly in my head like a buzz or low hum from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep (for the last 7 years at this point). I had some of my hair (mainly my eyebrows) grow back and my hair grew in darker but besides that, I felt more sluggish and tired. I had new symptoms that I didn't ever have before. I eventually talked to my doctor to switch to nature throid and while the symptoms that were from the synthetic thyroid replacement eventually left, I still felt like crap and on top of this, my thyroid numbers were still low considering I was taking higher dosages. So as my nature throid was running out, I realized I had a choice to make. I could keep doing what everyone else was telling me to do and still feel like I was just trapped right beneath the surface or I could take a leap of faith and try something new and see if that makes any difference. I followed the directions of thyroid support, taking only 1 for 3 days before bumping it up to two. Even with the one pill I was already starting to feel better. I started to stop sleeping 10+ hours and still feeling groggy and tired and sluggish to sleeping about 8 hours and being ready to go and having much energy throughout the day. I am accomplishing more in my day, I'm not so depleted on energy and I can actually have enough energy to do the things that would help me get more energy (like exercise--taking walks and dancing is my fav). Also, ever since the hospitalization, if I didn't get 10 hours of sleep, there was absolutely NO WAY my body could even try to function. Two days ago, I went to bed at 1:30/2am and had to be up at 7:20am and yeah, I was tired but I GOT UP AND WAS ABLE TO FUNCTION. That was huge and something that I had missed (I'm only 22). This thyroid support is amazing and I'm so very happy I gave it a shot! :)
 Using two a day made my body feel great but gave me such terrible anxiety I stopped. Kept taking one a day until they ran out. Efficacy on the physical side wasn’t nearly as noticiable taking only 1 a day, but the anxiety from taking 2 a day wasn’t worth the trade off to me. Chose not to reorder.
 The first month I took this product I noticed a few of changes. I had an increase of energy, less PMS symptoms, changes in my appetite, sleeping better, and my skin wasn't as dry anymore. Once I switched to the 2nd bottle, I started experiencing terrible headaches and insomnia. Also, the pills in the 2nd bottle were darker in color. I did receive a message explaining why the color changed and there were no changes made to the formula. I stopped taking the pills and no longer experiencing headaches. Maybe there was a change to the formula, maybe not.
 A few years ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was immediately put on synthroid medication. The medication helped a great deal in normalizing my TSH numbers but for some reason I still felt tiredness most times. I came to Amazon looking for a more natural solution to my problem. Upon reading the product descriptions for Thyroid Support combined with the elaborate reviews I decided on purchasing this product.<br/><br/>To minimize any drug interactions with my Synthroid medication, I spaced intake of the Thyroid Support some 12 hours apart. It's now some two weeks since I started taking the Thyroid Support supplement. I can report that my overall energy situation seems to have improved, I'm less lethargic, and more active during my waking hours. I believe that this supplement augments the effects of my thyroid medication thereby improving my overall health.<br/><br/>Update<br/><br/>I had misgivings when I started taking Thyroid Support but after more than one month of using this product, my overall health has improved. I feel more energized, sleep well and go about my day feeling fresh and invigorated. I don't seem to tire as fast as before when exercising and my weight is manageable.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Thyroid Support supplement especially for those with under-performing thyroid glands. It helps a great deal that this product is packed with nutrients that together help improve the health of hypothyroid sufferers. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 I've been struggling with trying to find something for my hypothyroidism. Got tired of docs so took it in my own hands. Came across thus, researched and gave it a try. Been using it almost two weeks again and feeling alive again!! Sleeping better, have energy again, less moody, starting to lose weight. This has been a life saver for me and truly grateful!
 I have been taking levothyroxine thyroid medication for about 5 years because I got 5.6 at my TSH blood test. With its help, I was able to lower it to about ~3.8 using 50mcg dosage.  I really wanted to stop taking them just because these are not as healthy as some vitamin pills for example. Then I decided to try Thyroid Support Supplement but before I did that I went to do a TSH blood test so I know what the level is before I start taking them. I was shocked to see a result of 5.6. I thought that now is the best time for sure to try making a change. I was taking Thyroid Support Supplement for exactly 4 months and did a TSH test again and the results turned out as 4.16 where 4.20 is a max level. I couldn't believe my eye that a natural solution could do a better job! Will be continuing taking them and hopefully it will be if not lower at least the same.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support daily for about a month and a half. About 6 months ago I adopted a gluten free diet when I found out I have Hashimoto's. My endocrinologist agreed to let me try a natural approach first to see if I could lower my TSH levels, increase my free T3 and T4 and lower my antibodies. I'm grateful that she did. After less than 3 months of taking selenium and eating gluten free my thyroid panels came back within normal range, though antibody counts hadn't lowered. I began learning more about Ashwaganda and other nutrients that can support thyroid health and that's when I switched from selenium only (I liked to get mine from Brazil nuts rather than supplements) to 1Body's Thyroid Health. I feel my energy and motivation levels are improving. A year ago I couldn't get through 2 miles of running without feeling sluggish and fatigued and then I'd stop. I used to run much longer distances frequently, so this is not normal for me. Now I run 4 miles and feel like I can keep going - the way I used to feel! My hair also seems to be growing in again where it used to be thinning - much to my relief (though to be fair I've been using shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatments to help with this too, so it's hard to separate out what's having the impact).  I just had my next set of labs done, though I don't have the results back yet. I'm hopeful that TSH has lowered further, that free T3 and T4 have inched up more - and especially that the antibody count has decreased. I plan to stick with it and be patient as long as things are stable and/or moving in the right direction.  Restocking my supply of 1Body's Thyroid Support right now - happy to supply my feedback on how it's working in return for a free bottle!
 I like this thyroid support supplement because of the beneficial ingredients. It has the same exact ingredients as a previous thyroid supplement I tried, except this one doesn't smell strongly like that one did. It's helped to boost mood and energy so I know the herbal ingredients agree with me and help with my chronic illness. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and I'll take anything that helps and boosts my natural defenses. The capsules are easy to swallow and are packed fully with powder, which many supplements on the market lack.
 I took this supplement for about a week and a half to two weeks. Almost immediately, I started noticing strange, even worrisome side effects. First I started having what felt like multiple hot flashes throughout the day.  I was so miserably hot at times, I had to remove layers in a cold room that everyone else was complaining about. I wasn’t having hot flashes at all prior to this supplement. I’m usually freezing cold all day.  Then a couple of days later I had a massive breakout all over my face, including a major rosacea flare up.  Then I started noticing unpleasant, even worrisome urinary issues I had not been experiencing prior to using this supplement.  Then I forgot to take it over a couple of days, and all of the symptoms disappeared.  I didn’t make the connection until I started taking it again...and all my symptoms came back in a day.  After a few more days of taking it, I became suspicious, stopped the supplement, and all of the symptoms quickly disappeared again, and haven’t returned.  The urinary symptoms are not worth the risk for me.  I did notice that I felt a little more energy, but I must be very sensitive something in this supplement, my side effects outweighing any benefits.
 I feel more energized an have been sleeping better. I have also lost 10Lbs. While taking thyroid support. I started my second bottle today and will keep updating my review as I continue taking this supplement.
 I've purchased several bottles of this and I just do not know what it is supposed to do , or if it really does anything. I'm going to my primary M.D. this week and I will ask id this really is  a benefit as a thyroid supplement or if I'm just paying for some expensive urine. I'll let you know the verdict. And the first bottle I ordered were green capsules, the next were clear with a beige powder which strongly resembles a K3D2 supplement my husband takes. I often wonder if there are really any beneficial ingredients in these supplements.
 This works well alongside a straight iodine supplement. My thyroid issues have disappeared and my energy level has returned. I would definitely recommend this.
 I immediately noticed a higher energy level and less anxiety.  It seems that my outlook is more positive and my interest level in doing things has increased.  It is too soon to tell about weight loss, but since I only want to lose 5 pounds, I am hoping that happens as well.  I usually do not write reviews, but this product does really appear to provide positive benefits to the body and mind.
 I've noticed that since I started taking the thyroid support, my appetite is reduced and I'm losing weight.  This product has been very helpful and I feel good with no side effects.
 I ordered this product as well as the Adrenal Support as I was looking for a natural supplement to help with my fatigue, mood swings, energy loss, etc.  I have been taking both supplements for 10 days and can tell you the difference in my overall physical and mental health is incredible.  I have started to regain my energy levels and no longer have those mood swings.  I highly recommend this product and I will continue using it as part of my daily regiment.  When I say this product is a life saver I do mean it.  I'm starting to feel like "me" again.  thank you thank you thank you
 I am satisfied with the purchase of the Thyroid Support Supplement. I'm fairly young to be formally diagnosed with hypothyroidism, but it does run in my family and I began experiencing many of the known symptoms, especially the fatigue, coldness in my hands and feet, loss of hair and weight gain, so I thought that taking a supplement would aid in preventing the full effects of it. I have been taking it for a couple weeks now, and I've definitely noticed that I feel less tired/groggy throughout the day, and have noticed that I've been waking up in the morning feeling very well rested. Perhaps its too soon to tell, but I have noticed less shedding of hair, however I want to wait at least a month or too before determining if that is from the supplement. I also experienced a dramatic decrease in the constant coldness of my hands and feet. Overall, I think its a great product, and I haven't noticed any negative side effects.<br/>The other thing I wanted to say was that prior to purchasing the supplement, I read many of the reviews to see what others thought of the product. I was very impressed by the quality of service 1 Body provides in replying to many of the reviews, good or bad, as well as following up with costumers via email.
 It seems to be giving my body and brain the support it needs since I decided to stop a thyroid medication I was on.  I developed a rash around the time I started thyroid medication but it was gradual and did not make the association or deduction until it started getting worse over time.  I stopped the medication and now the rash is SLOWLY fading.  I researched and looked at reviews for this product because I needed something to help my body and mind with my thyroid condition.  My mood is healthy(which is a challenge for me) and my body is doing pretty good.  My job is demanding so I do get tired but without some kind of support I would be more tired.  I don't recommend people stopping their medications of course but I can't live with a nasty rash I can see let alone what the medication is ding to my body that I cannot see.  I will stick the "Thyroid Support" for now.  The ingredients I trust as researching them I found is what does support the thyroid and it's workings.
 Pretty annoyed that the product description AND the box it came in says that the B12 used is methylcobalamine which is the one that better absorbed and stored but the container I received says cyanocobalamin which is a synthetic form of B12. I have not tried the product yet as I'm uncertain on whether or not I even want to
 Since taking Thyroid Support I have noticed a distinct reduction in the menopause symptoms I've been experiencing.  My night sweats have gone from every night to very infrequent.  The hot flashes I was having have been significantly reduced as well.  Previously, I had a fan at my desk and carried a hand fan with me all the time for hot flashes.  I have tried other over the counter menopause remedies (Estroven and Amberen) but did not have any success - if anything, they seemed to make my symptoms worse.  Thyroid Support has been the only supplement that has mitigated my symptoms.  I highly recommend it!
 Love this formula! I take Levithyroxine but have still been feeling sluggish. This gives me noticeable energy (which has aided in weight loss, as well).  I've just ordered my 3rd bottle.
 Saying these pills are life changing might be a bit over the top, but they really have made a noticeable improvement. I am more focused with much less brain fog, have more energy, and sleep better. Maybe it is placebo. Who the heck knows, but even if it is, I will continue to take these pills for the foreseeable future, and highly recommend these if you are diagnosed with Hypothyroidism.<br/>Even if you have not been, if you feel like your brain is a bit foggy, and need more energy, these are worth a try.
 I decided to try this product after a blood test showed my thyroid was not working like it used to. I am reluctant to take prescription medications because of the many possible negative side effects.  After reading about Thryroid Support I thought I would give this a try before giving in to my doctor's request that I start taking a thyroid prescription. I am going to take it another couple of months and then have another blood test. The ingredients in this brand by 1Body are all recommended when I researched natural fixes for thyroids. I am hoping for the best!
 I started talking these pills hoping to fix a thyroid issue I know I have. Although my doctor says my thyroid is fine I really do not think so. My Grandmother and my mother both have hypothyroidism and have suffered from this since their youth and I don't think mine was up to par. It was slow at first, but then after a few weeks I started to notice an improvement in my mood and I had a bit more energy. I also noticed I was not gaining weight every time I stopped dieting. I would have to either be activity dieting or something in order not to gain any weight and I don't even over eat. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.
 I have been taking this product for a few weeks. So far I have noticed my mood has definitely improved. I feel "normal" again. As prescribed by my doctor, I take synthroid for my low thyroid, but didn't feel like it was helping much. I am much happier since starting this thyroid support supplement. I recommend it.
 I have been suffering from thyroid problems since I stopped nursing my daughter, (I nursed for 2 1.2 yrs).  Between that and adrenal fatigue my hair was falling out, my sleep was terrible (2-3) hrs at most, I kept waking up every day at 230 am and couldn't go back to sleep until around 6 which is when my little one would wake up and be ready to go.  I had no idea what was going on but looked up my symptoms and found out all they symptoms went right with hypothyroidism, including the terrible anxiety, etc...<br/><br/>I decided before going on medications and pills that I would be  dependent on forever once take I would go the herbal route.  So I found these supplements, changed my diet to a pale diet, and I don't know exactly when but what I noticed first was my sleep.  While I think it is a the big picture where you cant just take herbal pills and think your symptoms will go away you have to adapt a new lifestyle, I think getting those necessary herbs and minerals are imperative as well.  I really liked thyroid support's blend, and the fact that  they are veggie capsules as I was a vegetarian before adapting a paleo (with limited meat intake) diet.<br/>I will continue to take them and update my review to let you all know how its going.
 I am newly diagnosed, so my body is all kinds of crazy right now, but I have to say I can tell a difference when I don't take them. I can't tell you for sure what it is but I do know its good enough for me to want to keep taking it, I feel better when I take them. Thank you for your product!!
 I started taking this and a few days later I noticed that I didn't need to take a nap in the middle of the day. My energy increased and I believe it is regulating my hormones as well. I would suggest starting with one capsule a day then move to one in the morning and one at night. As long as the quality continues to be good, and I can see a difference in how I feel, then I will continue to be a customer. Just ordered the supplement for adrenal fatigue and hoping I that will increase the benefits.
 Great product and it truly does work.  Was able to grow back all of my eye brows the way they are supposed to be.  Definitely buy!!!
 I started taking 1Body Thyroid support 2 weeks ago and I have noticed improvement in energy level and mood and to my surprise dropped  2 lbs!<br/>I will return for another review when I’ve taken for 3 months. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a><br/><br/>6/16/2016  This is a follow-up review; now 3 months after being on daily Thyroid support supplement I can tell a significant difference on level energy, painful muscleskeletal system, itchy skin and bowel function; when I take it my symptoms improve and resolve completely. I may forget to take  supplement and symptoms return.  My TSH is a low normal but I have symptoms consistent with a sluggish thyroid gland, taking Thyroid support does make a difference for me and recommend it to anyone with hypothyroid symptoms and normal TSH.
 I purchased this product due to the high reviews. I have Hashimoto's disease and wanted to find a product that will preserve the remaining thyroid function that I have. Most doctors don't want to recommend any type of vitamins or homeopathic therapy for diseases, and I am more interested in non-pharmaceutical treatment. This is why I chose this product. I don't think I have been taking it long enough for the full effects; however, I do notice less brain fog. I have been taking it once a day instead of twice a day, because one of the reviews recommended this (I don't want it to affect the insomnia that I deal with).
 I absolutely love this product because everything I read about the supplement has proven be accurate. Now days, I am very skeptical of our medicine world because so many products promise to help you, but do not hold up that promise. A lot of times, the product either doesn't work or it makes you worse. I have struggled with thyroid issues &amp; endless symptoms for over 20 years. When I started taking this supplement a few weeks ago, I noticed an immediate change in my appetite, as well as, my energy level. I feel more alert &amp; not so brain fogged. I have more energy to complete day to day task now instead of feeling like taking a nap constantly. Thank you so much for such a wonderful, healthy, worthwhile product I can trust!
 This is my second review for this product.  Are used it consistently for two months,  and raved about it:  more energy, less digestive problems, etc.  then I let myself run out,  and spent weeks battling digestive issues and extreme fatigue day after day.<br/> My fatigued brain finally made the connection, and I re-ordered. I started using it again yesterday,  and today is the first day in weeks that I haven’t crawled straight into bed after coming home from my job in a kindergarten classroom!  I realize it’s early to state that this is a lasting benefit, but based on my prior experience, I think I am a customer for life.  Thank you for marketing this product!!
 When my acupuncture doctor diagnosed me with a low thyroid condition (very cold hands, fatigue, brain fog, hair loss), she advised me to take an iodine supplement.  I stopped at a store on the way home and found some liquid iodine drops, but was not sure.  At home I headed for my computer to see what Amazon had to offer, and that's where I found 1 body Thyroid Support.  I liked the fact that it not only contains iodine, but it also has other supporting ingredients.  I ordered it right away and started taking it as soon as it arrived.  Sure enough, as the days went by, I started gradually feeling better and better!  I have now finished that first bottle, and the very cold hands, fatigue and brain fog have gone away.  I want to keep this up!  I have just ordered my second bottle, and am looking forward to continuing benefits!
 I don't understand why, but this product along with the Adrenal Support just plain works. Have felt a noticeable difference since adding this two products to my daily routine. I had a TT 7 1/2 years ago and have never felt normal since, but this has started to make a change in me in just 2 weeks. I am a big fan so far and look forward to seeing what happens after being on them even longer.
 I've only been taking this for a few days. I had already been taking an adrenal support from a local health food store, for about a week. I can tell a difference in the adrenal support, and it's much better after taking both adrenal and thyroid support. I am very impressed with the company 1 Body. After ordering the thyroid support, I received an email. In this email I was informed that many people dealing with thyroid issues have reported the best thing to seem to work for them was pairing the thyroid with adrenal support. I was also told that if I do both, to only take one adrenal and one thyroid per day. They also sent an EBook about the thyroid. This included information about what to eat and what to stay away from, as well as recipes that would help support the thyroid. I feel like I learned more in that one email than I did in the last 10 years through doctors. I have for the past three days been able to stay productive all day long. I can feel myself getting tired, so I'll take a break, eat, and get back to being productive. It feels great. I hope it will continue to improve the longer I take it. I also hope it will be even better once I get back to the gym and eating healthier. I will for sure be buying this again, and I will also purchase the adrenal support from 1 Body as well.
 I have an overall better feeling of wellness. My mood swings have been less frequent and less drastic. Even if I don't get quite as much sleep as I should, I still feel great during the day and don't get bogged down when things don't go exactly how I planned them. This product did not fix all my problems, but it has greatly improved my symptoms of hypothyroidism, including mood swings, irritability, constant fatigue, digestive issues, brain fog, and always feeling cold. I plan to take this supplement for as long as 1 Body keeps making it. It has legitimately changed my life, and my loved ones can actually tell that I feel much better.
 I am using two 1 Body products - Adrenal Support and Thyroid Support.  Since I started using both, I definitely feel better and some of my symptoms of stress and hypothyroid have definitely started going away.  I was stunned this morning when I had a little glitch trying to order something from their website, and so I emailed Customer Service.  In less than an hour I heard from two different people in Customer Service offering to help me.  My problem was resolved and my expectations were exceeded. What a great company!!!!!!
 I have bought these when they were in the white/ off white capsules.<br/>The second time I reorder them there in a dark green/blue capsules.<br/>About after a min. of taking one they open up before there supposed to<br/>in the stomach/ throat  and have a burning yucky taste to them.<br/>Don't know if I'll reorder from this company.<br/>Other than that I like them, seems to be working.
 I have hashimoto's and have walked through trying to heal my thyroid. I am currently taking T3 only because my body cannot seem to convert T4. I started having issues with waking up during sleep and insomnia (classic symptoms my thyroid is out of sync). I was researching support for thyroid and ran across this. It has important minerals in it that I know I "should" be taking but with everything else I take, I don't do it consistently. I decided to give it a try. I have been feeling better, more energy throughout the day and I have resolved my sleep issues. I appreciate the ingredients and that they are vegetarian capsules. Thank you!
 I was seeking out a supplement for my thyroid because of major fatigue, hormonal imbalance, and sudden weight gain. I’ve been taking this product for 21 days now and have noticed increased energy more than anything else. When I would be pouring my second cup of coffee, I’m now feeling much more alert. I’m not seeing a change in weight gain but I intend to order my second month supply and kick up my efforts. For 2 months now I’ve been drinking apple cider vinegar once or twice a day, my next goal is to regulate my sleeping patterns (mom of 3 littles here 🙋🏻‍♀️) and fit in some yoga. I have yet to notice any negative side effects from taking this supplement.
 I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and am so happy with the difference it has made in my life. I didn't notice much of a difference at first, but by the second week I noticed I had more energy &amp; actually woke up in the morning easier. I struggle with exhaustion all day and mornings are a nightmare. It usually takes multiple alarms to wake me up and once awake it takes me hours (and a LOT of caffeine) just to function. I started waking up without an alarm a lot of days and now wake up to one alarm immediately. I'm not bouncing with energy (although I'm still hoping that happens) but I'm able to make it through the day without it being such a struggle. I was shocked that I was able to handle waking up at 4am to cover a work shift, AND being able to stay awake until 10pm that night...that would have never happened before taking this supplement. It feels so wonderful to be able to function like a normal human being again that I will never be without this supplement!
 My TSH test result was found to be indicative of Hypothyroidism and therefore was prescribed Levothyroxine 50 mcg. Within a week I developed terrible itching on my legs and feet. I couldn't tolerate this medicine. I tried 25 mcg, but without success. After some search on Amazon, I found Thyroid Support. As I am comfortable using herbal/Ayurvedic products, I decided to try it. It has worked for me. No adverse effects. I find it induces deep sleep, which is a great additional advantage. About the TSH , I will know the result when I go for the test in a few weeks. It appears that Thyroid Support by 1 Body is a safe and effective remedy for Hypothyroidism.<br/>I plan to continue using this product. The only reason I gave one less star is because I found it a bit too expensive for continued use over very long period.
 I am 52 years old women and I have been dealing with anxiety and sleeplessness for over two years.  In addition, these symptoms were accompanied with depression, fatigue, hair loss (lost two thirds of my hair), hot flashes and the inability to concentrate.  I elicited the help of my doctor and I had blood work done to check my hormone balance.  I was diagnosed with borderline low thyroid and my doctor prescribed another brand of thyroid support as well as supplements to bolster my immune system.  I also tried other herbal remedies on my own... but nothing helped.  After about the third week of taking Throid Support, I started sleeping again and the anxiety went away as did my other issues.  I am thrilled and truly grateful for this product!  I feel like myself again!!
 The moment i started taking this i could have felt its powerful effects. My body feels more warmer. Normally cold and bad smells from using coming to the bathrooms disappear almost completely. Bowels empty completely and stools develop as it should. No more diarrhea. My metabolism was off the charts. A few hrs into a meal and its like i never ate in days, if not weeks. I take with one squared beef liver. A wonderful pair.
 I feel better. It is kind of subtle so I had to think about it. My thyroid level according to lab blood tests are always at the very bottom of normal. So my regular doctor does not believe I need any supplementation even though I have always had the classic low thyroid symptoms.  My thyroid works but I think it just needs some support and that is what this product is doing. I have only taken this supplement for 3 weeks so I look forward to more improvement.  The owner of Natural Alternatives, a local business, recommended this product to me.
 Okay, I've only been taking this product for two days, but for the last two days I've had lots of energy instead of needing a 20 minute "power nap" in the afternoon. If the Thyroid Support is what's causing my renewed energy, I'll be buying it from now on!!! Also, inside the box was an offer for a free bottle of Thyroid Support, including free shipping! What a great offer!! I can't guarantee that there will be a free offer in your box, but it's worth a try to see.<br/><br/>I've been taking Thyroid Support for 2 1/2 weeks now, and I have energy all day long! I know that this sounds like a hokey paid ad, but I really do feel a LOT better. One day I felt like I needed a 10 minute power nap, but after sitting for about ten minutes and not falling asleep, I got up again and kept going all day. My naturopath has had me trying different thyroid supplements, but none of those has made me feel any different. I  have made other tweaks, though: adding organic peanut butter back to my diet, in spite of the bad rap that it gets lately (I have Type A blood, so peanut butter is supposed to be a medicine food for me.), taking B-12 EVERY day instead of hit-and-miss (I'm vegan), taking Hyland's Bioplasma, and I had a 20-year-old root canal removed about a month ago. So is it the Thyroid Support? Placebo effect? A combination of things?? I can't say for sure, but I took the first TS capsule in the afternoon, after it was delivered to the house, and have felt wonderful and energetic ever since!!<br/><br/>For any of you who are still reading this review: I'll be 59 in January, so I'm not OLD, but not young, either, and have just not felt very energetic for a few years now, basically since going through menopause.  I'm a Certified Herbal Consultant and worked in a health food store training under an R.N. and a Naturopath, so picked up a lot of info, did a lot of research, and tried a LOT of different products in search of more energy (I took Armour thyroid pills for a year or so in my twenties or thirties because I was tired even back then, but they never seemed to help). I'm very in touch with my body and how I'm feeling (I argued with my doctors for 7 1/2 months telling them that I was pregnant with twins while they kept telling me that I wasn't  I was!!], as opposed to the women who give birth without knowing that they're pregnant lol.), so I KNOW when something is making me feel totally  different, and I think that it's Thyroid Support. Try it and see if it helps you, too. I know that I'll keep ordering it from now on.<br/><br/>I've been taking Thyroid Support for one month now. I've had only three or four days when I was tired in the afternoon (20 minute power nap time). Normally I'd have one "good" day every two weeks or so, so this has been wonderful!! I've finished a carpentry project in the last two weeks, and I'd never have been able to do that before, or, if I did, it would have taken me months to complete, so YAY!!
 I take Nature Thyroid prescribed by Endocrinologist for Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. I am also taking Thyroid Support. I started taking 3 weeks ago. So far, so good. I am looking forward to seeing the differences in my body and how I feel after taking this product long term. I also have a problem with my Pituitary function that does not allow correct cortisol production of my adrenal glands so I am taking 1 adrenal support in the AM and 1 thyroid support at noon.I am hoping these products will make a difference.
 I have blood work every 6 months because my thyroid levels are on the edge of being too low. Another blood test is scheduled in 2 months - hoping 1Body Thyroid Support shows improvement! Energy levels seem to have improved, and memory feels a bit clearer. Capsules are easy to take! I've read bad things about prescribed thyroid supplements, so am really trying to find alternatives. Thank you!
 It helps me feel like I have my thyroid back. I had thyroid cancer and had to have it totally removed. The levathroxyine  dose my endocrinologist has me on seems to be just short of actually working. It's like I need just one more cup of coffee. The thyroid support really helps. I feel like my old self again and it's great!
 I having been using Thyroid Support Supplement, along with my thyroid medicine, for 2weeks daily.  I was going to see my Endocrinologist soon and had to have my blood work done first. When I saw my doctor he asked me if I was taking anything else for my thyroid.  I told yes, and what it was.  He then told me that my lab work was very good in all areas where I was lacking.  He was impressed and said I could continue taking The Thyroid Supplement .  So, my blood work is proof that Thyroid Supplement does help a lot.  I've had Hypothyroidism for at least 20 years. I have never taken any thing else but my thyroid medicine.  I did some research recently and found that the doctors don't tell you all the things you need for your thyroid to work correctly. That is how I found Thyroid Support Supplement, and I'm so glad I did!
 I quit taking thyroid Meds a few years back and since then I've been looking for a more 'natural' approach to treating my sluggish thyroid. These pills seem to help with my energy and sleep patterns.
 From the first day of taking it I noticed the swelling go down on my ankles, improved sleep, and less cramping on my menstrual period. I will continue to use the product.
 I have had lab tests which show no issues, but both my mom and brother were diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease. I decided to try something and after a few products I found this product and am AMAZED!! No more extreme loss of hair! Able to lose weight finally! Feel much more focused! AND JUST FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN!!  I will tell others about this amazing product!!
 Love Thyroid Support.  Started feeling a difference within 3 days.  After 2 weeks I have more energy, more motivated and focused on the task.  Lost 5 lbs which I'm thrilled about and am not losing as much hair which was a problem. I don't want to be without it!
 After using Thyroid Support Supplements for three weeks, my energy and being able to sleep through the night has improved.  Also, I noticed my anxiety and feeling depressed no longer exist.  I realized my anxiety no longer exist after going out to dinner for the New Year and not feeling like I am having a panic attack from being around a big crowd of people.  I use to feel depressed from just thinking about different things in my life like my bills and the passing of my love ones last year.  Now I am able to look at things in a more positive way and not feel depressed.  My skin looked and felt dry before taking these supplements now  after taking these supplements for three weeks my skin is not dry looking anymore. I never had a problem with break outs, my skin was just very dry looking at times and I have always been able to grow long nails before taking this product.  I am hoping to see an improve with my thinning hair within the next couple of months.  I take one supplement daily instead of two but I may start taking two daily.  I will write another review for an update later this year.
 I really like this product. Shipping was fast. The product worked fast into my system to where I could feel the results in 1-2 weeks. There is a noticeable increase of energy and stamina. Enough to help me through the day and not fall into a slump. It is helping with brain fog and that is a big plus. I will be ordering this product again.
 This Review will take you on bit of a journey, so settle back and read it if you wish.<br/><br/>Back in the days when dinosaurs walked the earth, if an eleven year old girl like me needed braces, a two-to-four hour set of x-rays were required! Fast forward a few decades and my TSH levels beegan dropping drastically, I had anxiety issues and probably a few other ailments as a result of that L-O-N-G set of now unnecessary x-rays. While I was being "examined and evaluated" regarding the need for braces on my teeth, little did I know years later those x-rays would wreak havoc on my thyroid. I suppose I should be happy that I didn't glow when I left the Orthodontist's office that fateful day! Over the years, I had small issues pop up, but nothing was as mentally scorching as being told, "You have a lump on your thyroid, we must biopsy you immediately!<br/><br/>Sidebar: I do not recommend EVER having a six-needle thyroid punch by ANY doctor unless they are 100% CONVINCED you have thyroid cancer, which I did NOT have. There are other test options! Stay away from invasive procedures. That was a miserable test all the way around.<br/><br/>I had grown up in a rarified world. My mother's Bible was the original Prevention magazine so we ate good, wholesome food the Rodale way. I sometimes regretted the fact that I was denied Wonder Bread, Twinkies and all the popular foods of the times because we lived a truly "natural" lifestyle (back when the word "natural" was not mis-appropriated by greedy people); this was before communes and organic farming came along. The lifestyle my mother felt was best for us probably saved my bacon (no, didn't get to eat that, either). Chocolate was the only thing that upset my personal applecart, because carob is NOT the same. I did finally get to enjoy some good chocolate when I was 16, but by that time candy was not important to me.<br/><br/>When my thyroid began misbehaving, I was not sure how to deal with the problem, in large part because the Levoxyl and Synthroid I was given were medications my body would NOT accept! The anxiety that my thyroid caused me, while trying to take those medications made me want to climb the walls! I had panic attacks and could not sleep! When the doctor told me to stop taking the thyroid medications, I was still a ball of nerves, but I felt better, just not 100%. My mother began giving me kelp and other iodine-containing products. I leveled off and began to feel better.<br/><br/>I began researching my thyroid and was amazed at the power that gland possessed, but it required nurturing, not over-medication. I had to find just the right combination of ingredients to calm it and myself.<br/><br/>I had a Chinese Herbalist who prescribed a wonderful mixture for me and I felt great...but we moved out of the area, so I needed to search for the proper herbs to contain my over-anxious thyroid. Here it is a good place to note that there are numerous ways a person's thyroid can react to bad environments, foods or ahem, medical procedures. The symptoms can range from extreme energy to extreme fatigue, weight gain and/or weight loss, it all depends on YOUR body and its reactions. We are each unique creatures, never forget that!<br/><br/>As I found out the hard way, it doesn't matter if you were originally diagnosed with either an overactive (hyperthyroidism) OR underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Sometimes the symptoms can be just as misleading as the diagnosis! Therefore, take all information you are given with a grain of iodized (or not) salt! However do NOT slack, get on a thyroid-care/maintenance program pronto!<br/><br/>I went to a Chinese Herbal doctor and he was the only one who was able to make me feel truly better, with a group of herbs formulated especially for me. Most people cannot afford that particular treatment, but over time I learned what was in his base formula and, since I became stabilized, I began looking for a similar formulation. I am not made of money either...sigh.<br/><br/>I just started taking 1 Body Thyroid Support with Iodine about two months ago. So far, so good. I am not anxious, sleepless, cranky, fatigued, nor am I experiencing any of the feelings I had been in the past when my thyroid flared up.<br/><br/>Is 1 Body's formula the answer? I will check back and let you know, but so far, so good. I am maintaining my thyroid's health as best as I can. I do not know the answers for every thyroid problem, nor do I purport to, but I can tell you that it is extremely important to remember one key thing:<br/><br/>The ONE thing we can do for our bodies is to stay healthy! Eat well, exercise, do not overdo ANYTHING, avoid sugar and its many substitutes (and if they are chemicals like Splenda or Aspartame, PLEASE avoid them at all costs, for they are carcinogens! Instead, try Stevia, a truly natural substance, and make sure to keep your "temple" clean. Get on it. Time passes quickly and one never knows what may happen. Every day we enjoy good health is another healthy, happy day!
 Been taking this for over a month. No change in my weight watsoever. I am going to purchase DHEA and see if that will help. I am a plant based vegan. I eat really good but have plateaued. I have 20 more lbs to lose. I will buy one more bortle to see if it kicks in later.<br/><br/>Update: tried havasu DHEA it gave me headaches &amp; anxiety. Returning it too. Next I will try DIM....
 Although I am still evaluating my progress with this product, my energy levels and alertness seem to be increasing in the mornings especially since I am intensive training with a new job, working my business when I get home, and helping with our 4 kids. I also was not 100 percent the other day but not sick. I feel good even with little sleep this last week. I am excited to continue taking this product long term as I get a sense of my entire body with long-term use. I look forward to giving an update in the near future!
 Okay, so I got tested for everything under the sun it seemed and to my surprise I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. My level was at 38 which means the higher the number the slower your system is working. So, I made a deal with the Dr. and told her that I will do my best to manage my thyroid using supplements. Well, after about 6 weeks, my levels dropped to 13. This says a lot. For a while I did stop and I should have kept on but, I am on it for good and managing just fine. If you desire to manage your thyroid, maybe you might want to try this product. It really works!!!
 I think I feel better, it is hard to tell.. but one thing is for sure... if I don't take them... I don't feel well... it is hard to explain... I do not see any improvements... but I guess they are... cause if I miss the pills for a few days... my hair starts falling... my nails become weaker... etc etc
 for 3 months i suddenly had no energy, could not do my nightly jogging...i don't have high or low numbers on my lab results BUT i did have a high (64) thyroid antibody which i think means i have a sluggish thyroid...took 2 of these pills around noon and i was jogging that very night. so i guess i need them!! sometimes i take on empty stomach, it never bothers me. i will continue on these forever :)
 I've taken 2 bottles of Thyroid Support from 1 Body and I like how my body has responded to the supplement. I've had more energy and have noticed that I'm sleeping better. No adverse side effects for me. I realize everyone can respond to supplements differently, but for me this supplement is working very well, I recommend to try it and see how it works for you. I am not being paid, nor was offered anything for my review - I paid for both bottles of this supplement. My review is solely based on my experience taking this product, as I was looking for a good quality thyroid supplement. I'm currently taking 60 mg of natural thyroid daily along with Thyroid Support.
 So far so good.  I haven't been taking this supplement for very long (i.e. 2 pills a day for about 3 weeks) but I have noticed some subtle changes in my health.  My energy level seems to have increased and I am not as irritable as before.  I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis about 9 months ago and I do not do well on prescription medications as I tend to have major side effects with anything I take.  To date, I have had no side effects from this supplement and am hoping that the other issues associated with Hashimoto's will eventually resolve themselves with the help of this supplement and life style changes.  I will definitely be purchasing their Adrenal Support and Liver Support products.  Perhaps all 3 products will help me regain a certain level of good health.  All the best to you as you pursue good health...
 I have started to feel better energy. I know I am getting the supplements I need for my thyroid to function well.  I know by continuing to take Thyroid Support, I will see stronger results.
 Thyroid Support has helped me have the energy to get back to writing again. Before Thyroid Support I couldn't muster the mental energy to write. After Thyroid Support, I write all the time and feel like I got my "mojo" back.
 I have Hashimoto's and my Endocrinologist tells me that my levels are normal, and until they're abnormal he can't do anything.  My antibodies are high in my blood, and I have so many symptoms of an underactive thyroid that it's obviously effecting me. I have been doing a lot of research into this condition and have completely changed my diet around, but still couldn't lose weight no matter what I've tried. I came across thyroid support seen all of the good reviews, and decided to try them. I've been taking them for 20 days and have dropped 9lbs already. I love them!!!!
 I'm giving 4 stars because it seems like it worked for me, but....it caused a flair up in my prostate. I developed a case of prostatitis and had to have a round of Cipro. Thinking it may be a fluke I tried another brand sold here with pretty much the same ingredients and WHAM another infection of the prostate. Not knowing which ingredient may be the culprit and learning that most cases of hypothyroidism are caused by a lack of Iodine. So, round 3, I purchased a bottle of liquid Iodine and started slow with only a drop or 2 in water and I could feel things starting to happen down there. So, if you are the age of BPH be very careful with it! On another note my wife is taking without issue and it is giving her lots more energy.
 Have been taking this supplement for about 3 weeks now. As suggested by the company, one capsule in the morning, one at night. They are easy to take and have not caused any stomach upset. While it's only been a short while, I have been feeling a bit more energetic. I have hypothyroidism (diagnosed by an MD) and am currently on Synthroid. This Thyroid Support Supplement seems to boost the positive effects of my regular medication, plus I like the fact that I no longer need to take an additional B-12 capsule every day. The B-12 is already added! I have happily noticed a small amount of weight loss as well. Good deal. I will continue taking this supplement as long as it continues to help.
 I'm so happy I tried these a few weeks ago. I have Hashimotos and most of the recommended vitamins are in this bottle. It's nice not having to take multiple pills. I haven't lost any weight, unfortunately. I have noticed I feel great which is most important. I haven't had any bad side effects and make sure I always have something to eat first.<br/><br/>Update 9/8/16: Just ordered another bottle. This is the best Thyroid supplement I've ever tried....and I've tried quite a few on the market. I have felt symptom-free (Hashimotos) since taking it regularly. The day I ran out, I ordered more but had to take a few supplements separately to substitute for these, I felt nauseous 10 minutes later. These have never made me feel nauseous. I take two in the morning since they kept me awake if I took one in the evening. I've never felt better!!! And the customer support is awesome!
 it made me very hangry, i've gained 10 lbs and had to stop using it. didn' t see a single positive feedback others have mentioned. trully dissapointed
 I definitely feel alive again!  I was looking for something to replace the thyroid medication my doctor had recently taken me off of stating "I was borderline" and it may hinder me in the long run to continue taking it for a borderline underactive thyroid problem.  I guess a doctor knows best, right? Or so they should at least.  But I just couldn't take the up an down hormonal rollercoaster I was on during the three months I was off my prescribed thyroid medication.  I was feeling extremely fatigued every day even with a good night's rest, high anxiety around my menstrual, complete brain fog and I feel that's because you feel so drained and tired to think straight and the list goes on.  I read many, many reviews on here and they really resonated with me in the fact that their doctor's, as well, were telling them that they didn't need the medication but still didn't feel normal and after taking this it was pretty much life changing for them.  I took the chance and here I am on my second bottle.  It is definitely what I needed and will continue to take it until that "crazy feeling" comes back again and I am hoping that it doesn't and this will do the trick for a long time to come.
 So I can't say whether it worked or not to help with my weight issues. But I can say the whole time I was on these I was a bucket of tears. I've never been so emotional in my life.<br/><br/>Will be trying again to see if it's just me or legit making me a sappy wreck.
 I have been taking this 2x everyday for 17 days now.  I know it takes time for these things to really make a noticeable difference in the way you feel, but I already have better energy throughout the day and less brain fog.  I’m excited to see if there will more benefits coming, but for now just the fact that I can get through my day without feeling like I need a nap is enough for me!!<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/>I have now been taking this for a little over a month now.  I’m on my second bottle now and I can’t say enough how much better I feel.  It has given me the endurance I need to stick to a regular workout and I have lost about 8 lbs since The beginning of January!!  My nerves are also less on edge and my moods swing less!  Lol  Needless to say, I still love it.
 I have been taking thyroid support for a few months now along with some other supplements and I feel great!  I have had an underactive thyroid for many years and now have energy and better mental clarity since taking this product!  I take 1 capsule twice daily.  All of us with thyroid issues know that our labs can look great but we still feel exhausted and mentally foggy...this supplement has definitely helped me.  I would recommend trying this product to anyone with an underactive thyroid who is looking to have more energy and feel more alert!
 I purchased this over a year ago and was pushed into the back of my medicine cabinet.  Cleaning out and began taking about a week ago and do seem to have more energy during the morning. I'll write again to follow up if this truly will help me with my sleeping. I've seen reviews to take in the morning and evening so perhaps will try that
 My thyroid levels have been on the low side for years. Early in Feb I had a blood panel done. My doctor said I may need to start taking a prescription to improve my thyroid. I went home that day and did some research online and found the 1 Body Thyroid Support. I ordered it on Valentine's day.  After a month of use,  I had another blood panel done. My levels are improving,  and I don't need to start taking the prescription medication now.  That's fantastic!
 This product is amazing. Going on birth control really messed up my weight, appetite, and mood, so I stopped, but I haven't been able to get back to normal. I suspected that it was low thyroid (I am on other medications that can lower thyroid function). I started taking this and almost right away, I started feeling less groggy and tired. For a while I was sleeping through half the day and barely able to function - now I feel much more focused and energetic. I'm hoping that regular use will improve things even more, and I finally feel more like myself.
 I have never written a review about supplements because it is such a personal decision to take them. One product is not going to have the same effect on everyone and professional healthcare supervision is so important in order to stay safe. My experience with this product has been very positive. I feel more energetic, my immune system seems stronger and it has been a little easier for me to lose weight with exercise and better food choices. Before, those things did not seem to matter. I do believe that it is very important not to exceed the recommended dosage with these particular ingredients, and that can be tempting when something works well. An overstimulated thyroid is not a happy thyroid any more than one that is under-performing. I am a happy customer and I plan to continue ordering this product.
 I wrote a review on this not too long ago. I wanted to change or rather update my review.  When I first started taking this product, I felt a difference right away which made me  think about the true condition of my thyroid.  I took the product for 30 days as directed in the instructions. I ran out  of the product, the day after I went on vacation and  wasn't sure if I wanted to order more because I had energy from excising. I let a week past and my previous symptoms of depression lethargy, foggy think, cold feet, constipation, etc. Everything came back and I felt horrible! I did not know it would  have such a drastic effect on my body that fast. I reordered and now I feel great again and will continue to order these nutrients.<br/>Just an FYI, I went to a nutritionist for 30 days in march and lost 19.5 lbs. after I came back from my vacation, with my  same diet regime, and saw her 30 days later without this support, my metabolic rate changed as well as dropped. I only gained a pound. Although it said it can aid with weight loss, I did not think the vitamins were assisting with my plan. It seems it was all along. Buy and use this product. your body will not regret it.
 I have been looking forward to using this since finding about my thyroid issues while pregnant. With my first child, I struggled with Postpartum depression, much of it caused by excessive weight gain and exhaustion. I knew I wanted to (try to) avoid this with my second child, which is how I came across Thyroid Support. In the first two weeks of using it, I already can notice a difference in my mood and energy. I feel more "normal," even while taking care of a newborn. I look forward to finishing my current bottle of Thyroid Support, and will continue to observe my results.
 More energy....sleep better...good product!  **UPDATE**  After finishing up a month on this product I wanted to update.  At first I was sleeping better and thought it might be from this product.  In hindsight I don't believe that was the reason.  Also...after now taking for a month I have GAINED 6 pounds.  Turns out this has ingredients in it that are not compatible with Thyroid Medication (levothyroxine) and actually conflict with it.  I received a complimentary 2nd bottle that is headed for the toilet.  This might be OK for people NOT on thyroid meds...but definitely not a good idea if you currently take meds.  Also causes an upset stomach about 30 minutes after taking.  Not worth the negative side effects.  Also not worth doing damage to what a Doctor has prescribed.
 I tried this product after my brother and sister in law suggested a thyroid supplement. They have both seen good results from prescription thyroid meds and said I may see an improvement by trying something. There was an offer from a compounding pharmacy in a nearby city and I found this product on Amazon that is almost a perfect match so I am giving it a try. I'm hoping it will help me with my feeling tired all the time with no energy and other things like skin problems and the like. I have only been using it for about a week but feel better already so time will tell. I felt that it couldn't hurt. My doctor told me that my blood test thyroid levels were normal but since have heard people say they were told the same thing but felt better after starting a thyroid supplement. I'll see how 1 Body Thyroid Supplement does over time, so far I like it. I'd like to add that I've been using this product for about a couple of months now and it seems to be helping with some of my issues with wanting to sleep all of the time. I'm on some medications for pain that probably contribute to that  but I have noticed a difference in being able to wake up and function better than without it. I will continue to use Thyroid Support from 1Body to see if there is more improvement.
 This is probably the best natural supplement for hypothyroidism! it has all the ingredients to support Hashimoto's and any other form of hypothyroidism. However, like it was for me- in most case, you need to combine it with a Thyroid medication (consult with your doctor) like NatureThroid (all natural porcine extract). If you do have Hashimoto's, avoid taking Synthroid (the most common Thyroid medication in the US) since it contains Gluten.<br/><br/>Overall great product! btw, if you get it directly from 1-body and sign up for a subscription, you get 25% off guaranteed for lifetime! Might as well do that, since hypothyroidism generally lasts a lifetime and doesn't just go away.
 I ordered this because the one I have been using for the last five years doesn't seem to doing what it's suppose to be doing. I chose this product because there is the usual Thyroid function ingredients but also some ones I have not tried before. I have been using this product for about a week and already it seems there is a difference in my energy level for sure.  Most days I would get up and not feel like doing anything, since taking this I get up and want to do everything.  My mental clarity seems on point  as well.  So far so good !  I hope it continues.
 You have to take them consistently and for a period of time but it is completely worth it. I'm on a thyroid prescription and still struggle with weight gain, depression and brain fog but the Thyroid Support supplement is helping immensely. I've tried various supplements and diets but this has been the easiest success to a normal life. Very happy with this product and highly recommend.
 I bought this product based on the reviews and figured it could work for me also. I bought this at the end of March. I took it as directed and OMG.. What a difference!!! I was no longer falling asleep at 3pm, I was focused, I had energy, I felt like myself again :D So just to see if this was a mental difference from trying something new, I stopped taking it for May. And now I regret it. I went back to the symptoms I had prior to take this. I am on here now ordering my second bottle and I can't wait for ME to return so I can enjoy my summer. Thank you for making such a great product.
 THis is exactly like the thyroid support medicine I used to take and I find it much more effective than levothyroxine in addressing my thyroid issues.  I am solely on natural supplements now, so taking this product has been very helpful to me.
 I know my thyroid function is low but not enough for my doctor to treat me. So, finding an alternative natural supplement was a better solution than what the doctor would have prescribed. I noticed a cognitive improvement with my very first dose and no side effects. I've experimented with nootropics... the results were great but never worth the 'hangover' side effects. With this Thyroid Support supplement, I may get a slight headache only on occasion. A little caffeine usually remedies that. :o)
 Purchased for my 18 year old daughter.<br/>We try natural solutions first.<br/>We are trying to stay off Dr meds.<br/>Her hormone imbalance began around 13.<br/>According to our book Prescription for Nutritional Healing she has specific thyroid signs.<br/>She said these are the best supplements she has taken specifically for thyroid prob so far. She takes additional VitE and collagen as well but she notices a marked difference if she misses a dose of this supplement.
 This unfortunately did not work for me. I was hoping it would be enough for my thyroid, to prevent having to rely on pharmaceuticals. It seems like a quality product, it just didn't help energy levels as I was hoping.
 I probably don't write enough reviews for really good products, but this one is so good I just had to provide my feedback. I was feeling just plain awful, weak, fatigued, etc.  My doctor ran a blood test and found my thyroid levels were a bit low and put me on Levothyroxine. Things didn't improve, so in desperation I searched and researched and finally found this Thyroid Support supplement. It took about five days before I realized that I was me again!  I had energy and was in a good mood for the first time in several months.  I went on a short trip and forgot to bring this along. Fortunately, I could tell the difference it was making when I was without it. It started working again for me in just a day.
 I had high hopes for this supplement but it just did not sit well with my system.  I took these as directed and ended up having a racing heart, sleeplessness, diarrhea and a lasting metallic taste in my mouth.  I stopped for a time and tried again only to have the same symptoms return.  Down the toilet they go.  I was disappointed they didn't work but hope they do for others.  I am going to try one similar but without iodine.  Fingers crossed!
 My thyroid levels were beginning to rise to levels where my doctor wanted me to go on medications.  I had tried one medication that didn't work for me, and I try to avoid perscribed medications if I can, so I asked her about supplements.  She suggested this supplement and gave me 3 months to try it on the condition that if my hormone levels weren't back to normal, we'd use medication.  After three months, my doctor was surprised with how well this supplement controlled my thyroid levels! She thought I had to have made other lifestyle changes too. I don't have to use a perscribed medication, and I couldn't be happier with this supplement!
 Definitely curbs appetite and improves or provides boost in energy. Also, noticed that I sleep through the night; I don't wake up in the middle of the night and struggle to go back to bed.
 I recommend taking this supplement WITH food.  Otherwise you have the taste of cayenne pepper in the back of your mouth all day.<br/>In the first 12 hours the pain in my heels vanished.<br/>When I woke up I was convinced someone had turned up the heat---but no the thermostat was still in it's original spot. My body was just warm.<br/>Within 24 hours constipation gone.<br/>After the first week my energy levels were normal---without jitters, or caffeine.  On the suggestion of another reviewer I decided to take the pills first thing in the morning (about 4 am) and then again at lunch.  It keeps the energy flow steady until I'm ready for bed.  No trouble sleeping.<br/>My heels are no longer rough and cracked.  The skin is smooth.<br/>So far, no weight loss---but given the relief in other area's I plan to continue using the product.
 I have been suffering from extreme fatigue and this product help me so much, that I started feeling like I am 25 again.  I lost  weight with ease and was  feeling energetic. I mistakenly bought a different brand thinking all was the same. but to my dismay it wasn't so. I could not wait to finish the substitute brand even though I have an opened bottle and I am only halfway through the one bottle. I reordered this  and immediately took one of the tablets as soon as the package arrives.
 Im 23 and was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Looking for alternative ways to treat it (instead of hormone treatment with t4 from a pig) I came across these supplements. With all the great reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. I've been using these for about a month now and my gosh I feel amazing. The fog that's been lingering over my head has finally cleared, I don't want to take naps all the time anymore because I actually have sustainable energy, my bowel movements are regular, everything has improved. I highly recommend these. I felt a difference within 2 days of using the supplement. I'm now subscribed on the monthly.
 I feel like there is a difference with taking this supplement. I do have to take thyroid medicine, but my doctor suggested a thyroid supplement to help it. It hasn't done anything so far as for cravings, but my energy is more stable. I've only been taking it for a couple of weeks, but intend to take it on a regular basis. I have the energy to exercise now, and that will make an overall difference as well. Highly recommend taking it.
 I bought this because I'm in my 50's, and I'm suffering from these symptoms: cannot focus (this is the symptom that bothers me the most), aches and pains (especially in my fingers and hands), cold nearly all the time (my temperature is never above 97.5 and is often 96, and the thermometer is accurate (agrees with doctor's office and my husband's temp is always 98.5), and I've been putting on weight slowly.<br/><br/>My TSH measures the same as it always has, but something is definitely wrong. I AM NOT MYSELF ANY LONGER. I WANT ME BACK. I'm trying this product to see if it will help old me make a reappearance.
 Nothing ever helped me as much as Thyroid Support.  Finally after 30+ years of doctor ordered meds I am finally real help.
 I ordered these supplements to help with my Hashi's. I am not experiencing the burst of energy like the other comments but I think they are helping.Took for 3 weeks and didnt really notice a difference so stopped to see what happened (experiment). After a week I knew something was off I felt like I was having a flare up that wouldnt stop. I remembered my experiment, so started taking the supplements again and feel a lot better. I have only been taking 1 tablet a day but when my 2nd bottle arrives I will take 2 as directed. I say give it a try.
 I was really excited to try this product. It contains so many things I've seen suggested, and the reviews at a glance all looked so positive! I took this product as directed for about 3 weeks. I noticed that I had this insatiable hunger pang sensation, but I attributed it to the fact that I had also been trying to change the way I'm eating and that maybe I just hadn't nailed down how much to eat to keep myself full.<br/><br/>The "hunger pangs" kept ramping up but somehow I ignored them until this last week they got progressively more intense. One morning it hit me - I had *just* eaten a full, actual meal, not just snacks, and my stomach felt as if I had starved myself for 2 days. I was feeling nauseated, and had to go home from work to lay down. After discussing with a few folks, it was suggested that maybe it was heartburn? I had no idea heartburn could feel similar to hunger pangs. I downed some tums, and skipped my second dose of the day and by the next morning the "hunger pangs" had subsided. I really wanted this product to work for me but the pain I was in was difficult to describe. Feeling that way while eating a meal is one of the most uncomfortable feelings!<br/><br/>After reading some more reviews, and searching for key words, I found that others experienced this as well, particularly those of us with Hashimotos. I would advise strongly against this if you are a Hashimotos sufferer, as it seems the iodine in this supplement doesn't jive well with us :(
 I took it for a month. Definitely made my depression worse. I would burst into tears at random times. After I stopped it for a few days, my mood got better. I had high hopes but in the end, I had to return it.
 In 2wks my horrible symptoms were 80% gone: Severe fatigue (falling asleep at desk even), hair falling out, acne, uncontrollable weight gain regardless of food intake, loss of motivation, etc.
 I have been experiencing all of the signs for hypothyroidism but my labs always come back normal so my doctor has not done further testing. I am confident that this is what all my symptoms are from so I took measures into my own hands and came across this supplement. After just a few days I noticed I had more energy, was not tired and I have lost about 6 pounds in 2 weeks. For supposedly having normal thyroid functions this supplement is working miracles for me. I am so thankful that I found this product and will continue to take it
 I have been struggling with my thyroid levels for years. I started getting bio-identical hormone pellets just to get more energy. It has helped but it's still a struggle. All the supplements that my doctor suggested that I take are all in 1 Body Thyroid Support. Therefore I can take 1 supplement instead of taking several. So far after only 3 weeks of taking your product I have more energy, less hair loss and it helps me sleep. I can't wait to see what my next blood levels are. This is a wonderful product.
 this product works!I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and went on medications for years without finding any relief.I started with the thyroid support with kelp from another brand and felt my heart racing.I got scared and stop both supplements.After moult  research, i found out the brand of kelp was doing that reaction to my heart and began with the thyroid support alone again to find myself feeling great, energized, with no brain fog, sleeping good, alert and happy....I found myself again
 I usually take the iodine drops but for some reason it stopped working. I was loosing my hair and have no energy. The first day I took this is I got a bad headache, but I continued the next day taking it and never got a headache again. By hair is not dropping out as much and feeling a bit more energetic. I hope this continues to work.
 This is my 3rd month on this product.  I wanted to try for a minimum of 60 days before posting a review.  So here goes.  This Thyroid support supplement has made a huge and positive change in my daily energy, balance and overall well being.  I have had no adverse or side effects to my health.  In fact this product has made such a difference in my mind and body health I will plan on keeping this supplement with me as long as I have this Hyperthyroid condition.  Which I have been told, excluding surgery, I will have for a very long time.<br/><br/>As well as experiencing a product that works I am also very please with the excellent customer service I receive.
 I just was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease about 8 weeks ago. I started using medication (Levothyroxine) to lower my TSH levels, but I still felt pretty tired all day. I finally came across this product, read all the reviews, and decided to try it myself. So far I have been using this product twice a day (once in the morning an hour after taking my Levothyroxine and once in the evening). After about a week, I started to feel like I had much more energy. I'm definitely going to continue using this product in hopes of improving my Hashimoto's.
 I bought this in hopes it would work and help with my thyroid problems.  I felt like it was not doing anything but I didn't want to waste my money so I continued taking the rest of the bottle.  A few days later not only did I feel the difference my husband commented on my behavior and asked me what was wrong and what was going on?  The only difference was I had not be taking my "Thyroid Support"  I went straight to the computer and order my second bottle. I will always have a back up bottle.
 Took away the black hairs that grew out of my chin. I am a woman.
 I suffer from Hypothyroidism so I was looking for a natural product to help me with the issues that come with this disease. (weight gain, fatigue, moodiness) I have only been taking this product for less than a month and I am interested to see what taking it longer will do.  I do feel as if I have more energy and less bloating. Once I have taken this longer,  I can determine if this a product I will continue to buy and take. I will say the customer service for this company is outstanding  and that goes a very long way with me!
 This stuff is junk and it does not work. Accidentally odered it on a subscription basis and can't ever serm to get it canceled by Amazon.  Beware the subscription route.
 I've been taking for about 4 week today I weighed myself for the first time... I am down 15 lbs!!  That's amazing considering I have such a hard time losing weight. With my age, some health and hormanal issues I had almost given up hope.  On top of the weight loss, I have been more energy, and less of an appetite, and the fog is lifting. Overall, I am beyond pleased and will continue using this product!!
 After taking this product for nearly a month, the biggest changes I have noticed so far are a dramatic improvement in my mood, body temperatures seem closer to normal, slight improvement in my appetite and I'm sleeping better. I definitely wouldn't go as far as to say I'm cured or back to my normal self I was years ago, as I suspect I will need to get something stronger prescribed from a doctor, but I can say that this was definitely worth the time and investment.<br/><br/>The bottom line: I would much rather be on this supplement than off of it and I would recommend it to someone. Seeing what it has done for me thus far I would honestly be worried about not taking it anymore. I will continue to take this product until I am able to go in and see a doctor in hopes that I will get prescribed something stronger for my situation.
 I have an underactive thyroid and it is very difficult to lose weight.  After about three weeks of taking this product, I have lost  a few pounds.  Several reviewers said to stay with it because you will not see immediate results.  I have found this to be true for me.
 I bought this in a hopes to help my sluggish thyroid.  I have multiple issues and was being treated for many hormone deletions, and also my thyroid was showing multiple nodules and it was swollen, and verified Hashimotos.  So between the three issues, my hormone balance has been off, and having so many symptoms that I've been miserable.  My lab numbers have been borderline, so no medication has been given, and it's been a frustrating year and a half.  I have now taken to alternative and natural approaches.<br/>I bought this and looked at the ingredients and thought let's try and support the thyroid.  I never expect an overnight miracle, so I brought it to my nutrition guy, and had him muscle test to see if it was even helpful for me or if it would be neutral and not help much.  It showed as helpful and will benefit my thyroid, and the muscle test on my HRT came back negative , so I'm taking the leap and stopping those for a month at least and see how I do.<br/>I am optimistic that I am taking the right approach to this, and do believe this will be helpful for my thyroid. I would update this to 5 stars, after I've been on it longer , I am on week 3.
 I decided to try this a month ago because I had been trying to lose weight and even with a healthy diet and joining a gym I was losing and gaining the same 1 pound over and over.  I also have just about every symptom of hypothyroidism except that my doctor said my blood test was fine. So I did some research and read the reviews and decided to give this product a try. So, after 1 month of taking these, I have lost 5 pounds! That being said, I haven't noticed any improvement with my other symptoms such as fatigue but I'm definitely happy with the weight loss. What I really like about the product though is that the company really seems to stand behind their product. With my first bottle I received a coupon for a free 2nd bottle. They also send occasional emails to see how things are going. I didn't feel harassed at all like some posters said. I will continue with this product for at least another month or so.
 I had blood work ran which led me to purchase this suppliment. After I used the whole container as instructed, my new blood work showed no difference and I felt no better. :(
 I've been taking this supplement for about 3 weeks. I had a new baby about 15 months earlier and even with him sleeping all night, still felt great fatigue during the day, within a few hours of waking up actually. I also felt like I was still loosing hair from hormone changes due to my pregnancy and have been unable to drop the last 10lbs of baby weight. My appetite was spotty. Even with eating healthy and exercise I felt my metabolism was out of whack. Within days  of taking this support supplement, I noticed I was no longer fatigued mid-morning. I'm able to have enough energy to accomplish my busy days! I feel as though I sleep better as well. I've noticed the scale dipping some and hope that with my increased energy and metabolism these last few pounds will soon be gone!
 I have severe hypothyroidism and a thyroid nodule. This causes severe fatigue and irritabily along with many other symptoms.  This supplement has eliminated the pressure feeling in my throat from the nodule and decreased my iritability. I havent noticed a change in other symptoms yet but its only been about a month and the thyroid isnt a quick fix so I will keep taking it to see the affects in a 3 or 6 month span.
 I feel better overall. I have more energy and sleep better. I also feel less hungry. I'm not sure if that's because of these supplements, but I'll take it! I have to take my second capsule at lunch, not in the evening. I stay awake if I take it too late.
 I’ve been taking 1Body Thyroid Support formula since November 2018 and it has helped me feel much better with symptoms of hypothyroidism. I have more consistent energy throughout the day, much less brain fog, better sleep, more motivation to get stuff done (by way of having more energy). Weightloss however has not been improved at all, but I’m sure diet/lifestyle improvements will be helpfu. Overall I really love this particular brand and hope they never change it!
 So I have felt for years and years that my thyroid was not functioning appropriately.  It started 33 years ago after the birth of my twins.  I have had the labs done and I have been told that the labs were borderline.  I have tried this over the last week, and I can't believe it.  I feel better.  My metabolism seems to be moving faster.  My energy and mood seem better.  I am using this along with a supplementation of hormonal cream.  The capsules are easier to swallow, no real taste, even when I drank warm water by accident.  I also feel a better sense of well being.  I handle stress better, I sleep soundly at night with no more 2a worries, and an inability to go back to sleep.  Now, no wake ups, no middle of the night stressors with my brain running a million miles a minute.  I recommend this for anyone who just feels they need a boost to their energy level and a metabolism boost.<br/><br/>disclaimer:  I have received this product at a discount/free of charge for an unbiased opinion.  I have provided an unbiased opinion.  I am a weekly, sometimes daily amazon shopper and appreciate when I can read a review to give me some insight to a product before purchasing.  I remain unbiased, because I would not wish to be lead down a path of wasting my moeny or time.
 Since I started taking Thyroid Support I have noticed a significant change in my energy level and I wake up feeling rested instead of tired. I will definitely be sticking to this brand as I have tried a few before but 1 Body has delivered as promised.
 As a first year medical student I've found myself becoming increasingly exhausted as the semesters progress. This product has worked wonders for my energy levels and keeps me going without drowning myself in liters of caffeine. I've also had colleagues notice my waistline shrink! My family has a history of thyroid issues and I'm convinced this product keeps me where my body should be functioning instead of where it likes to live--with low energy and poor macronutrient processing. 5 stars!
 This stuff is amazing. I've been taking it for the past month and it's helped me a lot. I was training hard 6 days a week and eating well for the past 8 months and the weight was not budging. I didn't get it. I was also always tired with no energy. I was also cold all the time. I also had mood swings. All the symptoms of hypothyroidism. I started taking this and after a week I was full of energy and feeling better mentally and I wasn't cold any more. The best part was that my hard work finally started paying off and I lost an inch around my stomach. I will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it for anyone who has hypothyroidism!!
 Excellent product!
 I'm a 52 year old female that noticed decline in my energy in the last 3-4 years. My blood work tested normal but I felt "off" and somewhat tired (like my energy was so depleted that neither rest or vitamins would fill it up to "full/normal"). I tried L-Tyrosine 500mg daily and felt better, so I have been taking it for over 2 years. Though I felt better, I was feeling low energy more often than high. I decided to try Thyroid Support by 1-Body because it contains vitamin and minerals besides L-tyrosine. After one week I noticed increased energy and metabolism. I feel like myself again. As I'm writing this report, I have been on it for a month. I'm glad I found it and am now going to try other products from 1-Body (such as the one for hair and nails)
 This was so complete a formula that it really helped me wean down from the rx dose I was taking. You really want your tsh to range from 1 - 2 for optimum health. Too much, too little, tsh has shown a correlation with Alzheimer's. Check the studies. Don't assume your GP has.
 Hard on stomach. They claim a 100 % money back guarantee in 60 days. Well now is the time to test it. Please refund my money. I will try the free sample they will be sending me.. if it works out..! I will revise my account and present details as they unveil.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for months now along with Lugol's Iodine. I definitely notice a difference if I miss these supplements (which is very infrequent). My energy level is far higher and I feel more balanced with this added to my supplement regime. I feel this is a fine product. Thank you for the free bottle!
 In the past many months, I have felt cold all the time. I woke up every morning sneezing and have running nose for at least an hour. My husband said something might be wrong with my Thyroid. I don’t like going to the doctors, so I done some research online and found this product on Amazon. I gave it a try, within 2 days of taken this, my sneezing and running nose have stopped. I am very happy with this purchase so far and will continue taking this product.
 I have a thyroid problem and I am currently on medication for that.  My hair continued to fall out even though my levels were in a normal range.  After taking this product to about 2 weeks I see a huge difference.  My hair is not falling out as it was and I am happy to say that so far I love this product.
 I have only just started this, but gave it 5 stars as I am excited to take control of my body.  The Doctor recently diagnosed me with the beginning stage of hypothyroidism and after one more blood test will put me on Synthroid which he says will make me feel much better.  After arriving home I watched a You Tube video on Thyroid issues, by a Doctor, and he was not selling anything just gave the facts.  I decided that I wanted to take control of this and start with helping my body to help itself.  Looked for a supplement that contained what my Thyroid needs to work better so that I can feel better.
 I've only been taking the product for a week and a half but the difference is remarkable.  I have so much energy, I'm not angry/irritable/tired/cranky  all the time, I don't fall asleep everytime I sit down on the couch... I've been fighting hypothyroid with medication and herbs for the last 5 years and no combination of stuff I have taken to date as made this big of a difference to me
 Wow this worked right away. I took one this evening and immediately felt a boost in energy and concentration. I'm currently juice fasting as well so that's probably why it worked so quickly with no solid foods in the system. I hope it continues to get better!
 I have only been on the product for about 10days. Not sure I have noticed anything different quite yet. I purchased this product because I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis which is very hard to control with  Thyroid replacement medications like synthroid, armour etc. because of it's autoimmune nature. My hope is that the blend in this product will help my thyroid work for effectively on its own. So far at least nothing negative to report.
 I am still on my first bottle but I have noticed I am getting slimmer since taking the product and I have a decreased appetite. I have not had time to workout yet, but I believe that once I do I will see great results. I have put on about 4 lbs over the past few years. I recently turned 40 and it is extremely difficult to get the weight off with just moderate exercise and cutting calories.The doctors cannot find any reasons for this stubbornness, tests show no issues with thyroid or glucose levels but something is wrong.. I have a demanding schedule and cannot work out for hours every day. So I decided to try this supplement.. So far so good!
 I have noticed I *feel* better overall than on my Nature Throid alone.  My mood is better, my energy is a little more consistent throughout the day, overall I just feel better even with my dr reducing my dose from 194 to 162 (my labs were too close to my last dose, I am concerned...retest soon!).  I still have a long way to go, progress with thyroid disease is slow and hard-fought.  Endo appointment next month to address deeper-than-in-house-labs can handle, but this product has definitely given me an extra "spoon" in my drawer so I can function better at my job and taking care of my full family.  =)  Thank you!  Going to add Adrenal Support after Endo appointment probably!
 My appetite has finally normalized. Over the past year my appetite has changed and I feel hungry all the time and I even craved things I have never eaten in my life (sweets). Once I started taking this, that went away and I could not be more happy.
 This is by far the best supplement I’ve ever taken!  My sluggish thyroid is now energized and I haven’t felt this good in forever!  No more brain fog, I feel awake and full of energy even with 3 kids. I’m losing weight and don’t feel hungry all the time. My scalp his quit itching and my nails are growing stronger without splitting. The best part is I don’t feel exhausted any more!  I have recommended this supplement to friends and coworkers. I love it!
 I recently found out that my t3 level was slightly low, but not low enough that my doctor wanted to put me on thyroid meds that would cause my heart to race, etc.  Then I started having this weird itching on my neck, chest, and arms. No rash of anything. This went on for a few weeks and I looked online to try to figure out what was causing it. I came across an article that said low thyroid levels could cause it. I researched and found this product and ordered it. No kidding, 2 days after I started taking it, the itching stopped and that was about a month ago. I just received my second bottle. Honestly I feel great.  There is no way I'm going to stop taking this. I'm a firm believer in this product. Can't wait to tell my Doc. Its amazing.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto and had severe depression, muscle weakness,  cold intolerance, yawning every 15 seconds, lack of energy and many more symptoms. I bought this product hoping I will have the same positive experience like the other people shared. Unfortunately I didn’t feel any improvement during the time I used the supplement. The only change I saw was suppressing my appetite which is why I’m giving it 3 stars. I will give it a try again when I’m in remission. It might be more beneficial then than now!
 I have a lot more energy since taking this product. I highly recommend it for hypothroidism and I will continue using it. The longer I take it, the more pronounced the effects are.
 Oh my gosh! So I'm 6 weeks post partum and I was having trouble with my energy. I just felt sluggish a lot and not really like myself. I ordered this not really expecting much. I'm on day 6 and the energy has finally hit me. I got dressed today. I exercised. Cleaned the house. I FEEL AWESOME 😍. I was totally a skeptic but I loooooove this and how it makes me feel!
 Almost all people need a kick-start on their thyroid periodically.  I was starting to feel sluggish, and unable to lose any weight.  Whenever I feel like I need a boost, I go back to a good thyroid supplement for a period of time.  I always stop using it if I start to have so much energy that I cannot fall asleep.  I just ordered the product about 10 days ago.  I, already, have much more energy.  I will keep it going for as long as I live.  You may want to consider the product, as it does provide energy.  It also helps curb your appetite.  I think it is superior to most products out there, as it also includes some herbs that most do not contain.  I am getting good results with energy, weight loss, and suppression of hunger.  I have only taken the product for one week, and I can feel and see a difference.  Take care, Catherine
 A couple days after taking, I felt better. Hard to describe just better.  I've actually lost some pounds. I've dieted and excerised before but would hardly lose weight. Now in addition to the same excerise and diet plan but adding these in I've lost close to 10pounds.
 I received my product fast and the order was correct. I have read most of the reviews detailing the smell and the positive effects of this product. Going from there the product definitely has a strong smell to it, but if it works who cares about a smell. The strong smell is selenium. Though deadly is large quantities it is vital to every system in the human body. As I have not been on this product for a full month yet I feel that the full effect of the product has not been reach. However with that being said, I have noticed some change in the way I feel and am going to continue the course. I’m excited feeling a boost!
 I have been taking thyroid RX for about 6 months and don't feel the effects as much as I think I should. I started reading and realized that some key support items may be missing from my diet. For example we purchase salt with iodine at home, but since retirement we eat out about 80% of the time (I know that's too much). I also never add salt to my food once it is cooked. I don't think restaurants or fast food places use the iodine salt in their food products. So I decided to make sure I was getting the right supplements to make the RX work. So I purchased this item about a week ago and while it may be a placebo effect, I do feel like I have a little more energy already.
 It could be the placebo effect, but, I think this stuff actually works.  I feel the difference in mood when I take it.
 When I first started taking this product, I noticed that I had more energy. I have hypothyroid for 23 years (I'm 40) and have been on a roller coaster of ever changing medications and dosages over the years. I have lost 2 pounds in 3 weeks (not as much as others reported) but the added energy that it has given me is worth continuing to take this product. 
 I have hypothyroidism and have been taking Armour thyroid for several years.  Each time I get my blood tested the dr. adjusts my dosage and I always lose my energy level until they bring the dosage back up.  I began taking this in addition to my Armour Thyroid, my energy level is back up.  I am anxious to see what my next blood test shows. I would be totally happy if we continue to reduce my Armour Thyroid and could eventually be on this supplement totally.  Will keep you posted.
 Purchased for my daughter after having abnormal thyroid levels, she was very tired and experienced weight gain. Since taking she has more energy and is losing weight, can't wait to see if her lab results will be back to normal next month
 Ive been taking this 1-2 times daily for less than a month.<br/><br/>The reason I started taking it is that i started noticing weight gain and puffy eyes as well as colder hands.<br/><br/>Even though my TSH levels were normal I feel there is something 'off'<br/><br/>Since I started taking this my puffy eyes have beena  bit better and I dont feel like im continuing to gain weight but nothing super noticeable.  Perhaps if i took it properly I would see more.<br/><br/>After taking it for a while i went to the dr and got t3 levels checked and he said they were right in the middle of "normal" and he prefers to have them in the upper 1/3 of normal.  He is recommending naturaroid rx to try for a bit.
 I've been taking this supplement for a few months now and definitely notice a change in my energy levels and overall health. Also, I suffer from PCOS which makes my period very irregular. After not having one for months, about a month after beginning taking this supplement, my period returned. I'm hoping it will help with my weight loss efforts as well. Great product!
 I just started taking my second bottle of this product but so far it's done great. I haven't noticed huge changes but some small ones.  I figure it takes more than 1 month for any product to work effectively so I'm going to take this product for 3 months before making final judgment on it but so far so good.  I do have one suggestion, don't take the second dose after 6 pm or you might find yourself wide awake at bedtime.  The company is EXCELLENT, their customer service is perfect!!
 I'm so glad I found this supplement. I've always been borderline hypothyroid according to my blood tests. And while I've symptomatically displayed the signs of hypothyroidism for a decade, I've never been medicated through my provider due to that "border line" status, Thus, I've struggled with lethargy, hair loss, random bouts of weight gain, etc...<br/><br/>This supplement has made such a difference in the last couple weeks I've taken it. I've felt more energetic in the mornings, clear headed, and it would seem that I've lost a couple pounds without any significant change in activity.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this product.
 I don't like phony offers!  When I received the product they offered a free bottle but what a hassle...they didn't follow through with their offer.  I won't buy this product again.  I could have gotten it cheaper.  To make matters worse I just ordered a bottle for my daughter...my bad.
 I purchased the Thyroid Support awhile ago and then realized I would need to wait until I was through nursing my baby before starting. As of now, I've been on it for 5 weeks. I occasionally missed taking it twice a day. I have noticed that instead of wanting a nap every single day, sometimes even by late morning, I am only occasionally that tired during the day. I have a lot of weight I need to lose and look forward to seeing more benefits from this product as I continue my journey to better health!
 I can tell when I haven't taken this product on a given day. I am really liking it.<br/>I haven't had my thryoid tested since being on it, but I will continue for another month and then get it tested to see if it is helping. I feel the energy difference when I am not taking it, so I believe it helps.
 I've long suspected I had a thyroid issue, but was always just this side of normal range when tested.  It's been about 3 weeks since I started taking this product, and I like it.  I've noticed a couple of things pretty quickly.  I don't have to fight to stay awake every day at 3:00pm like I did before.  I have energy to do things on the weekends again and feel more awake and alert at work.  I am not out of breath anymore just walking up a flight of stairs.  I think I've dropped a few pounds because my clothes are loose.  I'm going to take it for another month to be sure it isn't all my head, but I think it's helping.  I certainly feel better since I started taking it.
 Amazing product! So much energy! My hair and skin looks incredible. I am finally losing weight! Love this product.
 I'm on my second week of using this product, taking 2 capsules a day.  I notice my energy level has gone up a bit.  I'm waiting to see if these vitamin supplement is helping my nails, my skin and my hair.  I know it will take a while.  I'm going to continue taking them for 2 months to see the results.  Thyroid Support has not upset my stomach so far.  Thyroid disease runs in my family.  My test have been within normal range.  I saw that Synthroid does not help my sister at all.  She's been on it for several years.  I also use magnesium salt and magnesium topical lotion.  They work so well for migraine headaches and achy muscles.  I will send another message after 2 months to tell you the results.
 I have noticed more energy and I have also dropped some weight.  I feel like I have been awakened and the energy I used to have has returned which is the best part about this product!  I take the Adrenal at lunch and Thyroid support at night.  I will say I do get a little nauseous occasionally since taking the supplements but nothing a little ginger candy can't help.
 I have a mild low (hypo) thyroid condition.  stopped taking my prescription synthroid thyroid supplement about 6 months before I decided to try this supplement.  When I went in to get my blood work taken after using the 1 body brand thyroid support, the doctor said my thyroid levels are within the normal range and I don't need to be on the prescription.  I'm very happy with the results of this 1 body thyroid support and plan to take it regularly.  I prefer to support the thyroid with what it needs instead of taking a thyroid medicine like synthroid.
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support when I wasn't on my medication. Since I was working overtime for a few months and didn't refill my prescription, I used the Thyroid Support instead. I was working long days and since I always felt fatigue, I noticed a difference with my energy. I'm back on my prescription, but I also still take the Thyroid Support. Key tips for me were to take it at the same time everyday.
 UPDATE Jan 2016<br/>I have had my lab work drawn 3 times and they all state that my thyroid is doing well. No night sweats and I have definitely seen and increase in energy. I have since ordered another bottle. I have not see any loss in weight:( . I have noticed a slight decrease in hair loss and a relief in shoulder/joint aches. I am very pleased to say that I will continue take this supplement... No one asked me to go back and update this review.<br/>*********************************************************************************************************************************************************<br/>I started taking this product on 12/25/15 and it's rather early to determine all of the results. However, I feel like I have more mental clarity and not so off balanced. If you do not have thyroid issues it would be hard to understand. I recently did lab work and they said that all of my T levels are fine. I told them that I have gained 3lbs, my hair is thinning, and I just don't feel myself. I was told that I've been off methimazole for 6 weeks and that my body is just adjusting. I don't have time for adjustments, I just want to feel like myself again! So I started taking this product based on all of the reviews. I work out 4-5 times a week, drink 90 oz of water daily, and have regular hair appointments. So I'm hoping that my weight and hair will get back to normal. However, I do not have any complaints and I actually feel better. I will update this review in a month to provide updated information on my weight and hair. I wish everyone who understands what I have written "good health" and trust me, please know that you are not alone. Thyroid issues are awful!
 I have been taking this for three weeks and feel that I am already seeing some improvement (reduction in dry skin &amp; psoriasis, brittle nails, fatigue) and will try to remember to provide an update after I am on it for a longer time. I am quite pleased with the customer service provided by this company.
 As a vegetarian I eat a lot of soy and found that my thyroid was being effected.  I started taking thyroid support, stopped eating soy and found that I felt more like my old self again.  The only concern I had was that if I took this too late in the day I felt like I had trouble falling asleep that night.  So I take one in the morning and one at lunch time and feel really, really good.  I recommend this Thyroid Support Supplement.  RMBC76
 Well, even though I have been taking this supplement (Thyroid Support) for about twelve days, and a bit too early to say it has been totally effective, even within this short period of time it seems like things are so far on the positive. I am slowly but surely gaining some sort of energy that I have been lucking for so long. At least, to start with, I can assure you that I have started to get the motivation to accomplish few things like house chores that I have been procrastinating to either start and/or finish within the last few days and I attribute the contributing factor to this one supplement and I personally regard this as a huge plus if anything else and I already am delighted about this particular result without any side effects at all so far. It also seems to have curbed my appetite to some extent. generally speaking things are on the positive and I am anticipating even better results in time. I will be back to write more thorough reviews in the future to let you know of my final decision regarding this product.
 First of all I don't usually give reviews!<br/>But I felt I needed to take the time on this one...<br/>First of all this company is the REAL DEAL . Their customer service is second to none.<br/>If you have a question...any question..they get back with you right away and treat you<br/>Like friends and family..seriously...I was amazed.<br/>As for theThyroidSupport I have been on it for about a week and feel great.<br/>I had no bad symptoms at all. I think the scale is even telling me I lost a couple pounds..which is a nice extra.<br/>If you are going to buy any supplement such as Thyroid Support buy from this company 1 Body
 I've had this over a month now. It definitely keeps me awake and I have energy but it's not a crazy boost of energy. As far as helping me lose weight I've lost 5lbs so far. I imagine with even better diet and more exercise it would be more. My sugar and junk food cravings dropped tremendously. Now, the reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because, 1) my crippling migraines have gone from coming on every day/every other day to only twice in the month I've had this. And that is a huge huge huge thing for me. 2) I have noticed my appetite not be as crazy, I fill up faster and my energy lasts. I take one at 5 am everyday and then I lay back down until it wakes me up. Usually about 530 or so I'm wide awake for work. At around noon I take the second pill and it boosts me back up. It does not give me shakes nor does it make me sick when taken on an empty stomach. I feel like I'm more focused at work and I even sleep better at night. I'll definitely get this product again. :)
 I purchased this with hopes that it would help with the fact that my hair was falling out like mad...it has helped better than I dreamed! I will continue to use this and highly recommend it.
 This thyroid support has more ingredients to help my sluggish thyroid. I am able to stop taking separate herbs and minerals which are already in Thyroid Support.  Taking one in the morning with meals and one in the evening seem to help.  I do take thyroid medication every day which seems to be working better with your product.
 Just started this product today.  I chose this particular brand because it contains a great combination of supplements to support your thyroid and is soy free.  After trying T4 for a couple of months, my symptoms just got worse (weight gain, hairloss, fatigue).  I've been researching natural remedies and I was impressed by all the positive reviews.  As someone who usually experiences all the side effects and none of the benefits of prescriptions, I'm very excited to begin.  I will post a more in depth review after I finish this bottle.
 Having suffered from the lowest end of "normal" in test results for years, I thought my low energy, slow metabolism, and poor focus were things I would just have to live with; that is until trying 1 Body Thyroid Support. After just one week of taking this supplement, I have more energy, can focus better, and my scale says I'm down 3 lbs.!<br/>Thank you 1 Body for helping me feel my best!
 Have taken two bottles of Thyroid Support and just ordered third. Brain is better, skin not as dry, hair loss slowing.
 This supplement completely turned my life around! I'm so grateful to have found this product. Before I started taking thyroid support, I was extremely tired along with experiencing a constant feeling of lightheadedness. I couldn't perform daily tasks from fear of fainting. I have been taking this supplement for about a month now and have noticed huge improvement. My energy has almost completely returned, I'm able to care for my 3 children without assistance, and my concentration has improved significantly. I've even been losing weight! This is a product I will definitely continue to use and have already recommended it to family members who need help managing their thyroid health.
 supplement works...have been using for a while, ran out and noticed a decline in energy within a couple days. have reordered at least two months worth this time, won't run out again, this stuff works. Have been on levothyroxine for years!  recently increased my dosage twice and didn't feel better until I started taking this stuff.
 Honestly, I planned on this being the first thyroid supplement I would try but  had no hope it would be the last. I was wrong. I’ve been taking this for two months. After the first two weeks my energy dramatically increased, my stamina at work improved and my concentration greatly improved, and I also started sleeping much better. I have absolutely no need to look any further - this is the product for me and I highly recommend it. I am 62 years old and and very active but I needed the energy boost this product has provided. I am very thankful!
 I love this supplement! I have actually lost 7pounds since taking it, I have been stuck at the same weight for a year and have been so frustrated I decided to look for a thryroid supplement because as you get older your body needs a little help loosing weight your thryroid isn't the same, all of the ingredients in this product are just amazing! If you eat right and take these I think you'll be pleased! Good luck!
 I was recently diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, which means one of my thyroid hormone levels is normal while the other is low, I bought this to help with the fatigue and weight problem. It definitely works. I've been taking as directed on the bottle and have noticed a significant difference in almost every aspect of a typical day. I can wake up when my alarm goes off without hitting snooze. I don't need to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks in order to have steady energy. I can concentrate better on my homework. My mood has been better, I've noticed that my  usual lethargic attitude has subsided and I feel more willing to be adventurous. If you're thinking about trying this product I would recommend it.
 I take thyroid meds (NDT) but my dr. had lowered my thyroid.  After some testing, I got her to put it back up a bit but I also ordered this.  I had noticed increased energy when taking this and I would recommend it to others in the thyroid community.
 I have found this product to really work and help. I feel better since I've been on it. This is my second order of it. In June of this year I'll have another thyroid test done by my doctor. I'm hoping it shows the overall functioning has improved with the help of this supplement and that I won't need to go on a synthetic replacement therapy. I'll write more when I get those results later this year.
 I have been using this product for 2 months now, and I have noticed a significant improvement in many aspects of my life. I take one of these in the morning, in combination with one of the Adrenal support pills in the afternoon. Since using these products, I have more energy, I am less irritable, I have lost 6 pounds (less cravings/more motivation to work out) and I am sleeping better. When i first ran out of the pills, I thought nothing of skipping a few days while the new ones shipped. BIG MISTAKE (and this is how I know they are working)... I was tired and grumpy! I definitely recommend this brand. Great Packaging and Fast Shipping. A+++
 So far so good! I've only been taking one capsule a day to ease into it for the first month, and I do notice some small positive changes, so I think I'll up the dosage to two a day with this next bottle.  It's nice to know there's a natural thyroid supplement out there that actually helps.  Thank you!
 I waited one month to find out if this was really as good as its' supposed to be - it is. While I did take it for a month, I stopped for several days in the middle of the month, to see if the results were my imagination. It was not. I have blood work and an exam at the end of the month, and I can hardly wait to see the lab results to further confirm the positive results. EXCELLENT product.
 I took this product before, and after years of my hypo symptoms and no energy, this product actually worked. I had energy and my joint pain had diminished. I made the mistake of finishing the bottle and going a few months of not re ordering. Just neglect on my part. I will now be sure to always have this on hand. I'm sure results may vary by person. After 7 years of hell with my thyroid this has helped me so much. It took a couple weeks for me to start feeling a difference, but I will swear by this supplement!
 This product boosts my mood, makes me feel as if I have sufficient energy to get through the day. My brain is very awake, active, creative and curious when I am on it. I do like the way it makes me feel. When I stopped it for a few days, I could tell a difference, so I purchased more. I plan on continuing to use it for as long as it benefits me.
 I've been taking this product for a while now, and I can honestly say that it works. I don't mean to be gross, but it helps to regulate certain functions of the body if you know what I mean. I also feel more energetic after I take one of these pills, and this is before I take my adrenal. This energy has helped me to function better in my daily life, and I feel a lot more productive. I also get more ideas and I feel a lot more aware. This is a big difference from how I used to be. I also feel like it helps with my metabolism and I seem to get hungry more, but I don't really gain weight like I used to either. All in all, it's something that I would definitely buy again.
 3 months regular use and my thyroid check came back normal (after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, slightly out of normal range).  No side affects.  I plan on continuing with them to maintain my numbers.
 I have only been using it for three weeks.  But, if I can exam where I am at now I do seem to be sleeping better.  I did not ever feel rested before, I believe I really did't fall into a deep sleep for very long.  I actually am dreaming and I recall  the dreams and even feel rested when I awake.  Also, I have more energy and my focus at work is also better.  I am always suspicious of products like this because I feel they could put grass in the pill and you would't know it.  My thyroid problem I have been suffering with for fifteen years is hyperthyroidism, I have been on meds all the time I did not use radioactive Iodine, so I still have my thyroid, but my thyroid is now starting to turn into hypothyroidism<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>.  I did not give five stars because it is still early and I would like to see what happens with further use of the product.  This is my first review of any product.
 I’m almost done with first bottle and I do see a change in energy and mood. Nothing huge but I was extremely fatigued prior to taking this and now feel closer to “normal”. Hair loss is a little less but still more than I’d like. I have heard it takes awhile for real changes which is why I’m going to continue for a couple more months to give it a true chance.
 It works!!! I was very sick with symptoms of my hair falling out, constipated could not think clear and my feet hurt.  After taking this one week I now have energy, no constipation and my hair and skin look better.  I feel much better.  I had hypo thyroid and was put on levoroxine and after two months of that I had symptoms return after reading the reviews about this I tried it and it really works.  I weaned off the levoroxine before taking this and now am only on this thyroid support.
 Right away I noticed a huge chance in my energy. I couldn’t get out of bed before. Now When i wake up I’m up and stay up. I don’t crash mid day anymore. Don’t know if this is too much information but my womanly cycle came back.  A woman with low thyroid levels can have little to no cycle. So I was very surprised to have mine regular again The first 2 weeks of taking thyroid support. My ent doctor said my thyroid is low but not scary low. Not low enough for prescription meds. I love this alternative so much more.
 I feel less foggy. I was taking all of these ingredients (ashwaganda, selenium, tyrosine etc) separately. I like how there’s a combination and I don’t have to take a bunch of different capsules every night. My only complaint is that I wish you guys made one specific to Hashimoto’s, without iodine. I had to find a new multivitamin without iodine to keep my daily intake of it under a certain amount.
 After two days of use, I really feel a difference! My TSH level is borderline at 4.2, and I'm waiting on the results of my T3 and T4, but I wanted to start something natural instead of something synthetic to see if it would help, and my goodness, I feel like a new woman. I had a lot of energy today, didn't get winded going up and down the steps, and also had energy to do my hair and prepare a healthy lunch and set out meat to thaw for dinner. I feel great and plan on taking a walk this evening and possibly using the Wii Fit. Haven't felt this good in a long time. Not sure it's completely because of the pills, because I'm also eating pretty healthy, cutting back to a max of about 1500 calories a day and am increasing my lean protein and vegetable intake while focusing on upping my water intake as well. So I guess what I'm saying is that I definitely recommend these, when paired with a healthy diet.
 I have almost finished my first bottle of  1body throid support. I began taking this product hoping it would help with overall fatigue. Results of thyroid blood work say I fall within an “acceptable normal range” but im hoping for something closer to optimal! Taking this product as well as doing more regular strenuous excercise has improved my overall sense of well being. Im just not sure which has more impact yet! But Im sticking with this product as part of my plan and hope to report more conclusively soon!!!
 I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's and, because my TSH level was "normal," my doctor declined to put me on any medication despite continuing symptoms. Through several websites for thyroid sufferers, I became aware of the importance of certain vitamins and minerals which help the thyroid to function better. I ordered this because of the selenium in it and started taking it as soon as I received it (about 2 months ago). I try to take at least one, if not the full dose of two, every day. Although I still have some symptoms, I am not as tired as I was before starting this. I have even managed to lose a few pounds, although I wouldn't suggest taking it purely for that reason.
 Noticing more energy &amp; swelling in my thyroid area has decreased. So far so good on seeing changes. I have severe Hypothyroidism &amp; Synthroid doesn't work with my body at all. Dr's refuse to try Armor instead for it takes too much time to control the starting dosage. I am pleased with the results I'm having with this supplement more than I have ever had in my life on prescriptions..
 I Love this product! It gives me great energy throughout the day.  While I am trying to lose weight I was losing steadily at 2lbs a week, while taking this product I lost 4lbs..do not know if it was coincidence or not, but I will continue using at his product for sure.
 After ONE bottle of this my blood tests for my thyroid came back perfect! Now I don't have to take a heavy medication. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful product.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a little over two weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my thyroid function. I am losing less hair each time I shower. My dry skin has already started clearing up and my energy is up! I did not expect such quick results, but I am so pleased and have already signed up for a subscription so that I don't run out!
 Have been taking these for a couple weeks now and maybe it's too soon to tell but aside from feeling more "regular" (bowel wise),  I can't tell anything else.  I'm not even sure, if that is supposed to be a side effect.<br/><br/>I will say that I appreciated that I placed my order for these without any promised incentive, received them quickly and opened the package to receive a coupon for another free one as a thank you in hopes that it would encourage me to leave feedback.  I received the free bottle just as quickly as the first.  For their customer service alone I give them 5 stars.  I discounted 1 star only because as of yet, I can't tell if these are doing anything for me.
 I ordered this for the first time in October and I didn't order another bottle because I was trying to save money but I started noticing symptoms I used to have were coming back.  So I realize I cannot live without this product trying other products and hope to get the same positive results.  Thank You.
 I have been taking these for about 2 weeks. Regarding weight loss i really cant say that i have lost any regardless of working out 4x week with the les mills combat, but my memory fog has drastically changed. I feel more alert and less stressed.
 My thyroid tested sluggish and I had all of the symptoms from a underactive thyroid. I have been taking 1 body thyroid support supplements for a month and have lost 7 lbs. I also notice, I'm not taking any naps during the day. Since I started taking this supplement I can tell a huge difference in my health.
 I've only been using this for two weeks, but already I can feel a notable difference. I have energy, I'm not voraciously hungry, and my moods have started to balance out. I'm excited to see how continued use of this thyroid product is going to work
 I read the reviews and gave it a shot- my thyroid levels are in the normal range....but I do have hashimotos. I just felt I needed a boost. I have not noticed a weight loss reduction, however i have noticed increased energy after work... that’s a major for me!
 I have been feeling so tired, drained and have gained weight over the past 10 years. My joints ached. My body ached, my brain was unclear, unfocused all over the place it was just awful. I've been taking this product along with the Adrenal Support for about 2 months now and I have to say that I feel so amazing. It took time to get to where I am now but the one thing I noticed immediately was the clarity in my mind. I am grateful for these products.
 I have hypothyroidism (taking .137 mg Levothyroxine) and started taking "Thyroid Support" at the beginning of January 2016 in an effort to try to kick the few remaining hypo symptoms I've been having (brain fog, exhaustion, etc.).  I do feel that these symptoms are now gone for me and I've also seen a significant change in my TSH levels, going from 1.66 MCIU/ML in January 2015 to .75 MCIU/ML taken two weeks ago.  I've been taking one capsule each morning, but am probably going to dial it back to every other day as I'm starting to feel a few hyperthyroid symptoms kicking up.  I feel that this is going to be a good way for me to make minor changes to my thyroid levels without having to get a new prescription every time I'm symptomatic.  If you have a known thyroid problem, I do recommend getting your blood work checked if you do start taking this as my results indicate that it does have an impact on thyroid production.
 I bought this for my wife she was taking some prescription one from the Doctor and it was not helping at all in fact I think the side effects were making her worse I ordered this Thyroid Support and I can see a improvement but also I made her stop taking the one from the doctor it will probably take I couple of months to fully get the bad one out of her system I will leave another review after another month or two to let everyone know how it is working.I would say that my wife's mood is getting better and her energy levels are 40 percent better .I love my wife very much and could not stand to see struggle with her exhaustion,only time will tell but so far so good.hope this was helpful.
 Having been recently diagnosed with breast cancer in the past year, I underwent surgery and radiation, along with having to take tamoxifen daily. I noticed my hair was falling out like crazy, both in the shower and in my hairbrush. I'm also Hypothyroid, so I am not sure which or both contributed to the hair loss. Even though I am on a thyroid medication, I though I would try the Thyroid support after reading many of the reviews. It has been about a month since I started taking it. I only take it once a day, and I must say the hair loss has stopped! I will continue taking Thyroid Support, I am pleased with the results.
 I switched to your product because the iodine levels were safe and not as extremely high as the product I was using. I have had the same, if not better results with your product. Energy levels are good, hair growth seems the same (but more time will tell), so far very happy with your product!
 I am a mid 30's African American woman. I have a busy active life, via fitness and also a busy rewarding career.<br/>My doc's said my thyroid levels are fine and I've been to the best doctors in NY but I know something was wrong. I started to lose my hair and my energy levels were declining. This was a major wake-up call that I had to take things into my own hands. I found this product and it has really worked for me!!! I am on my 3rd bottle as I really like to make sure a supplement is really working. I live a very healthy life so I attempted to battle the side effects on my own of my thyroid issues but this is the only thing that has worked. It has brought my hair and energy back. Energy is necessary for anyone to function each day personally and professionally. Having chronic fatigue sucks!!! My hair was always long and beautiful it started falling out slowly but noticeable...this has brought it back...I will continue to use this product and hoping it continues to work and they make a better version of this in the future.
 I like the ingredients that are in this product i've heard good things about them being benefical for the thyroid &amp; other parts of the body.<br/>Everyone is different, for me i have been on this product for a month i have another bottle coming.<br/>I only have half of my thyroid &amp; have not been prescribed meds however i feel that taking a good quality supplement could help my thyroid . I noticed over 4000 reviews that seemed positive on amazon for this product so im trying it in hopes it will help support what i have left of my thyroid &amp; help me have more energy.
 I have been taking these vitamins for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed an improvement. My energy levels are getting better, I'm sleeping better at night and my joints are feeling less achy. My PCP ran bloodwork for my thyroid and it wasn't functioning properly. I didn't want to go on a prescription as that can effect your liver, so went the natural route with these vitamins. The company has wonderful customer service and the product is working. Overall, I am exceptionally pleased.
 I wasn’t sure this would work, but after taking Thyroid Support for 2 weeks I am starting to notice a difference! I notice I’m starting to have more energy through the day, I can come home from teaching Early Childhood Sped and still have energy left to play with my 10 year old. I’m also sleeping better and I’m not taking sleeping pills as often. Now, it’s not a miracle pill and you’re not going to notice a difference on day one, BUT if you take it everyday like the directions say after about 7-10 days you should start feeling a difference.
 At first it took awhile for the upset stomach issues to pass, but it's worth sticking with and remembering to take on full stomach. I've been treated for hypo for almost 30 years and about five years ago got very ill...they ultimately ended up tripling my Synthroid dosage about three years ago and I've felt much better, but would on occasion have relapses and feel absolutely awful for days at a time. This product seems to reduce those days and their severity. I have more energy...to the point where I'm only taking one a day...if I take one at night I have trouble sleeping. Thank you so much...this has ingredients I'd never taken as supplements and has allowed me to pare down the number of supplements I do take as some are already included in this product.
 Been taking this for a few weeks now; so far, I definitely feel like my adrenal function is higher, and I see little baby hairs sprouting up. I’ve been taking selenium and L-tyrosine for months prior to this, so I’ve discontinued those as they are in this formula. After many years of hypothyroidism and having half of my thyroid removed, I am willing to try anything!
 Felt a difference right away.  Before beginning Thyroid Support I was always needed a nap to get through the day.  I haven't need a nap and I have slept better throughout the night.  I always had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep but since beginning this supplement I get a full night's rest and wake up earlier without feeling sleepy.  I take one capsule in the morning and the next capsule around 4pm instead of bedtime. I have been hesitant to take one at bedtime since it has so much B12.
 Thyroid Support is a great product. Since I started my bottle I feel less tired and as a result I’m being more active. I take it together with other vitamins and minerals, if that helps. I would most surely recommend it and will buy it again
 I bought this thyroid support over others, based on the ingredient methylcobalamin (the methylated form of B-12) but the box says methylcobalamin but the actual bottle says cyanocobalamin... not as advertised! The other ingredients seems good... but this was a requirement for me, and why I bought this product over other thyroid support!
 I am so thankful I found Thyroid Support.  I just finished my 1st bottle and ordered a second I am starting to feel so much better. I quit taking thyroid medication because it made me feel sicker taking it than without it, but after taking Thyroid Support I am feeling good again.
 I went off thyroid medication 2 weeks ago to take this. I will be having my labs retested next month and will post another comment when I get them back! Fingers crossed I'm hoping to stay on this. Great integrity this company has!  Generous offer with a second bottle free after first purchase.  Thank you!
 I am taking this along with the adrenal support. WOW! I have noticed a tremendous difference within myself. I suffer from anxiety, and I have been so much calmer, with less mood swings, and I feel like I am on anxiety meds. I also am sleeping better overall, and have more energy and motivation. My thyroid levels have always been within the normal range, however, I have a very strong genetic history of thyroid disease &amp; thyroid cancer. I suffer from many of the symptoms, so I thought I would give this a try to see if it helped.
 So far I prefer this product over another one that I was using before.  Will continue to use it to see if benefits continue.  Not sure if it's better to take both capsules at the same time or split them up into 1 capsule every 12 hours to keep a more level amount in my system.  Trying it both ways to see which I like best.
 I've been taking this product for about 2 weeks.  I bought it to help with sluggishness and for mood enhancement.  Since I've been taking it, mood has been improved and I've been less lethargic.  I've also noticed food cravings have been less intense.  Still, the effects of this are mild.  This is no miracle drug, but a supplement to help your own body work a little better.  You still have to get your butt off the couch, but this may give you a little more oomph to get up. The pills are a little big if you have trouble swallowing them, and don't sniff them for goodness sake!  They reek!  Other than that, they seem to have a positive effect, so I will keep taking them and update this review in a month or so.
 Doctor had me on a Thyroid prescription that made me anxious and crabby.  My family was not a fan of the new me.  I tried these and found the relief, energy and support I needed without the negative side affects. I'm a believer.
 I got this for my wife few weeks ago. Here is her review:<br/><br/>First of all I want to say that I did not get it for free so i could review it. I decided to buy it after I read reviews of other people about it. After I bought it for full price I found a coupon for free bottle. Of cause I used it and got second bottle for free. :)<br/>I waited to write my review so I could try product at least for few weeks and now I can say that supplement definitely helps me. It gives me higher levels of energy to do things I need to do. I do not feel so drowsy and dizzy when I take it. That was my primary reasons why I wanted to try it. Regarding weight loss I can not say anything as I did not followed my weight before I started taking supplement and did not noticed any change on my clothes fit.
 Just received the Thyroid Support so will follow instructions and now begin using it.  Have minor issues with my thyroid gland and hope to overcome them.  Have been doing diligent research and find that, with the right product, one can overcome problems.  This supplement seems to have all of the ingredients I am looking for and so am hoping for success.
 Since by body is in pretty bad shape and there are too many things wrong with it, I didn't think I'd notice a difference with this product, but I did!  My doctor said I needed thyroid support and I don't remember why but I just went with it.<br/>I'm feeling more like how I did when things were normal for me.  I just feel healthier.  I'm sticking with it since there seems to be a trend that was started here.  ;-)
 I've only started using this product and already have noticed a considerable change with my energy level.  I have an underactive thyroid and always feel sluggish and tired.  I believe this product is working very well for me thus far.  I chose this product because of the natural ingredients and the fact the capsules are vegetarian.
 I am on thyroid medication and I have been taking this in addition. I feel better. No doubt about it👍
 Unbelievable! For years, test numbers were at the very bottom of acceptable on my T3 and T4 blood-draws. My physician assured me no prescription was necessary. My days were filled with extreme fatigue, insomnia, brain-drain, dry skin and sore joints. Within 36 hours after taking Thyroid Supplement  I had more energy (emphasis on MORE) and my joints felt less tender. After three days of Thyroid Supplement, I had energy like days gone-by and felt greater comfort in my joints. Is this a dream, am I going to wake up tomorrow and feel tired and achey? No, each morning, I feel better and better. I have changed nothing to my routine except to add this supplement. Thyroid Support Supplement has changed my life!!!
 I waited to rate the thyroid, adrenal, and liver support because I was sketical. The following is what I have observed as results.<br/><br/>Thyroid support: I have many of the hypothyroid symptoms weight gain, sluggishness, increases appetite, and most noteablly hair loss (body and head) and unbelievably dry skin to the point it was difficult to hide and a source of embarrassment.  I have noticed my skin is softer and a significant reduction in dry skin.  My skin was dry to the point that I noticed flaking on my cloths after wearing them. My facial skin is changing it is softer and seems to respond to my daily moisture regiment.  The change is visibly and noticeable to the touch. I take my dose first thing in the morning as soon as I get out the bed.  That is totally what's up!  By time I get out the shower I am awake.<br/><br/>The adrenal support I take around 3pm.  I notice I am calmer which is a big deal because I am easily excited.  My out look is more positive and overall I feel good.<br/><br/>I take the liver support before bed.  I am not sure if it's related but I have been sleeping like a baby.  I have been taking all three for 3 weeks and I will continue.  I feel better so much so that I have not missed a dose since I started.  I have not been diagnosised with any deficiencies but I feel like this has provided something I was missing.
 My eyebrows are finally growing healthy again. Before taking this medicine, I had all the classic symptoms of hypothyroidism, including hair loss. Finally, I'm feeling better and my health is improving.
 I have been diagnosed with adrenal fatigue years ago and after trying other brands of Adrenal Support, I decided to try 1 Body Brand. I also read reviews about how wonderful the Thyroid Support Supplement is as well so I decided to order them both.  I have finally started losing weight after a couple of years of being stuck at a plateau and have more balanced energy....I finally feel like my old self!  Definitely will continue using these great products.
 Since I started taking this product, I feel more energetic and less sluggish throughout the day. Also, I previously felt no appetite in the morning, whereas when I was younger I used to have a healthy appetite for breakfast. Since taking this supplement, I feel hungry throughout the day at regular intervals---I feel like my metabolism is working faster. I've only been taking it one month though, so that's why 4 stars instead of 5--I'm going to reserve further judgment until I see more benefits in the future.
 I'm a 36 year old mom (using Dad's account), with a history of thyroid issues. I used to take synthroid for hypothyroidism, until my doctor said my levels were back to normal and he took me off it. So, when i started having the same old symptoms of a thyroid malfunction, mainly noticeable hair loss, I decided to find something in a supplement form. After maybe a week of taking the pills, I noticed a huge different on hair loss! Where before, i could run my fingers through my hair at any given time and come away with 10-20 hairs in my hand, now there MIGHT be 1 or 2 hairs that come out. Very pleased! This product obviously works and I will continue to buy it.
 I stated taking Thyroid Support because my doctor stated that my Thyroid was slightly enlarged.  I showed my doctor the bottle and they agreed that this would be a great supplement for me to take.  Since taking this product it feels like my thyroid is not as enlarged and it has made my hair grow longer!  I highly recommend this product.
 I'm over 50 and have hypothyroidism. Since using this product I'm finding I have more energy, sleep better, better stamina, and clearer thinking.
 Previous to this supplement, I was having issues with lethargy, even to the point of having to pull over in the middle of the day while driving to close my eyes, and I am only 30! I also put on about 25 lbs within the past year despite having the same activity level.<br/><br/>After taking this thyroid support (ingredients were identical to almost every other thyroid supplement so I picked this pretty randomly) I have had sustained energy throughout the entire day, right up until night time. I don't feel jittery, or experience a crash, or have trouble shutting off and  getting to sleep, it just makes me feel constantly "awake" if that makes sense, which is beyond exciting. Planning on popping one a day, everyday, for the foreseeable future!
 I have been hypothyroid for over 20 years, and complained to my endocrinologist every time I went about how tired I was.  Every endocrinologist I ever went to just looked at my lab results, and sent me out the door proclaiming that my numbers were within normal range.  I found this supplement on Amazon one day, and I decided to give it a try.  I felt a definite improvement in my energy level within a 2 week time period.  It wasn't an immediate change, but I gradually started to feel more energy throughout the day.  Will definitely buy again.  Too bad doctors don't have more nutrition training because it seems to me that they should know what supplements may help.
 I was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago, and after surgery, chemo and radiation, I no longer have a functioning thyroid. I'm now taking Armour, and have added Thyroid Support for an additional boost. I'm getting tests done next week and will have a better idea of how it is working then.
 I just finished 30 days of this product.  My hair is stopped falling out and my nails are doing pretty well.  My feeling of cold has decreased as well although I'm still working on my sleep patterns.  Decided to take the adrenal support as well.
 I never write review because I have never had a product work as good as this product.  I have had hypothyroid for years and nothing the Doctors gave me would increase my levels. I have gone from .025 to .540 in one month. This is the low range of the thyroid levels. This product works better then the prescription  that I have taken for the last 3 years. It has increased my energy and I feel so much better.  My Primary Care Doctor could not believe it. He asked what had I done so differently to finally get my level to reach the low end of the range. I told them about this product and they couldn't believe it. They told me to stop taking my regular prescriptions and continue with this product because it works so good.
 Just vitamins. Haven’t seen any more results than with regular vitamins. Maybe something is happening that I cant see?? Was hoping for hair loss help and more energy!
 I recently started this product because I was wanting to quit adderall. When I got this I quit the adderall cold turkey and I didn't feel tired and I was still able to focus. Normally if I did not take my adderall I would of been tired and sluggish all day. The energy I get from this is more steady vs adderall having a burst of energy. Plus I'm getting my vitamins and becoming more healthy. Love it.
 After my last routine lab test my doctor wanted to give me a prescription thyroid medicine, my  TSH level was out of range and low T3 level, besides that, I had sleep disorders, lack of energy, depression symptoms, loss of hair,  but I said to my doctor that  I wanted to give a chance to a natural supplement, It was when I decided to try Thyroid Support, two months later I had a lab test to check my thyroid levels: TSH is back in range but close to the upper range normal level, so far I'm satisfied with this product, my sleep patterns, energy levels are improving  and I'm in a better mood but my hair is still falling, I will continue to take this product at least  for 4 months more, because it takes time to the body to work with natural supplements.
 I have had my thyroid gland completely removed due to Grave's Disease and hyperthyroidism. I have been hypothyroid and on synthroid for years now, and have not felt up to par. I have been taking thyroid support for about 3 weeks and am feeling better already! Great Product.
 I have been very impressed with this product. I have taken the adrenal supplement as well and that worked very well. I always receive more mental clarity and a more sustained energy throughout the day. Overall, if you're looking for a great thyroid supplement then this your winner.
 I was sick of telling my doctor about my thyroid meds not working. After doing my own research, I bumped into this product. Read the reviews and thought of giving it a try. I wish I had tried the T3 supplement earlier. In just 3 days I saw my hair fall go from can almost make a wig to countable when I brushed (about 10-15 strands). I also had lot of energy (it takes about 30-45 mins to see the difference). When I get back from work, I am literally exhausted and just want to crash. But thats the time I take my second tablet for the day and within an hour, I am ready for my exercise. I have recommended this to a couple of my friends and they started in less than a week and say good things. I would highly recommend this product.
 I bought this product because I was having all the symptoms of a thyroid problem. Before finding a doctor I decided to see if I could treat this on my own. I have been taking it for about a week and I can feel a 15% increase in energy I'm 200 lbs so this is a big leap, I felt fatigued most days. Now I feel a little better I have been taking this for about a week everyday and will continue to do take it. I had also noticed that my nails had been getting very brittle and some hair loss, my nails now look great and a 20% less hair fall. Energy wise I no longer feel fatigued, only tired as I work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week. I might buy this again for sure if not I might try a different brand to test which one works better. I'm also trying to lose weight so I'm going to start exercising too. I will post an update after the 30 day dosage.
 Excellent combination of iodine, iodide and many supplements that are excellent especially for thyroid issues.  Good for anyone since most folks don't get enough iodine.  I actually went to autoship with the discount plus I use this daily.  I also not use this firm's liver support with the great ingredients and price.
 I have only been taking for a few weeks but I can already tell a different in my energy. I will submit another review in a few weeks with an update.<br/>I did try and claim a free sample from the seller with a coupon they sent in my shipment and, only after I posted a review and gave them my contact info, did I receive a notice that they are all out of free bottles and I could be contacted for another promotion. Kind of disappointing
 My wife and I are both taking this product.  She was already taking a prescription for her thyroid and the last order was "lost in the mail" or some other huge delay.  She and I have both been faring quite well on the product.  My wife says that your product is possibly even more effective than the prescription medication that she was taking.  She doesn't mean to say that she thinks people should stop taking their prescription medication, but that the Thyroid support just seems to be doing a better job.  It is a little early to tell what the true effects might be for me, but I do feel more energized.  I have also noticed a change in skin texture.  I am very optimistic about this product and waiting to see more of the positive results. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 I'm very impressed with the quality of this supplement.  I've been taking this product for about 2 weeks &amp; my energy level has increased significantly.  Hoping that this will lead to weight loss soon.
 Very happy! I ordered a bottle of this product, being impressed with its broad ingredients list as opposed to other thyroid products that don't provide much besides the needed iodine. I'm a 61 year old male, fairly active but still tire easily in daytime despite good nights of sleep and careful diet.  I have been on this product for nearly 3 weeks now and just after the first 2-3 days I noticed my daytime pep is much better, my metabolism seems to have a daily boost with this product. I've lost a bit of weight since starting this product, 2 pounds though that isn't the main intent, and the weight  doesn't seem to be coming back as long as I keep eating sensibly. My experience with this product so far is excellent, I do recommend giving it a go if you're looking for some more daily rev than usual.<br/><br/>Note: a free bottle is currently being sent to me for redeeming the small email contact card that came with the product. (However a review was not required to gain this one time free bottle) I have posted a completely accurate review as still on my first bottle I am feeling the desired metabolism effects daily, especially in the afternoons when I had been getting the most dozy. I will definitely purchase this product again even after both the paid and free bottles are used up.
 I've been getting more and more picky about what I put in and on my body as I learn more about the chemicals and additives used and what they can do to a body.  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and put on synthroid at the age of 40. Part of me tends to believe low levels were caused in part (if not fully) by my near elimination of salt and hence iodine combined with naturally declining hormone levels. A little research brought me to this product which I have been taking for a month now. Haven't yet had labs done, nor do I intend to stop my prescribed medication, but I definately feel a mild boost of energy/ alertness for a few hours after taking this product. The wall I used to slam into in the early afternoon now doesn't hit me until early evening.  I think the product has a good selection of ingredients and I absolutely Love that there is naught but the active ingredients in a vegetarian gel capsule.  I wish all medications and supplements could be put in a capsule without added fillers and binders. BIG selling point for me. Thank you 1 Body for choosing to formulate you product so.
 I've only been using it for just over a month but so far it has helped significantly with losing a couple extra pounds and gaining a lot more much needed energy to keep up with my two toddlers and the upkeep of my house, before taking the product I was rather sluggish and worn out, and while it might be a coincidence, I've noticed a boost in energy since I started taking the product and so far no downsides (knock on wood). Will continue taking it.
 Good stuff, I recommend trying it. It took about a week for me to feel the effects but I did heavy lifting in the garden in 100 degree heat for 4 hours Saturday with no residual tiredness or pain in my muscles afterwards. For me the better my thyroid functions, the less I feel the fibromyalgia and CFS. I also have been looking for a vegetarian supplement to use for my thyroid as the typical stuff has cow/pork thyroid in it and that stuff always causes me an anxiety side effect.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the owner of the business checking in to see if it was delivered on time and if the product was meeting expectations. I get that it is Amazon and everyone wants reviews, but who does that?
 After acute kidney failure, I started taking your product for thyroid support. It seems to have helped during my recovery process. Thank you!
 I have PTSD and always tired due to anxiety and sleep apnea. I received this March 7, and decided to take 1 that evening. I SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT!!<br/>I WOKE UP AT 6 am, READY TO CLEAN HOUSE!!  WORKS FOR ME!!
 I have been trying the thyroid supplement support for 15 days now, and I can feel a positive difference so far. When I take 2 a day, I wake up feeling not as tired as I used to. I also feel more focused on everyday tasks as well as a bit more alert.
 I was having issues with hair loss, not split ends but loss!!  and it wasnt growing near the front of my scalp (bangs and side). Tried minoxidil and ALL sorts of shampoos. I am very healthy and work out and vegan and was at a loss. I decided to try these vegetarian supplements. I have been taking them for 2 weeks... and have noticed not a lot of hair loss and my hair is very shiney! I will continue taking these as they seem to give me energy also. I have been on the night shift for years and this has helped me tremendously! Try it for hair loss and energy- you wont be dissappointed!
 I have determined that taking 1 capsule 2 days in a row and skipping a day then 2 days again works very well for me.  Higher doses made me edgy.  ( I don't do caffeine )  Much improves mental clarity for me and overall energy level.  Very good product.
 I feel better in the morning when I wake up; I'm not as tired as I was before and I have more energy in general. My weight has come down as well.
 I read reviews before buying this product. It caught my attention because my thyroid levels go from one end to the other, but always borderline. I also have PCOS which is a constant struggle. Once I started taking Thyroid Support, I saw a slight increase in my energy. Now I have been on it for 3 weeks and I have lost 6 lbs. I feel like my mind is sharper too, like my fogginess is slowly fading. Definitely give it a chance. I have not had any side effects from this product.
 I have never fully had my thyroid checked out. However, I have always felt "off". Since I have taken this product I no longer have my afternoon blahs or need a nap to function the rest of the day. I can fully tell when I do not have this product in my system. I have gone through 2 bottles of this and absolutely love it! It makes me feel "normal" again.
 I started using this product last December.  Its been wonderful.  Did you know that if you are in your 40's and you constantly dieting, you are at risk for hypothyroidism?  Since using this product, I have my energy back, my fibroids are virtually gone and my hair is thick again.  I love that it is vegetarian and has the B-12 added in.  Great product!
 I took this consistently for 30 days because I had previously been told I could have an underactive thyroid (but not within laboratory range to be on a pharmaceutical replacement). This product has made me feel great! I can definitely tell a difference in my energy levels &amp; feel my metabolism is more efficient (i.e. faster). However, don't expect results overnight. It took me until week 3 to start really feeling a difference. But you get a free bottle after your first order so it is certainly worth a try!
 I feel like I have more energy and more clarity of mind. The foods I am craving are different and I'm not able to eat as much as I previously was...I dont feel "starving"...therefore, I am beginning to lose weight. Also, my hair seems to be a bit healthier. So far, I am very pleased with the product!
 So I wasnt going to write a review at all. I am careful that way. A few months ago I was told I have a goiter. I went to a holistic chiropractor who told me my levels were borderline low but that I was B12 deficient.  He gave me two supplements. Selenium and B methyl. I tikk them religiously but wasnt seeing any change. I felt better, but that thing was still staring at me every day. I bought this supplement on my own and without any advice. It's been 2 weeks and I'm taking one a day. My goiter is almost gone. I have not had any side effects.
 I have been taking thyroid support for a few weeks now. I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease. I will be the first to admit I have not been consistent in taking this twice a day as recommended. Most days I take it once a day, but I have noticed I don’t feel as fatigued and ready to crash. I take this supplement 2 hours after I take my levothyroxine. I do get nauseous at times, if I take on an empty stomach (but I also feel the same way when taking a multivitamin). I showed this to my primary care physician and he didn’t see any problem with the ingredients in the supplement.
 I can't say yet what effect it has had on my hypothyroidism without blood testing; however, my mood is so calm. Anxiety has left me and I sleep so much better. I don't seem to be craving specific foods or a lot of food. It must be working great for me to notice these things in less than 30 days on the product.
 So far, so good.  It will take a few months to really determine the effects of this supplement. I am currently hypothyroid. I would like to get off the medication. I have been feeling more positive after a few weeks of taking two a day. It has been a good experience. I will report back in a few months.
 This wont replace prescription thyroid pills ... but it helps. I'm out of my prescription ones and after a month of taking these, I do feel a bit better again. No thanks to all the crap of the medical industry &amp; insurance ... soon as I can, I will get back on the meds though.
 This is a helpful product.  I only take one capsule at a time or I feel very jittery.  I take this to mean that my body absorbs the ingredients well, however.  My thyroid level was within normal range, but barely.  Taking these I have been able to avoid permanent thyroid medication as several symptoms have been relieved and my immunity has increased. I feel like it is a well-rounded supplement to take in general.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for about 4 months now and I only take one a day (suggested use is 2 a day). I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and I take Synthroid daily, but I still have symtoms of fatigue and overall lack of energy. This supplement really helps give me that extra boost of energy when I take it in the morning. I will definitely continue to take this supplement!
 Great for helping metabolism kick into high gear after a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Synthroid wasn't getting the job done in terms of energy and weight loss, but my test numbers were good, so the dosage remains low.Thyroid Support has gotten my metabolism and energy back in line.
 I was so scared that I was tired all the time and had no energy. Someone told me that I may have thyroid issues. Although I don’t believe so entirely, I do believe that there is something in this product that gives me a legitimate boost of energy in the day and night. The only issue I have is that my eye starts twitching randomly on occasion and this started after I took the product.
 I have my energy back! I take 150 mcg of levothyroxine daily, and my TSH numbers are "normal" but I was still feeling exhausted, sluggish, and had brain fog. After taking thyroid support I feel like I'm finally back to normal. I haven't had any stomach ache or side effects.
 I think that with any natural supplement it takes time to build up in the body. I'm already feeling more energetic and believe it will only get better as I stay on this product. I think I'll have a much better idea of how I feel after I've been on it for at least 90 days!
 I have more energy and feel more clear headed.  I have had hypothyroidism for 12 years, and this is the best I've felt excluding the first few days after increasing my medication dose!  Thank you for a great product.  I have recommended to friends and family who are also dealing with this disease.
 I have been taking this a week and am very pleased with the results.  I was tired all the time and wanting to nap every afternoon.  This supplement gives me a boost that I need to take on projects around the house instead of napping.  I am not having any negative side effects.  I just feel better throughout the day and then sleep more soundly at night too.  I recommend this for anyone that has hypothyroid problems.  I think you will be very happy you gave it a try.
 My naturopath recommended a mineral supplement to help support my thyroid function and I found that it did help my energy levels. I decided to try this brand to save money and am happy with the results. I've noticed increased energy levels and less hair loss since starting the supplement. It works as well as the expensive brand from the doctors office.
 I have only been taking for about 3<br/>weeks but I have noticed a significant increase in energy and overall well-being. Have seen great improvement in focus also. I do occasionally get a mild headache if I do not take after a breakfast as recommended.  I look forward to continued use for best results as my friend who insists this has been life changing and has helped him in regaining his energy and weight loss as well as mental clarity.
 I have been using this product with good results, but noticed with my recent order that the color of the new capsules is different from the previous capsules. I don’t know now if it can be trusted month to month to be the exact same recipe and give the exact same results.
 I no longer feel tired when I wake up in the morning.  I usually experience frequent bouts of acid reflux but since I started using 1 Thyroid Support, I don't have heartburn at all.  I think it is helping me with controlling my acid reflux! I will definitely reorder.
 I haven't been taking this very long but so far, it seems to be a good supplement.  I choose it as a replacement for an iodine supplement I was taking that made me feel sick if I took it every day of the week.  I took that one 3 times/week and it work ok.  I thought that I would try this one as I have Hashimoto's and know I need some iodine but thought I'd give the extra supplements in this a try.  With this disorder we just keep on trying things to see what works.
 I've been taking the supplement for 2 and a half weeks and I'm starting to notice changes in my appetite. I seem to be desiring smaller portions when I eat and also crave healthier and lighter foods like veggie's and chicken and fish.  I also noticed that I have been breaking out on my skin and have felt a little sick,which I'm guess that it's also cleansing. I'm feeling better now that I've been taking it a bit longer.  So far I feel it is making a difference in my appetite, but haven't felt a difference in my energy level's yet.
 Good product, but the pills are really huge....and difficult for someone like me to swallow. Also, in an effort to take the supplement without swallowing, I opened the capsule and put the powder inside some warm/hot tea. BIG mistake! This product has cayenne pepper (in a small amount, but it's a super strong pepper) which did not agree with my stomach when taken that way. So, back to swallowing the monster sized pills...sigh.
 I am 49 years old, was on hormone therapy a few years ago but it got too expensive to keep up with. I've been trying to balance things naturally with supplements and diet, etc. I started off with these and was able to sleep better than I had in a long time. I tried a different brand that you take only once a day. Those didn't seem to work as well for me and made me almost a little irritable at times for some strange reason...even though they have mostly the same ingredients. I have come back to these for a second shot. I believe when I take them properly and don't forget my second dose in the evening, I sleep better.  I'll have to continue using to see what other things I notice. So far so good. My sister takes them as well and we both noticed we were sleeping better when we first started taking them. I'll report back if I notice other benefits.
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support Supplement for approximately one month now, along with a daily dose of green tea.  I have noticed subtle improvements in my symptoms (energy level, mood, hair loss and muscle pain and weakness.)  Nothing life-changing yet, but I ordered another bottle and will continue taking it.  It has produced results, which is more than I can say for other supplements I have tried. Also on the good side, I have not noticed any negative side effects. Will review again after taking for longer period of time.
 I am 52 yrs old fighting hypothyroidism. I started taking this product as a natural remedy to regulate thyroid. I believe it is helping even though I do not have recent lab tests to back it up. I do plan on continuing this product.
 Thyroid support seems to be working as expected. I have more energy and my skin seems to be less dry. I do sometimes forget to take my second dose in the evening and I'm sure when I get that under control the benefits will be even more apparent. I would recommend this to a friend.
 Our family comes from a country which suffered so much after nuclear Chernobyl disaster and thyroid treatment is a must. This product I chose with recommendation of friends. We started this year and will return later to share some results and impressions.
 I have only been using this product for several weeks now.  I will be 60 in a month and have noticed some changes.  I have not had to shave my legs in years and  with the hairs on my legs are growing.  My nails are getting stronger and my sleep is getting better.  I will update my review when I have taken this product for several months.  I would recommend trying this product.  I do not take hormones replacement.  This may be a big game changer for me
 I have been using this product for almost 3 months, after having symptoms of Hashimoto's but needing to wait 2 months for a dr appointment. I have more energy overall, am sleeping better at night. While I've also tried other supplements since then, this is one I will continue to use. They offer a free bottle once 1 is purchased, which was lovely. Thank you!
 Thoroughly enjoyed. Not sure how it works but I have more energy and sleep better.
 After being diagnosed with hypothyroid I began taking 1 Body's Adrenal and Thyroid support.  Within 2-3 weeks I noticed I was sleeping much better.  4 months later, my blood work says my thyroid is functioning normally.  NO MORE HYPOTHYROID!  I will continue to take these to ensure the health of my adrenal glands and my thyroid.
 I asked my endocrinologist about taking these and he said they would inhibit the synthroid medication from working. I threw them in the trash can in the exam room.
 I have low thyroid function and have been dealing with really bad flu like/pain and weakness symptoms that can only be described by doctors as fibro pain because all the test that have been done show nothing is a miss. I was taking a lot of over the counter pain killer which of course is not good so was looking to find something that was more natural in hopes that it would work. i bought the thyroid support and after a couple of hours of taking the first supplement the pain started to fade. I waited a couple of weeks to give this review to make sure it wasn't all in my head and that it actually worked. i had forgotten to take my two afternoon pills the last two days and Omg the pain came back, i can tell you I do not want to forget again feeling like death was trying to grab hold is not a fun feeling. i did not realize how bad I truly felt until I was pain free for two weeks and then had it come back because i forgot to take my supplements. As far as energy I cant say it has helped a lot but please listen to the other reviews try not to take it at night.. i did because i forgot to take during the day and my dreams were very active. I am hoping for more progress the longer i take it, it has only been about two weeks so i will remain hopeful. for now i definitely don't want to be without it because of the pain reason alone. ( i did talk with my doctor first to make sure it was okay and to make sure my blood work is monitored while taking this with my thyroid medication )
 I was given a thyroid drug, but I could not handle the side effects.  I tried this, and it works...I feel good!
 I purchased this along with the Adrenal Support.  I purchased because I was having issues with fatigue and adrenal burnout (dealing with intense stress).  I previously had to take Synthroid due to Hoshimoto's Thyroid disease.  I have not been on meds now for over 5 years however, although blood work indicates normal levels, I seem to still experience some of my previous thyroid symptoms (hair loss, constipation, brain fog, confusion, fatigue, etc).  My hopes are to relieve the symptoms and support both my thyroid and adrenals.  I have been taking for just about couple of weeks and have noticed more energy and focus.  I am looking forward to seeing how my body responds as I continue to use.  Will write another review after I have been on them for 2-3 months.
 My thyroid level is high but not high enough for my dr. to prescribe prescription medication. Therefore, dr. recommended finding a natural supplement. Since starting this, I have seen an increase in my energy and a drop in my steadily rising weight. I LOVE IT! No side effects at all! I’m on bottle 5 and have no reason to consider quitting this supplement. It works when all else failed!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support twice per day for four weeks. I had already been taking a very good thyroid support supplement and several drops of iodine per day before I started the Thyroid Support. So I really have not noticed any difference in the way I feel - not better, but not worse either. I did cut down on the other supplement, however, because it contains some of the same ingredients as Thyroid Support.<br/><br/>I based my decision to try Thyroid Support on the many excellent reviews I read here on Amazon. I like the fact that it contains forskolin, which I had not seen incorporated into a thyroid support supplement before.<br/><br/>I would really like to have gotten the e-mail with the e-book "Thyroid Support Diet &amp; Weight Loss," but I did not... or if I did, then someone deleted the e-mail before I got a chance to see it. :-(<br/><br/>1 Body is sending me a free bottle just because I bought the first bottle on Amazon. I think that is great. When that bottle arrives I will discontinue my other supplements and take only the Thyroid Support. Then I'll come back here and update my review.
 This product caused me to feel bad. I looked up some of the ingredients and some of the herbs can cause some folks bad side effects, so be careful what you take.would not recommend.
 I am almost through my first bottle and am seeing a difference and plan to order more.  I figure six months is a fair amount of time to determine results, so will update this review at that time.  But for now, results are promising.
 I have been using the product for a little over one month now. I noticed that my mood has improved and that my body temperature has improved. My body temperature would average around 97 degrees, and the last time it was checked by medical professional a little less than a month ago, it was 98.8 degrees. My body temperature hadn't been in the normal range for years. My hair has been shedding less also. I believe this supplement works. I am waiting to experience the weight loss benefits. I just started a low carbohydrate, so hopefully I'll start losing some weight soon.
 This product has proven to be the most effective in getting my cycle back on track! I had a thyroidectomy over two years ago, and six months ago my cycle got wayyyyy off track. There is nothing wrong with my lady parts, my thyroid levels were showing to be more on the hyperthroidism side, and I refuse to take birth control ever again. This was my last resort, and I am so thankful for the many reviews on this product that helped me choose this product. It is actually the only product that has everything that I need (with the exception of Magnesium and B6) to keep my body on track.<br/><br/>There were a few times over the last month that I took this pill and it made me sick because of not having enough food in my stomach. I highly suggest taking these with a good solid meal. I am not sure how these will fair for me when I do my candida detox/diet. That's why I am rating it only 4 stars instead of 5.
 This product is amazing! My thyroid is in normal range, but my T3 is a little low, so my dr recommended a supplement. However, I don't think I realized it until I ran completely out of the thyroid support and didn't have any energy, how great it is! I love it!
 This was my second purchase of this product.  I have been able to replace synthetic thyroid medications with this supplement and get the same results.  I feel so much better !! I am very excited to have taken a leap of faith and get off the meds !!!
 I used to barely wake up after full night of sleep hoping i could stay in bed, when i finally got up i was slow and foggy, after taking these i can finally function like a normal human being, do things without wishing i was in bed. I dont experience any side effects its all smooth.If youre tired of being tired do yourself a favor and give it a try.
 Feeling positive and have increased energy.  I take the Adrenal supplement along with the Thyroid, separately, one in the AM the other in the PM.  So far so good!
 Bought for my daughter who was having major difficulties concentrating in college. She has been very sluggish, especially in the mornings. We have a family history of thyroid disorders. This Thyroid support really helps her. She takes every morning. She even notices if she misses a day! This really works!
 Hello after one week of using this product I have to say I am very very happy. I had been sluggish and just not feeling like doing anything really for the past year.  I turned 55  last year and was aware that my body was definitely going through changes. I started by taking one tablet in the morning and one in the evening. After three days I noticed a mild metallic taste in my mouth. So I drink more water I no longer have the metallic taste. I was very hopeful about this product as I had been about other products and they never seem to work. This one is working for me hallelujah! I heard people use the term brain fog before. I wasn't quite sure if that was what I was experiencing. But now that the fog has lifted I can see that was definitely what I've been going through. Needing way too much sleep and not feeling like doing much. Everything was seeming to become more of an effort. Pretty much right away I noticed I began to accomplish more tasks each day. As a matter of fact on the 2nd day I did a yoga class on YouTube. This morning by 10 o'clock I have already cleaned the house. Yesterday I cleaned my backyard. And when I talk about energy it's normal energy not jitters or shakes purely normal energy that I'm feeling. Although my weight hasn't changed by much one or two pounds I FEEL like I weigh less which is great. I hope this works for you too.
 Great product.  I no longer have the side effects associated with the prescription drug.  If thyroid function checks out good on next doctor visit I will continue taking it.  Energy level has increased significantly with the taking of this drug.
 I take one 1 Body Thyroid Support daily, along with one 1 Body Adrenal Support and have noticed a difference in my energy levels. My thyroid was removed following  a thyroid cancer diagnosis and I am now hypothyroid,  so I appreciate the extra support of these supplements, along with levothyroxine, to keep me going.
 BECAREFUL! I have been taking this religiously for about 1 month.  I also am taking levothyroxine to treat my hypothyroidism and experienced worsening lethargy.  I went to see my endocrinologist and he said that iodine content in this supplement tips your iodine balance off the scale which weakens your thyroid function. He told me to stop taking this asap.  I figured other people deserve to know.
 I bought my first bottle of Thyroid Support about two months ago and I feel like I am so much more energized now. Just had my thyroid numbers checked again last week and all were well within the normal range. I was delighted! I began the monthly prescription program so I would not forget to keep this wonderful product on hand. I prefer natural remedies to prescription medications
 This is really a great product.  I lost 15 lbs without dietting, or exercise, bc I can't exercise, I'm handicapped. This is my second bottle, so I greatly recommend this.
 i HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS NOW AND I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I FEEL BETTER, MORE ENERGY AND LESS SLEEPY. I TAKE IT ALONG WITH MY NORMAL THYROID AS PRESCRIBED BUT THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY HELPED ME OUT OF EVERYTHING ELSE I HAVE TRIED. FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS WHO SUFFER FROM HASHIMOTO THYROIDITIS THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT SUPPLEMENT. ALWAYS CLEAR WITH YOUR DR FIRST.
 Hi,<br/><br/>Due to an inability to lose weight, rigid nails, a sensitivity to cold, I decided to look for a product which would solve these issues. With the purchase of this product, I have gained so much energy that I could lose five pounds. Thank you.
 I didn't realize how crap I was feeling until I started 1 Body thryroid and adrenal support. I was so foggy and tired all the time. The only issue I have with this patricular product is that it makes me nauseated. I think I probably need to eat a bit more before and after.
 Before I started it I was struggling with cold sensitivity, energy and bowel sluggishness. I take medication but it isn’t enough and my doctor wouldn’t increase my dosage. This is the next best thing.
 I bought this product hoping it would work and it did. I bought it because my hair had started to fall out and this product has stopped that from happening. Even though it states curved appetite and energy boost, that has not occurred with me. I am still very satisfied with my purchase and will be ordering it again. Don't hesitate to buy!
 So far this is great.  I'm hoping to provide an update after I have taken it for a month.  I also purchased the Liver Support.  I am hoping to improve my energy.  I have been on the same Thyroid medicine for the last 19 years.  I've gotten to where I'm tired and can't sleep at night.  I want my energy back.  I've reviewed so many different types of Thyroid Supplements and 1 Body seemed to have the best results from other customers.  Although there are some folks who it might not work for, not everyone has the same results.  We'll see how it goes after a month.
 I tried to like this because I really like the listed ingredients, but taking justone pill a day put my stomach in knots. I switched from taking this in the morning with breakfast, to lunch because it is usually a larger meal for me. No luck. My stomach was cramping every time. I gave it a fair shot, but if you have a sensitive stomach, this is not for you.
 I've been using this product for half a year and it's working beautifully for me. My energy levels are great. I've been losing weight steadily. I feel my metabolism is speeding up like my youthful days. My doctor says my recent blood test shows normal across the board. This product came recommended by my doctor to keep my hormones balanced.
 I feel a difference after taking this for two weeks. My energy seems to have increased and my moods feel more balance.
 Great product. I have more natural energy and work out much better when using this brand of thyroid support. I eat much better as well. Felling pretty good and will continue to use.<br/>I have used other brands in the past without the results! Very satisfied with this product.
 I could not be happier with this product. It helps me with my energy, my mental clarity is better, and I just feel a lot better. I am so thankful to have found something that works. I will definitely keep buying these supplements. Having Hypothyroidism sucks already but then you get the side effects from the Synthroid pill on top of that and it makes it so much worse. These supplements have really helped me a lot and have taken away a lot of the harder to live with side effects such as the dizziness and the vertigo and such. I am just so thankful for this product.
 I have only been taking this for a short time. I have not noticed dramatic differences, but I have noticed subtle ones. I have started off slow and only take 1 in the morning. I am thinking about increasing this to 2 a day. I do feel like I have a little more energy, and I am not getting as many muscle aches as I have previously. I do not have any side effects at all, except when I was taking it at night, I seemed to not sleep well. I somehow feel as if my body is sucking this in like a sponge. My tsh and t4 have always been considered normal, but I have goiters. I will be getting another blood test and thyroid ultrasound in December. I am hoping for improvements.
 I have lost 7 pounds in 15 days with no change in diet. I highly recommend this product.
 So far I've only noticed a significant amount of energy. Not too much but more than needed to get motivated. Also noticed a decline in brain fog and that I'm much more alert. Since taking this product my feet are also not swollen anymore. I used to take Logol' s iodine 2% for the swelling but this seems to work just as well.  There is also an increase in my metabolism which I'm not so sure about as it makes me eat more.  There is zero weight loss however, but then again on the plus side there is no weight gain either. Overall great product, just wish it would help with weight loss.
 Since taking this product,  I've had increased energy, and can think much clearer,  goodbye brain fog!!
 My "brain fog" went away after about a week I feel that my clarity and focus are a lot bette plus what others mention a noticeable increase in energy levels. Also... I noticed better sleep at night, not sure if its because I have more energy during the day and get more done and I'm just tired at night or if the supplement helps to relax and getter a better rest.
 I would recommend to anyone with low thyroid ( I’m not taking any prescriptions for my thyroid). I started noticing a small change in 3 days, I took 1x a day for 5 days then went up to 2x a day. No more brain fog more energy ( before I was completely drained zero energy)and I feel normal! I will be ordering more for sure, if you are on the fence about ordering I would suggest you give it a try!
 I am not feeling as hot and sweaty and I was before.  I think this supplement has helped.
 I have been using this product for a few months it’s a good product.  I feel much better, I have more energy and I can focus better!  I will continue to buy this product!
 I've only been taking this a few weeks.  I haven't had the insomnia I usually have and my energy and mood feel more even, instead of the wild fluctuations I usually have.  I will leave another review later after having more time to fully experience this supplement.
 From Spring of 2015 to August of 2016 my 12/13 year old daughter's Thyroid numbers were out of whack and her doctor was talking about putting her on medication.  I am blessed to have a doctor that is willing to be patient while trying to find other things to avoid going on meds, even though meds with insurance probably is cheaper for us. Now I have to say something here which most of you who read this will think I am weird.  We were praying about what to do for my daughter.  I am always leary of "supplements" because I always think it is a "get rich scheme" for a company.  In fact the first company I ordered from was a quack.  That is why I like going through Amazon.  The high number of reviews drew me to this product.  So putting faith in God to direct us to the right solution for my daughter, I ordered this product.  She has been taking it pretty consistantly since September.  She lost 10 pounds with I believe this product and portion control but honestly not a lot of exercise.  Today the doctor called and told us that her Thyroid numbers were normal.  We are giving God the glory for this and using this product as an instrument for this situation in my daughter's life.
 True to be told, I'll try anything at least once. Every body is diferent.  Even if I read great reviews about a supplement, I try to focus in how I feel and how the supplents help (or not) my specif situation. Of course I pay attention to the benefit trends that people post in ther reviews, but do not take any product expecting instaneous or wonderous results. Just because something does not work for me it doesn't mean it does not work for someone else, but after a long search and years of struggling with thyroid issues, I think I found something that helps me.  It took two weeks to notice any change, but so far there is big improvement on my energy levels and sleep patterns (Insomnia is a big issue for me) and sugar cravings have decreased substantially . So if I am more active and my sugar intake is low, weight seems to be going down. However, I did notice more constant headaches. Not sure yet if they are related, so i will have to monitor this part. Overall, I decided to continue with this supplements for another month, I'll post any new findings after this.
 I have been taking this product for about two weeks and from the very first day I started to consume this product I have noticed a dramatic change.I have tons of energy, my hair is shiny and not falling out, my joints don't ache.....if you are hypothyroid you know this a a big deal. After only 3 days of taking Thyroid Support, I felt super-charged.
 I have used this product for a month so there hasn't been enough time to see what it will really do for me in the long run, but I actually believe the change I see in me so far is that I seem to have more energy and not so moody.  I don't suffer from intense mood changes, but they are very subtle, and this product seems to have helped in this area for me.  One day I just noticed that I haven't suffered from these the way I normally do and I haven't changed anything in my diet.  I will be willing to place another review after 3-6 months but so far, so good.
 My Dr. started decreasing my thyroid medication so that my TSH would be in "standard" range. So then I started getting my old symptoms back; dry skin, foggy memory, hair falling out, etc. She wouldn't increase my levothyroxine so I started taking Thyroid Support. I finally am starting to feel like myself again; no foggy memory, dry skin, tiredness, hair falling out, etc. I love this product; I sure hope it continues to work and my body doesn't start to "get use to it" and require added support
 It is  still early on  in the game; but, after 15 days I feel like my energy level has increased  and overall I feel  better. I have hashimoto thyroiditis and struggle with fatigue among many other things, and was looking for a natural way to help me. Along with taking  my prescribed medication I added the 1-body Thyroid Support and have  noticed an improvement since adding this to my regimen. Anyone who suffers from Hashimoto knows that even a little improvement feels like a big improvement with this sometimes very  frustrating disease. So I will take the win.
 I am soo happy that I've purchased this supplement! I have been taking this supplement for a week and I noticed a difference after 1 day. I haven't had any energy for years. I've felt like a zombie for some time even with 8 hours of sleep. Now I feel alive! I have soo much energy when I awaken from sleep. My co-workers are even impressed with my energy level. They told me to continue to take whatever I am taking. I will definitely be a regular customer!
 Was taking a supplement from New Zealand that had powderized glands from cows but became very frustrated with how unreliable getting the product had become.  When you are taking hormones it's very important to take them DAILY as prescribed.  (Not to mention the cost) I had even stockpiled extra backups but got angry  over the process.  So the new approach is getting my thyroid to do what it's suppose to.  Taking your Thyroid Support product seems to be doing the trick.  In a couple of months I will have my thyroid tested to confirm what I feel is in fact true.
 May be too early to say, but i think it helps. I feel more energy and less foggy during the day. My mood improves, less mood swings prompted by unhealthy thyroid. I selected it because there is no 'herbal hormones' such as black cohosh, so it feels safe to take.
 I've been having problems with my thyroid function for over a year. My doctors did not think it warranted thyroid medication. I was tired all the time and rapidly gaining weight. To top it off, I had no energy to exercise and was becoming depressed. Since I've been on Thyroid Support my metabolism is increasing and my energy level is improving. I've even lost 5 pounds. I couldn't be happier with the results so far.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism around 15 years ago. Since my diagnosis, I have been prescribed increasing dosages of Synthroid. For the last 2 months I have been totally off of Synthroid and feeling progressively worse. Lack of energy, major brain fog and loss of memory are just a few of my symptoms. Since starting Thyroid Support I have experienced some alleviation of these symptoms. I realize that this product is not a total replacement for medication and that I have only been using it for a few weeks, but I am delighted that I have experienced a marked improvement in how I feel.
 I've just felt more energy lately. I've never been tested but it's like I have "mild" hypothryoidism symptoms and have been struggling with them for the last few years. I feel like my thyroid has needed a "kick" and maybe not full on conventional medical treatment. I have more energy through the days and my mood is more at a baseline.
 I bought this for my husband. He has been taking it for 20 days now and not only is he noticing a difference, but I am, too. He's feeling better, has more energy than before (especially noticeable at the end of the day), and his mood is better. Three people that he sees on a weekly basis said he looks younger and more rested! I'm so glad he's feeling more like himself. He will continue to take this. Thank you for a great product!
 Definitely helped with energy levels,  I don't feel like I need a nap everyday. Curbs craving, especially sugar.  Don't have the brain fog that I normally have. I have taken many thyroid support supplements over the years and I have noticed the biggest difference with this one.
 I like this product because it gave me the extra boost of energy. It didn't make me feel jittery. I took it with along with my thyroid medication. It seemed to work better than increase in my thyroid medication.  Each person may have different results. I can only speak for myself. It is a wonderful product.
 I have lost weight and have so much more energy!
 I have been taking this product for about a week now and honestly, I have to say that I have noticed some positive results. I have noticeably been able to sleep better and deeper, feeling a little more relaxed and less fatigued. I have not noticed anything of the other benefits which this product claims yet, like improvement on my skin and weight loss, but then again, I am only using it for a week now, so maybe it will take some time to be effective in these areas.<br/>The delivery by the seller was quick and on time. Overall, up until now..I am very satisfied with the product.
 The product I received doesn't have METHLYCOBALAMIN as the form of vitamin B12.
 Just started my third week and just started noticing marketable improvement. Given that I'm at the phase of my menses where I typically drag with energy and pep, I feel energetic and upbeat, silencing my usual hormonal issues. I'm very pleased and will continue to use this product. I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because I want to ensure the continued use proves beneficial with results.<br/><br/>Update: After using 2 months I have lost weight, much leaner, have more energy and consistent moods. I've sent some to my mom to try. I am very pleased and highly recommend!
 I gave it 4 stars because I like the formula but I'm not sure I'm feeling or seeing any differences just yet.  I understand changes, that come naturally, take a couple of months... so I'm being patient.  I'm in the middle of my 2nd month.
 I took it at it said to, I started taking this bc I read about how it helped other women having issues with thinning hair, low energy, and helping curb hunger - and it has help with all of these things - and I have ordered another bottle !
 I feel like my old self.  My brain fog is going away.  My thyroid tested "fine." I had it tested mutliple times and it was always within multiple limits.  I took a chance and started this supplement.  I feel so much better.
 I am so thankful for this supplement.  I was so low energy before and always craving junk food in hopes of feeling an energy burst.  Since starting these I feel so much better and it has only been a couple of weeks.  Will be buying again!!
 I can honestly say that after taking 1body thyroid  for the past two weeks I've begun to feel once again like myself.  I have been treated for hypothyroid disorder for thirteen years. I have experienced hair loss as well as indescribable feelings even when lab testings would indicate that my levels were good.  My hopes are that as I continue to use this product that I will begin to see hair growth as well as a continuance of the feeling of normality, in my  overall being.
 I was only using this product for a few weeks before I had to stop taking it for a week per pre-surgery instructions.  That week was difficult because fatigue set in very quickly.  I started it again the day after surgery and I feel great...the fatigue is almost gone.  I think this was a good test, and it seems to work for me.
 I feel very healthy, however because I take so many supplements, It's difficult to give full credit to any single product. What I am sure of is the company's excellent customer service and how involved they are with their customers. I will continue to purchase from 1 Body.
 Just finished my first bottle.  I take thyroid medication daily since I had a thyroidectomy almost 10 years ago. I've been eating low carb and exercising, yet I hit a plateau.  In the month of taking thyroid support I finally got over the plateau and lost a couple of pounds!  I think it definitely helped because I've been stuck for a few months now.
 Just received this product and have only been using a short while, but I felt motivated to submit a review. This company included a coupon for a FREE bottle of what I just ordered, no string attached. I think this is wonderful marketing and a great way to promote one's product.<br/>I will follow up after a few more weeks of using the product to give my opinion as to it's efficacy.
 I can't speak to long-term results yet, but I am encouraged so far.  I can definitely tell a difference in my energy/mood on the days that I take this.  I was worried that it might inhibit my ability to sleep but that hasn't been the case at all.  I'm hopeful that it will have a positive impact on hair growth.  I have been on levothyroxine for 9 years and my TSH stays in a very healthy range.  In spite of this, I still deal with Hashimoto's symptoms like low energy, hair loss, senstivity to cold and GI issues.  After reading all the positive reviews of Thyroid Support, I decided to add it to my wellness regimen.  I will keep taking it and will update my review later.
 My thyroid tests always came back "normal"  but for the past 3 years I have had all the classic symptoms....I' ve been taking this for a few weeks and can't say enough good things.  As a mother of 6 I am busy!  I now have energy to keep up and do projects I'd been putting off. My hands are no longer cold. My bowel movements are great. I no longer ache. My cycle came and went without all the pms junk.  Never want to be without!!
 Just had my TSH checked and numbers are down slightly from last test (I also take Levothyroxine). Not sure the script was working as well as it should related to T3 levels and saw recommendations for zinc/selenium to assist. Also - did make me a little nauseated at first - definitely take with food (something over 300 kcals at least) to avoid nausea. Nausea only happened first 2-3 doses though (I am 5'3" and 117 lbs so also only taking 1 instead of 2/day).  Been taking with lunch for 3 weeks and no stomach sickness since so something in it definitely requires a few days to acclimate.
 I believe this is a great addition to my daily dose of synthroid.  I believe it gives me more energy and gives me an overall better feeling.  I will probably continue to take Thyroid Support and hopefully it will improve some more of my hypothyroidism symptoms.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism over a year ago. To treat it, my doctor suggested taking an over-the-counter supplement before we try prescription medication. I found this supplement on Amazon and I am quite happy with it. I can definitely tell when I don't take it - I feel sluggish. I have been taking this product for about 6 months now and recommend it for anyone trying to avoid prescription medication to treat an underactive thyroid.
 Been using for a bottle and a half now but have not seen or felt any difference.
 Love love love. Took my numbers right where they needed to be 😍. Gives me a ton of energy.
 Increased energy levels within the first week of taking this supplement. Will continue to take this product and edit my review at a later date.
 My husband started taking this product after his doctor told him he may need to go on thyroid medication.  He has been on it for one month and is feeling much more energetic.  He feels so much better that we ordered another bottle.  We hope his blood work will show good results in a couple of months.
 It’s a great product. It puts me in a very uplifting mood. I’m not so depressed or on the negativity thinking mood. Highly recommended.
 Recommended by a naturepath. My energy level has greatly improved and is consistent all day. I also think clearer
 My Tsh levels were high. Then I  started taking thyroid support , within 2 weeks of retesting  my levels were decreased by half the original value. By the end of the third week my levels were within normal range.<br/><br/>So this product worked for me. I am glad I took the chance on it.<br/> If  you are having thyroid issues I would say to give this product a try.
 I started taking 1 pill twice a day for a week, when I took the second pill in the afternoon I noticed I would have trouble going to sleep at night so I switched to taking second pill in the evening. It has been two weeks now and I have noticed that I am more awake and have some energy. I will continue to use to see if the energy increases
 My TSH was very high, and I was feeling very tired and weak.  After I ordered my first bottle, I did not believe it would help me but I just decided to try.  After first week of taking this supplements, I started feeling much better.  After I finished two bottles, I checked my blood again and my TSH dropped to normal.  After that, I did not take supplements for about a year.  Now I decided to support my thyroid again and ordered the third bottle.  It did help me, and I also recommended this product to two of my friends who had serious thyroid issues.  They both said that they started feeling better and not as tired as before.<br/>I recommend this product to everyone who is looking for thyroid supplement.
 I am unable to take Levothyroxine due to having difficult to control blood pressure issues.  Besides  raising my blood pressure, I also had some very unpleasant side effect from the prescription.  Not knowing where to turn, I happen across this thyroid support.  So far, I have been taking this close to a year and am very pleased with the result.  This supplement has also given me an energy boost.  I have reactions to most meds and am thrilled to be using this.
 So far, I think it is helping my thyroid.  I have had my thyroid tested and I believe the results are not correct. I have a large goiter that seems to affect its functioning.  I am hopeful that this product will continue helping me manage fatigue and weight gain.
 I was borderline inhaving a low functioning thyroid and my  DR wouldn’t  do nothing since I was still in the “low normal” parameters so I felt I needed to help myself quickly and with this product I did just that. Every since Ive been taking this product I have had more energy, my muscle weakness has gone away and I’m overall in a better mood!!!
 This supplement is wonderful. I'd been experiencing very low energy for a while and wanted to give this a try to see if it would help. I hadn't realized just how tired I was and how much coffee I'd been drinking to compensate. The first day I felt so amazing I forgot to have my coffee. It's been about a week now and I'm down to about 1 cup a day. I'm going to subscribe and get this once a month. I'm really pleased with the results. Thank you!
 Got rid of the foggy brain and the tiredness that comes with having a thyroid issue.  Highly recommend to anyone having these problems while still taking levothyrozine.
 The reason I rated this as I did is because I haven't started taking it yet; however, my thyroid is causing issues and I have been sluggish and after reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to try it.  I am a caregiver and need to keep sharp<br/><br/>^^^I have been taking this for a week and had to make a change on this.  I have gotten the best sleep I have for literally months!  I don't have the mid-day crash either.  Great Product
 I absoultly love this product. I had gone to the doctor and the only thing that came back from my blood work was that my thyroid had basically stopped working.  I researched some natural products to try out before I tried prescriptions. Some of my symptoms were that I was VERY tired all the time, my focus was GONE, I lost all motivation to do much of anything because I was so tired all day. It didn't matter how much sleep I got at night, I usually woke up more tired than when I went to bed. Since I started taking this around 1.5 months ago, I have so much more energy!  After only about 4 days I could already tell a huge difference in my energy and focus levels.  I am very happy with this product and will continue to take this product! The only reason I am giving it 4 starts is the fact that is has not seemed to help my metabolism, and this may be something that takes a little longer to respond, so I'm going to give it a little longer to see about that. I am eating better and going to the gym at least 4 days a week (with a trainer) and I have not been able to lose anything (as I have before in the past).  Overall--I am VERY happy with this product and will continue to take it. Thank you 1 BODY!
 I am suffering from hypothyroidism for the last 14 years and using livothyroxine. Every time my blood reports are normal but I am still facing the sympotoms, my skin looks so rough, brittle nails and losing hair every day. But as a good luck I discuss the problem with my friend who is suffering with the same  recommended me to use this supplement as she was using it for the last few months.And she gave me her extra bottle which she had it in stock to try for few days and see the results. First I do not believe her but I was surprised to see the change just as little as in 3 days. I stated to feel the energy in me not tired at the start of the day.And my hairs stop falling in a week and my skin looks better and above all I lost  4lbs in 3 weeks. I ordered my second bottle before I finished my first bottle so that I will continue to take this."TONS OF THANKS TO ADRENAL THYROID SUPPORT " for saving peoples lives.
  It seems to be helping with my energy level as well as my overall well-being. I am looking forward to seeing the effects, after taking this product for a longer period of time. So far, its been a positive experience. Its nice to find a quality product that has all these ingredients in one capsule. 
 I liked the increase in energy I started to notice after taking two capsules daily. This product works better than the prescription I was getting fro T3-T4 from a compounding pharmacy which was not even increasing my low thyroid levels. I will continue to use this product.
 A few years ago I tried another brand of thyroid support supplements and noticed zero improvement of any kind. After a month, I gave up taking them and figured that thyroid supplements just weren't for me. Fast forward to this year when I had some blood work done and found out that I was hypothyroid and decided to once again find a supplement. This time, rather than finding the cheapest one available, I spent hours researching and reading countless reviews - and ended up settling on this one. Before even starting my thyroid medical treatment, I noticed an improvement in overall symptoms after taking Thyroid Support for just 2 weeks. More energy, fewer crashes, clearer head, basically feeling more like ME rather than the person who feels tranquilized 24/7.<br/><br/>When the bottle was empty, I figured I didn't need to continue with Thyroid Support since I was on thyroid meds -- big mistake. Only took a week to experience an overall slump. Again with the crushing fatigue, brain fog (it's like having dementia - I'm only 45 and can't think of the proper words to use, don't remember people's names, etc), and overall feeling of being drugged. Lesson learned - I purchased 2 months worth and don't plan to ever be w/out this miracle supplement ever again.<br/><br/>It's too soon to see an improvement in hair regrowth but I have hope based on what other reviewers have said.<br/><br/>If I could sum up Thyroid Support in one sentence - while taking it, I had more good days over the course of a 2-3 week period than I had over the previous 2-3 YEARS. Great stuff!!
 O was using a YL thyroid support but decided to try and find something less expensive that worked as well since I didn't want to go back on thenRx Naturthroid. I took my chance and so happy I did. Good supplement less $$ and now a coupon! Great company..thanks
 I sleep so much better than I have in years! My brain fog is non existent And I have tons of energy! I haven't lost any weight but i'm less hungry. My hair stopped falling out by the handfuls.
 Just got this product, compared it to many, this seems to be what i need for my thyroid symptoms.....will up date when feeling better....i like the fact that it doesn't contain others ingredients that i don't need....like magnesium stearate or soy....but has a all the ones needed for thyroid function....well see how it goes....
 Started taking this supplement about 2 months ago.  So far, I like it!  I decided to give it a try because my doctor showed that my thyroid function is decreasing so I thought this may help.  I haven't been back for a check up since I started taking it, but look forward to seeing if it has stabilized or had any positive affect on it.  Either way, I feel better since I started taking it.  It took a about 3-4 weeks before I noticed a difference. I'm glad I decided to give this a try; there's really no reason not to.
 I am starting my 4th month of taking Thyroid Support. I don't know if it is my imagination or desire to feel better but I actually do feel more energetic and healthier. I did not notice any difference in energy level when I first started Thyroid Support. It seems to take awhile to build up effectiveness, but after two months, I did notice some improvement in energy. I've also noticed that my hair and skin seems to have regain some of their luster and color that they had lost. I'm 66 years old and have been on Thyroid Support for 3 months now and I think that I will continue for awhile to see how it goes.
 I noticed a difference in my hair within a couple of days taking the supplement.  It was not falling out nearly as much... to which I was ecstatic!  I had been losing hair for years....even while on another brand of thyroid support.  It hasn't been quiet a month since I started the supplements, but yet I can tell a difference in my overall well-being.  I'm very excited to see what the next couple of months will tell.
 I believe this is helping taken along with my prescribed nature-throid thyroid supplement. I am doing what I can to achieve optimal health through food &amp; quality supplements when needed. There was a day I did not know I could improve my thyroid health. I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. It took many years to have an antibody test done &amp; even then I did not know what I could do besides take the awful (for me) synthetic thyroid supplement. Once I learned I could use supplements &amp; not completely destroy your thyroid it still seemed too complicated, like knowing when &amp; how much iodine. I waited before reviewing to better help people who rely on reviews. This is an area of my life that has been a long struggle, ie. sleep. energy, foggy thinking, body aches, weight gain. I am doing so much better &amp; I am not hypo. Not going to go deep into this, but sometimes tests indicate over active thyroid when the truth is the liver has not converted thyroid &amp; you still have symptoms. This supplement helps conversion. Good luck all.
 I have Hashimoto's disease. I looked forever to find a good vitamin to help support it and came across this. I've been using this for about a month now, and noticed within just a few days my energy level increased a lot!! I went in for routine blood work last week, and my TSH levels are lower than they've ever been!! I have 4 children (one is an infant) and having energy to keep up is just a wonderful blessing.  I talked my husband into trying it for a few days (he has a crazy work schedule and is up all hours of the night and day) to see how he felt.  He's hooked too. He also noticed an increase in energy and alertness right away. And he has no thyroid issues, it's just that good!
 I was taking a TON aid supplements and medicines, including T3.  When I started seeing a Functional Medicine doctor and Kinesiologist, they did muscle testing on all of it.  This was one of the few products my body liked!  Even better than the T3!  They were surprised, but told me to continue taking it - even at a little higher dose.  So glad I found something I know is working for me.
 I feel my mood is better and my energy is increased.  Having hashimotos, I kept forgetting to take my second pill at the end of the day so I don't feel I was getting the maximum benefits at first.  However, it has now become routine and I see a difference.
 While I was taking it, I felt better. Unfortunately, my specialist asked me to stop because of the iodine. I have Hashimotos and shouldn't take any suppliments with Iodine. But if you have a thyroid problem not caused by Hashimotos, I'm sure you would benefit from this, just make sure with you specialist that it's ok.
 This has helped with a lot of symptoms. I still have pretty bad fatigue but have found that I can finally get up and actually start accomplishing things. This has also helped boost my mood and mentality!
 Wanted to try a natural product to help with low thyroid and unexpectedly found it stopped my hot flashes within a week.
 Why did I buy this?---  I have all the classic symptoms of hypothyroidism and a strong family history, but not the clinical numbers needed for a diagnosis.<br/><br/>The first few days---  I tolerated it well, but found that I had uncharacteristic headaches.  I simply skipped a day and then resumed taking one capsule until I could work up to the recommended dose.  I also found that starting the day with 16 oz of water before a morning dose helped dramatically.<br/><br/>How's it going 1 month in?---  I'm slowly losing weight, a little more easily than before.  I seem to have a more energy and my digestive system is less sluggish.  I think the supplement is helping, though it could just be that I'm drinking a ton more water.<br/><br/>It's worth keeping it up a little longer to see how it plays out.
 I've been struggling with finding a doctor who will look adjust my thyroid medication claiming my levels "are in range". Finding your product and taking it for a few weeks now, has made a significant difference for me physically and mentally . In a week I could notice a boost in my energy level. I feel less bloated and even seem to have more clarity while at work.
 I really liked this product at first, but I feel like my body isn't really responding to it anymore. I'm going to give it another month or two. If it still isn't as effective I am going to try something different.
 I just started taking it so this is a trial basis as of now. If I see changes in my body I will continue with the thyroid support.  Hopefully less bruises, less dry skin and some weight loss .
 Hypothyroidism runs in our family, and my levels are at the low end of the scale.  I've been feeling sluggish, headaches and of course gaining weight.  I have a terrible time losing, and when I do lose, I can gain it back in what seems like a week. I started this product last week after my physician refused to treat me.  So far I am noticing more energy and I'm hoping to see the results keep coming.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been about 30 days now and I feel 100% better.  This is a wonderful product.  Stick it out for 30 days - you may not see results immediately!
 I have been taking synthroid for 13 years and finally decided to try something different.  I was tired of feeling sluggish all the time.  I found these on Amazon and the reviews were amazing so decided to give it a try.  I am on month 4 and feel so good.  My levels are great!!  I highly recommend this product:)
 My husband's previous bloodwork showed a thyroid problem; so he began taking 1 body thyroid support in February.  He is on auto refill through Amazon and will continue taking thyroid support as least until his next bloodwork is scheduled.  And he has lost 15 lbs since February--a good thing.
 I was exhausted all the time no matter how much sleep and losing hair so I purchased both thyroid and adrenal support after researching symptoms. It has helped me immensely with my energy levels and mood and only on week three!  I’m premenopausal and  have a high stress job so the combination has taken its toll on my body. So glad I found these products!!
 Did not notice a change.
 My wife noticed the difference in her energy levels within 3 days. She feels so much better now that she has this supplement. Thank you!
 I made the decision to stop taking my thyroid medication after experiencing some really annoying side effects long term such as deep tendon and joint pain. Since taking the 1 Body Thyroid Support I feel better off the prescribed meds than I did while on them.
 Lately I've been wondering if I might be slightly hypothyroid.  My metabolism has slowed down, I don't have the energy I'd like, and it's not always easy to concentrate like I'd like.  Figured I'd give something like this a try before going to the Dr. and going through all the tests, and possibly going on some medication the rest of my life.  Ordered this based on all the positive reviews, and I haven't been disappointed at all so far.  Only been taking it a day or two, but I already notice a difference.  I've had more energy, been more alert, my appetite is lower, and I slept much better than usual.  Considering others have said it takes up to a week or two to kick in, I'm excited to see how I feel in the weeks to come.  Hopefully this helps me lose a few pounds as well, but I'm already more than happy with my results so far.
 This product just plain works for me.
 So far I love this it’s definitely making me feel better day by day and it’s nice to feel good again and not be tired all the time! I highly recommend for a natural alternative to medication without all the terrible side effects! ❤️
 Took for a month.  Didn't feel any different.  Won't be purchasing again.
 I Feel Like Me Again!!  I have been so run down, bloated and constipated for months now.  I walk 4 miles 5 days per week and watch my diet, yet I still keep gaining weight.  My blood tests all come back normal and I started to feel depressed.  Ive been on this product only 3 days now and I'm simply amazed that I feel so much better.  My bloating is going away and all this puffiness on my thighs.  Time will tell but I will certainly buy this again.
 Great product! I knew for a while that something was "off". But since I'm in a high stress job I blamed it on that.  I noticed a HUGE difference in my memory about day 8. I was on a work trip in Mexico and all of a sudden I realized that for the first time in a VERY long time I was not struggling to find the words in my conversation.  For people that have experienced this you know exactly how frustrating that is. Highly recommend!
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for a little over 2 weeks; so far I've noticed more energy and less of the mental fog I've experienced in the past. Hopeful it'll be continue to be helpful with my 25+ year hypothyroid experience.
 Amazing product!! I feel energized with this product. I take two per day and I'm so much more active and do not have the feeling of laying on my couch when I get home from work. Thank you! I was skeptical about this working, but it does!!
 After my yearly physical my doctor took one look at my skin and told me to get my thyroid checked through blood work. My skin is always scaly and dry especially my legs and my hair has been falling out. Since taking this my hair has not been falling out and my skin is looking much better although I realize it may take more time. I’m looking forward to feeling better and already feel a huge difference!
 Hello,<br/>So far I'm very pleased with the product.  It's really a miracle!  I have been taking antidepressants on and off for 19 years and I believe I've been depressed most of my life.  I cry for no reason and it can happen anytime anyplace.  When not on meds it take so much energy to fight to try and feel "normal".  I've stopped taking the meds and have been on this for 6 days.  Not one episode and I actually feel good without feeling medicated.  I'm guessing most of my life I've been B12 deficient and not depressed. (?)<br/>I'm going to continue taking and pray to God that I'll never have to take antidepressants again.  I'm 51<br/>Thank you so much !!!
 Love this product. It has helped with my energy levels, nails, skin and focus. I have taken twice a day for nearly a month and definitely reordered so I would not run out.
 I am in my 50s and was so TIRED of being sick and tired. I never felt well and never had much energy. I was skeptical but after reading the reviews, I purchased the thyroid support and the adrenal support. I felt a difference within the first few days. I wasn’t as tired, had more energy and overall felt better.
 Everyone's system is different. I experienced heart palpitation, sleeplessnes and vomiting so I had to return the product and got a full refund.
 I've been taking this product for 3 weeks now. I noticed that it gives me more energy and able to carry on with my daily activities. It just makes me a little nauseated when I took it on an empty stomach but it went away after eating some food then drink a big glass of water. I've been on Levothyroxine for a decade now but it's giving me more unpleasant side effects. I've been looking for a good product for thyroid support and i found this Thyroid support pills from 1 Body and wish this will help me more in the long run (hoping I could decrease my Levothyroid dose to lessen some of the untoward side effects). I'm going to have my blood test in 6weeks to see if this Thyroid support will have good effect on my thyroid blood levels. I'll keep you updated later.
 This did not make any difference taking it for a full 30 days.
 This product is great and has improved my energy levels. I have had a sluggish thyroid, and tried taking Armour for a few years, but did not see a change. I just had it tested again after taking this product for a month and my thyroid levels tested normal. Doctor told me to continue taking this product. I am very pleased!
 I like this product for the stamina and energy that I maintain throughout my day... I get up with greater ease in the mornings and maintain that energy throughout my long work days. I am able to navigate the winters with more spring in my steps!
 I purchased it out of curiosity. A week after taking this product, I noticed something in my body, I don't feel always stressed and tired (as I am always working on shifts, and working on shift is very stressful), I have lots of energy, and I feel that I am getting a better sleep. Great product.
 I have been using this product for a few weeks now and feel it is a great supplement to go with my hypothyroidism medicine. I have been eating low carb, gluten free, and soy free and found the pounds started to move faster after taking this supplement. I take them after I have had breakfast and dinner and would recommend them. I feel they are specifically formulated for hypothyroidism. I would purchase this product again.
 I like that this supplement has vitamin b-12, iodine, zinc, selenium (which is good for fighting breast cancer), copper, manganese, kelp, and ashwagandha. And so many more good herbs etc. I notice a difference with this product. My son told me about 1 body and he really likes the Adrenal Support supplement. I have that as well and notice that I am calmer when I take it. Iwill continue to use them both.
 I am 66 and retired and for several years I have had no energy and no motivation.  I am rather stunned at how quickly the change in my energy has happened.  It has just been 14 days and I have begun to do things at home again, things that I had been saying I really need to do this or that.  Not saying I am running track or whatever, but I can see my way now to accomplishing my goals.
 Have only been taking this for two weeks so I can't say for sure if it is doing anything. I think the ingredients are great and am definitely going to purchase this again! I will update my review in the future after taking this for a few months.
 I've recently started having hypothyroid symptoms again...my hair was falling out like crazy. I bought this supplement to see if it'd help, so that I could void having to get an increase on my medication.  I've only been taking it for less than two weeks and my hair has already stopped falling out.  Thank God!<br/>Ps: the company sent me a really nice email because I'm on my third bottle lol.
 I have been struggling for several years with Thyroid issues. I prefer a Natural, Healthy product instead of medication. Thyroid Support has worked great for me! I feel increased Energy &amp; Balance on a daily basis. I am on my second bottle and will continue to use. I felt better after about 2 weeks of use. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a Natural Boost!!<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 Taking for 15 days now.  No positive or negative effects noticed. Need to wait another 6 weeks before repeating blood test to see if this product seems to boost my borderline low thyroid level
 I've been taking this supplement got only a couple of days and had seen great results. I use this supplement to repair my thyroid while also taking in 5-http and L-Tyrosine for an increase in natural dopamine and serotonin levels. In the last year and a half I've been trying ECA which depleted my dopamine levels and messed with my thyroid and ever since felt depressed and sluggish. Just within the first day I noticed results, my mood was much better and I slept great.
 I had recently been diagnosed with a thyroid condition (hypo). The doctor suggest a thyroid supplement with Selenium, Zinc and Iodine along with my Rx. I tried a few different brands, but unfortunately had some sort of reaction to them, something in them. This was the first one that i didn't have any issues tolerating and i feel GREAT! Much more energy. I feel so much better.
 I've taken it for 16 days straight, once in the morning, once at night, and it hasn't helped much with my physical symptoms, but I feel a lot better.  I'm hoping after a full month it'll start to kick in more and help more with my skin and dark under eye circles like other thyroid supplements have in the past.  But like I said, I feel a lot better in general with this and some other vitamins I began taking around the same time, so I have high hopes about at least finishing the bottle and having some more improvements.
 I started taking this product because my energy level had dropped and I suspected a thyroid issue since that runs in my family.  I've only been taking it for a few weeks, but I feel an increase in energy.  I can't wait to see continued results with this product.
 I have been having issues with my numbers and they have been fluctuating my meds.  During this time I began to experience the original onset symptoms of dry skin, exhaustion, and a few others.  I began taking this and I have noticed a change.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to run a marathon, but this has improved the issues.  I will continue this in addition to my meds.  The doctor was ok with that choice too.
 A friend told me about this product..loaned me out 2 weeks worth from an extra bottlel she had with the promise of it works for me I would return those borrowed  ...I was skeptical, but decided to try it out because  I had been feelinh horrible dealing with this thyroid...it may be the iodine in the ingredient  that was exactly what I  needed I feel more balanced my focus is a bit sharper as Ive only been on it for two weeks I hope I only improve more with the longer I continue to take it.
 I love this product and would absolutely recommend.<br/>For the first time in 10 years my thyroid levels are normal again.
 This product has changed my life. I was skeptical at first that they weren't working, but after getting my blood work back this week, all of my thyroid levels are regulated. I have Hashimotos disease, and have been on 75mg of Levothyroxine for years.<br/>I have just finished 2 bottles of the supplements. I cannot say anything better about this product!<br/><br/>TRY IT!
 Amazing. I went and got my bloodwork done last August, and my TSH was 6.3 (high). i went to see an endocrinologist, and my T3 and T4 were also completely out of whack, with my thyroid being enlarged - as shown through an ultrasound. Before just sticking me on medicine, I told my doc I had just started taking this. She said to try this first as she liked the ingredients (and the right amount of iodine, not too much). I went back 2 months later, and my numbers were better. I went back last week, and all of my numbers are now within the normal ranges. I was SHOCKED. I mean, she had told me I had a thyroid disease and then just like that, nothing?! People don't believe me, but I know it was this (in addition to my healthy plant-based vegan diet). Unfortunately, this price is a little high, and I found another brand with same ingredients but half the price - so I will have to switch to that. However, this stuff really really works and is worth a shot before going on life-long thyroid medication that includes tons of other side effects.
 I think it helped support the thyroid.  I was hoping it would help my eczema.  I haven't found anything to help it.  You do get a free bottle if you fill out a form but I order for products and could only get 1 product.  I ordered 2 of these and 2 other bottles.  I just started the liver support, but I like it too.  The thyroid supplement's are easy to swallow and I hope to see results soon.
 I have to take sythroid 100 much daily for over 16 years. Even I take sythroid everyday, my energy is always low... I try the Thyroid support about 2 weeks (still have my sythroid daily) and I feel the BIG difference. My mom has hypothyroid function for over 30 years, she also feels that her body is not that heavy anymore. I think every person who has the hypothyroid function will know what is mean the "heaviness" of your body. Finally, I feel more energy now!!
 I have been researching for about six months in 2015 on an alternative way to increase my thyroid, without taking my medication.  After reading all the excellent reviews of Thyroid Support, aside from doing research on my own, I finally decided to order Thyroid Support in December 2015.  After taking it for three days, I notice a real improvement in my my energy level from morning till night. Since then, I have been taking it every morning before breakfast, and of course, I have stopped taking my medication entirely since then. Further I have recommended to all my friends, with low thyroid, to buy and take Thyroid Support Supplement.
 I feel a difference in my metabolic system by taking this in conjunction with my natural thyroid tablets. When I run out of thyroid this product continues to keep my thyroid functioning at a good level. I also take it with the Adrenal Support which also helps very much. I have had a thyroid disease since I was 14, it runs in my family.
 fast service.seems to give me more energy. wanted to treat not only my T4 levels but T3 I am 70 years old and need all the help I can get. Already take synthroid but that doesnt work on T 3. I do feel more energetic .
 Started taking thyroid support after neurologist ran tests and showed a thyroid imbalance.  I think it is working, but I have not had the follow up blood tests yet.
 I've ordered this supplement several times which is more than I can say for any other thyroid supplements I've tried.  Works best for me when taken twice daily.
 Great product! I have seemed to always have a sluggish thyroid, yet doctors can't determine that through bloodwork. Lately I was feeling very sluggish and unmotivated. I am very in tune with my body and decided that I would give this product a try. Within the first couple days I had much more energy and was less hungry. I now have the energy to excercise a couple hours per day just fine and am sleeing better. And am losing weight. I am definitely working hard to lose the weight but this supplement has been very helpful. Would highly recommend for people with hypothyroid symptoms.
 I ordered this product after reading the many positive reviews. I was previously taking Thyrosense and thought I'd give this a try. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work well for me (I took 1 capsule / day for 9 days and experienced tightening in my throat, I think due to the iodine, which is only 150 mcg but another product I take also has iodine in same amount). Anyway, I will switch back to Thyrosense as it seems to work better for me. Everything related to this product for shipping and receiving the free booklet via email was top notch!
 I've been taking this about 3 months now and it definitely seems to help.  My mind is clearer, I sleep better, and I wake up better.  I took the bottle to my doctor to let him know that I was taking it regularly and he didn't have any concerns about though he was skeptical about whether it would really help.  It definitely does though.  There are other products that work just as well that are a little cheaper but when I tried one I found that the pill was larger and less comfortable to swallow so I switched back.  The only downside with this and other products like it is the upset belly if you take it on an empty stomach.  It doesn't last long but it makes it feel like you just ate a hot pepper.  Since there is Cayenne in the pill, that's probably exactly what it is.
 I have always struggled with thyroid issues. I find I feel my thyroid functions better while taking Thyroid Support. I feel less tired, sluggish and  eczema has improved
 I have been taking this product for just under one month and I can already see changes. I have more energy to chase my toddler around than I have in so quite some time. I'm not crashing for afternoon naps. I am FINALLY losing some weight and I just feel better. If you think you have thyroid issues or have even tested "normal" and still feel bad, TRY THIS!
 I have been using the product since March 2016. It works wonderfully!!  I haven't had any of the problems caused by the thyroid condition since stated the product.  I do not take prescriptions for hypothyroidism.  I only use Thyroid Support, other supplements, eat right, and exercise.
 Along with doctor's prescribed medication, 1 Body Thyroid Support has help me get my hypothyroidism levels back to normal.  It's a great product, with no side effects.
 So far so good however it has only been a week that I have taken this.  I opted to take one in the morning and one with lunch, as B vitamins in some people don't work well at night.  I have not encountered any nausea or unpleasant feelings taking them; I do take them with food.  The past few days it does seem like I have more energy and feel better when I wake up.  I plan on providing an update after approx. a month of taking this.
 I have been taking this just over a week, but I do feel subtle changes.  I take levothyroxine, and I do not intend to stop.  However, when the drugstore gives me a different generic every month, I do feel the differences.  Thought I would try this to smooth out the changes.  Seems to work well.  It has already gotten rid of the tell-tale internal earthquake that indicates something new has been introduced.  Thanks for "support."
 This product works great! You need to stick with it for a few weeks. Over time you’ll start noticing a difference. I noticed I wasn’t feeling so cold all the time. I would be freezing all the time. Noticed a change in my appetite I’m Not starving all the time. I’m not losing as much hair as before. Also not feeling exhausted all the time.
 Husband was the first to notice that i have more energy. I am 70, work full time and was finding myself always tired and just didnt want to do anything. My doc always said my levels were within norms but i always wondered if i was on the LOWER end of what they considered as norm. I will say i have been forgetting to take my evening capsule but take the morning one faithfully. Going be sure to take the evening one as well!
 So far so good! I am supporting my Thyroid to counteract radiation from x-rays and CT scans, so I hope it helps.<br/><br/>Great price and quick shipping!
 Mood has stabilized and energy is up once more. Still waiting to see if it helps my dry skin.
 I measured borderline TSH numbers indicating hypothyroidism the last time I went to the doctor. I'll be returning for follow-up bloodwork soon, and I've been using this product in addition to making a few other changes (I'm diversifying my exercise routine and limiting dairy, wheat, and sugar) to see if I can alter the numbers without going on medication. I'm not sure what the outcome will be, but I'm hoping the results will reflect how I feel. Since starting this product, I've definitely noticed some positive effects; most importantly an increase in energy throughout the day, and I'm just generally feeling and sleeping better. I highly recommend this product as part of a holistic effort to manage thyroid issues. I'll continue using it, for sure!
 I highly recommend this product.  I was feeling very sluggish and had no energy.  There is a history of thyroid problems in my family. I read the reviews and tried to try this product.  I noticed a difference in a matter of days.  My energy has returned and I am sleeping through the night.  I hope this product works as well for you as it has for me.
 Love having everything I need for my thyroid in one bottle, saves money and less pills to take.
 More energy, clearer thinking, better overall attitude. Its helping me and I have already recommended it to others. I think its a really good sound product!
 So far after taking for just over 15 days I'm wanting to continue for at least another month. This product gives me energy and 1 of the ingredients, Selenium, was recommended by my physician. I like natural remedies and will give this product a chance. Good price too.
 only have used for 2 weeks but i can slowly see a change in my energy when i get up for work and its helps with my weight loss
 Only a few days in, but do feel more energy, but still slow to get moving in the morning - thought I don't think that is attributable to this supplement or anything. Just too early to tell, yet. I will try to come back to offer more when I get further along.
 I have been to the doctor several times and have been told that my thyroid is ok. I always felt alittle off and did not have a lot of energy. After researching thyroid symptoms I knew I had a lot of them and doctors still disagreed. When taking this product, I sleep much better and have a ton more energy. I absolutely love this product and feel so much better and can’t imagine not using it.
 I love this product. This will be my 2nd bottle and I can already tell a difference in myself. I actually want to ride my bike!!!!  I also do not have the brain fog I used to in the mornings. Great product!!
 Snake oil.  Saw none of the benefits listed.
 I've been taking it everyday for 2 weeks now and I can say my fatigue has been dissipating and overall I feel more energetic. With my thyroid, I've been unable to lose weight for over a year, even with healthy eating, calorie counting and exercise. I haven't seen results in weight loss with this product, but I plan to update in a month to see if it has the scale looking better as well.
 I had thyroid cancer in 2009. I am on a high dose of  synthroid which doesn't contain T-3, so I was always tired. I decided to give this product a try to improve my quality of life. So far, I do feel better. I have been on Thyroid Support for two weeks, and I can honestly say that my energy level has increased.
 I'm only taking it in the morning (1 pill) since it's a little pricey and I don't have an active thyroid problem (TSH range is normal). I just felt draggy in the morning, and it's difficult to lose weight, very difficult. On this product, I find the pounds just melt off, I have more energy, and I feel better overall (less mood swings). I think it's a combination of things (when I take this product I always get more active, eat healthier, and take better care of myself). Regardless, I really like this product and have it on auto-delivery. This is my third bottle.
 I started taking this after my labs in January revealed I have Hashimoto's. I am still waiting on an endocrinologist appointment to see if other things are going on with my thyroid besides swelling and to find out if the nodule is just a growth or worse.<br/><br/>I am currently on no prescription medications. But since taking this once a day in conjunction with a few other select vitamins, my hair loss has slowed and the energy levels while not "normal" have vastly improved. I am able to function more than I was in the beginning when I first started taking this supplement. It took a few weeks to kick in, but I have, with no change in calorie levels, lost 10 pounds. That was not why I started this, but it certainly is a nice bonus.<br/><br/>I can tell if I forget to take this medication, the headaches come roaring back that I used to have  daily for a year while trying to get a doctor to listen and test to see what was going on with me. Ordering this again, probably forever. I have noticed since being on this the swelling in my thyroid has decreased some and I no longer have the something stuck in my throat feeling. That alone is worth re-ordering this. Wonderful product, it's helping me survive until the endocrinologist appointment still many weeks away.
 Update: This stuff makes me want to puke my face of for an hour or two after I take it! What a waste of money!<br/><br/>Took my first pill this morning and about an hour after I thought I was going to barf! I got a horrible headache and super queasy, I had to lay down for about an hour and it went away.  I will try it again this evening as directed and if I don't barf, I will continue and update.<br/><br/>I also take armour thyroid, so curious if it interacts with it.
 Speedy delivery! Seller also followed up to be sure I was happy w/product.<br/><br/>So...I actually noted right away&gt; the difference in my sleep! Sleeping through the night now! Awesome! I've found that it helps if you take your second dose just before you retire for the night&gt;for a great night's sleep. :)<br/><br/>At this point still too early to give 5 stars as not really noticing the much clearer focus and energy I was hoping for&gt; at this point only slight increase in energy level. Only 1/2 way through the 30 days though, will update at end of 30 days and hopefully the stars will change to 5. :)
 I take this product every night because I know I can wake up early morning with "no fatigue". Thank you.
 After another low thyroid test and a new drug, I decided to start looking for other possible remedies beyond what my doc was prescribing.  I chose this product because contains all the recommended ingredients to treat low thyroid.  I've only been using it a month, but I feel clearer headed and less sluggish.  1 Body's customer service is excellent.  I have another month's supply on the way, gratis.  Will be interested to see my blood test results in another month.  :)
 This seems to have raised my metabolism permitting me to achieve my weight goal without starving.
 More energy and better sleep, I feel it helping me and I feel different since I started.  I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and 1Body I prefer the natural option of 1body to taking prescription medicine or hormones.
 I've only been taking this product for about a week but so far so good. I have been on thyroid meds for almost 10 years and lately started feeling lethargic and gained weight and have been unable to lose no matter how much I exercise/watch what I eat (I was down to 1000-1200 cal/day and still couldn't lose) My levels have been in the normal range so no change in meds from the doc but I knew something wasn't right. I am already feeling more energetic and have even lost a pound so I am very hopeful. I will update if anything changes.
 I Like thyroid support because it helps with my energy levels and I do not feel I have to take a nap daily. The right half of my thyroid had to be removed, I still have the left side and before surgery, my levels were good, but went low afterward and I couldn't function now with thyroid support my energy level is so much better.
 Loving this product for all kinds of reasons. Mental clarity, energy and focus are just a few. Looking forward to full balance in my life and this is one way I'm achieving that.
 I have been taking this for a couple weeks now and I must say after 2 years of struggling to get my thyroid under control I'm actually feeling a little better than I have in the whole entire time of switching meds and taking all my supplements!! I'm still taking my other sups  but added this as well. I am hoping it continues getting better and better!! Thanks for a Great product!!!
 I have noticed, my hair isn't falling out as much and when I lay down for sleep, I fall asleep instead of laying there for a while. My mood swings aren't as bad either, not as emotional.
 All my test results were coming back good and that nothing was wrong. But my body wasn’t agreeing. Took this product and it absolutely made a diffeeence immediately. It revived my energy that been gone a long time and made me have life again.
 Me comenzaron a salir moretones en los brazos y las piernas realmente no se si sera por las pastillas prefiero consultar a un medico antes de seguir ingiriendo
 I liked the subtle boost to my energy.  Did not feel "mediciny" - just a pleasant boost without side effects.  Super fast shipping and good pricing.  I would highly recommend.
 Was expecting to wait a week before noting any difference, but after 2 days, my energy level is noticeably better than I have experienced in the past 5 years on prescription thyroid drugs!  Will have to give it a month or two to see if the effect is real and will last.  None of my other drugs have been changed, so I believe this initial improvement is due to Thyroid Support.
 I have noticed that since taking 2 tablets each morning, my mood and energy has been more regulated. I also think that my sexual drive has increased. I have been taking this along with my daily prescribed estrogen and it really does seem to be helping. Looking forward to the next couple of months to see if it continues.
 I am feeling much more energized. I am not experiencing sleep deprivation as much. It has only been a half a month but i can feel the difference.
 I have Hashimoto’s and have only taken this twice both times made me extremely nauseous. I took with food and 2 hours after my prescription thyroid medication. I don’t recommend this if you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I do see a naturopath and was told not to take this.
 Great product, I feel more energetic and have lost 5 lbs without any changes in diet since I started taking this product.  I am not sure this is a typical side effect , but it is a welcome one.  Since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I have gained about 5-10 lbs so it is nice to have some of that go away.
 I've only been taking Thyroid Support for approximately one month now, and I'm quite happy with the results.  Honestly I wasn't expecting to notice anything within the first week, but I did.  Overall, I've noticed great improvement in my mental clarity and sleeping patterns.  Having an auto-immune disease has greatly impaired my sleeping leaving me groggy and unfocused thru my day, however I noticed within the first week that I was sleeping more soundly than I have in years.  I haven't been so lucky to lose any weight :) tho.  That would be a bonus.
 So far I​ have been loving how I feel after taking my thyroid support, at first I started with one pill a day for the first week and the second week increased to two pills a day. I feel that I have more energy. I plan to keep taking for a few months to see if it<br/>helps with any weight loss! Definitely the best thyroid support I have taken so far.
 I've tried several different brands. This is my favorite.
 Love this product. was having a difficult time losing weight no matter how well I ate and exercised, since I have been taking this product I have been losing weight.  I will continue taking this product and was thinking about trying the adrenal support as well.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism five years ago and taking the hormone replacement therapy until I started to feel it wasn't working. I began to feel tired, gained weight and mentally fatigued. Then I began looking for other alternatives and started to use this product. Even though it's a short time since I started using I can honestly say I feel the difference.
 It works, if you want a life style change. Its not a magic pill, you have to research your issue but adding this product to your daily routine is a must. Weight is falling off, cold hands and feet are gone. Bowl movements are more regular. Memory is slowly coming back.<br/><br/>I do not know if taking this pill and changing nothing else is the answer. I keep my intense workouts, burning about 2000 calories in one workout, eating completely different and taking this pill. My bloat face is going away. Im shocked at how much im starting to look like myself again. I put hard work into it but seeing results like i used to is making it worth it.
 I did notice a slight difference, I felt more energy and alert. I hope that if I continue to use it I will get even more of an increase in energy! I purchased about two months ago,I liked it but I went on to try another thyroid support product(that also had good reviews) but with that product I felt absolutely nothing! So I'm back and ready to continue with this product, I will update in a few months.
 I was recently diagnosed with a thyroid nodule, so I bought this because it had so many great reviews. So far, I think it's helping me because my energy level has gone way up, my hot flashes have diminished and I'm sleeping better.
 This product has worked well for me and the company has provided great customer service.  I like the mix of different ingredients available within an easy to swallow pill.
 So far so good. I have about a werk left of my current bottle..Feeling more energetic for sure..still have some off days but the last 2 have been consistent... but I also forgot to take a days dose a couple days ago... Haven't lost any lbs yet, but the energy thing is amazing and it's nice to start making it through the day without feeling completely drained at noon
 Within 1 month of taking this product, my cycle became regular and almost painless. I could cry over how this product is changing my life.

 I like the fact that this supplement is natural and in the future hope to stop taking my prescription medication of levothyroxine
 I feel a great difference in taking this supplement.  Prior to taking this, I had a difficult time swallowing some foods, and felt like my throat was closing up.  This supplement is working to neutralize my thyroid, and I no longer am experiencing that issue.
 Thyroid Support supplement has really met my expectations. I started feeling so much better after taking this supplement . I gained more energy &amp; feel much happier . I even introduce this supplement to my sister. This supplement has done for me what prescribed Armour thyroid couldn't do.<br/>I plan to continue taking Thyroid Supportt, my skin has improved &amp; my  joints are feeling so much better!<br/>Update 1/28/2017<br/>This supplement is really helping me with my health! &amp; I promise to continue if ing it ! 1 Body Customer Service is truly amazing!
 I have been taking the product for 2 weeks now. The quality of my sleep has improved. My hair is not falling as much and I have more energy throughout the day. I will continue with the product at least for the next few months as I am eager to see if there will be other positive changes with time.
 This is my first order of this product.  I looked up what top seller was on Amazon as to thyroid support supplement.  After reading the multiple revies I decided to order the product to give it a try.  I started a few days ago and noticed a noticible difference in my energy level.  I was on Synthroid medication and as I was having too many side effects to the medication I wanted to find a product which had natural ingredients.  I look forward to trying the product to see the improvement so I can continue to order the product.  I received the product quickly which is a perk to ordering on Amazon.  I am very pleased with the service and product.
 Made me feel sick.
 I just recently started taking this product.  I had surgery to remove the right side of my thyroid a year ago and have felt horrible ever since.  I was a very active person and since having the surgery, I was feeling as though I had no energy.  I started Synthroid about 5 months ago and still feel like I could fall asleep at any chance I could.  I saw this product on Amazon and figured it was worth a try....couldn't hurt, right?!?!  So I've been taking it now for about 2 weeks, I am feeling better, still not back to myself but I am not hitting snooze on my alarm clock 10 times every morning.  I will continue to take this product!
 Dont feel sluggish. Feel sore when I work out. Finally gaining muscle mass.
 Provides noticeable relief from my daily hunger-like stomach pains. Previously had CT scans and other medical diagnosis and was unable to find a cause for my very uncomfortable stomach pains I would get each morning. Used in conjunction with an improved diet and exercise, my stomach pains have diminished almost entirely.  Diet and exercise alone do not seem to remedy the pains.]
 I thought this supplement would help where my thyroid medication didn't i.e. foggy brain.  So far no changes.  I've been using it for a couple weeks.
 I have been taking one pill twice daily for one week now and I definitely have more energy. Before taking I was so exhausted by the time I got home from work I just crashed on the couch now I am able to go on a walk and get things done around the house. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
 Not only have I noticed a marked increase in my energy levels,  which is what spurred me to try the supplements in the first place, but have also noticed benefits others have noted such as decreased puffiness in face and loss of a few stubborn pounds that wouldn’t go away regardless of diet and exercise.
 I have been taking the thyroid support for over a week now and I can honestly say, I am very satisfied and happy to finally have found a supplement that helps with my fatigue and sluggish feeling. I will continue to use them to experience the other benefits of taking them as well. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who has a thyroid condition.
 This seems to be supporting our thyroid function very well. My wife and I both are enjoying a better overall feeling of well being.
 I have been told that I have low thyroid problems.  Since taking this product, I seem to be doing better. I have not had my levels tested yet . So, I can’t be 100% sure but I am feeling better.
 I bought this because I have been struggling with fatigue for years but every time I do do blood work, I am only told I am vitamin D deficient. Since I started using these over two weeks ago, I have noticed that I have more energy and I am not as lathargic. Huge plus I get to get a free bottle to continue this supplement. Will definitely purchase again.
 Love this product!  Every time I go with them my extreme hot flashes return...  This is a supplement I feel I need to keep things balanced
 I love the supplements in Thyroid Support. Prior to taking this supplement, I was purchasing some of them separately costing me more money. I like that it has the proper form of B-12 in it.
 This product states above in the description that it has the natural form of b12 (methylcobalamin)  however that is not the ingredient stated clearly on the bottle. It says cyanocobalamin which is the cheaper synthetic form of b12.<br/>I'd like to have a full refund.
 I started taking Thyroid Support after my doctor said I had underactive thyroid.  I have now taken this product for 2 months and I love it.  I have more energy, more focused and overall I feel great.  I will definitely be taking this supplement forever.
 I was taking another thyroid support before this one called thyro8. I liked it at first, but I would crash by the afternoon. But then I discovered this one on Amazon and I love it. I don't crash in the middle of the day and I'm not super tired in the morning when I wake up to where I haven't had the need to have coffee to give me that extra boost of energy. Plus I am happier. I'm definitely buying again.
 I am happy with this product. I have no side affects from taking it. I am using it in conjunction with a weight loss plan as well.
 I have experienced lots more energy since taking these pills. I also am experiencing a clear mind and better focus. I will NEVER run out of these pills. They are my magic pill! 
 I just got this product 3 days ago and have been taking it 2x a day (once with my Levothryoxine).<br/>I have been having increased energy because I have been working out and taking other supplements for Thyroid. This is a hardcore compilation of everything the Thyroid needs to function. I have been hungry less and tracking my food,but before this product I still felt hungry after meals. With this, I don't have that hunger between.<br/>I am looking forward to weight loss as well, and if the scale doesn't budge, I have the feeling my clothes are going to fit differently!!<br/>I have had slow metabolism/thyroid issues for over 2 years now and this is a godsend! ❤️
 My mood has improved since starting the thyroid support pills. I am seeing small improvements everyday. My thyroid has not been swelling as much as well.
 I  love this product. It helps me with sleep and my skin is getting better. I  feel happier and have more energy. My mood is getting better!
 I do have Macular Degeneration and that is the reason for ordering your product.  I bought it primarily for the zinc and copper.  They don't know much about MD yet, but studies have shown that copper and zinc, and a couple of other elements slow it down in some people.  The other items in your Thyroid Support vitamin can only help me in overall health.  I'm sorry for the brief statement given earlier.  I bought quite a few of your item because I have a positive attitude that it will make a difference.  And believing that, I'll be taking them the rest of my life (I'm only 69).  If you can provide more than one additional bottle since I bought so many I would appreciate it.  But do what is good for your business.<br/>Cheryl
 My rx helped me in the beginning but I was starting to feel the effects of my thyroid again, instead of taking more prescriptions I thought I would give this a shot.  I'm glad I did, it has been helping me feel a bit like my old self again.
 I have been unable to lose weight without taking drastic measures for a while now. So, even though my blood tests come back okay, I tried the thyroid support because I had all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. I started taking this product and while it's not a miracle drug, it does help me lose weight in a normal way and I can tell a difference.
 This item did nothing for me. I finished the whole bottle and instead it made me vomit and have heart palpations. It made me a jittery mess and I just thought I should share that so, people can make the proper decision in whether they should purchase this or not.
 I havent had it long to give a thorough review. I have nothing bad to say. I have noticed having more energy and all around feeling better since taking it.
 I have taken it for 3 weeks and I have alot more energy and I finally can start to work out again after my thyroid has been removed I tried alot of different herbs and different Thyroid supports but this 1 body by far the best! And it doesnt keep you awake at night which I think is awesome because you take one in the morning and one in the evening.<br/>So don't feel like crap any longer try it for yourself and you'll be glad you Did!
 Because of thyroid support I am able cut my thyroid med to half of my<br/> Dosage it has help me a lot it is a very good  supplement I use to have a lot of joint pain but I notice since I started taking it about 3 weeks my joint does not hurt as much it is not a joint  relief medication but I think my  dosage of thyroid medication was too high now that I am taking less I notice the pain is less
 After taking it for about 3 weeks, I have lost some weight and feel better. Not sure if it is this or just watching what I eat. So I want to continue to take it because something is working. Thanks!
 I purchased this for the Selenium component to aid my Thyroid supplement. I feel it has boosted my energy level in the two weeks since using the supplement.
 Yes I've had it less than a week, but for the first time in months I have slept all night for three nights in a row. If that's all it does for me I'll be happy.  No side effects other than feeling slightly light-headed for a short time after taking one. Could be my imagination. Am also on medication for low thyroid but taking this supplement did not seem to affect me at all.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and have been on medication for several years. It did not seem as if medication was doing anything as far as my loss of energy, the weight gain, the listlessness and the depression. Since beginning this over 2 weeks ago, I'm beginning to have more energy, getting more things accomplished and actually feeling better than I have in a long time. I just pray that I continue to improve.
 Been taking this for about months.  I can tell a difference now, I'm guessing that my levels were so low that it took the supplement time to get into my system. I can see new growth in my thin hair and my nails have started to grow like crazy. I also notice that I am sleeping deeper than I had been. Only negative thing I can say is that I can not take this on an empty stomach.
 I am on month two of using this product and I like it quite a bit.  It does not upset my stomach and it seems to be helping stabilize my moods.  I take it twice a day now and I can feel a difference when I miss taking the supplement for more than a day.  Great product.
 I have had thyroid issues for sometime now and have tried a variety of vitamins / medications for it. I take this supplement along with another my boyfriend has ordered for me and noticed a huge difference. I am so full of energy, where I didn't have much before. I'm really glad I decided to try this out and will definitely be making this my go-to.
 What a difference!  My doc says I don't have a thyroid problem, but after one month of taking this supplement my energy level, sleep, and even digestion has improved.  I am now a regular subscriber.
 I was taking another thyroid supplement recommended by my naturopath which is miuch more expensive.  I compared this one to the other one and it has the same ingredients, same quantities for much less.  Works well for me.
 There are not enough stars to rate this product. I really, really love it. I have thyroid issues, but not enough for a prescription. Since I started taking this supplement, I feel such a a big difference: I have more energy, and less brain fog. Even my hair has stopped falling, which are symptoms caused by thyroid issues.<br/>Can't say enough about particular brand, cause I also tried a different brand but it didn't help me at all.
 Feel more peaceful yet energetic. Took thyroid prescribed by a M.D. from age 8 to 30 then was told I didn't need it....I think I do but docs wont prescribe. This is as close as I can come to good support.
 I have been taking this for about a year now. Just realized that I have this coupon that I'd forgotten about. Works great, thank you.
 Already have more energy after just 2 weeks! I used to fall asleep at 7:30 PM because I couldn’t even keep my eyes open anymore. Now I feel like I can stay up until at least 8:30 and my eyes aren’t nearly as heavy. Definitely will continue using to see even more results!
 I've been using the supplement for a couple of weeks and feel like I have more energy. I will have my thyroid checked in another month and post back result then!
 I've been living with Hashimoto's for a few years and taking Synthroid. Even with prescription medication most of my symptoms persisted. About a month after starting Thyroid Support the lump in my throat went away. I also have more energy and am able to concentrate on tasks like I used to before being diagnosed. Since most supplements lack the minerals needed for your thyroid to thrive, this product is truly unique. Highly recommend it!
 My blood test showed sluggish thyroid issues going from T3 to T4<br/>Only been taking this product for 3 weeks.<br/>Noticed that I sleep better and need less sleep.<br/>not as tired, and wake up more refreshed. There is some change in my appetite, craving less salt and spicy foods.<br/>Hope to loose some weight in the next few weeks
 I feel less lethargic, my sweet cravings seem to be suppressed and I am starting to feel like my old, YOUNG self again. I will continue to take this provided my system does not grow immune to it. Thank you so much! 
 I feel much better and it give me more energy and I can get around much better.<br/>Great product I can only recommend this product.
 Love that it is a vegetarian product. It was shipped quickly and well packaged. After reading other reviews, i decided to give it a try. I did notice some changes while taking this for my possible thyroid issues.  Followed directions indicated. I would purchase this item again, and recommend it to a friend. Easy to take (swallow) pills.
 I have been using for two months and it appears my hair is growing again and I have more energy and getting much better sleep. I haven't done anything different so I am attributing it to the thyroid support.
 I started taking this a few weeks ago and feel much better. I have stopped snoring according to my daughter and have had more energy and not as tired. I feel my hair my vibrant, skin, and nails are better. I will see what my doctor says when I go back and check TSH levels this Monday and will follow up. I am going to continue taking this because of all the wonderful results I am feeling.
 My doctor had me on Synthroid and my thyroid levels were okay, but I didn't feel any better, so I quit taking it.  I found this product, Thyroid Support about 6 months ago, took it for 2 months and had my doctor check my thyroid again. My levels were perfect AND I felt better too! The natural stuff works guys! Good luck to everyone else trying to better themselves without harsh meds. :)
 I've been using this product  for a week now. My engery level has totally increased. I know I need to give this product a few months to tell exactly how well it's working for me. I will review again March 2017.  As a bonus 1body sent me a full size identical product FREE!
 My  nutritionist  suggested  I  take this  product  for a low  thyroid  ----
 I have more energy, sleeping so much better, not so foggy in my brain., My hair seems more silky and not falling out oh yes, I am starting to lose some weight Yay!
 I purchased this product based on the stellar reviews. My thyroid levels fluctuate, with symptoms of a sluggish metabolism.  My hope is to stay off medications by supporting my thyroid with this product.  I also chose this product over other others because it didn't contain magnesium stearate and other junk that I don't want.
 I’ve been consuming this product for close to 4 months now. It has helped me feel a lot better more energetic and with an improved mood. Overall I fully recommend this product, as a side comment the manufacturers should not put in promotions for a free bottle when they are not able to fulfill. It should be an email promo code that way it’s not deceiving customers.<br/>I will continue to purchase as it a great product.
 I feel more energized without feeling jittery. I wish it could help me balance my hormones (lose the stubborn weight, acne) though.
 This product is the best Ive had to date! I can tell a difference in my body, apetite, &amp; mood! My dr kp sayn Nothing was going on with my thyroid bit my body told me it was! Test came back normal but I was going thru menopause &amp; sleep deprived! Lathargic All the time to! I feel so much better l! I will continue this one along with the adrenaline one as well.! Happy Customer!
 I can tell a difference in this product after 6 days.  I take 2 tablets a day, started on a Wednesday and by Tuesday morning realized I was not tired.  I have not been diagnosed with Thyroid issue yet, but it Thyroid disease runs in the family.  I would rather take this supplement, than go on medicine from the doctor. I can only hope that my energy levels stay increased and get better as time goes on.  I would definitely order this product again!
 I have been taking this product for a few weeks now I have already noticed a change in the dryness of my skin. Dr. treated me for thyroid for 6 years with medication. The 7th year my numbers fell within normal range {barely} after being off meds for 6 months and changing doctors.  New Dr. will not treat with numbers in normal range. Hoping to see even more improvement and hopefully get my eyebrows back.
 It worked great.  I unfortunately tried a different brand after this one and I will be returning to this as soon as I run out.  This one works much better for me.
 It's boosting my mood and energy,not feeling lethargic any more.able to concentrate on work properly and feeling good and happy
 Haven’t noticed a huge difference yet . Possible a tad more energy and focus. It’s hard to tell because it hasn’t been that long yet. I have finished one bottle only
 Bought two bottles of the Thyroid Support through Amazon after doing some research about Thyroid supplements. I bought these based on the reviews on the increased levels of energy, how it can help our mood and focus. I liked the fact of how natural the product is.
 I was taking it for few months. But lately it has started giving me stomach distress.  I have to make sure it does not have estrogen etc, in it because not good for after menopause.  It makes me a little quesy and cannot concentrate .  Feel very uneasy.  Have tried it few times and it happens everytime.  Wonder why?
 I definitely felt an increase in energy while taking this product.  I was more focused all day at work, instead of yawning and fighting off falling asleep by lunch.
 I had constant ringing in my ears before I read that I needed to take this supplement. The ringing stopped within 4 days after I started taking this thyroid support!
 I have thyroid issues and take meds for it. I have researched alternative help and yes stumbled upon this formula. I must say i’m Impresssed. I really thought it might be some ridiculous formula but it’s actually helped. I recently had blood work and my thyroid was right in the normal range. Thank you!
 I've been taking this for a few weeks now and I feel good.  My goal is to take this for 6 months to a year and then get my T levels tested again. I'm normal high and I don't want to go over the normal levels.
 I just began taking this supplement but I've been already taking the Hair Skin &amp; Nails as well. Is it safe to be taking both supplements?
 I've only been using Thyroid Support for two weeks but am beginning to feel some movement toward more sustainable energy. It's too early to tell but I'm going to continue the use of the product. I'm excited to see what happens with longer use.
 Ok
 I took these only for one month, but I really need to buy more. While taking them, I had lots more energy and just overall felt better. I do have thyroid issues and am taking Vitamin D as well.
 I started taking these and then misplaced the bottle. Boy could I tell a difference when I started taking them again! Hugely effective! I now have more energy and am much more alert and can think clearer! I couldn't get anything done before, always tired and foggy. Now I hop up out of bed and get going hours sooner than before. Excited to have them back in my life!
 I have been trying this product for almost a month now and have noticed I am sleeping better and have more energy during the day. I was surprised by this because you just never know if these reviews are legit. I will continue to take this product and share it with thyroid doctor during my visit this week. He believes in the Medical Medium and the power of supplements. Looking forward to his opinion of this product.
 I liked the energy that I have throughout the day, the better night's rest, and the reduce stress I feel throughout the day!! Strongly recommend!
 This stuff works. I had been unable to lose weight, fletbtieed, stressed, generally crappy and this really helped me in conjunction with their adrenal supplements to feel a lot better. Try it out and you will see.
 Excellent ingredients product. I purchased for my low thyroid, based on excellent reviews. Just started taking it a few  weeks ago. I have noticed an increase in my energy &amp; have lost a few pounds too. No side effects noted. I have purchased another bottle. Hoping it will help my low thyroid &amp; give good test results at my next blood draw too!
 I am very satisfied with my purchase. I am taking both the thyroid and adrenal support together and so far I not only feel great with tons more energy, but today I stepped on the scale and I’ve lost 20 lbs!! I will definitely keep buying these products and will look into buying more. Thank you 1body!!
 I had used this product for more than a month now and i can see a direct correlation to using this product and having a painful boil near by nose...im general, when  we take certain foods which cause excessive body heat, we get these issues... i think the manufacturers need to do a proper testing on this aspect
 I just love it....I was taking another thyroid support supplement but still feeling tired.  I did a research and I came across this one.  I felt the difference right away. it gives me more energy.  Thank you
 I definitely see an improvement in my health. I feel more energized and focused. When I wake up, I don’t feel like going back to sleep. I am very happy with the results and will continue taking it.
 Improved my energy, concentration and mood. Helps me stay on track with my healthy eating/weight loss. I haven't lost weight for the last year despite diet and exercise. I lost 2 lbs. in 1 1/2 weeks since I started. I am encouraged. I had to cut down to 1 capsule in the morning, though, because I couldn't sleep at night with the 2nd capsule.
 Since taking it I am sleeping better at night. My cravings have minimized. I also noticed my hands are not as cold as they normally are.
 I’ve been running low on energy, but since taking the thyroid support I have more energy. I’ve also feel as if I’m losing weight. Glad I decided to try this product out.
 I have been taking the 1 Body Thyroid support for over a year.  When taking them regularly, I have noticed a increase in energy and managing/losing weight has never been easier.  I have tried other thyroid supplements that claim to be the best. My experience has proven 1 Body to be the best so far.. I purchased a bottle for my sister and she had good success with it, she lost about 30 lbs while taking it.<br/>In addition to offering a great product, the customer service at 1 Body is outstanding!
 I don't feel nearly as sluggish. I tend to eat a bit less and get full quicker. Long term use will determine if any health issues go away.
 Love this product it has help me sleep better as well as calmed my jitters. Very impressesed by this product
 I forgot I had this bottle and just started to take it. I have more energy throughout the day and generally feel better.
 Excellent product. My dad has suffered for years and now that he's taking this he's feeling so much better; great difference. I'm ordering right now two more bottles so that my cousin may take them for my dad in Honduras if God permits.
 I highly recommend this! I was skeptical, but this has brought back my energy levels &amp; finally feeling myself again!
 My hair has started to fall out less. I have more energy now. I even lost about 3-4 pounds. I am more active and feel less sleepy throughout the day! This is way better than my levothyroxine!!!
 I love this product. I bought it as a desperation move. I have done loads of really wacky stuff to try and feel better and have more energy. I have dieted, detoxed and cleaned. Once I even drank clay. Nothing seemed to help my crushing fatigue. Started taking this and within two days I had so much more energy. We have vitamin B deficiency in my family so maybe that was the issue. Big fan!
 I have been taking thyroid support for close to a month and am definitely noticing better energy levels.  I am sleeping better, and its easier to stay focused throughout the day.  I will definitely repurchase this!
 I am happy with the product so far, gives me more energy and no negative side effects that I can see.
 Within the first week, Thyroid Support reduced my bloating and gave me more energy... which has helped get me back into exercising. I have also noticed a significant decrease in appetite and cravings. I have a doctor's appointment next week and am excited to share my results. It's obvious I was missing crucial vitamins and nutrients that are found in this supplement.
 great product!  stopped taking my rx drug for thyroid issues and started using this instead.  bloodwork shows this is working to bring my thyroid back into the right place!
 Helped me with my energy level and helped me lose belly fat.
 Definitely see improvements in my energy level.
 I have only been taking this for a month. I added it to my daily supplements to try to treat my an autoimmune disease (vitiligo). Results take time and there is no sure all for these things. The effects are subtle but I am spending the money to continue using this supplement because I think it is a good blend for autoimmune diseases after a lot of research.
 I've had this product for over a month and I seem to be sleeping better and have lost some weight (along with watching what I eat).
 Lifesaver in my case. I struggle with severe constipation and I read that the thyroid is linked with digestive health. This product has been helping me with regular bowel movements as well as energy levels and I really can’t stress how much I appreciate this product. Don’t neglect your thyroid health.
 After testing showed my thyroid levels are low, I decided to try this Thyroid Support Supplement first, rather than just jump right into synthetic medications. Because my levels aren't dangerously low, I feel comfortable in giving this a try for several months.  I'll update this at 2-, 4- and 8-weeks. Cross your fingers.
 Extremely helpful for Hashimoto's -- a noticeable difference when not taken. Hashi's people who notice flares with increased iodine intake (search articles by Chris Kresser for more info on this) should always make sure to take selenium in conjunction with iodine/kelp -- which this supplement balances quite well. Highly recommended.
 I have increased energy and have begun to lose some weight in the first couple of weeks!  It did make me a little too energetic at night, so I had to start to take it earlier in the afternoon and that helped.  So far it's been great!
 It supplies some nutrients that I often miss.  It isn't a wonder drug but good for over the counter
 I seem to feel better, more alert and I don't have brain fog.
 Brought the Thyroid Support Supplement for my husband who told by his doctor that he has a enlarged thyroid and recommended that he remove his thyroid and take hormone supplement.  His condition is not critical - so instead of removal and hormone supplement we felt supporting the body with proper nutrients would be a better option to start - especially when doctor said once you start taking hormone supplement you need to take it for life.  I researched on what nutrients support the thyroid and 1 Body Thyroid Support has the right nutrients as listed on their product.  He just started taking the product so we will see what will be the results by the time he finish with this bottle.
 I've just started taking the Thyroid Support, which I ordered after reading the many reviews stating how much better people have felt when taking it.  I've had Hashimoto's disease for 30 years and have been prescribed levothyroxine the whole time, which does NOT do the job, but the doctors will not consider anything else.  The fatigue, the hair loss, the constant cold feeling, the brittle nails, the mental fog - I could go on and on.  The ingredients in Thyroid Support should greatly help my thyroid function better, so I'm really looking for improvement - and I'll post an update in a month or so stating the results.  1 Body has promised a free bottle for my review.
 So far I have noticed that my body temperature has risen. I am not as cold as I normally would be. Most days I feel more energetic. I will be scheduling an appt with my Dr for blood work, and I am hoping to see improvement in the numbers.
 better energy and mood improved significantly. I have had the best experience with this brand Thyroid support
 I take supplements primarily for weight training but the thyroid support adds just what I needed. Our thyroids are overworked by lack of nutrients, stress, and aging. I have so much more energy in the morning. I really do not need much pre-workout since I started the thyroid support. I will be purchasing this product every month.
 Nothing is set to work over night or with one dose. I have noticed a difference in my hair, as it is not falling out as much. My energy has increased and my sleep is a bit better. I am about halfway through, and will order another bottle and keep trying the product as I know nothing happens in the blink of an eye when it comes to the thyroid.
 I have had thyroid issues for years. Back in 2009 I had my left lobe removed (suspicious nodule) Ever since I have had periods where my energy and stamina are questionable. After taking these pills, I have definitely noticed an increase in energy. Another thing that I am not sure I can correlate to these is regularity. Love these and have already ordered another bottle!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a couple of weeks. I have definitely noticed an improvement with afternoon brain fog. I have also noticed an increase in energy and hoping this will have a positive affect on my metabolism.
 I have been on the Thyroid support for a week.  Yesterday (day 6) I woke up well rested and had more energy throughout the day.  I have been tested for thyroid issues many times, but am always boarder line.  I have been suffering from weight gain, low energy and hair loss.  I feel good again today and will continue this product.
 I wanted to try a natural form of thyroid support versus the synthetic prescription drug I'd used in the past so I ordered this product.  It's been about two weeks but already the sluggish feeling has decreased and I just feel better.  Due to have bloodwork done next week and will update with results.
 I feel so much more energetic, less tired and sleeping better! I feel like a whole new person!
 The product has made a difference quickly. The chronic fatigue aches and pains have lessened considerably. I have even been sleeping better. Feeling better.
 Taking Thyroid Support has improved  my energy level and has helped my thyroid labs to increase toward normal.
 I take Thyroid Support everyday.  I think it gives me a little more energy than just taking my thyroid medication alone.  I will continue to take Thyroid Support.
 works great, feel better and a good value. Will probably buy again and recommend to my friends.
 I have a sluggish thyroid. I'm not one for wasting money but I will try things now and then. This was a happy surprise for me. Within only a day or two, I felt my energy level go up a bit. I'm sticking with this product.
 I can tell a difference since I've started taking this product. I will continue to take and purchase again.
 Capsules are small, easy to take. I have been taking other ones I will continue to take these.
 I have noticed that I have been in a better mood with fewer to no mood swings. I also feel less hungry. I had severe heartburn for the first week, it has lessened now so I'm hoping it goes away completely. I'm very pleased with this product.
 so I've been taking these twice a day, every day for about a month now and would definitely recommend them. i have felt more energized and alert upon waking, just overall more clear headed and ready to start the day. I will for sure continue to purchase and highly recommend.
 I’m really disappointed in this product, and I had such high hopes. I have used other brands in the past, but my thyroid has been going in and out for the past few years. I take products like this during the periods that I need it.<br/><br/>I was only able to use this product for two and a half days (5 pills) before I needed to discontinue use. About an hour after taking the first pill I noticed that the one side of my jaw started really bothering me, but I sort of brushed it off. Later in the evening I could hardly open my mouth to eat because of the pain, and again I figured it was nothing. On day two the pain only got worse. The third day in the morning I had such difficulty opening my mouth due to jaw pain that I ended up calling my doctor. Due to this being literally the only thing that I’ve changed in my diet my dr told me to discontinue use immediately. Day four I woke up with a little pain but no where near the excruciating pain that I was in.<br/><br/>I suppose my body reacted poorly to this product. I’m a bit upset that I paid so much money for a product that I’m unable to use, and that put me in so much pain.
 I have had hypothyroidism for the last 20 years, I have been perscribed a hormone regulator in the past but have never been able to get quite the right dosage so I completely gave up on that sort of treatment and resorted to a more holistic approach instead. I have done a lot of research and had never come across such a well rounded product as this. I have been using it for 5 days now and I feel great! I will definately be purchasing more. Thank you!!!
 I have been taking the 1body Thyroid Support for several days and have noticed a great increase in energy and decrease in appetite and cravings.  I am feeling better and am positive that all of these benefits will continue to increase the longer I take this supplement.  I haven't noticed any negative side effects of taking this supplement, only positive effects.  I've had an underactive thyroid for at least 8 years, maybe longer, but the problems associated with underactive thyroid have only been a real problem for about 8 years, and, they were steadily getting worse as I got older.  I am 59 and was finding it impossible to lose weight.  I also have thinning hair, feel cold easily, and have had problems with my knee joints.  I work out, eat healthy...I grow most of my own food organically, and follow a healthy lifestyle, yet the weight that I gained right after my thyroid inflammation which led to a damaged thyroid, would not budge.  Fortunately, that was "only" 20 lbs., but that 20 looks and feels like a lot more on me since I am only 5'4" and small boned.  I am positive that this supplement will aid me in my quest to lose those 20 lbs without any negative effects.  I haven't been at all jittery, in fact, I have felt more calm and serene since starting the 1Body Thyroid Support supplement.  I'm thankful that this excellent product is available on Amazon!!!!
 Swelling in ankles and legs has decreased in two weeks! Feel great and no side effects!
 I felt that I had more energy after using this product.  At first I felt a bit nauseated, so I cut the dose in half after emailing the company for support.  They were very supportive and said if I continued to feel nauseated, they would gladly refund me. I tried taking one pill instead of 2, and never felt sick again.  I feel more like my younger self on this product--more energy and less moody.
 I take this in conjunction with 1.5G of Armour Thyroid for hypothyroidism. I've been hypothyroid since the age of 21 (now 30). While my levels have been stable on current dosage of medication, I am hoping to avoid having to increase my dosage in the future. I have noticed decreased appetite and more stable energy levels.
 Box states vitamin B Methylcobalamin<br/>Bottle states vitamin B Cyanocobalamin
 my doctor has me on prescription thyroid replacements, but my blood work is on the low side and I had all the symptoms of hypothyroid......I saw this product on Amazon and decided it was worth trying and I am glad I did I feel so much better since taking Thyroid Support and will take it from on!
 This is a great product ! I suffer from hypothyroidism,  a sluggish thyroid gland. I am on prescription meds for it, but was still suffering from symptoms.  This supplement has made me feel better and I have more energy.  :-)
 AMAZING. I have only been taking these for two days and I am a whole new person. I will probably update my review in about a month. So far the main thing that I've noticed is my increase in energy and my aches and pains have lessened. I was thinking of switching thyroid medicine, but I might give this a try with my current medication and see how it goes for a month or two before deciding to switch.
 I am a 36 y/o female with hypothyroid symptoms, but with normal lab results. This product didn't seem to do anything the first week I took it. Then I started to notice that I had more energy throughout the day and had less trouble remembering things. I have also lost 5 pounds since I first started taking it a month ago. Will buy again.
 About a week into taking 1 Body Thyroid Support I started losing hair on my arms and legs and developed a horrible rash on my arms and on both sides of my ribs. My arms look as if they are sunburned. Not sure if it contains something that I am allergic too but I had to stop taking them. I also have been having difficulty sleeping and when I do sleep, I wake up every couple hours no matter how exhausted I am. I feel like my energy levels are worse  than before and am still having problems with concentrating. That was the reason why I purchased them. My Doctor is giving me a referral to see a dermatologist and hopefully I will get some answers as to what is going on with my body. I would highly recommend talking to your Doctor before taking these pills...<br/>P.s. I followed the directions taking 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening. No other changes to cause my symptoms other than taking 1 Body Thyroid Support...
 This did not seem to make any difference to me, so I discontinued.  No difference then either.
 I have been taking this along with the Adrenal Support.  I have just had some blood work done to check my Thyroid and I am looking forward to seeing where I am at.  I really like the ingredients that are in both products and hope to give them another two months to get into my system and then give an update.
 It's almost been 30 days since I started taking the thyroid support. My skin has improved a lot. It felt terribly dry and irritated for several months previously. It feels more smooth and hydrated. My energy has also improved. Very pleased so far
 I have been taking it for a month or so. It's good. Some liquid thyroid support is better but it contains alcohol and not always appropriate to take it - before going to work, for example. This one doesn't have any smell so better.
 Since I've been using this product, my thyroid functions, hormone production, inflammatory responses and overall health have improved.  Highly recommend for thyroid regulation!
 I have noticed that while using this product I am experiencing more energy and less thyroid symptoms. Highly recommend to others who have an interactive thyroid.
 This product I believe helped my hair grow faster and definitely helped give me more energy overall.
 This thyroid supplement has helped to maintain energy levels throughout the day, but dosage is key. As with any supplement your mileage may vary, however, I found that an entire capsule was too much for me. A full capsule would induce swelling and tenderness in my throat that while not serious, was uncomfortable.  After comparing this product to others, I learned it's dosage contained twice the amount of Ashwagandha. Since then I've noticed a marked improvement and no swelling taking only half a capsule once a day in the morning. This experience reinforces due diligence when trying any new supplement and consulting a doctor if in doubt.
 I take just for two weeks, but feel feel better, energy and mood getting better. Recomend
 This product has provided me with more energy, better mood and appetite suppression. Overall, I feel much better. Will continue to take.
 I've been losing weight at a faster rate.  I am losing roughly two pounds a week.
 This Thyroid Support has all the right ingredients I was looking for to help with my hormone imbalance. It's been a slow process, but I have definitely taken notice to how much better I feel.
 I have not started taking it yet but my sister in law recommended it, she takes it and swears by it.  She had her thyroid removed about a year ago and she had gaines weight and lacked energy.  She claims to have a lot more energy and she has definately lost weight.
 I have been taking supplements for a little over a month now. I believe I'm noticing a difference. I am gong to continue taking it because I need good support for my thyroid. I am hoping around 6 months of taking it I will see noticeable results.
 I have researched the ingredients in this supplement and they are recommended for thyroid health.  A medical doctor advised taking a low amount of iodine with selenium.  Also, the B-12 should help with energy.  I just received it and am looking forward to  feeling better.  I have been hypothyroid for many years and  take Armour Thyroid.
 I have taking two capsules every day for approximately two weeks and a couple of days. I can already tell that my proper energy levels are coming back and I no longer feel bone-tired. I reordered my second bottle to see how I feel after 60 days.
 I think I am going to have to take this supplement a lot longer than one month. I feel better but not great. Yet. I am hopeful for this product to heal me once and for all. Thank you!
 My thyroid is borderline, but my Dr was not ready to put me on prescription medication yet. I was feeling so bad, couldn't focus, extreme exhaustion, dry skin, the list goes on and one. I started looking for a natural supplement hoping for some relief. I have definitely found it with this.  Within about 2 weeks, I noticed that I didn't seem a tired all the time. Then I realized I my head was so much clearer! It has continued to get better. I am so thankful that I found this!
 I use this product to help reduce my hypothyroid symptoms.
 This product has been helping with the symptoms of my hypothyroidism so far. I’ve been taking it for three weeks now and hoping that it continue to work and my body does not become immune to it. I am 32yo and have had hypothyroidism since I was 14. Although I take a daily prescription, certain symptoms never subside. I purchased this supplement in hopes it will help. So far so good!
 This supplement changed my day to day life for the better ... have always had thyroid issues since I was a child and my hydroids glands were always bigger than they should normally be and I accepted it and the pain that comes with it as part of me, Until I came across this supplement, I been using them for almost three months now and I’m way better than I was and with lots of energy
 I feel more energy; it seems like I'm eating less; and feel a little better all around
 Didn't notice any difference...
 I bought this product to take in conjunction with Iodine (Iodine protocol).  I have been on the protocol now for about 3 months.  I have reduced my nature throid medication while maintaining normal levels T3 and T4, as evidenced by recent lab results.  My hair, skin, and nails have improved as well as my energy level seems to improve on a daily basis.
 I just started taking the Thyroid Support Supplement, but the I want to tell you the reason I even bought it.  I come from a family of all girls (3 sisters) and of course, my mom who are all taking hypothyroid medication.  I have dodged that "bullet" all my life, but yet every once in awhile my physician says that I'm borderline at starting this medication.  I believe that this will give me the support that I need since I do have many of the symptoms that are indicative of those that are on thyroid medication.  I have high hopes for this product!
 Lots of great natural ingredients. I have been sleeping better and have noticed a difference regarding brain fog and my moods. I will purchase this again.
 I was feeling really lethargic and have had a difficult time loosing weight despite all the exercising and dieting I have been doing for the past 6 months. After a week of using Thyroid Support, the scale is finally moving and I have more energy! The "brain fog" I was experiencing has lifted as well! Great product!"
 I have had hypothyroidism for over 25 years and I have taken synthroid for it but still don't feel up to par.  After taking this for 15+ days I truly feel better.  I was about to start taking antidepressants and now I feel I no longer have to.  I have also lost a few pounds as well.  I will continue to order even after my free bottle is gone.  Thanks so much for a quality product.
 I absolutely love this supplement. I used to feel tired all the time and I have more energy after taking this. I also have lost 10 pounds and don't get as hungry so it definitely boosted my metabolism as well.
 I felt better almost right away I was less tirer and more energy.  I’m not as foggy headed as I was. I’m feeling more balanced don’t get as angry or emotional as I use to.
 I can tell a difference with less fatigue, not wanting to nap all the time. Before, cuts, scratches etc. were taking forever to heal, and now they heal more quickly.  I was losing quite a bit of hair before, and that has definitely slowed.<br/><br/>Update - my purchase was in December, before the formula change involving B12.
 I have been taking it for almost a month and think that it is doing me some good, I will continue to purchase it and use it
 I feel like it is helping to support my thyroid prescriptions and relieve  some of my severe symptoms.
 This product did not work for me.
 This is the first time I use it I, haven't finish the bottle but I have notice a lightly increase in my focus and overall energy. I will keep using it since in my lab test appeared that My thyroid is good but I take one for maintenance daily. It doesn't upset my stomach and I love the ingredients.
 My recent thyroid test came out normal even though I am weaning myself off of my thyroid medication.
 Simply put it works!  I’m amazed by the results. I was skeptical with the claims, but been using it for 4 weeks and the latest tests showed my thyroid is under control.
 Each day my energy level seems to increase. I'll continue to take the Thyroid Helpers.
 I have been more energized since I have started taking it, and I have also lost 5lbs.
 More energy for sure and I have lost 3 lbs.
 Like that it seems to help with fatigue due to auto-immune issues. Cut back to only half dosage after a few days as I felt it was too strong for me and am slowly building up to the regúlalar dose..
 I could not get through the day without this stuff. It does a better job of alleviating the issues I have with low thyroid than my actual thyroid meds do. I honestly can barely drag myself out of bed until I take this, it just lifts that fog and helps you to think clearly with an added energy boost. I forgot what "normal" felt like until I started taking this.
 I take thyroid medication, but I was still having hair loss and low energy. I started taking this about 2 weeks ago, and I no longer lose excessive hair, and my energy levels are better.  I am very pleased!
 I take just one a day with my regular synthroid to stay balanced. It's my 5th bottle, if that tells U anything.
 Since taking Thyroid Support I have more energy and I’ve been sleeping better at night!
 Before I started taking this every time I brushed my hair too much hair came out on my brush.  Since adding this supplement I am back to what I normally lost.  When I miss taking more than a couple of days it happens again so I'm convinced it has to do with taking this supplement.
 Been taking for 2 weeks and haven't noticed anything different besides gaining 3 pounds. I'm just really frusterated at this product.
 I am on my first bottle of product for Thyroid Support. I cannot tell, at this point, that anything has changed or improved, except it seems like my eyebrows are filling in. They had thinned out some, especially toward the outer part, and new eyebrows are growing in. Maybe this is connected to the product, I'm not sure. I have been applying a certain oil to them at night and maybe that is helping. My thyroid tests have always been normal, so far, but I seem to have a lower than normal body temperature, cold hands, and other symptoms of a thyroid problem, so I will try this product and hope it helps.
 My TSH, T4 and T3 are all finally balanced! I have been trying for 2 1/2 years to balance my thyroid. My naturopath is very happy that we finally got it right.
 So far so good. Ive been taking it for a couple of days havent seen mayor results. I do feel the detoxifying effects. I Feel slightly more energetic.<br/>I will update in a month or 2 , and tell you how its going. Usually my body takes longer time to adjust to things medication or vitamins
 This has really helped control the symptoms I’ve been dealing with that my regular thyroid medicine doesn’t control, especially fatigue, sweating, and hair loss.
 I’m no longer taking my synthroid medication. Since I’ve been using  the thyroid support, I feel so much better.  My hair has started to grow and has not been falling out. I can definitely tell the difference.
 I've definitely noticed an overall sense of engery and well being. My head feels clear and not as foggy. I'm going to keep taking for a while to see it's full effects.
 I am up in years and this has product has helped my thyroid work better. I take one with breakfast and one with dinner.easy to use and no side effects.
 I like this  product, I gained energy and I really lost weight
 I purchased Thyroid Support supplement for a few reasons; 1) To assist me with balancing my diet, 2) To help with my energy level, 3) To help with weight loss, and 4) To assist with hair growth and better skin. So far, I have only been on the supplements for about 2 weeks the most. However, I have noticed a change in my hair loss amount per day which in my opinion is a good thing. I still feel very tired in the mornings and generally but that could be from my lack of sleep (I have a busy work schedule). My skin so far seems to be adjusting to the supplement well. As it relates to my diet, I've noticed as of recently that I don't have the urge to eat as much as I used to so I'm hoping it's because of the supplements. I haven't lost any weight as yet, so I'm also hoping that I can see a change in this area. Like I said, I've only been on the supplements for at least 2 weeks. I am prepared to continue to see how my body will react.
 Great product, helped a lot with my stress levels &amp; deeper sleep
 So far I have noticed  o difference in any ki d of way, so I'm not sure if I wa t to order this brand again!
 I wanted a natural thyroid supplement. I am not a fan of pharmaceuticals. So far, so good! I will definitively continue to use this product!
 This product has really helped increase my energy levels and level out my mood. I feel more calm and less anxious almost immediately after I started this product. I feel fatigued if I forget to take this for a day so I think it really is helping with energy. I also appreciate that this is a vegetarian based product.
 I have been using Thyroid Support supplements for about 6 months now and feel the difference they make. I can't be without them. They keep me awake through out the day. Sometimes by afternoon time I would practically be falling asleep at my desk at work, but no matter how tired I am these keep me alert and functional.
 I just started taking this so I'm not sure if its too soon to notice any difference.  I do feel as if my mood and focus have improved.
 I bought this to support the generic synthroid I'm already taking for hypothyroidism. I feel better taking the brand name synthroid but since my insurance plan covers generics at 100% to save money I decided to try the generic. I feel ok on it but just don't have the energy I had before and often feel like I have brain fog. So I'm only a week into taking this and I am feeling  more energetic and sharper thinking at work. I take 1 mid morning and 1 before dinner. I haven't had any problem sleeping since that was a worry with the hefty B-12 amount. So I'll continue taking and hope to see more benefits in a few more weeks.
 So far so good.  I have been using Thyroid Support supplements for about two weeks now and will continue to use them to determine if they are helping with my hyperthyroidism.  As of now. I have not experienced any negative effects and I feel that it has helped out with the fatigue.
 I've been taking this for a little over two weeks and I already feel better. I have more energy all day long. I also am able to sleep though the whole night more often than not since I started taking this thyroid supplement.
 It took a couple weeks, but my sleep/wake cycles have normalized, and I feel more clear-headed than I have in a good twenty years.  I am taking a prescription thyroid medication, but still felt sluggish, and was having trouble sleeping through the night.  I'm very happy with this supplement, and the 1 Body customer service is terrific.
 If you have a medical condition, go to your doctor. This stuff made me feel sick, and too much iodine can actually kick you into a state of hypothyroid, if you're not there already and just think you are. Don't be an idiot like me, don't waste your money.
 Its a dud ! Zero ! Did not do what it claims. Messes with ones stomache.
 Great product! Wish I could take it three times a day, but I'm nervous about the extra iodine because of the warnings. When I take it my hands are actually warm for about 4 hours! Would love a version of this that doesn't have the iodine so that I could take it at lunch when the first dose wears off. Reduced my hair falling out and many dry skin bumps are gone too.
 Updated review: I have been taking this for about 2 months now and I have noticed a significant increase in energy and I have been losing weight more steadily. I think it pairs well with my diet and exercise routines. I do not feel jittery or shaky, just awake and less sluggish. What I notice more is when I DON'T take it and I feel horrible, so it is definitely having an effect on my thyroid.
 Amazing product! I have noticed a big difference in hair growth and thickness as well as overall energy levels!
 My blood tests came back with a very low thyroid count.  No wonder I had no energy. I began to do research and found this supplement on Amazon.  After taking this supplement for 3 weeks, I had another blood tests and my thyroid count came out normal.  I am so grateful.  That is why I put myself on auto ship for this product.  Thank you so much.
 I suffered from subacute thyroiditis and needed support to get back to normal. I felt better while taking this product. I didn't continue because my thyroid function improved. Additionally, I'd read taking iodine supplements over prolonged periods isn't recommended.
 Helps with restful nights and clear focus through the day.
 It is working as expected. I was previously using Iodine+2 but this seems to work just as well and is much less expensive.
 Company is very supportive in follow up. This is my 2nd week of use and I noticed a small improvement...hopefully soon I can detail more in regarding the use...I have intentions to continue at least 3-6 months to give room for notice difference on my daily basis.
 I kept reading that is was going to take YEARS before I got my energy back and my thinking straightened out.  Since I started using Thyroid Support, it has only taken a matter of a few weeks.  I love this stuff!
 I feel different when I take it.  I am hypothyroid and take NP Thyroid but I found if I take one capsule of Thyroid Support each day I feel even better! ☺️
 I am still trying to guage the effectiveness of this product. I take it daily, 2 capsules with a piece of fruit and plenty of water. I finished the first bottle and am now on the second bottle. Have not noticed much difference or lessening of my symptoms but I will finish the new bottle to see.
 So far amazing... I feel so much better about my health and well being. I feel like being on a diet as well as taking this has helped a lot.
 I'm vegan so the b12 is amazing! I feel more energized everyday and I swear I can feel my body metabolize the pill. Great product!
 Has helped keep my weight in check and my hormones balanced after the removal of half my thyroid
 I'm starting to take it slowly so that my body has time to acclimate to it- starting with half the dose for the first month to see how it makes me feel.  If the first month goes well, I plan to try the full dose in month two! I'm paying close attention to my alertness/energy, hunger, and body temperature in terms of what I'm looking to notice differences in.
 Ever since starting this product my skin has cleared up for the first time since before I was a teenager, I'm actually losing weight (-5 lbs in a month), and I, overall, have more energy and focus. The people closest to me have said that I look happier than I ever have. This product is awesome, and I definitely recommend it to anyone having thyroid issues.
 AMAZING. You feel the product working &amp; energized right after taking it. I feel great &amp; I LOVE it already. From having hypothyroidism, it has changed my mood for the better drastically. Also, the supplement is not too big, so it’s very easy to swallow &amp; digest which is another plus.<br/><br/>Highly recommend :)
 This supplement is amazing!!! I will never be without again. My labs were done and my doctor  was shocked how good I was doing.
 I have more energy.  I just feel better in the morning when I get up.  This is a great product.
 Been feeling run down, so searched the internet for likely causes (besides just getting older...).  One article talked about trying some thyroid support products... went to amazon and compared what was available and chose this one... Been very satisfied so far.  P.S. the company offered me a second bottle free (after 15 day trial).  Can't argue with that!
 Working great. Energy level is up and hair growth is excellent.
 Great combo of supplements for thyroid health! Take full dose of 2 capsules for best results.
 I've had hypothyroidism for 15 years and like many others' stories here, have struggled with the weight gain, bloating, and the chronic fatigue characteristics of this condition.  I've been taking levothyroxine at 75 mcg dose, then upped to 88 mcg about 2 years ago.  I'm nearing 50 now and had to own up to needing to make some changes to improve my health on a number of fronts.  I began taking this supplement in May of 2017.  This is the real deal, folks, a product with true efficacy.  I think everyone's experience will vary as body chemistries are unique, but in my case, I noticed the difference immediately, by the evening of the first day I started the supplement.  By the end of the first week, I honest to god felt like I had re-inhabited my 25-year old body-- I felt fantastic!  And more to the point, I still do.  I can't say whether the speed of my results were typical as I've read other's comments that it took them a couple of weeks to notice the change, but mine was nearly immediate. Moreover, I had not realized how severely I had been affected by the chronic fatigue and how adversely the fatigue has impacted my life, especially since turning 40.  I would tell myself, begrudgingly, "oh well, your middle aged now, this is what happens."  Not true!  I'm now past the 6-month mark of taking this supplement and can honestly say this product has unequivocally improved the quality of my life.  For me, the most important result was getting my energy back, but there have been other nice perks as well.  My sleep noticeably improved--much less tossing and turning and ability to sleep through the entire night without waking up.  Really good quality, restful sleep, consistently.  I don't really need to use an alarm anymore as my body has found it's own rhythm and is awake and ready to go on its own.  I've lost weight but more importantly, no longer feel constantly bloated and inflated like a balloon, the way I used to.  I'm more active, in general, because my body is metabolizing energy better and I have the mental focus and clarity to keep going when previously I would crash.  Proof is in the pudding--saw a fellow dancer in ballet class yesterday whose been gone several months--she was very complimentary about how much better I looked (loss of weight, less bloating), which made my day.  Looking better is nice, but FEELING better is why I take this.<br/><br/>So I'm finally writing this review after all this time because I wanted to share with others that this product has changed my life for the better.  Don't let hypothyroidism hijack your body--give this a try.  You'll be really glad that you did!<br/><br/>P.S.  Incidentally, at my last physical, my liver enzymes were really high.  I tried the companion product, Liver Support, for one month, retested, and my numbers were completely normal.  My doctor literally wanted to know what I was doing/taking to get results like that.  Thank you 1 Body, for making such terrific products.
 Good improvement on my energy level and balancing out my hormones throughout the day. No smell no after taste. Great amount of zinc and vitamin B as well as L-Tysorine. Comes in handy with my PCOS/PMS symptoms. Definitely going to continue purchasing. Doesn't seem to interfere with my Metformin or any other natural supplements I<br/> take on the daily.
 Works great I felt a big difference after three days and felt better each day, my body has started to slim down my urine flow have improved and feel to have more energy.
 I was taking nutracraft thyroaid for years and then the capsule appearance changed. I did not think much about it, however, after a month my symptoms reappeared, especially the hair loss which had completely stopped after I started nutracraft. I kept taking for a little over another month and it did not improve. After reading reviews and checking ingredients, I tried 1 body. 15 days in and already noticing an improvement. I am hopeful it continues.
 One Body has a great support team, but most of all they have a great product. Look at the number of supplements included, many of which I was having to buy separately. I have already noticed more energy beginning the first day I took it and no longer need an afternoon nap!
 Feel more energetic, no bad side effects.  I will know more about positive effects when I get my next blood test in a couple of months.
 I have taken it now for a month.  I do feel a little more energy, but the main thing is that my thyroid is doing much better.  I had been diagnosed with a slightly low thyroid.  I went to the doctor just a few days ago and the thyroid is reading normal now!!
 I feel energized and along with diet and exercise, I'm losing those hard to lose pounds right before my goal weight :) thank you thyroid support!!
 I have more energy and have experienced a decrease in hormonal problems that are normally exacerbated by my hypothyroidism. Great product !
 Sorry, I'm unable to give a review since I just starting to use the supplement.
 I used this for a month and lost about 7lbs. Taking this in addition to diet and exercise, with quite a few cheat days, and still lost weight! Can’t wait to get my second bottle
 I am very happy with this. I have noticed a difference in how I feel on a day-to-day basis. I was struggling with feeling tired and groggy--I have more energy throughout the day and don't desperately need a nap!!
 I have more energy, I wake up rested and Im motivated to clean my house again! I noticed a difference almost immediately-within the 1st week! I know the Lord led me to this product!!! I feel like my normal self again!
 Started using this product a month ago. My energy came back and I was able to do my chores in the evening. This motivated me to get back on my low-carb diet and start exercising. I didn't expect this product to help me lose weight, but it has given me the necessary boost to begin working out again and eating right. Losing weight as we speak. I have re-ordered again.
 I am trying alternative medicines for my thyroid condition. So far, I had 1 bottle of Thyroid Support and I feel great. I will share my experience after trying it for at least 2 more months.
 I have only been taking this for about a week, but I have already noticed a reduction in the amount of hair loss when I wash my hair. Since I also take a multi vitamin, I only take one a day instead of the two. I will update this review in a couple of weeks when I have been taking the product for longer.
 I feel I have a bit more stable energy throughout the day. I took the supplement and didn't think about if it is working or not. A few days ago I forgot to take the thyroid support supplement and it didn't come into my mind about taking it, but I was feel a bit more tired and asked myself, why am I feel tired? So I backtracked and the only thing I forgot to take was the thyroid support supplement.
 I recently started taking the thyroid support supplement a month ago. I suffer from hypothyroid and taking this supplement I have noticed a considerable change. I'm able to focus better and not feel so run down. I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue takinging it. I highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from hypothyroid. You will feel the difference!
 I sleep much better.My brain fog is non existent.And i have more energy
 I only just started taking this supplement, but it contains many of the supplements I had been taking, only in one pill—definitely makes life a bit easier!
 Felt energized again.  Will continue taking from now on.
 After being tested for thyroid and having tests come back normal i decided to try this. I had all the signs, falling asleep at 6pm, weight gain, always cold.... This product has really helped. I highly suggest, they even send an informative e- book. Takes a few a few days to see results, but huge difference.
 I have been taking g this for a few weeks and it has already helped with my fatigue and energy levels.  I have had symptoms of thyroid fir years.  Everytime I get blood work they say the same thing,  you are in the low range but never did anything about it.  So I looked into supplements.  This product had done great reviews on Amazon so I decided to order.  I am looking forward to feeling even better after taking this for a longer time.
 I am very happy to have a high quality Thyroid supplement. It is much easier than taking many other supplements to get the ingredients that I need.
 This combination of vitamins and herbals has all the things I would be taking to nurture my thyroid - I've been diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I seem to have more energy, but it may take a little more time to feel its full impact.<br/>The great thing is: 1Bodybrand gives a FREE bottle for my purchased one.(Offer was in the product box)
 I started taking it as soon as it came.<br/>I have plenty of energy now.<br/>One thing I can't take it in the evening because it keeps me up.<br/>I don't feel cold all the time so hopefully it will do a lot of good.
 I have had this product for 3 weeks now and I really like it, I'm not sure if this is a direct result but my nails have been growing very strong my hair is not thinning out as much and I feel rejuvenated. Great product.
 It is easy to swallow and it does the job.  I was trying to find something more natural to take instead of the prescription and it works just as well.
 I have been purchasing these and taking them for awhile. They've been a huge help. I don't get as tired as often, and I've even lost a few pounds.<br/><br/>I'll continue to purchase.
 My wife’s thyroid was quite swollen to where it was obvious. The doctor didn’t think anything major was wrong. After taking these pills regularly, her thyroid has went back to its normal size and she has also been shedding some pounds and minimizing her waist line with proper excerise.
 It works just as good as my thyroid medication did. If I miss a dose of Thyroid Support I start to feel sluggish and foggy. It truly helps.
 Feeling so much better on this product! FINALLY, found a product that really supports my thyroid! Best every!
 I'm just getting started and I'm looking forward to getting healthier and more balanced with my thyroid issues!! I'm feeling positive about this product so far and will certainly come back and update my review as I take this product for a longer period of time.
 I've been taking this product for over six months now, which is the minimum amount of time I feel is necessary to evaluate a supplement.  My energy levels, quality of sleep, and mood have improved noticeably since I started taking it.  I am a 55+ year-old woman, and I think many women in this age group have undiagnosed low thyroid and could benefit from this product.
 Been using thyroid support for a few weeks now and I have more energy then I have when I was taking prescription drugs for my thyroid condition.  I probably will be purchasing this again.
 A good product.  Appears to be helpful.  Thank You!!!
 Seriously I have been taking this product for 15 or 16 days now and I can seriously say that it is eliminating my carb cravings and has made me more regular. I just plain feel better. That's the only way I can explain it.
 My mood and energy has improved. I take this with the adrenal support and don't have to waste my time taking any other vitamins. Thank you!
 I have tried several different thyroid support supplements and have noticed a significant difference in how I feel. I would recommend this for anyone like myself who wants a more natural solution to thyroid issues. It's not a perfect solution but it has helped me quite a bit, I still recommend consulting with your physician.
 I have underactive thyroid. Years ago i was taking synthroid.. Became immune to it and it stopped working.. I had also stopped taking adderral.. Gained 20lbs within 2 months and very lethargic. No energy, alot of headaches . Saw this product and decided to give it a try. It put a hold in my weight gain and have more energy and Less headaches
 i find i have more engr., will continue to purchase this
 I sleep like a log since been taking this..and love the other health benefits of extra vitamins and the fact there is no magnesium stearate in processing.
 Better energy, tried another brand but going back to yours.
 Taking this to support my thyroid and shrink a goiter.  Seems to be working along with diet changes/
 I have less cravings for sugar and my energy has been more even throughout the day.  So far my weight has remained the same but I believe I will begin to lose some weight as I continue use of the product.
 Based on all the research I've done, the ratio/combination of minerals is the perfect blend needed in order to stabilize the thyroid gland. 200mg of selenium a day for 3 months should put Hashimotis into remission.
 1 Body Thyroid Support has nutrients my slow thyroid needs &amp; I feel better when taking this product!!
 MARCH 9, 2015: I have taken two capsules in the morning with my breakfast shake/vitamin routine for a couple of days and had good sustained energy throughout the day. I was running out of steam in the middle of the day or collapsing in the early evening but with this supplement that has changed. I haven't felt this good in months so I will continue taking it and report on progress either way again in a few months.<br/><br/>APRIL 21, 2015 (UPDATE): I have stopped using this because I discovered that vitamins that contain Magnesium Stearate and other similar additives (which this does) block nutrient absorption in the body. Since then I have switched to a liquid thyroid supplement that is highly effective in getting absorbed instantly.
 just started taking this product for 3-4 days and already can see a difference. My thyroid screwd me up bad for the last 3 years...I can def sleep better stay awake more without having to take a nap during the day and my focus has also improved. So far so good. will write more reviews later on in the trial. This is my first product im trying and im so happy so far and I can only thank the people that took their time to review this cause that's what I based my choice on. Peace to all and God Bless!!!
 I gave this brand a try knowing that it had a different blend with a couple less ingredients than one I was previously taking. I’m pleased to say that it is effective.
 I've yet to see any results because I have not rechecked my blood work. I'm anticipating an improvement but I can't say yet.
 I don't really feel any different but I just finished my whole30 day diet so there were a lot of changes in my diet and a lot of different things going on.  I'm going to continue taking Thyroid Support in hopes the claims will come to fruition.
 I’m always a laid back easy going person but after the second week of using this I had lost all patience with people including my wife. I don’t use any medications, drink alcohol or use drugs. So this supplement is the only possible cause. I’m sure it works well for some people but definitely not for me.
 I noticed energy returned and brain fog vanished!  Im sleeping well and more myself again!
 I was looking for an energy boost as a 51 y/o man. Vitamins and other supplements were not helping. Talking to others my age I found a lot of them were taking prescriptions for their Thyroid. I'm a fan of natural supplements, so I ordered your product instead. I have realized a nice boost in energy levels nice taking your product.
 I bought this product to help my low energy level. I do think after a few days my 3:00 slump is gone. I'm on my second bottle and will continue to use this product to help me.<br/>I have never been diagnosed with low thyroid. I'm always borderline but I have had a physician suggest I try a thyroid supplement from the health food store. Happy I followed his advice!
 This supplement does give you energy, but for me, it was a little too strong and caused a rapid heartbeat and sleeplessness.
 So far this has really made me feel better, I have a lot more energy and have been in a much better mood. I have combined this supplement with a healthy eating program and in the last 6 weeks have lost 22lbs. The first few times I took it my stomach was a little upset but I found that taking it with a meal took care of that. All and all I am very happy with this product!
 I have been taking them for several months. They are helping my thyroid levels.  I plan on continuing taking them.
 Take this to additionally support my thyroid meds.  I find that it helps a lot with mood, depression, and additional energy.
 I’ve always be borderline low. Taking thyroid was a bit too much. This supplement is just right
 I’ve been using this for 2-3 years. I just got my most recent bottle and the color of the pill has changed to white. I thought nothing of it. But something has changed because as soon as I take it, I feel nauseous and my stomach gets super bloated. I also get super hot and sweaty. The nausea lasts almost the whole day. I don’t know what happened. This is my fourth or fifth bottle, and it’s not cutting it anymore.
 I ordered it from Amazon, but the package was damaged.  The customer service was great and shipped me a new bottle right away (and it was the new vegetarian version, which is great).  I've been using it for a week now and I think just about started to kick in.  I do feel more energized.  I think I need to give the product a bit more time to really judge how it's effecting me, but the kick is enough to motivate me and order another bottle.  Also, the company gave 25% discount off the next bottle, which is great. Overall seems to be a good product.
 I have had my thyroid levels check twice now. Both times they were borderline low on the side of normal so of course my doctor wouldn't follow-up on it because it was "normal". Then I read an article on Facebook about "mom" brain and how when it extends beyond the point of your kids sleeping through the night that something else may factor into the issue. One of the culprits listed was a problem with your thyroid. That got me searching for foods to improve my thyroid levels, and then an ad popped for Thyroid Support. I was extremely skeptical about the product at first. Then I started reading the reviews. One review struck a chord with me - it sounded just like me: forgetfulness, fatigue, depressed (even with an anti-depressant). I thought what the heck - if it didn't work it looked like I could discuss my options with customer service. For me it took about a week before I noticed an increase in my energy levels, and another week be for I notice my general mood had changed and I was not so forgetful. I have been using this product for about 4 months now, and finally feel like myself again. I have recommended this product to friends and family.
 I have been using this product for over a month and really feel the difference.  I’ve got a little extra pep in my step.  Hopefully it’ll be easier to lose weight.
 I am interested to further my good experience with Thyroid Support. I only used 1 entire bottle, and I do believe that I received benefits, however subtle. What I know is that my schedule was more hectic than it had ever been in my life, and when I started taking the thyroid support-I did notice an overall uplifted feeling and energy throughout the day. I would like to isolate this supplement on some days to see if I can ascertain any more results.
 I am amazed at how much better I feel. I have more energy and best of all, my hair is not falling out anymore.
 This was for my wife and she just started taking these. She said she feels much better, such as she can get up in the morning without any issues, she sleeps better, she doesn't feel any cold on her hands and feet, her appetite is under control, her hair doesn't fall off like it used to be, and more energy during the day. She doesn't have any thyroid issues but her symptoms were clearly there. Blood works came out normal... After taking these her symptoms are all gone. I am planning to buy these for her again soon.
 Like many others, I have Hashimoto's Disease.  Nothing I did helped - no vitamins, exercise, etc. and then I stumbled upon Thyroid Support from 1 Body and decided to try it.  I'm almost 30 days into it and I've noticed a difference.  I used to come home from work at night and immediately lie down for 1 to 2 hours before getting back up to east dinner because of being so tired; I used to fall asleep at my desk at work.  Since I've started Thyroid Support I'm able to come home from work and do a chore or two before dinner.  I'm also able to be more alert at work.  Thank you 1 Body.  Please do not change anything about this product to try and make it better and do not stop making it altogether.
 Wouldn't buy these if I were you reading this.
 I have only take 1 Body Thyroid Support for one month.  I just received my 2nd bottle today, Mar. 7, 2019.  I think it will take few weeks to determine if it is helping me.  I showed it to my Naturopathic Doctor and he really liked the ingredients and recommended that I continue taking it - so I am!  Time will tell:)
 Great stuff make your thyroid work better I take a programs minerals nascent iodine B stress sea calcium n shilagic to heal thyroid n bones truly amazing at 56 I can fight auto immune diseases and have lots energy<br/>.<br/>,
 I am writing mostly about the customer service.  I really appreciate the seller checking in to see if I like the product, offering coupons, and the offer for a free bottle that comes with the first purchase.  I think it can take a while to really notice results, and I've only been taking it for a few weeks, but I do think that there has been some change in energy level, and it seems my weight has gone down a little, and I'm less inclined to engage in mindless snacking at the end of the day.  I'm not sure if those are things I should expect to be noticing by taking this, but I have noticed them all the same.  Also, my hands don't seem to get quite so frigid.  I do want to continue taking it to see if I continue to notice a change.
 Really noticed a difference when taking these. Thought maybe there would be another product out there that would give me more results, but this is the best I've tried so far.
 I haven't been using this product for that long and that is why I can't give it five stars, BUT, I feel good! I stopped taking my prescription thyroid not feeling comfortable that I was taking desiccated animal thyroid. Also, it was making me feel nervous. I did stop the other thyroid awhile back even though my blood work said I needed it. This is a clean new start. I am sleeping well, and the most important thing is that I am not feeling nervous, but instead, energetic! I am sure if this keeps up I can change my review to five stars.
 Love it! Arrived early and we'll packaged. I feel so much better since I've been takin the Thyroid Support, just remember to use Sea Salt and not the Iodized Salt, and you're good to go :-)
 I am sensitive to supplements and have had no negative reactions. My thyroid problems are a bit better. Will keep taking it daily and hope for the best!
 I love this product. It has really work for me. I feel more energetic. My hair isn't falling as much. I don't have anymore headaches or dizziness which is a major plus for me!! I only take one pill a day. Make sure you do eat before you take it otherwise you will feel nauseous. I have been taking it for 6 weeks now at lunch time.  I have recommended it to all my friends and family that have thyroid problems.
 Not sure yet, I typically take Levrothroxin which I am substituting Thyroid Support. Doctor Apt. in a month, we will see after blood test.  Thanks
 Recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's but all lab numbers besides antibodies normal range so endo recommended selenium supplement and retest in 4 months. Ordered Thyroid Support after researching about the disease and reading the reviews. I've been taking the supplement for just over 3 weeks now, I do not believe I have seen any significant improvements yet but I am hopeful. It all comes down to when I go to retest my thyroid levels in a few months. As this contains selenium and other helpful ingredients, I am hoping it will help my overall thyroid help so I do not need to get on medication! Considering the amazing reviews, I am hopeful!
 Sleeping better, and energy level is improving with thyroid enhancing efforts
 I really like this product. I've purchased many supplements, individual and complexes. I've purchased this twice and I will continue to use this supplement.
 It gives more energy. The company has good ingredients
 Works pretty well. I feel much better since using it
 I'm noticing less fatigue and improved energy &amp; focus. Would highly recommend!
 Have been taking this product for less than a month and definitely can tell a difference. I have hashimotos hypothyroiditis.
 After 3 days of taking Thyroid Support I had noticed a bit more energy and is supporting my weight loss issues. No matter what I did from an eating and exercise program I struggled to lose however I haven't given up and this has definitely helped jump start. I have also noticed less bloating and swelling of hands and feet. Overall great feeling half way through the bottle.
 I think this is helping to boost my energy.  My thyroid Rx didn't seem to give me the boost I needed.  I will continue to take this to see if I keep getting these good results.<br/>I have been using this product for a couple of months and I do believe it helps me keep my energy level higher.
 I purchased this product to see if I could rev up my sluggish thyroid. I'm 74, and it seems to be working. I'm down 10 pounds, many more to go.
 I have been on Synthroid for years.  Although my levels are 'normal' I thought I could use some help and this really delivered for me.  Now, I wouldn't go without it. I feel much better than with Synthroid alone.  I recently ran out and didn't take any for about a week and I notice a big difference! I'm not that disciplined about vitamins and stuff, so I take this with my Synthroid.  I'm going to try their Green Coffee Bean Extract next...
 I like that I feel normal while taking this supplement.
 Energy improvement for me was visible within a few days. Less headaches after two weeks.
 I was taking 2 antidepressants to try to improve my energy level, but was still sleepy in the daytime and had difficulty sleeping at night.  Since I started taking 1Body Thyroid Support, I'm sleeping better and feeling more alert when I'm awake.  It's still the early stages, but I'm hopeful that this continues.
 finished bottle. Seemed to help a little with energy but nothing super noticeable
 Thryoid support. No more profuse sweating and feel more relaxed and sleep better.
 I think it is working? I've taken it for one month so far and feel better. I've been making several changes though so I am unsure if it's this product or a combination of them all.
 I think that I have more energy when taking this supplement. I struggle with low energy due to hypothyroidism, and its been a small but perceptible lift in energy while not making me jittery or sleepless. Will continue taking.
 Increased energy levels, however it has increased the vividness of my dreams. I try not to take the evening dosage because it gives me so much energy. When I initially started on the supplement I did have some weight loss but have since plateaued. I will definitely continue using this product.
 I bought this for my daughter who has hypothyroidism l, but I also took them for a couple of weeks. I seemed to have less brain fog &amp; fatigue while taking. I have been off of them for a few weeks &amp; notice the difference.
 Seems to be working
 Easy to take and digest.  Has helped me with weight loss, energy and hair loss
 Since taking Thyroid Support every day, my dizzy spells are severely reduced. My body heat is also more regulated, where I don't feel as though I'm radiating excessively. I highly recommend this product.
 This supplement helps me with my energy problems! I suffer from multiple sclerosis and have thyroid function issues but this little bottle helps me right out!
 Not sure if I'm imaging but I'm pretty sure hair loss has decreased since I started using.  Will be ordering my 3rd bottle shortly!
 Thyroid support has all the supplements my doctor recommends . I notice a bit more energy than usual and only after about eight days of taking the product. I hope that this will be the final product that helps me with the exhaustion and pain I have had for years now due to my hypothyroid condition.
 The benefits were felt very soon after I starting taking Thyroid Support. Highly recommend it.
 I've struggled with Hypothyroidism for about 8 years now. I found out I had a problem when I was around 20. After taking these supplements, I have more energy and my thinning eye brows are finally filling in. I highly recommend trying these if you suffer with thyroid issues.
 I have noticed a HUGE increase in my energy level! I'm also not so "down" anymore. I suffer from thyroid nodules and my doc suggested finding and trying something like this before we jumped right into synthroid.
 I have always had issues losing weight due to what I believed were thyroid issues, but my thyroid was always in range when I had labs done. After taking Thyroid Support and not altering my current diet (low carb, low fat), I have already started to lose weight. I also overall feel more refreshed and awake throughout the day.
 I TAKE ONE CAPSULE IN THE MORNING AND ONE AT NIGHT.  STARTED FEELING MORE ALERT AND POSITIVE ON THE VERY FIRST DAY.  SLEEP SOUNDLY AT NIGHT TOO.  ORDERED MY SECOND BOTTLE AFTER THE FIRST WEEK.  DEFINITELY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY OVERALL WELL BEING!  MORE ENERGY.  MORE PRODUCTIVE.  NO MORE "CLOUDY" FEELING!  THANKS 1 BODY!!!
 This product was recommended to me by a dear friend who has seen great results. I have only used this for about 2 weeks and I cannot notice much difference yet. I do think I have a bit more energy during the day. I am hoping to see more results long term and plan to continue the supplement for the foreseeable future. I can't see anything wrong with it but I cannot give it 5 stars because I am not sure how well it is working yet. I promise to update my review if/when I start feeling a difference. It is easy to take, I just have to set alarms on my phone to remember morning and evening. :-)
 "I suffer from Hypothyroidism and started using this a little more than a month ago. I find it gives me additional energy and generally makes me feel better. I wasn't sure at first if it was doing anything but then I ran out before my next order arrived and I was MUCH more tired! I didn't notice any weight loss as other have but having energy to get through the day was great!
 Loved it.  I had more energy, less depressed, less mood swings and better libido
 I’m not sure I’ve experienced the full benefits yet. Only 15 days in. I’m hoping to notice a more substantial improvement!
 I like adding this supplement to my regular synthroid. It gives me an energy boost and helps me maintain my weight easier.
 I had been taking another similiar product and was happy with it but the price is a little better on this one with good reviews so decided to try it. I have finished one bottle and it seems to work equally as well plus I recieved a coupon for a free bottle and I have now recieved it. Great customer service.
 I’m not sure if it is but I do have more energy so i would like to continue using it and do some blood tests in the future to confirm if it’s helping.
 I haven't been taking this for long, but so far there is a palpable difference in how I feel and sleep, and a reduction in the amount of night leg cramps I experience.  I am hypothyroid, and this truly seems to help.  I will definitely order this product again.
 I had more energy within the hour after I took my first pill. I’ve been taking them about a month and can tell when I miss a day. I do not have any adverse side effects from taking them.
 IT SEEMS TO HELP WITH SLEEP &amp; SEEMS TO HELP WITH MORE ENERGY.  . I HAD VERY LOW  ENERGY AND SLEEPING POORY FOR A LONG &amp; I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE PROGRESS I HAVE MADE .
 I have only been taking this for about 2 weeks but have noticed my energy levels have gone up and i no longer feel like I am going to fall asleep at any given moment. I am waiting to see if it will help with weight loss. I will update in the future.
 I have only been taking one tablet a day so far, but I’m already seeing improvements in my overall rest, energy, and appetite.  Plan to see how much of a difference two a day affects me after my second bottle arrives
 This product is part of my  morning regime! I started this product to reduce my waistline, I  am pretty fit and muscular and  trying to get rid of the 1.5 inches in the waistline. I  have been taking this for 2 weeks and feels good so far! Let me update the review after a month or so!
 I’m 60 now and have been drinking energy drinks to help with my energy levels. I do believe that Thyroid Support does increase my energy levels. I also have a little extra sexual stamina!
 This product has proved to do what it say it will do.  Our thyroid is a very important part of our body and we must thrive to keep it healthy.  I do recommend this product.  I have noticed great changes in my body and I will certainly purchase it again.  This is my first review that I have ever written but this product deserve a five (5) star rating.  Thank you.
 Great Product worked extremely well. I felt a lot more energized and actually started to feel great again and had no problem of waking up in the morning I do take this with my synthoroid
 So far I think it is working because my hair isn't coming out like it was and I have better general feeling and am not so tired all the time. 
 I've been wondering why I was feeling so much better lately. The only thing I can attribute it to is Thyroid Support. If that's the case, and I believe it is, I will stay with it the rest of my life. I seldom write reviews, and then only after I've tried the product for a while. I thought this product deserved a good review.
 This product is definitely working for me. I'm noticing more energy and focus as well as a bit of weight loss around my waist line.
 As anyone with thyroid problems knows, it can be very tricky to tell how much effect supplements are having. Each day can be very different. That said, I have overall felt more focused and energetic since beginning with this supplement.
 have seen a few things, like improvement in constipation.  have only been taking a short time so too early to say much.  But cautiously optimistic!
 Good quality.  I have been taking it for approximately a year.  My energy level is much better now.  My TSH increased from 1.08 to 2.01.  It really makes a difference.
 I have been using this product for a month now.  I wanted to wait until I wrote a review. At first I didn't notice any changes.  But after the first week I realized how much more energy I had.  I had been struggling with energy.  Took caffeine pills, energy drinks, coffee etc. all of it wore off so I ended up taking more.  That stuff can't be good for you. I had been suspecting my thyroid for a while. And after being diagnosed pcos, I wanted to try something that would help balance my hormones naturally. In a month I'm having a more regular cycle,  it's not 100% yet. But it's significantly improved!  I haven't lost any weight with the product. But maybe for someone else they have. My biggest concerns were my energy levels and my cycles and this has helped better than anything else that wasn't prescription medicine. Thank you!
 Deffinately more energy, sleeping better, and symptoms lessened.
 I've been suffering with weight and low energy my whole life with no help from doctors -- with this product I have energy and my pants are getting loose, this will be part of my life from now on.
 I feel like it gives me less head fog
 Been taking for 30 days and so far it seems to be doing it's job.
 I have been using Thyroid Support for three full months, and love what it has done for me. I began to believe that I was taking too much of my prescription thyroid meds because my heart rate and blood pressure were both elevated far above what had always been my normal, and in my research I discovered it was likely  due to my meds. I was also complaining of constant bloating (especially at night), and fatigue. I ordered Thyroid Support and cut my prescription thyroid med dose in half. The first day (!) the bloating was gone, my heart rate was down to normal, and within two weeks I had lost five pounds. It is now a few months later, the weight and bloat are still gone, and my blood pressure has normalized. I am very happy with, and will continue to use, Thyroid Support!
 I started taking this and by the end of the first week I really noticed a difference. I didn't have the sluggish feeling as before. Most definitely would buy it again.
 Since taking Thyroid Support, I have had more energy and feel like doing tasks that I have been putting off for quite some time. my mind seems more clear and I am better able to focus. Other thyroid related symptoms seem better as well.
 Feel mentally &amp; physically lighter. More focused &amp; happier overall. Will continue the product to give my lovely body all the care it requires.
 Open box and the container was already ripped apart. Terrible.
 I just received these a week ago and I have already noticed a change in my energy levels! I have recommended this product to 3 people already and plan to recommend more. I just learned that I have hypothyroidism, and after reading numerous reviews on this product, I decided to first try this rather than wasting the doctor or my time. I will post another review in a month for final results!
 The first two days I really didn’t feel a difference.  I kept using as directed and the third and fourth day I could feel a significant difference.  Through prayer and the Thyroid Support I feel 100% better!
 So many supplements of all kinds hurt my stomach, but this one does not! I starting taking this along with making changes to my routine, so it's difficult to tell how much help is from the supplement and how much is from routine change, which is the only reason I gave it four stars and not five.
 Seems to be working. Too early to tell.
 This is an amazing product! Wish I could give it more stars!! Had symptoms of thyroid issues but never formally diagnosed. After a short time on this and I feel so much better! Fast shipping and excellent customer service as well.
 Had no energy and was a bit foggy in doing tasks. I seem to have more energy and stay on task.
 I've been taking this product for 1 month and I already notice big improvement in my health. I feel more energy, less anxious and help me out with my sleep.
 It seems to be helping with my struggle with weight loss, lost 3 pounds in two weeks.  Could probably loss more if I start my exercising again.  :-)<br/>Feel better since I have started this supplement .
 Ordered this product more than once.  Liked it.  No bad side effects
 I've only been taking this supplement for 5 days but I've already noticed a difference.  I'm not as groggy in the morning and I have a little bit more energy throughout the day.  I'm still not feeling as good as I would like to be but I'm confident that in time I'll be feeling even better.  1 Body also sends a free bottle after purchasing your first bottle which I definitely think is a great offer.
 Very effective. My metabolism was completely out of whack. I lost 20 pounds of unnecessary fat as well.
 Not only does it support my thyroid, it has allowed me to stop taking several other supplements that I was taking. AKA, I’m saving money by taking this blend. I’m quite happy with the product!
 I'm using this to replace the prescription thyroid medicine...so far, so good.
 I have more energy and my mood has improved. I feel better overall. I feel normal. I've been taking thyroid medicine since I was 21 and I never felt like it was working even though my blood work was supposedly fine. Since I have started taking this I finally feel normal again.
 I have recently just started this product. I have estrogen dominance which affected my thyroid severely and due to this gave me very low energy levels.I came across this product while searching for iodine supplements which literature have suggested can help in estrogen dominance conditions. When trying this for the past few days , I have significantly improved my mental alertness, I no longer drag myself out of bed every morning and could perform my everyday chores without mental haze and severe fatigue.
 I bought the product on the advice of my doctor to try a thyroid supplement. All of a sudden for no apparent reason my hair started falling out by the handful. My doctor said thyroid problems were a leading cause of major hair loss.
 i feel like it is leveling me out. i don't feel like i'm gaining 2lbs a day. it seems to be working really well with my work outs and diet.
 About a year ago I had symptoms of secondary hypothyroidism but one day my tests came back completely normal. My endo told me I had thyroiditis. The fatigue, weight gain, swollen face and feet were all symptoms that I recently experienced once again. I started taking this Thyroid Support Supplement and within a week I felt my energy coming back. I will continue to take this on a daily basis!
 I definitely notice the difference
 Although I don't have a scheduled blood work appointment for another month - I am convinced that this product is helping the thyroid meds I am prescribed. I feel less tired in late afternoon. It will be interesting to see the numbers.
 I've been taking this product for about two weeks and I can say that I feel more energy and I noticed my moods are more stable. I also noticed the outer sides of my eyebrows started growing out - as I suspected, the eyebrow receding was due to thyroid malfunction so I'm very happy they are now growing back.
 I have had an issue with my thyroid for over 10 years and I have had issues with fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss. I have only been taking it for a week and my energy level is fantastic! I feel well rested and usually I wake up feeling horrible. I am very happy so far with this product.
 Couldn't be happier!  My foggy brain was improved after just one bottle.  Then 1 Body gave me a discount on the second bottle and the third  free!  1 Body also sent follow-up emails to make sure I received my order and was satisfied each time I ordered.  Not only is it working for me but I'm extremely pleased with the customer support &amp; price breaks.  On a limited budget, every little bit helps!  Thanks 1 Body!
 So far have been taking this product for about 2 weeks and can already feel the difference.  Seems to be working well.  I will continue to take the product and report back later with more time taking under my belt.  But so far so good!
 I bought this product because of my under active thyroid and all the negative symptoms. I am on levothyroxine medication. My hair was thinning and I was often very fatigued. This supplement has made a big difference in my energy and lessened my hair loss. I have been taking it for a little over one month.
 Product has been good and they send a complimentary second bottle.
 My hands and feet are no longer freezing and my mood is stabilizing.
 The fatigue I was experiencing is gone - thankfully! In general I feel really good. The only down side is that it makes me really thirsty, but since I only drink water - it isn't too much of a problem. I am glad I started taking it.
 Helping to regulated my body temperature, increase mind clarity along with decreasing depression.
 It does not hurt to try it.  I have told my Dr.'s time and time again that there is something wrong with my thyroid and although my tests come back normal, I never like to go with their results, esp when I feel the way that I do.  Ever since I started taking this pill twice a day, I no longer struggle to fall asleep at night and I am more focused and willing to accomplish goals throughout the day.  I bought a two months supply last time....I will be purchasing more.
 Didn’t help me much.
 I am looking forward to starting this product needed something to boost my slow metabolism  I am so gradful I found it thank you so much .😀 I will let you know How it goes .
 This supplement gives me energy and a boost to my low thyroid levels, with the small dose of medicine I take and this supplement, I am normal--and not just low normal.  I don't feel tired and the dull foggy feeling that I had before is no longer a problem. I plan to continue taking Thyroid support.  It is definitely a good product without "fillers" like so many other supplements.
 So glad to have found Thyroid Support Supplement from 1Body.  After a recent physical I found out I have an under active thyroid,<br/>the doctor  wants me to go on medication.  I am opting for a different approach through vitamins diet and exercise, a lifestyle change.<br/>Thanks again.
 hi,  this is my first week to take this but hoping it works really good and helps to give me energy.I will purchase again if it helps.<br/>I read bout 100 of the reviews and they were positive so thats why I chose this product.I will update in a few weeks to tell how its working.<br/> I will give more stars then if it helps.<br/>Thanks
 I used this product because I was feeling sluggish and had hair loss in my temple area.  My medical doctor said that I did not need to take a Thyroid support medication.  I am glad I am.....
 "This is my third order of the Thyroid Support. This product has helped eliminate almost all of my symptoms and made the few remaining easier to manage. I dropped 15lbs within the first 3 weeks without extreme diet changes or exercise. My energy levels are up again and all symptoms have since been under control. I am truly thankful for this product!"<br/> 
 Excellent product easy to swallow.
 Just received this product and the company sent a second bottle for free as a "thank you."  Wow.  Great customer service.  I chose this brand because it had the highest ratings and seemed to have pure ingredients.  I'll update this review in future with progress on the results from using the product over time.
 So far, I'm liking it. My metabolism is better. I feel good. I'd like to keep using it.
 My thyroid levels were our of range and my physician wanted to begin medication.  I talked him into giving me a few months to try your supplement, and after three months of taking this supplement daily, I had my thyroid levels checked again and it had returned to normal blood levels.  Amazing product!
 Aids with hypothyroid.
 I seem to have more energy and a better mood.  I was more depressed and hate antidepressants.  This is a better alternative to those. I am hoping this will help my metabolism, as well.
 Taking this supplement for a few days now, but I must have researched the majority of thyroid products available OTC to help with an underactive thyroid. Additionally, I researched each of the ingredients to be sure there was clinical evidence as support for hypothyroidism. I'm hoping this supplement will give my thyroid and metabolism the boost they need, believe it will take a few weeks for a fair assessment of results but pleased with quickness of shipping and overall merchant service.
 I have  been taking this Thyroid Support Supplement for almost a month.  It was recommended to me by my doctor.  I selected this supplement because said she liked using it herself and liked the ease of ordering it through Amazon. Though I haven't been taking the Thyroid Support long enough to notice a difference in how I am feeling, I can say that 1 Body has great costumer service.  My doctor said my Thyroid numbers were below normal and gave me a prescription to bring them up. She said for me to continue taking this Thyroid Support Supplement and will probably need to take it for the rest of my life.  I am glad there is a company like 1 Body to buy it from!
 Noticing increased energy right away, after years of not feeling right even with a "normal" dose of Synthroid.
 Was feeling sluggish and tired all the time in the supplement has helped me feel clearer and more energized.
 It still is soon but I'm going to have blood work done next week and will get a report on my thyroid. I do have more energy so that being the only new thing I have been taking I would give credit to thyroid support.
 thought it did ok
 This product has changed my life.  I take one a day and I have so much more clarity and energy.  Thank you, I love it.
 I definitely feel more energy in the afternoons - no more naps!
 I am a 30/m and sometimes my thyroid inflames in my neck during stressful events. I've had a blood panel and my doc said that T4 is on the lower end and needs close monitoring. I am not taking any prescriptions for it.<br/><br/> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks (twice a day) and I have noticed a difference in how my thyroid reacts to stress. My hair has also been very dry and brittle for the past 2 years or so, and I think it's related to this, so hopefullyjt will be back soon. I plan to give this product 6 months to see how it goes.
 Been on over month...love it. This product given to me but I purchased one and used for month. It has improved my overall energy and stamina.  In addition, no longer have brain fog or lack of energy. Love this product
 I am no longer fatigue, no more dry skin. Very alert, great mindset. This has helped my thyroid and I am so glad it did because I feel fantastic!
 I have hypo-thyroidism. This product helped me feel less sluggish during the day and helped bring my thyroid levels to normal range without needing to up my dosage of Synthroid medication.
 I haven't been taking it for long enough to see too much change. However, it doesn't upset my stomach like other iodine products have.<br/><br/>I will continue to take based upon the wonderful reviews on Amazon.<br/><br/>Thank you!
 My energy during the day is better but at night I am out once I sit down. Not losing any weight yet but I am hoping after 30 days it will work.
 I noticed after taking this product for a month, I am less tired and do not crave sugar and caffeine as much. I have also been able to sleep more!
 First I would like to say the shipping of this product from 1body was great. It arrived faster than expected. I have only been on the Thyroid Support for 14 days, but I do have a great deal of energy now. I have other issues involving pain so I haven't felt a difference in the all day pain problem, but I can say so far the energy level is up.
 I was quite surprised Walter I took this product I was actually energized in a natural way not a jittery way. I didn’t even realize how tired I was even though I knew I was tired.
 I started taking this supplement one week ago, and unfortunately  my hair fall increase a lot.I was hoping that would help decrease hair loss due to low thyroid, but I have different reaction. It may work for some people but for me didnt.
 Good for enery
 Its just two a day - morning and evening - I seem to have more energy and am sleeping better!
 I have only been taking this product for two weeks.  The biggest thing I have noticed is that my extremely dry skin has gone away.  I am looking forward to seeing how else this product will help me.
 Feel more energetic
 This Thyroid Support supplement from One Body works well in combination with my prescription thyroid hormone. I am currently being treated for autoimmune thyroid disease with my thyroid gland currently under-producing and over-working. This product seems to have no adverse reactions and my thyroid tests have come back into normal range about 8 weeks post diagnosis and hormone replacement therapy.
 I can tell a difference and I've only been taking this for ten days.  I think most people have a sluggish thyroid and don't even know it, since fluoride, which inhibits iodine absorption, is in all commercial toothpaste.
 I love this product, I feel more energetic, less sluggish and I have lost weight since taking this product. I will continue taking this product.
 Seemed to boost my energy level.
 Love this before a workout.
 Disappointed.  No difference noted.
 Have only taken this for 2 weeks but started to feel a bit more energetic yesterday. My hair loss has lightened up some also but That could be from the hair and nails formula that I started on the same day. Will continue on my program.
 I’m a nursing momma with hypothyroidism and I struggle with my milk supply due to a sluggish thyroid. I noticed within my first weeks of using I was having some breast swelling and had my first post partum period. I can’t only attribute to these pills. They helped my body “ get back to normal” while nursing. Thank you
 Great product!  Way more energy and helps you feel way less bloated.  Excited to see what my results will continue to be the longer I take this product.
 I've only been using this for about a week, but already I have increased energy and my measurements are down. Recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and not seeing any results from armor thyroid I was losing hope. Looks like this may be my saving grace!
 I seem to have more energy, and I have definitely noticed that I am not retaining fluid as much as I did before starting Thyroid Support supplement.
 I am on my second bottle. I take 1 capsule a day. This is the first time in over 2 years that my cycle has been regular for 2 months straight. And I also feel like my hormones are in check. I'm still experimenting with this product. But for now, i'm impressed.
 A little strong for me.  Gave me heart palpitations at max dosage and got some weird dizzy feelings.  Reduced to one pill and was able to withstand for a bit but just wasn't for me.
 I received the product a couple of days ago and I am give this reviews mostly based on other customers who purchased this. I will amend this review based on use and probably reorder the product if I am satisfied. Thank you
 They are ok
 Three days into bottle;feeling a great deal better!No longer feeling tired;sluggish orlethargic{unfocused}Your description was all I was expecting.Great product!The price and delivery;could not have been beat.Totally excellent!
 I had been taking a different supplement with very similar ingredients, but noticed that my energy levels were dropping again and my face was getting puffy again, too. Not sure if my body was just getting used to that supplement or if the 1 Body product is just better, but after only a couple of days, my energy was noticeably higher, and face puffiness gone! So far so good. My overall mood is better thanks to the lack of bloating.
 did nothing for me, would not recommend
 I have been feeling more energetic since taking this. It is a good quality product.
 After years of my doctor trying to get my thyroid levels normal this supplement was able to do it in just 3 months.
 i felt immediate reaults with this product. more energy. no more brain fog and i lost 5 lbs in 2 weeks. Also, it really lifts my spirits.
 I actually went from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism since taking these vitamins. It has allowed me to reduce my dependency on levothyroxine (thyroid medicine). I feel better and less tired. So since I have seen improvement in my thyroid I have decided to purchase a second bottle and continue to plan to purchase more in the future.
 This product is kick starting my metabolism , i am loosing my fat from around my hips . I havent changed anything except for started to take this product . So I am very happy .
 Excellent product! Use this a minimum of 30 days before deciding if its right for you or not. Ive had better full night’s sleep, more energy during day, and havent been losing as much hair as i was before. I also used to bruise very easily (if you poked me id bruise) and ive noticed i don’t anymore. Recommend highly!
 This product seems to be helping with energy, metabolism, sleep, etc.  It is a good combination of thyroid support nutrients.
 Just starting to take this product.  First impression is that the company has excellent customer service.  My thyroid test came back normal for the second time.  My instincts and research make me believe I have thyroid malfunction. I don't see any harm in trying it.  Will report back in thirty days.
 I just started taking this product just a little over a week ago, and have already started feeling more energy.
 I have just started taking this product but I react quickly if there is going to be a negative, and there has been none!  It may be a placebo effect--time will tell.  But feeling even a little better for a few days is a major benefit!
 It relaxes me and gives me energy throughout the day love it because it allows<br/>Me to sleep through the night.
 It gives me more energy and more gumption - it gets me off of my butt - to get more things done! The first day of taking it - i felt some anxiety - but the next day was much easier. I am experiencing better mental focus now and I am able to make long range planning tasks easier. I will be turning 62 next January - and I plan on keeping 1 Body Thyroid Support a part of my daily supplement regimen!
 Excellent quality product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I was taking other similar supplements, but none as comprehensive as this one.
 I am told that I need kelp and selenium to help stabilize my health due to hypothyroidism. This product has all I need to help keep my health stable. When the thyroid medication change, it can make one uncomfortable, and having a supplement like 1 Body Thyroid Support will help to minimize the negative effects.
 I have been having thyroid issues. Where I feel the ups and down very dramatically throughout the day. This thyroid support allows me to have sustained energy throughout the day while allowing me to go to bed in a timely manner. 5 stars!! Thank you 1 body.
 I decided to purchase this product after a friend recommended it. I have always been on the very low side of normal in thyroid tests. I really struggle with being tired throughout the day, foggy brain and hitting that mid-afternoon slump every day. Since starting taking this supplement (one month in) I absolutely​ have noticed that I don't hit that mid-day slump and I have more sustained energy and clarity throughout the day.
 Definitely great product and will be ordering again.
 I started taking this twice a day because I had several of the indicators of low thyroid function, but didn't want to go the route of prescription medications like others in my family.  I really noticed a big difference around the 30 day mark.  I feel it helps with my appetite as well as my regularity and overall energy.  I have been taking it for a little over two months now and I am very happy with the product.
 Woke up feeling energized, the fog had lifted. Instead of having an anxiety attack, I found myself laughing again.
 This product is seriously life changing. I have lost more than 20 LBs and have heightened energy levels and overall better mood. Before this I could barely make it through the day, even while taking my Synthroid (which made me more miserable and gave me awful headaches)
 Since taken it, I no longer have to take pain killers and am able to get a good night sleep.  It's an awesome product!!
 My thyroid symptoms are non existent  also my last lab work everything was great. I am going to try to taper off medicine and continue taking thyroid support.
 Please give this product a try if you are tired of being tired.  I would wake up in the morning being tired.  How could I just wake up and be so tired?  My doctors reports showed my Thyroid was fine.  I tried Thyroid Support and with in 24 hours I did not have that tired feeling when I woke up.  I now have the energy to take on my projects around the house and go for walks and exercise.  I have been on this product for two months now.  It is made in the USA and it is vegetarian.  So I felt comfortable taking this product.  Give it a try, hopefully you will have the same results.
 Nice
 I just received the product, but I research many products and medical websites before I made my choice. Thyroid Support seemed to have all the ingredients that I was looking for. Thank you for the free offer. I was very excited about this as I plan to stay on it.
 After taking this supplement for two weeks my doctor had to decrease my thyroid medication.
 I felt like it made a positive difference in my energy level, which was more noticeable when I ran out and forgot to reorder. I'm starting up again and hoping to see improvement soon. I will update when I have new results
 I have not noticed any change or affect yet but I've only used it a few days. I'll report back when I have spent more time with the product. I did like the labeling which was clear and informative without hype.
 I tried this product because I was always SO tired.  I have three very active children and I worried about having enough energy  to keep up with our busy lifestyle.<br/>I have been taking this product for a week now and am amazed at how I feel.  I have 100% more energy!  Now, when I come home from work the children and I go out and play Frisbee or play with the dog.  I can go from 5:30 am to 11 pm and I have more than enough energy.<br/>As an added bonus I am seeing positive changes in my hair and skin :)
 I usually take three natural thyroid pills aday and I just finished the bottle and cut down to one pill aday because my temp. is staying normal.<br/><br/> Copy to clipboard
 The first thing I noticed was I had a lot more energy as soon as I started taking it! I’ve only been taking it about 2 1/2 weeks so far but I’m just starting to drop a couple of pounds which is great because I have been stuck in my weight loss journey!
 I ordered this product because it had a combination of herbs recommended to me for my sluggish thyroid. I went on the reviews and hope to get the great results written about. I have been taking the product for less than a week and I do feel a little less fatigued. It's too early to know for sure if it's placebo effect or not. I am having hope that this will be the product for my future. If I do feel great results, I will respond again and let you know.
 Together with a prescription for levothyroxine a good combination.
 I'm almost through my first bottle.  I definitely feel more energy and I notice a difference in two areas 1) An improvement with my bowl movements.  2) I don't feel as sluggish during the day and evening.  I take the supplement as directed twice a day. I've also noticed I'm not as cold anymore.  I always use to be cold, cold hands, cold feet.  I don't know if it's the supplement or just menopause?
 While this product is not a miracle worker, I have noticed that it helps with brain fog. I'm more alert when I take this product, and I don't get jittery like I have when I've taken other supplements.
 I chose this product because the brand of thyroid support I normally get was out of stock. After researching the ingredients and reading the reviews and saw it was gmo free and had all the ingredients I was looking for in a thyroid supplement, I'm glad I chose 1 Body. I really appreciated the follow up email and thyroid support guide pdf they sent me it has a lot of valuable information. I'm excited to see results as I continue to take the supplement.
 I love this supplement! I’m not as cold anymore, I’ve been able to lose weight so much easier and my memory has improved. My favorite thing about this supplement is how much it was helped with my anxiety! I wish I had found it sooner!
 After finishing second bottle didn’t feel any change
 Very good product. Definitely helps with your borderline thyroid problem. I'll buy again. Felt improvement within days.
 This blend works...the L-tyrosine and the B mix are the most important ingredients.  I only need to take one per day, and definitely notice a difference  when I do not take this. Highly recommend it.
 I feel that it is a good product to assist in my morning workout.
 I'm grateful for this product. The special combination of nutrients helps me maintain a healthy weight, and to have the energy I need to get through the day. It's not cheap, but I really see a difference in my quality of life when I take it.
 At this point, I have more energy than I have in awhile. I have only been taking the Thyroid Support for two weeks but, so far, so good. I’m giving it 4 stars because I don’t know how this will do long term. We’ll see!
 Since taking the supplement I see improvements in my clarity, focus as well as energy levels have increased. I have even seen some improvements in my skin and hair. I plan to continue taking and monitoring to ensure the positive effects continue. It beats taking a prescription med.
 It seems to level out my thyroid issues. I take natural thyroid medicine every morning, and I seem to have less fatigue symptoms when I take thyroid support each day about noon.
 Since starting Thyroid Support, I have way more energy and focus than before.  I have started to make a list every morning of the things I want to accomplish that day instead of sitting on the sofa watching TV or reading.  Wish I had found this product years ago.
 Feel better. Great energy and focus. I take 2 before the gym in the morning and 2 about 4pm and I do not need my usual afternoon coffee. I will keep taking it!
 I have only been taking this for a week now and already feel better as far as not feeling so lethargic and run down. I have been on thyroid medication for seven years now and will always be taking meds for the rest of my life, however I have always needed an extra boost to feel human again and so far this thyroid support has been helping me with that. I'm just waiting to see if this will help with hair, nails and weight support. Like I mentioned, I have only been takinh this for a week and so far so good. Will keep taking this.
 Love this product, will purchase again
 Really works for me.  I could feel a difference within the first week, I really enjoy the benefits!
 I have been talking it for 15days and I been noticing the difference  I have more energy  now is more easy to fall a sleep I use to have problems with that
 I have notice more energy. I still struggle with many side effects of my thyroid issue (sluggish metabolism, hair loss, sleep disruption, etc). I will also take prescription medication and see my regular doctor. However, I am hopeful this can improve some of the symptoms that often still exist even when on prescrption meds.
 I think it may take a little longer to get results but so far so good.  My hair appears to be thinning less
 I have only been using for about a month and honestly am not that good at remembering to take in the evening. I notice a little difference in energy levels. No adverse effects which is good.
 It seems to be keeping my low thyroid symptoms at bay but I am only able to take 1 capsule a day. If I take two a day my gums bleed. However, with one a day I feel good and strong and that works for me.
 I have been taking this product for a few months now and have noticed a significant improvement in my thyroid function. I started with just one capsule daily and am now taking the recommended 2 capsules twice a day.
 As a vegetarian I love this product. It not only helps my low thyroid but also has no animal by-products and no chemicals included, just all-natural ingredients!
 Thyroid Support seems to give me energy, alertness, and weight management.
 I've only been taking it for a few weeks, but I have noticed that I seem to have more energy.  I do notice a difference; not as tired as usual. I've begun exercising more.  I've noticed enough of a difference to get a second bottle.
 Beats the heck out of Synthroid, which is what my doc first prescribed for moderate hypothyroidism. After a month I have experienced mild improvement. I can be patient. It took me years to dig the hole, so climbing out in a few months seems reasonable.
 I seem to have more energy when taking this product.
 I have been taking it for 3 weeks and I have noticed a big improvement in my energy levels! I almost don't even need my usual 2 cups of coffee every day to get going. I'm looking forward to seeing the other benefits.
 I just received this item.I wanted to try it because I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism but can't afford to go to the doctor right now and wanted to give this product a try.Right now I will rate it 5 stars and then adjust in a few weeks when I see improvements.
 I have only been using it for a week so far, so I can't really be sure if it is helping or not.  My doctor wants to see me in another six months to re-evaluate my thyroid condition. I chose this product based on other people's reviews.  Overall, most people seemed to be happy with this product.  I realize this product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease, but I like the fact it contains a combination of herbs and kelp.
 HAs helped me control water weight more than anything I have tried
 Notice much more mental clarity.  No weight loss, however.  I will still buy again!
 Recommend by doctor
 Almost done with my first bottle.  I have been feeling better but need to give it more time to know for sure!  But so far so good! Will order more!
 Not really sure if it helps but I am being proactive and trying to see if this would help with weight gain and future blood work results, No side effects
 I really love this product and will purchase again. Helped with digestion and energy levels. Easy to swallow, thank you
 I love love love my thyroid support supplements. I've lost weight, gained a ton of energy, can concentrate more, I'm not tired in the morning, and my hair is finally growing back fast and healthy!!! I will definitely be ordering another bottle!!!<br/>And btw, in my 9 years of having an Amazon account have I ever written a review so it's really saying something with my very first review of this product.
 Great product.
 A few years ago, I noticed a gradual yet significant change in my energy level. I went from being a super active exercise junkie to being lethargic and wanting to nap after work. I finally saw my MD and after a blood test, my thyroid was the issue and she suggested selenium. That seemed to help, but it wasn't enough so I ordered Thyriod Support which has selenium in it. I'm taking it with an adrenal support and it really helps! I'm no longer in a day-long "brain cloud" and I've resumed my exercise routine.
 I usually don't write reviews unless I'm disappointed in a product. Well I really like this stuff so  much I'm writing a positive review.  I have Thyroid disease since my pregnancy of my third child.  My numbers seem to be ok but I always feel sluggish and unmotivated.  I have not been able to loose any weight since my pregnancy and I'm always tired. I switched to Armour thyroid and my new Dr. told me to try a supplement that focuses on Thyroid.  I wanted something with Kelp and B vitamins in it. I saw on Dr. Oz that Kelp and all that stuff is really good for you I also heard that Chile pepper is also good for you.  All the ingredients in this stuff is legit.  I have been taking this stuff once a day in the morning and I have felt pretty good since. My afternoon sluggish state is almost gone I actually feel like going for a walk after dinner now. I'm sleeping much better at night which probably helps my energy level during the day.  Your thyroid sucks the life out of you and all your vitamins your body needs. So this is a great supplement and I HONESTLY FEEL ALOT BETTER , my apitight has also seemed to decrease not sure if this is they reason why but it has also helped my bloating. Which in turn I have lost some weight .. I'll take it anyway I can get it
 Reducing swollen thyroid can now swallow food &amp; even water easier and less choking, has also started helping with fatigue.
 So thankful to have found this product.  I feel energy that I haven't had in a very long time.
  I feel like I have more energy and focus. It's a very effective fast acting product that packs a lot into each capsule. It was very easy to add to my daily supplements. 
 Works great
 Not effective
 Made me feel so much better. I knew there was something wrong but my labs were coming back normal. After starting these I feel like a new person!
 I had a friend tell me about this, I was feeling so bad and not getting any answers from my doctors, thought I would give it a try along with the adrenal support as well (when taking both I only do one of each) and started to slowly feel a difference after a couple of weeks. I just went in for my doctor app't and they wanted to know what supplements I was taking as my numbers were back in the "normal" range. I am not yet feeling 100% but am very happy with finding a product that seems to be helping me each day feel better.
 Sent back
 I've been taking this product for almost 3 weeks. I can tell a difference sometime. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be difficult. I'm going to continue taking it and should be getting my next bottle free from body1 soon. Thank you!
 I have been using the product for about three weeks now. I have noticed an increase in energy, more alert. I have noticed that I'm not as tired as I typically have been in the past. I'm looking forward to seeing how I feel after I have been using the product for a month.
 My thyroid blood test came back a little high and since I started taking this supplement, it went back to normal. I will keep taking it as long as I can. I recommend it!
 I'm giving the product a 5 star for quality and customer service.<br/>I chose this particular product because of all the ingredients in one form of thyroid support.  All the research I've done about the most effective thyroid support ingredients are found in this one product.  No other product I've found has all of them.  I also like the fact it is made in the USA.
 I got this for my daughter.  When she first started taking synthroid she had started being rather irritable.  Since she started taking Thyroid Support she doesn't seem as irritable.
 I had thyroid surgery and have felt like my remaining thyroid was sluggish although my labs were ok. Decided a supplement might be helpful so chose this product. I have been feeling better and sleeping better. Overall I am pleased and will continue to take this product.
 I got these for my girlfriend last month. Within 3-4 days she started having SO much more energy. Normally, as soon as she got home from work she would take a nap. Now, she doesn't nap when she gets home, and even has energy to burn way into the night.<br/>And with that has come a general happiness increase, weight loss, increased libido, seems less stressed, sleeping better...All good stuff.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product.
 I've been taking this for a little over two weeks. It has definitely helped with energy levels, along with a number of other mild symptoms that all pointed to low thyroid function. I have a 2.5 year old and one year old, both born with food allergies that prevented me from being able to take a multivitamin while nursing them, and I needed something to replenish my iodine levels along while improving my thyroid function, even though blood work did not show any red flags (other than low vitamin D levels).
 I have more energy and have lost 10 pounds
 Great product! You can feel yourself again. Have only been taking it a few weeks looking forward to more time taking it.
 No side effects. I feel more awake and like myself. Decreased appetite wasn’t intentional.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for almost 30 days now. I can see some improvement in my energy level and concentration while I'm working.
 This product is keeping me level. I'm currently trying to come off of Kratom, an addictive drug that acts like Opioids do to the brain. Cutting my doses makes me sluggish and moody. I believe this product is helping manage those symptoms.
 I have been  using this for about a month and it works great!
 So far so good. I suffer from low T3 and the Rx I recently began taking didn't seem to be doing anything to help with symptoms. I tried taking Kelp but it caused me a lot of GI issues. Based on the product review for this thyroid support I'm really hoping to start feeling better soon. I am VERY happy to report no GI issues though (about a week in so far) and I'm hypersensitive in that area.
 I feel good with a boost if natural energy. No negative side effects. No weight loss yet but will continue to take these.
 This Thyroid Support supplement really works.  I found that it takes about 4-6 weeks to see a change but once you reach that period, I could tell that my metabolism was engaged.  thanks for a great product!
 I have been taking it for about 6 months or so.  I notice that I am not quite as tired during the day, and yet it does not seem to interfere with my ability to fall asleep at night.
 I have been taking this for a month now. My nails were so brittle and peeling and I was so tired all the time. My nails have now started to grow out and when I hit anything they don't break and the peeling has stopped. I have even seen some energy coming back.
 I had to quit taking the product after a couple of weeks as the pepper started coming back up. I tried it with and without food when this started and nothing helped. The pepper was way to much to bear so I had to give it a break and find something new.
 I must say I am impressed with this product. I have used many other thyroid support supplements and this one by far is the best.
 I feel more energetic. My stamina for doing physical task on my property has increased. At 68 years old I'm beginning to feel more like I did when I was 30 years old.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis over 10 years ago.  I have been struggling with doctors and getting prescribed proper treatment.  Even though I am taking levothyroxine, I still feel tired and my emotions are a roller coaster at times, still have hair loss, etc.  I found this Thyroid Support Supplement, and I am surprised at how much better I feel.  I have taken this supplement for a little over a month, but I noticed a difference within a couple weeks.  I have more energy, my emotions are more even, and I have improved mental acuity.  Over the past 10  years, I was lead to believe that I had an anxiety problem, but I now believe it was related to my thyroid.  Since taking this supplement, I don't feel anxious and out of control. Although I was not expecting it, I did lose some weight in the past 30 days.  I attribute that to having more energy so that I can actually work out!
 So far so good. Better mental clarity than when I was taking levothyroxine. I have other health issues and battling sleep apnea also but this product has definitely given me a step in the right direction. I think my apnea is the main source of my energy problems now.
 Helping me lose the weight. Curbs my appetite!! Makes me want to exercise.
 My doctor recommended taking a thyroid support supplement. So, I chose 1Body Thyroid Support because it included the ingredients the doctor said were important. I've been taking it for about 6 weeks and I feel wonderful.
 I felt a increase in energy overall. Also my metabolism appears to be getting better I have not changed my eating habits or have been exercising however I have had some weight loss.
 Bought this product for my mom, it provides the nutrients she needs. So pleased to have it! After searching for a product that would best help her with her symptoms, the thyroid support had all the major components she needed at a wonderful price. Delivery was quick, only took like three days.
 (Disclosure-- no one put me up to this review. I only review a product if it's horrible and I want to warn others or it wows me. This product definitely wowed me!) After 10 years of an irregular period and weight loss issues, I bought this bottle on a hunch that I had thyroid problems-and I was right! I'm finally regular again and losing weight and I haven't changed anything else in my active lifestyle or healthy eating habits. I even stopped taking them for a month to see if I would have my period and if the weight loss would continue without it....unfortunately no such luck. Started taking them again and the next day got my period.  An extra benefit of the pills is that it wakes you up mentally and helps you focus more.  I'm very thankful for this product!
 I didn't really notice a big difference but I did feel like I had less energy after I ran out. For the price I would recommend it
 This product helped with my Thyroid symptoms and gave me the extra energy to get through the day. I also take Armor Thyroid meds so this was an added benefit. I recommend it :-)
 Within just a couple of days I noticed more energy, increased my focus and helped me to be able to get back to exercising. After reading reviews of a number of supplements, I settled on Thyroid Support, and I'm so glad I did!  I will definitely continue using for a long time to support my thyroid health.
 I have more energy. There is no after taste. The only thing I would suggest is the capsule could be easier to swallow.
 I made this purchase after researching other thyroid support supplements. For the past 9 months I had been taking thyroid supplements provided by my wellness chiropractor at a much higher cost. My order came quite quickly and I started taking today. I was impressed that with first order there is an insert for you to get another bottle free. Once I take this for a week or two I can then provide a review on how I felt. I had Graves Disease with thyroidectomy 40 years ago.
 This made a significant difference.  I have ENERGY!  I sleep well at night and my memory has improved. My doctor said my hypothyroidism wasn't bad enough to treat with medication yet, but I was tired of feeling like a slug!  Hopefully, I won't ever have to be put on medication. I have a very low tolerance for most medications so I am only taking one capsule per day and even that has made me feel energetic. It's great to have a vegetarian supplement that is so effective.
 I have been taking this for about six days. I stopped taking my prescribed thyroid medication and replaced it with this. But I was feeling really bad after doing that so now I am taking both my thyroid medication from my doctor 75MCG od Levothyroxin along with this thyroid supplement. I have not noticed a change yet, but it has only been six days so. I'll write another review in about three weeks to let you know if I am feeling better. My long term hope is that I would be able to stop taking the prescription thyroid medication and only take the natural herbal supplement and feel fine.<br/><br/>But I am glad to have all of the things I need for thyroid health in one pill. That encourages me.<br/><br/>Also, the first four days of taking both this and adrenal support my body was detoxing and I had headaches. But the headaches are gone now.
 I’ve been taking this thyroid support for 2 weeks and I no longer need naps to make it through the day! My nails are growing and not so brittle and no more brain fog! I will definitely keep ordering this.
 With this product, I feel like my food processes faster, and I rarely get sick to my stomach now. This used to be a daily occurrence. I have also see an improvement in my mood.
 I have seemed to have positive results from the Thyroid support. I just ordered my second bottle to further evaluate this. But I was definitely having some symptoms from my thyroid condition that showed improvement as I got into the second week of taking this supplement. I started taking a probiotic at the same time and have since added some other supplements. But I do see marked improvement overall.
 I have hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's and this product helped keeping up my energy levels up. I have noticed as well my sleeping has improved also so I will be buying this again.
 seems to help get me going every morning... will buy again
 So far so good. I've only been taking this supplement for a very short time. I have noticed an increase in energy and have been sleeping much better. Hopefully it continues! I will update this review after I've been on it longer.
 Very impressed with this product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try it.
 Drank the whole bottle and did not feel any change- disappointed.
 More energy  !<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 I have hypothyroid.  This supplement is better than Western Medicine for me.  My hair is growing and I have lost the extra weight around me middle.
 Love it I am more energetic I’ve lost weight since being on it and my periods are on track now!
 Since taking Thyroid Support, I feel I have more energy and am not so exhausted by the end of the day. I take one capsule a day. I tried two, however, I felt jittery and couldn't sleep, so I went back down to one a day
 My Naturopath / M.D. gave the thumbs up. Its a good product with all necessary ingredients for a healthy thyroid
 Just received the product, but haven't started taking it yet.  I chose it because it contains enough of the vitamins and supplements that I desire so I shouldn't have to take any other vitamins with it.
 The first few days I had an increase in energy.  My husband started taking it then and says he gets a bump in energy after he takes a pill in the morning. Included with the package was an offer to get a free bottle, including shipping! Give this product a try and maybe you will get a second one, too. I love free things! Thank you 1 Body Brand.
 I started taking 1 Body Thyroid Support about three weeks ago.  I feel like it is working.  I usually have a couple of energy slumps during the day and I haven't experienced those recently.  I don't feel as though my thinking is as "foggy" as it has been in the past.  I sometimes lose hair as a result of my hypothyroidism and lately my hair even feels thicker!  Going to keep taking this and hoping for even more positive results.
 I have definitely noticed that it's easier to wake up and fall asleep. It also seems like my body temperature is more regulated and I don't feel as "hangry" as I normally would.  It's probably worth it just for this benefit alone.
 I love that I can get several  of the vitamins/minerals/amino acids recommended for low thyroid in one supplement. It helps keep me energized and my hypothyroid issues away.
 Just starting, I often have a bad reaction to many supplements, this causes me no problems at all. I chose it because it had not only Iodine but several trace elements and an Indian herb known for Thyroid healing.
 decalcify pineal gland
 I was able to get off my medication and feel great. All my thyroid numbers are normal for the first time in years.
 I have definitely already noticed more energy, hoping for more results re: hair &amp; skin soon! ( 2 weeks )
 I've had the product less then a week... in my opinion it's not long enough to leave an acurate description.  So I will update again after a full bottle usage.<br/><br/>I started taking the pills the night I got it in the mail.  On the third day I noticed I woke before my alarm and at the end of the day realized how much energy I had.  It's not noticeable as in feeling jittery or a rush of energy... it was more of a "wow I didn't need a nap, and was shocked at how much I got done that day". But boy did I crash that night and slept like a baby with out getting up 3x to go pee or get a drink.  And that next morning I felt rested and ready to start the day!<br/><br/>So far I like the product.  I too am one of those  people whose doctor says the thyroid test is borderline OK. My entire family on my mothers side has Hashimoto's thyroid disease.  Even my doctor says I have classic symptoms of thyroid issues such as little hair growth loss of hair dry skin minimal eyelashes foggy brain my BMI is higher than it should be I'm always tired and my hands and feet are always freezing even in the summertime.  as for my symptoms I can't say as of yet whether the medication has fully helped with one or more issues.  I will say that I plan to finish the bottle and keep using it for a few months to see if I notice a difference. So far I like the energy level I have and that is enough for me.
 The product is great. I have more energy and I’m more alert.
 Seems to be working. Feeling better than with prescription drugs.
 This has definitely helped with my skin/rash problems I've been having lately. Very happy with this.
 I tried these due to hypothyroid. I was feeling better and was eating better without any symptoms. It was first try so I can't say if symptoms improving till blood test.  I tried a different multi vit which was 6 pills a day I got nausea and physically sick always craved chocolate cake and did not eat anything good due to nausea. I stopped them and I'm going to give thyroid another try because I felt better and had no craving which helped me stay on good diet.
 I got this product for my mom. She's been on thyroid prescriptions for 6 years now. She recently fell ill due to a stomach virus and was unable to take her prescription, because they caused too much pain to digest. I switched her over to this And she loved it. She was able to digest w/o any discomfort and she feela awesome and that was only after taking 5 days. Hope to see what the results are after a month of use.
 I knew my thyroid levels were low.  After a week I am sleeping 5 to 6 hours a night, and the brain fog is lifting. I am beginning to have well being. I am staying on this, and am looking forward to see where this goes.
 I liked that your L-Tyrosine isn't super high; another nutritional company had so much in their formula, I had difficulty going to sleep if taken 2nd pill as early 4pm. I wake up feeling ready to get up...which is a great feeling - Thank You!
 I have Hashimoto Disease. This thyroid support helps with overall clarity and my daily functionality. So happy I found this. Changed my life
 I wish they were organic but otherwise I have been happy with them. I even showed my doctor and he said the ingredients were good to support my hypothyroidism. My tsh went down from 25 to 6.7 after starting these in addition to dietary changes
 I started taking this supplement and prescription thyroid medications at the same time. I'm feeling much better. It was recommended by my Thyroid Specialist.  I'm sure this is helping.
 I think this is helping, but it has only been 2 weeks, so I need to give it more time. I do feel better
 I have notice a change in energy. I'm not as sleepy during the day and I sleep more peacefully at night. I haven't notice any weight loss as of yet, but I'm sure I will because my thyroid has been off for years. I will continue to use 1 body thyroid support. I will as also look into your other products as well.
 I’m almost done with my first bottle of thyroid support and absolutely love it so far!! I’ve felt so much better and have even lost some weight which I believe Is from using this product because that’s the only thing I changed.
 I chose this supplement after searching for one that was soy and gluten free.  I was very pleased to receive my order quickly and find a coupon for a free bottle.  Just started taking it today, but am hoping for great results and excited to have 2 months for the price of one.
 I had been feeling quite drained, so began taking Thyroid Support about three weeks ago.  It definitely helps me keep my energy up throughout the day.  I would be happier if I saw some weight loss along with it!
 I can't tell if it's working yet, but I'm going to keep going with it.
 feel more energized -less mid day sleepys
 I haven't been taking this long. I do notice a difference in my energy.  I sleep really well, wake up and power through my day. I usually run out of things to do. I will update my review as results come along
 Under promised, and over delivered.<br/>Thrilled.
 This has helped improve my metabolism as well as give me energy!,
 I love this product. I've been taking it for over a month and I feel great and my nails are stronger.
 I feel like I have more energy since I've been taking the product. It seems to be easier to control my appetite and weight loss has been easier.  I plan to keep taking it and see if I have further improvements.  Also, it doesn't upset my stomach like some supplements..
 I just got it in yesterday evening. I decided to try it and I felt way better yesterday evening than all morning. My husband decided he would try today since it helped me so much. I will update soon.
 It works good!
 I've just started using this product, and so far it seems to be helping.  I'm looking forward to the next few months.  I was taking Prolamine Iodine, but that became too expensive.  I took other iodines which I didn't notice any benefit.
 I used this to get my thyroid working normal.  While I did not "feel" any different, I notice a sudden drop in weight.  I have been on plateau following a KETO diet.  This made a huge difference.
 I have only been using the product for about a month.<br/>I believe it is helping my overall physical health and well being.<br/>I would purchase this product again
 Ive been taking for about 1 1/2 weeks. I noticed a difference in like 3 days. Im not tired. And hopefully my hair loss will diminish. I can do daily task and workout. My thyroid does hurt or throb anymore. Andni have energy. I dont have cloudy memory  or brain fog anymore either.
 Decided to give this one a try based on the reviews.  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about two years ago and admit I would love to see an increase in energy and focus.  Since I just got the product today, all I can speak to is that the product arrived very quickly and I received a coupon in it for a free bottle for writing an initial review.  A company willing to do that impresses me as one that stands behind their product.
 I feel better. It's only been 15 days
 We purchased this product for our thirteen year old daughter with hypothyroidism. She has noticed an improvment in both her energy level and concentration
 I have hypothyroidism and take Levoxyl. But after adding this to my regimen as well, I find I'm having more energy and less constipation. Love this product! Thanks for offering it!
 I have noticed an increase in energy and mood and a decrease in appetite since starting this supplement.  It contains an excellent blend of quality supplements.  There are so many thyroid support supplements out there but this one so far seems to be the best one I have taken.
 Was on Thyroid medication and hated the way it made me feel so I quit.  I started taking Thyroid Support and I feel great.  More energy and just feel better.  Also lost the weight I had put on when taking medication.
 Just received so do not have any experience with it as yet. Looking forward to feeling better so hope this is the one. After studying the many other supplements available I chose this one for the specific ingredients as well as the ingredients of the capsule. All natural.
 I really don't know yet if it is helpful because I take it with my RX.  But I do believe I get an extra amount of lift.  I had Graves  disease 40 yrs ago and have been struggling ever since to stay balanced  between hyper-hypo.  I think if I can get an extra boost, it will help. Will say later if it appears I am staying balanced. Think about leaving out magnesium stearate.
 I've taken the product twice daily for about three weeks.  I know the contents of this should help support my thyroid condition as my doctor has recommended selenium and this product has that and more.  I feel more energetic and mental fog has decreased.
  I have only taken it a little over 2 weeks so I'm not sure of long term, but I feel a bit more focused and I am sleeping better. My energy seems to be returning. I also like that it supplies a lot of, what I think, are very important trace minerals that I am not getting elsewhere. 
 Great help to wellbeing!
 After much research by my wife, and her guiding me to this product, I chose it because it matched and exceeded (in additional areas) the requirements needed for my thyroid health. I strongly believe that the thyroid should be well taken care of for overall health and well being, and this product seems to be the best choice for the job. I'll update after taking it for a while.<br/><br/>Update, unfortunately this product didn't work for me. I just left the hospital, had to have my heart restarted due to the extreme afib caused by an inactive thyroid. I had been gaining weight after I was diagnosed with a slow thyroid and I really thought this would help. I didn't want to take the prescription meds due to the side effects. I, evidently made the wrong choice. Really was hoping it would have been what I was needing.
 This product is wonderful!! I feel so much better when I take it. There is no more brain haze, I feel alert and quick again. I sleep soundly and wake refreshed. I feel that my mind and body have gone back in time
 My son and I have Hashimoto's and taking Thyroid Support has been a great supplement to add to our diet.
 I started taking this supplement to help with sluggishness. I definitely started feeling a difference in the first two weeks. The reason I gave 4 stars is because this supplement is a bit pricey and although it works it is not a cure-all.
 Have been taking these for about 3 weeks and love it so far! My entire family has mild hypothyroidism and I will definitely be recommending these supplements to them. I've noticed I'm more alert in the mornings instead of groggy like I always used to be and it's definitely helping me maintain a healthy weight. Haven't noticed any difference with brittle hair or dry skin yet but from my research it looks like that takes a little longer to start improving.
 Too soon to be sure of the effectiveness, and with the holidays that add extra caloric intake and stress, those variables create difficulty with a definitive assessment. Will update next month.
 It's been two weeks now that I'm taking this and I've notice more energy and slowly starting to feel like myself again. Taking this along with synthroid since my doctors claim my levels are in range but I was feeling drained with no energy. I'm so glad I found this on Amazon and the other reviews helped in making my decision to try it too. The company offers you a free bottle with your first order and have been very helpful. To feel more like yourself it's worth a try :) only someone with thyroid disease can understand that tired exausted feeling that's very frustrating.
 In as little as a few days, I noticed a difference in my overall energy level.  I was no longer tired and dragging all day long.  I will purchase this product again.
 I haven't noticed large changes yet, but do find that I am sleeping a bit better and I am maintaining my weight a bit easier than I have recently. I know that I need this supplement, so will continue taking it.
 It's been 3 weeks and so far I can tell a difference in my energy levels. Also I noticed I don't want to sleep all the time as I was napping daily. So far I am loving this product. Going to continue to take thyroid support for another couple of months.
 I have been taking this for about a week and started to feel better after about 3 days.  I woke up earlier, had more energy, digestion is working better, and believe I am shedding less. Will just stay on this for the long term and looking forward to trying Adrenal Support.
 I felt a definite increase in energy within a couple of weeks. My digestion seemed to function better. My sleep was a little more normal.  The biggest thing I noticed was when I ran out. That's when I noticed how much of a difference this supplement was making in my body. I'm definitely buying more in order to see a more long-term benefit.
 I have been using 1 Body Thyroid Support Supplement for approximately four months.  I feel like I have more energy with more clarity and not as tired each day before I started using Thyroid Support.  I take one tablet each evening before going to bed.  I am going to continue taking the support because I am feeling more energetic than I have for a long time.
 My order just arrived.....will update in a few weeks. The reviews read were mirrored with my low energy level and other disorders associated with hypothyrodism therefore it was easy to decide on 1 body thyroid supplement as a homeopathic corrective measure. I have been taking the thyroid supplement for 10 days and have a noticeable improvement in energy, hair loss, dry  scalp , dry skin and achy hands-  I am a satisfied  very customer.,
 I think the product has helped my thyroid get back into the normal levels.
 I have felt a difference in my overall energy. Waking up more refreshed and alert. Thank you!
 Give me energy
 So far I really like this product. I haven't lost weight yet but I've read other reviews where they say it takes a little while for some people. I started sleeping better within only about 2 days! I wasn't expecting that. Really nice bonus!
 I used this product for my hypothyroidism. It really helped me to feel better and manage my symptoms. For whatever reason I ordered a different one come time to reorder (Nussapure), but after taking it, I don’t notice a difference. I’m switching back!
 This has really helped in so many ways, to reduce a number of random symptoms, including chronic pain, stiffness, headaches, digestion and fatigue. Highly recommended!!
 Been taking 1 Body Thyroid Support for 3 weeks, 1 in am and 1 in pm.  I have had no adverse side effects.  I have had an increase in energy throughout the day, not bursts of energy, just a steady feeling of alertness.  I have thinning hair on top and am hoping this thyroid supplement will help with this embarrassing issue, I'm sure hair re growth takes some time to show.  I will continue with 1Body and give it a chance to help correct other thyroid issues, don't want to take Rx drugs.
 I've been taking these for 3 days now and I have to say I feel pretty good! Im don't feel like a zombie walking around anymore. No tired or sluggish feelin. I hope this continues to go well in the next few weeks. But so far it is a good product.
 So far so good.I have been using since more than 2 weeks.I am feeling some improvement.Hope this will help my thyroid works better
 I've been taking this supplement for quite some time and I have noticed a lot of my symptoms getting better. I have more energy to do things during the day and my sleep has also improved.
 I have only been taking this product for 4 days. I started to take it because I have every single symptom of hypothyroidism, but my levels always come back normal. I have already started to notice a difference. My mind is clear, I am sleeping better, and today... I woke up feeling refreshed and energetic! I will continue to take this product and see if there are any other positive changes.
 I just started taking this about 2 weeks ago, but I feel a whole lot of energy when I do. I am hoping to get a jump start to my thyroid with new hair growth, so far I just feel the energy. I really like taking this. I noticed a difference right away!
 So far I’ve noticed an increase in my energy and water weight loss!! My constant weight grain has completely come to a stop and I know it’s because I added this on with my new thyroid medication prescribed by my doctor.
 I notice a significant difference in my energy levels and feel like I can function like a normal human.  Listen to the reviews and give your body a few weeks to adjust....you won’t regret it.
 Nothing its works good.
 I have been taking this product for one month now. I am also on Levothythroxin and struggling to get control of my weight. Although it hasn't helped me with my energy levels, I do sleep much butter at night and I can think now at work. No more brain fog. I am able to concentrate and maintain my focus on things on daily basis. Minus the energy part, I feel normal again. I have finally lost some weight while maintaining a low calorie diet and moderate exercise. I really do feel like this product has helped me get control of my weight, my sleep and get back to "myself" again. I reordered another bottle and look forward to continue on my weight loss journey into the new year.
 I feel more clear minded and not so lethargic.  My nails and skin don’t seem to crack as much.
 I had high hopes for this supplement but it gives me terrible stomach pain and diarrhea every time I take it. At first I thought I must have food poisoning but it continued every day I took pill and stopped on the day I stopped the pill! I eat spicy food all the time so I don't think it's the ceyenne...probably one of the other herbs. I guess that's what I get taking something with herbs I've never tried or even heard of before :(
 Have only been taking this product for 3 weeks - but man can I feel the difference. My energy is definitely higher. I'm not struggling to wake up at 5am for the gym and it feels like my body is back on track - if that makes sense. I have all the symptoms of thyroid issues but all the tests came back perfectly fine. This thyroid support was exactly what my body needed. And the fact that I can recognize (and pronounce) all of the ingredients was huge for me. I definitely recommend!!!
 Works okay. Not much more to say. It's a supplement.
 new to product. want more time to be sure~
 This is a great products as well...one that you can count on.
 This is the first time I have taken a thyroid supplement and I have just taken it for one day so it is too soon to tell much about it.  However I feel like it will work so I am very optimistic about it.
 I was asked to leave a review so here it is!  I am just starting to take this product based on the wonderful reviews that I read here on Amazon. I am excited to see results.  I just started it yesterday when the shipment arrived.  I will post again after I have had sufficient time.  There was no choice for "under 1 week" for how long I have been taking this product.
 Thyroid support is new to me, I've only used it for 1 month. So, maybe after a little longer use my star rating will go up. I definitely feel more energy using this product. I even got myself back into a sport I haven't done in 15 years! I did stop taking the product as the bottle was running out &amp; I can see that i have less energy &amp; drive again. I take my thyroid medicine as directed and my hormone levels are within range, yet I still just don't feel like I used too. Thyroid Support has made a difference for the better. I plan on purchasing it again, without a doubt.
 So far so good. I think I expected an overnight success. After reading how people were so improved within 14 days, I wanted instant results.  Maybe my case was worse than theirs.  Either way I have seen improvements I began my menstrual cycle today after 7 months of not having one.  I'm excited to see future improvememts and I will update!
 In addition to my prescriptions for Hashimoto's Hypothyroiditis autoimmunity, I've been taking Thyroid Support for three months and feel increased energy and mental clarity.
 I haven't noticed any difference yet but I have only been taking it a little over 2 weeks.
 I think I have more energy but will need to take it longer to see.
 Feel better and sleeping better
 I have been taking this product for about 3 weeks now and was recommended to me by my gynecologist.  I plan on updating my review once I have used the product for a few months.  Most of my symptoms including hair loss and menstrual irregularity will take some time to see if improvements were made.  On average my energy levels seemed to have improved slightly, but again I have only been on the product for a short period of time.  The product arrived on time, exactly as described and customer service has been great!
 I have been researching what is good for the thyroid and this has those things in it; a combination of vitamins, herbs and amino acids.
 For the past couple of weeks that I've been taking it, my face is less puffy- which is one of the symptoms of hypo. I have to keep taking it for a longer period to see if other symptoms improve.
 My energy level seems to be more steady, fewer afternoon sleepies.
 I just started taking the product 2 days ago so I can't really say much just yet, but I did order it because I was on thyroid medicine and I decided to not take it about 4 months ago.  I did have blood work done and my levels were fine, but I am losing my hair a lot and as a woman that's not cool.  When reading reviews I did see one about hair and that is why I chose this product plus of the stuff in it which I researched on.  Not all thyroid supplements have what you really need and this one did, plus it's vegetarian which I have chose 90 days ago to be.
 It's hard to explain the exact specifics of the difference I feel when taking this product but I feel much better generally in every way. More energy and much more balanced.
 I've only taken this product for a few days, so I haven't experienced it enough to provide an effective review..but honestly so far I feel more awake. I can come back later for an update.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I just needed to say that I feel great! I have the energy to exercise in the mornings when before I couldn't even get out of bed. I take one in the mornings and one after lunch or the latest at 3pm. I don't recommend it to take after 7pm since I was up all night the day I took it late.
 The only negative is that the type of B12 advertised on the box is not what is on the bottle. The company assured me this is a typo, but I have no way to confirm this. Great product and will buy again.
 I can already see a difference three days in! Although, I took 5-HTP with it today and got a nasty headache and panic attack. So I wouldn't recommend doing that. Will order again!
 I loved the way it made me feel and suppressed my appetite.  One of the better ones.
 I always test normal but being in PA school I know the symptoms associated with thyroid problems. I have a large number of these symptoms and I feel like they are beginning to fade the longer I take this product. Will be purchasing again.
 This is a good place to start working on improving your thyroid issues.  For me I am not feeling as sluggish and tired.  I have only been using this for 15 days and will continue hoping to see improvement in weight issues as well.
 1 body Thyroid Support gives me a subtle yet extra little boost of energy. I feel like it works well with the medication that I am already taking to support my thyroid. I have been taking this for quite some time and I notice a difference when I quit taking it.
 Works
 I bought these a few months back but I refused to leave feedback until I gave them time and eliminated any possible psychosomatic effects. I have high rT3 but have had no luck finding a physician to help me with my debilitating lifelong symptoms. I got these hoping for relief. I do feel some effects - a steady energy increase that does not crash. It isn't intense, but it is noticeable. One thing to keep in mind, you need to take these everyday. If I miss a day or two, the effects are delayed. It seems to build up in your system. I take 2 in the morning, sometimes another in the afternoon, always on an empty stomach. I think they are worth a try. But like most things, don't expect a miracle.
 I take several supplements but I believe this supplement does what I needed it to do as the others did not. Posted in 2015 when first taking supplement.  March 2016 - I ran out of the product for a few weeks in Jan/Feb.  Noticed a huge difference, most notably in the libido area, much to my husband's chagrin.  They say you don't know what you have until it's gone and in this case they are correct.  I will not be without this supplement again!
 This is the first time I am writing a product review but I felt I should definitely write this one. I have hypothyrodism and when I first began to take this product, I liked it because it made me sleep better. But gradually I started to feel very lethargic all the time and all day long and I did not connect it to this supplement. So I took it for several months. I finally realized that it could be the cause and within a day of stopping it, I had far more energy and I stopped feeling lethargic.<br/><br/>The point about taking a thyroid supplement is that it should help give you MORE energy rather than make you so terribly lethargic and tired, with achy muscles and so on. So remember if after a couple of weeks of taking this product, you feel like you want to go back to bed all the time, you need to stop taking it.
 It worked and felt great for the first 2 weeks but then I realized that I needed something more to help with my thyroid. I'm now taking their adrenal support, so we'll see how that goes.
 Seems to work and give me an energy boost
 It is very easy to take. I find that it has helped with my mood and appetite. Maybe it is a coincidence, but I have lost 5 pounds in 15 days. I would definitely purchase this product again and will purchase other products.
 I have not yet started taking the supplement because I just received it. What a wonderful surprise when I opened the box and saw the offer to get a free bottle!!!  Thank you so very much!  Talk about great customer service from the start. I chose this product because of the reviews and natural ingredients in the product. I am looking forward to using this product and getting the results explained on the box. I will write back after completing both bottles. Thank you again.
 I purchased this recently after going through what I believe to be pre menopausal symptoms, including lethargy, mood swings, increased appetite, decreased metabolism, hair loss, brain fog, etc... I have been taking this product for nearly a week and I have noticed several changes.  Increased sustained energy, improved focus, and decreased appetite.  Additionally, I have not experienced any nausea by taking first thing in the morning before eating.  I am very impressed with this product and will continue to take it as long as it makes me feel this good!
 . I don't like the prescription medicine as I prefer natural remedies as much as possible. I read all the reviews and product info before deciding to purchase Thyroid Support.  Based on that info,  It seems to address the symptoms I continually experience. (Low energy, hot flashes, dry skin and hair loss) and product users seem satisfied with their results. I will be starting the product tomorrow and am anxious to see if I can obtain the results other users claim. Will be submitting another review after a month.
 This supplement seems to help support my thyroid to operate at a normal range,
 I bought it to see if it would help me stay warmer, since I'm always cold. I am noticeably colder when I don't take it. And I've also noticed that I seem to have less gray hair!!  So I do plan on continuing to buy this product.
 I am sleeping better and deeper and have more energy.
 Thyroid support was received quickly. The supplement is reviewed highly. After a few weeks of taking it, I had my blood tested. The results will be back in a week. So far, very good.
 On my 3rd bottle.... what can I say IT WORKS!  I love this supplement.  I have energy, I am loosing weight and I no longer drink coffee to get my butt out of bed.
 So... I got a massage,  a real good one.  But...  When it was over I still had tight muscles deep in my shoulders and lower back.  All from stress.  The masseuse suggested that I had a problem with my Thyroid.  So I found this product on amazon.  I've been taking it for about two weeks now twice a day after meals.  Those muscles are looser and I'm getting better sleep.
 Waste of money!  I’ve only taken this for a few days and have felt horrible, extremely moody, horrible headaches, horrible reflux!  So disappointed, I want a refund!
 So far energy has been better. Brain fog diminishing and sleeping better.I feel less moody and more like my old self. I will definitely purchase again.
 I have been taking thyroid support for over 2 weeks now and feel more alert during the day. I also find myself not feeling so fatigued. I look forward to results with continued use.
 I used this 6monghs ago and noticed a huge difference after I ran out tried a different brand with no luck I should have never tried to fix what wasn't broke so I am back to the one body brand with hopes of success again
 My wife and I have noticed more energy, focus, weight loss and an overall healthy feeling every day since taking supplement. We are continuing using the product. Ordering more today. Thank you!!!
 I have noticed an increase in energy and I will be having lab work this week to see if this has helped my numbers come down.
 Definitely the best product that I've used in terms of supporting my thyroid. I believe I have undiagnosed hashimoto's disease so with a low carb diet, exercise and this thyroid support the weight melts off, my hair gets stronger and my skin looks healthier. Fantastic product!
 I wake up in the morning a little more energized so only 1 cup of coffee instead of 3. I have a little more energy during the day and less brain fog. Also I do not have to turn up the temperature in my house as much as I feel the cold less.
 I have only been taking this for a short while but have already noticed increased energy.  Product came quickly and well packaged.  I would definitely order again.
 Just started taking it, but a friend of mine recommend she feels so good and she looks skinny! So I decided to leave the one doctor give me and try this one
 Haven't started taking the product yet, but I'm impressed with the affordable pricing, the free extra bottle that they're shipping which shows confidence and sincerity in what this company is doing. I've been struggling with thyroid support management and some products are just too expensive. I'm hoping that this product works as well as the ones I've used in the past. If so, I'll be a lifer!
 Great product! I have more energy than ever before! Can't wait to see my levels on my next doctor's visit!
 i have taken this for two weeks and noticed a difference in the first few days. i have more energy and im more focused at work. theres a clear difference. i take one in the morning and i sometimes take another one in the evening. when i first started i took two together in the morning. not sure how it should be taken, but i take one in morning now and if I need extra enegry might take another as needed.
 I noted an almost immediate positive reaction after taking this supplement. I had been feeling dragged out for awhile and ordered this. I'm feeling so much more vitality. My mood has improved, as well.
 so far no noticeable results
 I used to be in medical research &amp; was contaminated with a radioactive version of iodine, I-131.  (This is sounds waaaaaaay more dramatic than it is.)  So my thyroid levels have been borderline on the low side &amp; some in the normal range.  Whether this is the result of the accident or because of normal body chemistry is hard to say.  Consequently, I have "judged" my thyroid health by how I feel &amp; the amount of energy I have.  I have been using this product for a month now &amp; will keep using it.  (I think you have to wait a little while to assess overall effectiveness.)  I have a steady energy &amp; can wake up easily.  I have not recently had my levels retested so I do not have any numerical evidence.  I can say though that I before this I was using a thyroid support supplement from Natural Creations (which is also coincidentally more expensive) &amp; I have had better results with the Best Thyroid Support.  I also want to emphasize that, at  least me personally, I have to drink lots of water with any supplement I take to avoid headaches.  Overall, I think this is a good product &amp; I will continue to use it.  And, I have lost a SMALL amount of weight since I've been using this product.  This could also be because I am not craving the certain foods the way I was before.
 Great product - In just 15 days I have lost 4 pounds without change in diet.
 I haven't noticed any excessive weight loss like some have posted. But I do feel better and have much more energy than I have in a long time. Very happy with this product and will purchase again!
 Seems to be working well.
 I have been taken this for two weeks now and can notice I have more energy to get things done around the ranch.
 I can tell that my lows in my energy are not as low as they were. I do have more energy in general, however I am far from cured. For that I have to repair my Immune system. However this is defiantly helping.
 As a tennis payer, I really noticed how much better I felt and played on the court!
 I just started taking the Thyroid Support!  The product got to my home in a very timely manner and I got a very nice email with the free download about Thyroid Support...It had menu options and more information on the thyroid and why this product could help my lethargy, joint aches, and all around sluggishness.  I heard about this product from one of my "mommy" boards on FB and it got rave reviews!  I'm so excited to get started!
 I just started using this thyroid support supplement but I can feel a difference. My hands and feet are normally cold and I noticed that my circulation and warmth has increased. I've started off with just one because I already have insomnia. I do feel like my cravings may not be as bad.
 Started feeling relief after the first week, will recommend to others!
 I have been taking this product for two months in addition to my thyroid medication and I absolutely feel that it has helped me to regain some of my energy back, cut down on cravings, etc. that are associated with thyroid dysfunction.  I would highly recommend this supplement to any one out there looking for relief from their thyroid issues!
 This product saved my Moms thyroid from inflammation and swelling caused by toxic fumes from meth lab next door!!<br/>I also try this product - yes it gives energy and opens your brain.<br/>Will recommend
 I have been using this supplement twice daily as directed and have 6 pounds in 15 days! I am an active workout person who eats healthy-so I attribute it to this supplement.
 Obsessed with this stuff, really works... and they send you a free bottle in the mail. I figured it would be a month before I got that or more, it came in the same time as the first bottle. AMAZING!
 This has greatly improved the brain fog and fatigue I had been experiencing.  I've been using this for about 3 weeks now and the difference is amazing. I can't say it's helped with weight loss, but that wasn't the reason I purchased it.
 I really like this product and felt it was very effective in making me feel energetic with clear thinking. It is well worth the price and a great addition to the prescription products I take.
 It has given me more energy and I sleep better. I don’t have to worry about any side effects with this like I did with the medication that I was on. I am so glad that I found Thyroid Support.
 More energy and alertness. Boost results of other supplements that I take.
 I immediately noticed a difference in how rested I feel in the morning. Many of my negative thyroid side effects seem to be gone.
 The customer service of this company is GREAT! I haven't tried the product yet, but I got another free bottle out of it from 1 Body. I'm really looking forward to trying this product and think I will love it and continue to use it.
 Thyroid support was the missing piece in treating my hypothyroidism. I continue to take my prescription medication but the addition of Thyroid Support has improved my symptoms.
 Helped energy level, helped to sleep better and helped keep extremities from being as cold.
 These gave me energy. I can feel them working.
 For the last 5+ years I have noticed drastic changes with my body. Constantly tired, even when I sleep 8+hrs a night. Brittle nails, dry thinning hair, little to no libido, weight gain, mood swings, and the list goes on. I "Googled" diagnosed myself as possibly having a thyroid imbalance. I decided to try a "vitamin" because I hate taking medicine. I am happy to say, I feel better!! I don't always feel hungry and sluggish, I feel rested and refreshed after a good night sleep etc. I am happy to say, I am on week 3 of waking up before my alarm goes off and that says alot for me!!! I will continue to use!! Thank You!!!!!
 Day 2: I think this stuff works. I feel less tired and my nails went from being soft to being strong. I'm loving this product so far. I'll update y'all after a week or two of using the product (if I remember to)
 I gave it 5 start because it shipped fast and there was a coupon for a full sized free item.  That was fantastic.  However, I have not even started this product so I cannot review the product as of yet, but I will review it in a month.  Cheers!
 Great find!!
 I purchased Thyroid Support because after several days of research it seems to have the supplements that I'm looking for. I can't give it five stars right now but will amend my review in a couple of weeks.
 My legs don't hurt; less pain, more energy.  Wish I had discovered this product sooner.
 I started taking this supplement in February because I was told that I was border line hypothyroidism and my doctor wanted to start a low dose of Synthroid (which I didn't want to take).  I had some symptoms, such as weight gain, moody, and felt tired.  After taking this supplement for almost 2 months, I have noticed that my mood is better and I seem to have more energy.  Also may blood work came back and my TSH levels are awesome!!
 dont see any difference
 Have gone through one bottle so far and I can honestly say that it's a great product. I have noticed i have more energy and I'm able to focus better at work. I also wake up earlier and feel rested. Not sure what the effects are suppose to be but that's what I have noticed. I think my metabolism is better too because I've noticed I digest food quicker after taking it. I take one in the morning and one in the evening. Haven't noticed any side effects.
 I don't like anymore this product it is not working for me
 I am extremely pleased with this product.  I have been using it for over a month now and my energy level has increased substantially.  I will be renewing my order to ensure I receive maximum benefits from this product.
 not sure yet.
 I have been taking this product for 15 days and it has given me more energy than I have had in a while.  I now wake up less tired and feel refreshed. This is a great product.
 This product is amazing.  I have been taking it for 30 days now and I have results to prove it. I’ve had a weight loss/gain issue forever. Now I can proudly say I am down 15 lbs and keeping it off. I can’t wait to see what next month holds.  My energy levels have definitely soared. Thanks so much.
 I've only been taking this for a couple weeks.  I also take a prescription thyroid medication.  My energy level is up and my joint pain is down!  I will say it is important to not take this on an empty stomach as it seems to make me a bit nauseous.  I just wait until after I eat something before I take it.
 I have just begun taking this supplement a few weeks ago. There is certainly a subtle difference I can definitely attribute to this supplement. I really need to take it a bit longer to tell how much it is truly helping. It is a good blend. I will try to update my review in the future!
 I’ve been taking this for a while. I do notice that if I run out I get a bit cranky. This helps with my moods. I use this also along with my thyroid medication.
 I have been taking these for a couple weeks now along with my thyroid medicine and I can really tell a difference in my energy levels. I have bumped up my speed on the treadmill by 1.5 miles since taking these :)"
 I just received by bottle and I am looking forward to seeing how it will work for me.  I received the item very quickly along with a coupon for a free bottle.  You can't do better than that.  I read the reviews for several thyroid supplements and 1Body seemed to get the best.
 I've only been taking this for about a month.  I didn't realize how much sleep I was missing out on, before I started taking these.  I take one each morning and have never slept better.  I feel refreshed when I wake up; not drowsy.  I haven't taken them long enough to realize what other effects it may have, but if I continue to get the sleep I'm getting now, I plan on keeping them.
 I have been researching supplements that support my thyroid condition and this product has been the answer to what I’ve been looking for. Thank you for finally creating a quality product that works all in one capsule,
 Not sure why, but this product made my blood pressure increase.
 I haven't noticed a difference in me at all but the product is easy to take and easy on my sensitive stomach as long as I take it with food.
 Good stuff when I take with Nascent Iodine. I have hypo symptoms off and on, and watching how clean I eat, in addition to taking this daily seems to give me my life back to some degree! I'm a busy mom of two autistic kiddos and when I'm extremely hypo, it is usually because I forgot to take my thyroid supplement or because I couldn't afford it that month. Good stuff.
 I just received the product and took 1 capsule, which is easy to swallow. The box  and the bottle give good impression :-)<br/> Really like the components that are listed, they arel very important for proper functioning of the thyroid gland.
 I'm very happy with this product. I take it as directed and even on the first day I felt a difference in my body which helps me know I definitely need to seek a higher medical source to figure out my thyroid. But these definitely help with the in between portion.
 I’ve had severe hypothyroidism for years and this helps so much! I have energy and just overall feel a lot better since taking this alongside my normal prescription.
 Improved sleep quality and helped with fatigue, will continue using.
 I haven’t finished my first bottle yet but I can feel the difference especially in memory, the fogginess has completely gone away and I do have more energy. I have blood work next month and I’m looking forward to the results. I want to get completely off my thyroid meds.
 This has been a great addition to my prescribed thyroid meds.  Energy levels have definitely come up in the past 2 weeks.  Likely loving this one to auto-ship.
 Better than Synthetic Thyroid medication
 I take one in the evening as I take the natural thyroid prescription in the morning. I have noticed an increased ability of food digestion and less bloating.
 I not sure if I find a difference - I will update after my bloodwork in May.
 Makes a difference and I do feel better and have more energy!  Less tired.  Better mood.
 I've been taking this product for a few weeks as a supplement to my prescribed Naturethroid and have already seen improvement in my energy and mood.  Would highly recommend as an added boost!
 I wasn’t sure if it was helping until after I ran out. A few weeks later I realized my thyroid issue symptoms were getting worse.
 While I am on thyroid medication ... I was still not myself .... Tired and irritable with brain fog. the doctor says levels are normal at a 2 and  just ignore me.  I took this for a month and noticed a difference in three weeks with more energy and less brain fog.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for approximately 2 months. This Thyroid Support supplement has definitely helped to increase my clarity and focus, and over all energy. I would highly recommend to anyone that is dealing with any thyroid deficiencies.
 I have only been using this product for a very short time, but so far I am happy with it. I chose it after looking for an herbal supplement for thyroid support and read so many good reviews of this particular brand here on Amazon. I will update my review after more time has passed..
 I've been taking these for almost 2 weeks now and I feel like I have more energy, less fatigue, less anxiety/moodiness, and overall I feel slightly better than I did before taking them. I am only taking two pills a day though. There was a user who said they really felt the benefits of these pills when taking 3 a day, so I think I'll try 3 a day and I will update this review to let you all know how I feel. Thanks.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for 3 weeks.  I have lost 3 pounds.  I have so much more pep and energy that I am getting things done that I was putting off.  I think burning the extra calories each day is doing the trick.  I am 68 years old and could stand to lose about 15 pounds.  I will continue taking this product.  Thank you.<br/>PS I would give 5 stars if I had lost 6 pounds.
 I only started this 2 weeks ago. I researched a lot of product and supplements to help thyroid and this one seems to have the most beneficial ingredients. They also offer a coupon with the next bottle free so they must feel sure of their product.
 I have been taking this product twice a day for the past three weeks and I am pleased to notice that my hair is no longer falling, I have slowly shed a few pounds and I have more energy.  I should have a blood test in two weeks and I am curious to see if my numbers will be better...  I am planning to reorder, it's a good supplement which works.  I like the research behind it.
 The last few months I have been feeling very tired, but yet I could not seem to fall asleep at night. As time went on I was getting moody and making my life and everyone elses life miserable. I had been trying everything, when I came across your product on  Amazon. After reading the reviews I decided to try Thyroid Support. Within a few days I began to feel better, I would recommend this product.
 I have fibromyalgia and adrenal fatigue. Since I have been taking the Thyroid Support for about 2 months now I have noticed a huge improvement with my energy. I even ran out for a few days and saw the difference between taking it and not taking it and my fatigue came back while I was not taking it. I can't express how happy I was when I received my second bottle and could start taking it again to boost my energy again. I highly recommend trying this product if you have adrenal or thyroid issues.
 Great product that is alleviating a lot of my symptoms.  I am definitely buying this again and will probably set up a subscription so I don't have to worry about ordering more when I need it.
 Ok I think you just keep asking the same questions until we give up .......I give up...keep it
 The fact that it has several ingredients in it that supports your thyroid is a huge plus.  There isn't anything about this product I don't like.  I will continue to take it.
 I haven't been taking this product long, but can definitely see a difference in my energy and sleep.  I am encouraged that the benefits will be worth the price of the product.
 Excellent product. Hair and nails growing faster. Sleeping better.
 I bought this product a little over a month ago and it has been great, Not only has it helped my thyroid problems but.  It has helped with weight loss too.  For the first time in a long time I have actually lost weight.
 Just received my first bottle and hoping this helps with my low energy level. I bought this because there were so many positive reviews about other's getting results from this product.
 I gives me more energy and i feel more normal. I feel that this product has a high quality and really works great!
 Gives me more energy for sure and appears to boost my metabolism since I have been on my diet.
 Since taking them I have noticed less hair loss and I have more energy throughout the day.  I have an easier time getting up in the morning.  I have not had any side effects from taking them and will continue as long as I keep feeling more energy.
 i used it for hair growth
 My doctor said I was borderline for needing a RX for my thyroid.  I had been getting tired a lot more and a total lack of energy.  I decided to try "1 Body" because it is all natural. I have been using it for a week now and have noticed and increase in energy and just an overall feeling better.  I am hoping for some weight loss in the next couple of weeks. Thanks
 I have only been taking this product less than a week but i can already tell that this is different! I feel so much better and have energy! Finally, something that works! i have hope again that I can get my body (and health) back
 I haven’t noticed anything drastic, but I will increase my dose and see what happens. I look forward to receiving the free bottle to continue my self-experimentation.
 This is an excellent supplement. I take in addition to my NP Thyroid. I feel more energy. I can actually make it through a movie without falling asleep on the couch. Love this product and will continue to take
 Makes a huge difference in keeping my endocrine system happy. Fatigue-menstruation cycle- brain fog. Great supplement to help keep Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Chronic Lymes in check.
 I am hypothyroid and take meds for the condition  I have been taking supplement for over a month. It has helped with symptoms the meds did not.  I feel more "normal".
 Only been taking it two weeks ,but it is gentle on my sensitive stomach. It  gives me subtle, but sustained energy during my day. Not too strong.
 I have felt more energy and noticed Bing able to focus a lot better. Defiantly plan on reordering.
 I am very hopeful about this product.  I have only just started using it, so it is too early to provide real feedback on the product.  But, it has great reviews and it shipped quickly and I even had a voucher to get a second one free!
 I feel more alert throughout the day and I don't feel like I have to rely on caffeine at all anymore
 I can honestly say I feel more energetic. However, my sleeping pattern is still disrupted but perhaps it's premature to expect discernable changes in my sleep cycle. I recommend this product and will continue to monitor how my body responds to this product.
 I could definitely tell a difference in my energy level.  I felt more motivated and didn't have that mid-day lull.  My doctor said he thought I had thyroid issues, but my blood work came back just on the cusp of needing medicine.  This is perfect.
 I got all three products three days into taking them. Let me just say I have been struggling with low energy, mental block and issues with gout like symptoms in my feet. I started the Adrenal, Thyroid and Liver support. Since the three day's of taking the product, I'm sleeping for at least 4 hours straight, and feel the fog is lifting. My foot pain is easing, not sure if it's even related but I am thankful for it.
 I have an underactive thyroid. Recently I started looking for ways to support my thyroid, especially since I don't think I get a lot of iodine in my diet.  I've been on thyroid replacement medication, but I've been steadily gaining wait over the last few years. I've been taking this for a little over a month now. I feel it's increased my energy overall. I don't get tired as early at night as I used to. I've been working to improve my diet, and exercise, and I've started loosing weight. I think this supplement has aided in that venture as well.
 More energy less tired.
 I've tried many of these supplements and, while they typically have similar ingredients, this one not only works great but the customer service offered by the company makes it hard to buy from anyone else! Thank you so much!
 I am using that product only for 10 days but I have starts to loosing weight !!!! Feel great and because I am loosing weight my mood is better. No any side affects . Highly recommend.
 This product works. I was skeptical at first, but decided to try it (anything really!), after experiencing both hypo and hyper symptoms on my current thyroid medication. I honestly did feel that the raging "storm" I was experiencing calmed down considerably after only 5 or 6 days, and I now feel well enough to get back into my exercise program and get healthy again!
 I had more energy after taking Thyroid Support after just a few days.  After 3 weeks now I have lost 3 pounds.  My thyroid levels are low but Not too low so I told my doctors I did not want to take and medicine and wanted to try a natural supplement first and this fits the bill.
 Didn't see any significant difference but it did break me out and I was not able to take every day.
 I just received the product. I choose this thyroid supplement because of all the good reviews. I hope that it will help me as well as I have been suffering from thyroid issues. I will update this review.
 I really felt like it helped. I had more energy and I felt a difference within a week.
 Worked for wife
 Felt on edge, anxious, the entire time I took this product, caused panic attacks. Be careful!<br/>Product did not work as advertised, did nothing for my thyroid, had to dispose it as trash.
 I take levothyroxine/Synthroid for my hypothyroid condition. I had been noticing "mental fog" and tiredness/fatigue. My wife found this product and I decided to take it. I believe it's been helping me to have more mental clarity and less "bone tiredness."
 It took about a week and my energy was back. Getting up early for work and feeling wide awake...all day. Able to get back into painting and enjoying a lot of things that I used to do. I will continue to use this product!
 Only been using for a week, and noticed a difference instantly.  It is so nice to be able to get through a whole day without feeling like you need a nap every few hours!
 I feel like my metabolism is roaring! This is a great product. I've taken other iodine supplements, but this is the best. And my TSH levels dropped. Much better than medication.
 I have been using this product with the Adrenal Support Supplement for about 2 weeks.  I am pleasantly surprised by the results I have seen in such a short about of time.<br/><br/>I have a much improved frame of mind, energy, and general good overall outlook.<br/><br/>I highly recommend these products, no one was more surprised than me that the reviews are right on.
 I have been taking this product since end of October, 2015, works very well with my digestive systems, unbelievable results, such as a glowing facial skin after 1.5 months taking it, other people noticed too. Best work for me is to take one in the morning, one in the evening, with minimum one banana a day, and don't over eat.  Very happy with this product.
 I have been taking this less than two weeks, so, I'm basing my opinion on a short amount of time. So far, I feel a difference in my energy level. I'm not as sluggish in the afternoons. I have found it easier to get to sleep; something I have a definite issue with. Going to give it a try for a couple of months. Generally, while taking this product I feel pretty good, better than I was before.
 Very helpful, and works great.
 I haven't noticed a whole lot of change, except I feel like I've had a little more energy.  I am really hoping it helps so I want to keep taking it. I love that they are offering to give me a free bottle!
 This product has worked wonders at stabilizing my thyroid hormone levels.  I have had fluctuating dosages of synthroid for years and nothing has helped me to maintain stability in my levels like this product.  I have been using it for 3 months now with great results since about 6 weeks in and will continue to use this!
 I have hypothyroidism and some down sides to having this is hair loss. Since taking these pills i've started seeing baby hairs coming back in like crazy! and it's made me not so hungry all the time which is a huge plus!
 My doctor had me on some prescription medications for low thyroid counts which caused a lot of side effects. I have since stopped those medications and switched to this thyroid supplement from 1Body. This seems to be working quite well so far. I feel a lot better and have none of the previous side effects. My latest blood counts show my thyroid counts are almost up into the normal range. I plan to continue taking this product and hope to see even further improvement. Thank you 1Body!
 I like that these have decreased the amount of headaches i was getting. Still hoping to notice some more changes by the 2nd month.
 Thanks.
 I feel like I have more energy than I did before.  I am hopeful that through continued use I will see and feel even more benefits than I am currently experiencing.
 Love this product. It has helped me feel normal again and I have way more energy. I’m so glad I trusted the other reviews and gave this a try.
 Seems to be working.  Not tired like I usually am, been taking for 2 weeks now. I have so much energy now it's unbelievable!  Get bloodwork done next week.  We'll see how my levels are.
 Great product. Feel less bloated and more in control of my emotions.
 I just started taking this product yesterday and I woke up this morning feeling wonderful.  I am purchasing another bottle.  Been taking it for a while and I feel great.<br/><br/>Millie H.
 I have only just started taking this and already feel better than I have in a long while. I have a lot more energy and my three nights later slept great and woke up with clear white eyes, lots of energy and did not hit my snooze a million times, I only gave 4 stars because I just started and I know everyone's body is different the way pills work, but this was a quick start for me and I am very happy for a change.
 I've only been using it approximately 2 weeks.  So far, the biggest difference I've seen is in my energy levels.  It has cleared my "afternoon funk" and I am able to wake up in the mornings when my alarm goes off.  For now, I'm taking it in combination with Armour, but I think it's made more of a difference than the prescription.  I've tried many approaches to naturally treat hypothyroidism, and this seems to be the most effective thus far.
 I have only been taking this product for a couple of weeks but i already noticed increase in energy. I have low thyroid so i take this as an addition to my current perscription medication. Only time will tell if i find it to be helpful with weight.
 This is a great product.  I have fatigue and sleep issue for a while.  Since start taking the supplement, I felt that my energy is improved and my sleeping seems better. Highly recommend people who have thyroid issues to give it a try
 I will buy again
 I notice I have way more energy! I am also sleeping better and have experienced some weight loss! I definitely think that that this supplement has helped me immensely and I wish I would have started to take it sooner.
 I feel this product strengthened my system, increased my energy and helped me make improvements by sticking to exercise and eating right, which I could not do with my thyroid being weaker.
 I have more energy and had a consistent eye twitch that is gone after 15 days of taking thyroid support.
 I've read nothing but unbelievably great reviews for this product. I recently took a thyroid test that came out higher than the average range and because I don't have health care I thought id try this before going broke with Dr. fees! Excited to see how it goes! If I end up feeling even half as good as the people in all the other reviews I'll be stoked! :)
 It really helps! I had constant mood changes, after taking different vitamins, I finally got to the idea that it might be due to thyroid insufficiency. I looked up for several products and finally decided to go with this one. Had a lot of positive reviews ( for a reason). Even thought I am taking it for a few weeks only, I feel much better.
 So far I have more energy and less brain fog and happier mood.
 I will begin taking this tomorrow. I am looking forward to it. Hoping that it will make some differences in some issues I believe are happening. Rather choose natural rather than pharmacy meds.
 Good product, less headaches, more energy. Hopefully better results after continued use
 UPDATE: Just thought you all should know: This product didn't work for ME &amp; I was very careful to point that out in my review. Apparently,  my review was noticed by the manufacturer (1 BODY) &amp; they immediately issued me a refund. I did not request a refund, but it was given to me nonetheless. I think this is a VERY nice gesture &amp; a good business practice. This shows me that they stand behind their products &amp; as a result, I will be actively looking to them for other supplements in the future.<br/><br/>I couldn't really tell if this did or didn't help me one way or the other. I didn't notice an increase in energy or a change in my weight up or down. I honestly couldn't tell whether I took it or not most days. I took this daily faithfully &amp; I'm sad to say this product did not benefit me in ANY way, shape or form. That's not to say it won't work for you. I've read a lot of positive results from this supplement &amp; we are all different physiologically, so it may be helpful for someone else, just not me.
 Thyroid support has excellent ingredients to maintain a healthy thyroid if you do not produce enough naturally. Great product for low function
 I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a change in my mental and emotional well being, I’ve chosen 4 stars because I feel it’s still too early to give a full review
 I have noticed an improvement in my energy level and have noticed my cravings for sweets and carbs has decreased which has helped to improve my bloating and weight. Will have thyroid levels checked again in 2 months
 I typically have problems with energy so i decided to try this product out. I do feel a bit more alert after taking these. I also have chronic constipation and since taking these i have been able to go pretty regularly.
 I used to take Enzymatic Thyroid Formula but it's been discontinued.  this product is an ok replacement
 I thought this would give me more energy...It did the opposite. I am restless at night, not sleeping, feel like I hit a "wall".<br/>My hands and body feel very heavy....
 The thyroid problem has finally met it's match!  I will not allow myself to run out of this product and I am only writing a review because I am on my second bottle and can say, without reservation, that I feel normal for the first time in a long time.  If you want to fix your thyroid, give this a try.  And with no side effects - just results - what have you got to lose?
 Noticed a difference after taking one capsule. I just received this product yesterday and took my first capsule last night. I wouldn't recommend taking it at night as it gives you energy, mental clarity,  and motivation (this was MY personal experience). I gave it five stars because of the positive experience I've had with just one capsule. I'll have to return at a later date to review again when I've used it for a month or so.
 Haven't been to the doctor yet to get my levels checked since taking Thyroid Support, but I can't wait to see if there is a change. I feel much better since taking Thyroid Support and have lost a little weight.  I have been taking them for over a month now.
 I have seen a difference after using this product for about 4 weeks.  I have more energy and am sleeping better through the night!
 I have more energy when I take these supplements and I it keeps me awake at work.
 I have noticed that it smooths out my energy levels through the day.
 I started feeling less tired imidiately and have lost a couple pounds
 still early in using these but so far feel a little more energy.  ill update after i finish the bottle off.  always good to try a natural way before having doctors push drugs on you.
 Noticed a difference both physically &amp; mentally by taking this product.
 Sleep has been nearly impossible for me for years. Thyroid support has improved my sleep most nights. It also seems to be slowing the disturbing hair loss that has been happening.
 Awesome product I have so much energy all day
 I have been taking this thyroid support for just over two weeks.  I am hoping to see the effects of it soon.  I can attest to the effectiveness of the Adrenal Support by 1 Body.  Within 2-3 days, I could tell it was working and was able to feel by body getting back into the correct circadian rhythms.  I was waking refreshed and found myself sleepy and ready for bed at a decent hour.  Just what my body was needing.
 I have had all the symptoms of thyroid insufficiency for many years.  I've been tested by doctors and all day in in the "normal range." I just haven't had the time or energy to fight for treatment.  Lately my symptoms have gotten worse and I knew i needed to do something. I just couldn't bear to go back to the doctor and yet again be told I'm fine.  I have been taking this supplement for a few weeks now. Initially I wasn't feeling much but things take time to work and I'm patient.  Slowly I've begun to have more energy and improved mood,  a more level appetite which makes me think my blood sugar is more stable,  and have been sleeping like a log.  This supplement really works.  The only issue that it hasn't helped with yet is my weight.  I have had unexplained weight gain in the past few years.  Even controlling calories religiously and eating an extremely clean, healthy diet has only stabilized my weight but no amount of work makes it budge,  not even a pound. I am still hopeful that as this supplement balances my body,  the weight will start to shift.
 I've used this for three weeks.  Haven't noticed a difference in energy, however the dry skin on my arms has cleared up.  I will continue to see if this improvement lasts through the winter months.
 Haven't tried it yet, hoping the reviews hold up, my hair is falling out really badly :( I'm on my fourth pill, my energy is up though.
 For full disclosure I received one free bottle in addition of the one I bought. I feel good after taking this product.It is a well balanced natural blend of ingredients well known for their health benefits.
 It's helping me to feel balanced. My thyroid was slightly underactive and now it's doing its job!
 I have noticed an increase in my energy level and mood. I haven't experienced less of an appetite or weight loss however I am hopeful if I give it a longer period of time I may see results in those areas as well.
 Not sure if it helped but didn't hurt me.  Thanks.
 Has helped with my afternoon crash feel better
 I purchased product to boost my thyroid levels where I had been taking Levothyroxine instead of this supplement.  June blood tests will tell the story...
 I love this product. I have been suffering from extreme fatigue. This product has completely changed that
 easy to take. just 2 weeks so im not shure weel it it work. But i will take it for 3 months ND SEE.
 I became dizzy with headaches and cannot take this with my precription thyroid medication.
 I have Thyroid Cancer and I am always considered hyper as a result of my medication. Thyroid Support helps me sleep better and reduces my anxiety. It also helps with my mood swings.
 Very pleased with this product...have more energy, quality sleep.
 Less brain fog. Increase in energy. Seeing less hair loss as well.
 I struggled with itching on my legs and back. After I started this medicine I felt a great deal of relief. Just the relief from that makes it worth purchasing again!
 Used it all... couldn't tell a difference
 Perfect natural product. Far better alternative to prescription drugs for thyroid. Natural &amp; safe. Fast delivery.
 I have been taking the thyroid support along with adrenal support for about 3 months now. With changing my diet, I have noticed l'm not as fatigued and my hormones are more balanced.
 I think I’m getting a little more energy from it, but it’s hard to tell. I’m still waiting to feel better, but I do feel like the supplement is helping. Trying to help combat hashimotos symptoms.
 The thyroid support product gives me energy when I am feeling lifeless.  I am using it as a supplement to my thyroid medicine.
 Wow! I just took this for the first time at night, thinking it wouldn't do anything.  Now I'm sitting here wide awake!  It gave me a very noticeable energy boost...I just wish I would have taken it in the morning.  I almost didn't believe all of the 5 star reviews, but this product really delivers.
 Excellent product!
 Loving it so far! More energy and I don't feel tired in the morning when I wake up after a full nights sleep!! I've only been on this for a little over a week but I've lost 1 lb already!! I can tell this is going to help a lot with my metabolism and energy! Totally recommend this to anyone!!
 I am planning to keep using it.
 After 2 weeks of taking this Thyroid Support supplement, I have had an immense improvement in my overall health and wellbeing.  Better sleep, more energy and just feeling "right".
 Gives me way more energy! So tired without it. I used to take synthetic thyroid medication for Hashimotos but it didn’t make me feel much better. So I found this on amazon and I love it! Gives me extra energy and just makes me feel overall better
 I like that I had no side affects.  I took this for hypothroidism.  Haven’t been retested yet, but I feel good.
 This gave me immediate energy. Almost TOO much energy. I had my thyroid removed with RAI and I struggle to feel well and maintain weight despite a very active lifestyle and good eats. It’s too early to tell but I’m hopeful this will help.
 I am hypothyroid and was taking a different supplement before this one and I did not notice much difference.  This product seems to be helping with my sleep during the day I have more energy.
 I have been suffering from hypothyroidism for several years now and this is the only product that has made me feel better.  I have more energy, lost weight and my hair fills thicker.  Thank you
 I've noticed increased energy and decreased anxiety along with better sleep, not longer sleep but better sleep over the last three months. I plan on continuing use to see if there are any weight loss benefits.
  Since I started taking it I seem to have more energy and I believe I have lost some weight. I just feel more happier!!! 
 I have noticed a drastic change in my sleep pattern.  I am finally getting a restful night's sleep!  In addition, I have lost some weight since taking this supplement.  I am excited to see what the long-term benefits are.  I have only been taking the pills a few weeks now.  Great product so far!
 The product arrived quickly and seems to be high quality.  It's too early to determine how well it works.  I will take it for a few months and see if I notice positive changes.
 I feel a boost of energy when I take this. Hopefully it starts to help with the body aches and the cold intolerance soon.
 In the beginning stages of taking this supplement so it will take additional time to know if it's helping on multiple levels. It MAY be helping with hair fall out but only time will tell.
 I do feel that the supplements are giving me a slight boost in energy. I'm hoping prolonged use will continue to improve my overall health
 I have been taking thyroid support for almost a month and I have more energy and have been less moody
 Product seems to work well. I don’t know that it’s a replacement for diagnosed thyroid disorders but seems to help minor thyroid problems. I notice more energy and mental clarity when I take this supplement.
 I'm still trying to notice the full benefits from the product. While I am noticing some benefits, there are some lifestyle changes I need to make in order to know just how this product is helping me.
 Just like my previous review, I just started taking this along with the adrenal support. With the reviews I read I am really hoping that these work out for me. I am having such a hard time with fatigue and losing my hair. My body hurts. Im constantley grumpy and I cant concentrate for the life of me. Im keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that I start to feel better
 Very pleased with this product. I did experience some swelling in hands and feet due to the sodium. Other than that I have noticed a significant different with my fatigue.
 Not as cold even with below 0 degrees F outside; able to wake just before my alarm goes off; no weight gain over the holidays; subtle change in my energy—not crashing with fatigue in the afternoon but able to continue calmly through the afternoon.
 Supports thyroid
 It reduced my anxiety levels and improved my sleeping patterns
 anxious to begin this supplement.  I need help with a low T level and shrunken thyroid but because I also have Graves Disease, the dr will not put me on any thyroid medication.
 I feel like I have more energy and I'm not as tired as I used to be in the afternoons.
 Good
 I’ve noticed while taking this I’m sleeping better and the bloated feeling/swelling has disappeared. I would buy again.
 I just received the product &amp; got it fast. Only been taking it for a day but I feel like I have more energy. I work nights so I need all the help I can get!!
 Great product and I can feel a difference and will continue taking the Thyroid Support!!  Thank you!!
 I have been taking these for almost 3 weeks, I am more hungry Now than before taking these pills. Going to try and send these back.<br/>Went to thyroid specialist and she immediately stopped these pills and said they contain two things on list that have iodine and can cause hypothyroidism. So buyer beware... customer service thiough is amazing doe this pill.
 I love the product. I've been more alert since taking it twice a day. Good product !
 I don't feel as sluggish as I did before starting this.
 This supplement is for my wife, I can't give 5 stars because she just started taking it. So far she she said she likes it and feels that she has more energy.
 I have been taking the product for a little over 2 weeks. I seem to have more energy and, for the most part, am sleeping more soundly.  I am hoping that continued use will also assist in weight loss, since I seem to be headed back toward feeling more "normal".
 just started using this product,,seems that i am noticing a little difference already,,my tiredness seems less,,hope this continues,,will keep you posted,,thank you
 Since I started taking it, I have a lot more energy and feel better overall.  I will definitely repurchase when I run out.
 It does not give me energy. But it makes me sleep really well.
 I was able to stop taking prescription medicine for that thyroid, cleaned up my diet and use these supplements instead.
 This product helps you have more energy and I’m not tried
 this product helped me lose the stubborn 5 pounds I was having trouble with.  Also sleeping a little better since taking this.
 Good for my thyroid gland. I am under a doctor's care and she approves.
 I was suffering from extreme fatigue and after  taking Thyroid Support for only a couple of days, I began to notice a significant improvement in energy level.
 More energy, especially when I get out of bed in the morning.
 So far I have really liked my thyroid support supplement. I believe I am in the beginning of thyroid issues as it runs in the family. I have not been able to lose weight even with running 4 miles at least 3 days a week. I've excercised more than I ever have before and I have still gradually been gaining weight. I have notice a difference with my appetite after taking the supplement. I know eat less because I feel full like I used to feel before.
 Didn't feel any different with this.
 I just started taking this product and I'm hoping it starts making me feel better. The pills have a strong odor and leave a little after taste, but if it will help with my thyroid issues, it will be well worth it.
 Great result within 2-3 weeks
 I've been taking this product for about three weeks now. My symptoms have subsided for the most part. I no longer feel exhausted and my hair loss has slowed down. I will continue to take this supplement for a few more months to see the full effect.
 i feel more energetic after trying thyroid support
 So far I like it. I paid full price for it. I have gained more energy. I'm not sure about weight loss but my brain is not foggy and can move a lot faster.
 This product has changed my life...I am not kidding...I obviously needed it.  Thank you for the support!
 As of today I've been taking Thyroid Support for 20 days. Along with diet and exercise I've noticed change and most importantly, I feel better, I definitely  will continue to take. Thank you!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support Supplement for about 2 months and I have noticed less hair loss and some improvement in my energy levels.  No change in weight, but that was not my primary objective.
 I’ve been taking this supplement for a few weeks to help treat low thyroid function, and it is wonderful!  I have more energy, less brain fog… my hair stopped shedding and my nails are no longer brittle.  I totally recommend this product for those who suffer with hypothyroidism (once consulting your doctor of course).  Definite bonus that it's a vegan capsule, because of a sensitivity I have to soy.  Love it!
 in one capsule. Can't go wrong.
 I like it. I been taking it for a week so far and I do notice a difference. Especially knowing my thyroid levels were low. I don't know if it's in my head but I do feel more energy and I'm going to continue to take it until the bottle is done and if I feel even better then before I'll buy another bottle. You really do feel it within the first couple days but then again everyone is different. So far so good.
 I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and take prescribed medication daily. On meds for a while and my numbers are still not where they should be, so decided to order this supplement as an extra boost. I’ve been taking this product for a few months now and is seems to be helping. I’ll have a better idea if there are any improvements the next time I see my doctor for testing.
 more energy easy to sowallow
 It's helping me loss weight and I just take 2 a day and it is  doing it'smagic.
 I have been taking this now for three weeks. I really do feel like my energy is coming back and I am emotionally feeling more clear!! Great Product. I would recommend anyone struggling with their thyroid to at least try it for 30 days. :)
 This product gives me more energy.  I like that I can take a supplement to help my hypothyroidism all in one product and not have to buy a bunch of different supplements.
 I've been taking this for a few weeks and feel better than I have after taking synthroid for over 15 years. Hair isn't falling out and is growing in thicker and shinier.
 I have been using this product for about a month now. I have suffered from Hypothyroidism for five years. I experienced weight gain, fatigue and depression. This product has truly worked to relieve my fatigue and i believe it has been the cause of my recent weight loss. I have recommended to my family members as well.
 Helps with stronger nails and less hair loss if you have thyroid issues, but give it an honest 30 days to see results.
 I have already bought 2 more bottles, it has helped me with my hair, skin, nails, depression, gave me more energy. They are top of the line.
 I did experience headaches for the first few days but that went away! And I truely think these pills have helped me lose a few pounds and feel less tired! I just bought my 3rd bottle.
 I've been taking it for a week and I've been feeling better! I am taking 1 in the morning and 1 at night, I'm hoping that over time I'll feel even more of  benefit!
 I feel great! I had a thyroidectomy in 2009 and on synthroid. When I started taking this I noticed my energy levels are higher, my skin looks brighter, my metabolism seems faster. It’s been a great addition to my life.
 I have only been taking this product a little less than a month. It seems like it is helping me regulate things such as sensitivity to cold. I think it might take some time to see more results. Thank you for a great product that puts everything suggested to help in one medication.
 I just received this last week 11/23, so I haven't really been able to assess how well it works.<br/>I chose this product based on over 1200 reviews that gave it a 4 1/2 star rating, more than any other product.<br/>Hopefully it helps with my symptoms, and I will continue using!
 I just received this today, but it looks good. The packaging is exactly as I expected.<br/><br/>I ordered this mostly because of all the glowing reviews ( from people taking this product for at least a couple weeks). I wondered why there were so many reviews saying they just received it and will update later, now I know. You get a free bottle for a review.<br/><br/>I have high hopes for this product! I had my daughter about a year and a half ago. Since then I haven't felt like myself at all. At first I thought I didn't feel like 'me' because I was still recovering from having her, then as time went on and I didn't feel better that it was because I was breastfeeding and my hormones were still whacked. But now that its been 18 months and I'm not breastfeeding, I have not other excuse other than something is just wrong with me in some way.<br/><br/>I've looked up postpartum hypothyroidism and it seems to fit the bill, with the hypothyroid part sticking around and setting up shop. I actually have an apt with a doctor today to get my thyroid checked.<br/><br/>I bought these pills preemptively because I have a feeling I am going to get the lab results saying that my thyroid is 'within normal limits' and no treatment will be offered. But I also believe you can take these supplements to support any RX treatment.<br/><br/>I will update my review when I've been taking these pills for at least a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>I'm half way through my second bottle and so far I feel great. I also started taking B12 and D3 along with this supplement, So I'm not sure what should get the most credit. I've lost about 7 lbs and it still seems to be coming off very slowly, but i'm also not doing anything to try to push that along, so that is awesome.<br/><br/>Great product!
 Started to take Thyroid Support a couple of months ago and have been more clear headed as better body temperature regulation.  I have been on thyroid medicine for over 30 years and it has been difficult to control due to Hashimoto's.  My goal is to have my thyroid functioning optionally and blood tests to prove it.  Which ultimately leads to great health!
 I tried a couple of other thyroid support supplements and I found 1 body to work the best for me. I needed an extra boost and this gave it to me. I've been using 1 body for at least 1 year
 I find that it is complimenting my thyroid medication.  I feel alert, no brain fog, and good.  My body seems to be humming along.
 Started taking the Supplement 10 days ago. Noticed a loss of 1 pound and general well being. Will update later once I take it for couple of months.
 I started this product about a month ago because my T4 runs low and I felt sluggish much of the time. I have noticed more energy so this product really does seem to help.
 I will be able to judge once I have taken it for a while. So far, I can tell a difference. It can only get better!
 This supplement gives me some energy in the morning, calms my mood, helps relieve stress, and helps me focus. The supplement also helps to control the swelling of my thyroid goiter.
 I have been having a lot of issues with my thyroid so I ordered this product to offer my body a little extra help in addition to the medication I'm on for my hypothyroidism. I did feel like it gave me a bit more energy so I'm happy to continue taking it.
 Love it, I think it is working for losing weight.
 My Wife who has a thyroid issue says it's the best thing!..and her doctor also recommended to keep taking it..
 I have been taking this since April.  I already am less sensitive to heat and have more energy.
 So far I like it and think it's helping! I love the free bottle offer as well! Thanks for a great product.
 Great product. Tried a few and this outshines imo.
 I have been taking this for several months and my bloodwork has come back normal.  It has helped me with fog-brain so common to thyroid stuff.  I recommend that you give it a try
 this really works!
 I was feeling run down and just lacking energy. After two weeks of taking this product I feel normal again. I have energy, and my memory has actually improved. I'm normally exhausted by the end of the day...now I get home and walk three miles on my treadmill. This product is great!<br/>I will be ordering my next bottle soon!
 The product seemed to be help but caused my cycle to come every other week.  I took it for a month and a half but have to stop.  It also caused severe headaches.
 great price and excellent results with more energy.
 Really works. My TSH was 3.6 before I started taking it and in 4 weeks, it went down to 2.2. My energy level is great as well.
 Thyroid Support provides a much needed dietary supplement for the thyroid.  It gives essential nutrients such as b12, iodine, zinc, selenium, l-tyrosine, kelp, ashwaganda root which the thyroid otherwise may not get from the diet that we eat due to dietary deficiencies daily.  By giving the body the essential nutrients for the thyroid, it has helped me function better with more energy and vitality.
 I have only been taking it for a few week i do feel like i have more energy and i have not had any of my depression since taking it. I'm hoping it will help me lose some weight only time will tell<br/><br/>Up date review on my 2nd month energy is up and have not had any depression at all since starting.i have not lost any weight but I'm going to try going Gluten free to see if that will help. Still love the product!
 "Product works well. It took about 2 weeks before I could feel a difference, but it was well worth the wait. Hypothyroidism symptoms are relieved!"
 This product was recommended to me by my nutritionist, who diagnosed me with "Adrenal Fatigue."  Since taking this Thyroid Support, along with Adrenal Toner and Gluco-Support, I have been feeling much better; with more energy and focus.
 I have only been taking it for about 4 weeks. Have had increased energy.  I take it 1st thing in the morning and again about 1pm, then I can sleep.
 worked pretty good for the family member i purchased it for they said they would use it again to help regulate their levels
 I've been taking this for a month. Haven't noticed a major difference in my energy level, but do seem to be less hungry.
 I purchased this product because I was afraid that in taking supplements with my own knowledge I could create more problems. Knowing that I don't have to worry about interactions between vitamins and minerals is reassuring. I just received this, so perhaps in a few weeks I'll be back to upgrade the rating to a five star. Shipping was fast and everything arrived in good order. Thanks!
 The thyroid is a key gland that needs additional support in our stressful lives. I love this product. Check it out for yourself.
 I feel more balanced energetically which shows up as less groggy ,  and more focused in the moment.  Hopefully my hair will stop falling out but that hasn't changed yet.. actually feels like more shedding going on.
 Facial swelling gone down considerably, increased energy.
 I just received this product and I'm really excited.  I got it based off of the positive reviews. I'll come back and report how it's working in a week or two.
 I am on my second week. I am feeling a little difference, but I guess it will work better after the third or fourth week. I will keep trying it.
 Have been taking for a short time, but happy with the results thus far. I will update after a couple more weeks of taking the product with a more in depth review.
 So far so good. Feel a bit more energetic.  Will continue to try for another month.
 I really haven't noticed any difference in how I feel. I think it needs more time. I am glad that all the ingredients are supportive of my thyroid.
 This product within a week was making a tremendous impact on my life.  My energy levels had been sluggish now the improvements are very noticeable.
 This product make me fee great, more energy, and helps with my weight loss program.  I will definitely purchase this product again
 I feel really alert and energetic! The effects were immediate. I have also been taking other vitamins/supplements but will definitely have to keep this one in my daily rotation.
 It is really working given me more energy. I'm in the process taking a second bottle just hoping to continue getting the energy.
 I like the increased energy I have with this supplement and I also am pleased that it doesn’t cause upset stomach, even if I take it without food in my stomach in the morning.
 Too soon to experience any significant differences in my case as of yet , but I have only been on this supplement for about 45 days.
 I have more energy for my exercises and sleep more peacefully at night. I have also noticed I'm in less of a fog during the day.
 Since I am on thyroid medication I want to do all I can to support my thyroid.  I have tried other products in the past that did not agree with me but have had no negative effects from this product.  Thus far I do not feel any different but perhaps I will over a period of time.
 I have adrenal fatigue. I was following Dr. Axe's supplement advice and improved, but still was not at the level I had been. My daughter suggested I had a thyroid condition since it runs in my family. I order everything from Amazon and did some research and found your product. I stared taking it and viola, that was the missing link.  I know now that I simply cannot not take this product and be normal. I sleep, I have much, much more energy, and just feel better again. I have checked out the ingredients of other brands, but they are not the same. There is something in your ingredients that my body desparetely needed.  I will not change brands for anything now.  Thank you again and again.
 My weight seems to be getting better (lower) since taking it.
 This product helps my weight stay the same instead of the way I was gaining before I started taking it because of my hypothyroidism!
 I have more energy, losing weights and more bowel movements
 Like this product.  I find that I do have more energy throughout the day.  Will continue to purchase it.
 I have not been taking it long so I can testify to specifics, but so far I feel that is helping me with what I feel I was in need of. I will update when I have taken at least a full bottle.
 Best supplement ever for thyroid! Easy to digest, with a small amount of food.<br/>I have my system wide energy back.
 I always hit an energy slump in the late afternoon, but now I feel like I have a steady flow of energy throughout the day.
 Felt nauseous and gave me a headache
 We just got the product, we are impressed with the other reviews that we found here, I am sending this stuff overseas and hopefully it will work
 Gives me more energy and piece of mind that I'm doing what's right for my thyroid gland! Levothyroxine alone didn't seem to be helping, so I decided to try 1 Body Thyroid Support. I am very pleased with the results!
 I bought this because I have many of the typical (and very frustrating) symptoms of under-active thyroid and my blood tests show I'm on the lower side of the normal range.  My doctor did not want to put me on prescription Thyroxine so I decided to try this supplement to see if I can get a little relief.  I've only been on it about 10 days. I feel a bit more energetic but have not had enough time yet to see if it will help with the other symptoms. I'm hoping for more energy, better concentration, a better sense of overall well-being and maybe a speedier general metabolism.  I know I'm expecting a lot but this product was well reviewed so I'm going to give it a good long trail run before making the final decision.<br/><br/>Updated Review:  I've now been on this supplement for over two months and I feel there has been some decrease in my thyroid symptoms.  I feel more energetic and more focused as well as a better sense of general well being.  I plan to take this for at least  6 months in order to see the long term results.
 While I have just started this product, I am looking forward to what it can do to help me.  My thyroid function has been really low for a long time.
 This product has helped my hypothyroid symptoms quite a bit. I am not as tired or as cold and I am feeling more like my old self. I really like this product!
 I have been diagnosed with hyper-thyroid about a year ago. I'm hoping to improve my thyroid numbers by taking the thyroid support.
 Ordered two bottles- one came opened I threw that one out, VERY DISAPPOINTED. Was afraid to order any more for fear they would also come after having been opened. Not happy
 My wife has been taking it for 3 weeks and has been feeling good. Will update once we pass the 2 month mark.
 I have been on a thyroid prescription for hypothyroidism for over 20 years and decided to try something more natural. I have been using this product for 2 months and am extremely pleased with the results. I feel great and I no longer have to pay for the expensive prescriptions. Thank you.
 I am very satisfied and will keep using
 I STARTED USING THYROID SUPPORT BECAUSE I HAD SURGERY SOME YEARS AGO AND MY HAIR BECAME VERY THIN. THE RESULTS OF MY THYROID TEST CAME OUT NORMAL. HOWEVER I KNOW IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING INTERNAL. I JUST COMPLETED ONE BOTTLE OF  THYROID SUPPORT . I  SEEM TO HAVE MORE ENERGY NOW  AND MY HAIR SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE  STRONGER AND HEALTHIER LOOKING.  I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE IF IT HELPS TO THICKEN MY HAIR AND KEEP ME MORE ENERGIZED.
 I have only been taking this for a short time and have noticed that I am starting to have more energy and my hair loss is lessening every day.  So far I love it and will continue taking this product to see how much more I continue to improve.
 I've been having issues losing weight even though I've been eating right and working out 4-5 days a week. I decided to try these supplements to see if it would help and it has! It's only my first week and I'm finally starting to see the scale move in the right direction.
 So far so good. I have only been taking it for a short period, but I have high hopes. I really like that this is all natural. I had done research previously and was contemplating taking selenium and kelp on its own, but I like that this is all together in one product instead of having to take a bunch of other stuff.
 I've been using the product for a month after several months of not taking any medications for my thyroid. I have Hasimoto's, a growth on my thyroid, yet my blood work was within the normal range. Even though I have full symptoms of a sluggish thyroid, doctors would not prescribed for hypothyroidism. I do feel better since taking the product and Im looking forward to seeing how the product,along with exercise and healthy eating will impact my weight.
  So far for this 15 days of use its been great. I will want to see how it work for the whole month. 
 My boyfriend and I love this stuff. We can definitely tell a difference in our energy when we take it. We also take Adrenal with it every day.
 This product seems to work very well for me. I do not want to quit taking it and find out if I am right or wrong. This company has 10 star customer service.
 I ordered thyroid support when another product that I had used was not available.  Within about 5 days of starting this product, I realized that I had more energy, no longer had afternoon fatigue, and my sleeping was improved.  I can definitely feel a difference in my body from this product and am very glad that I "was forced" to switch.
 I was looking for a natural product to help support my thyroid. I've been taking the  1 body thyroid pills for about 6 weeks. My energy level is up and I'm noticing less hair loss. I have also noticed some inch loss around my mid section.  I do work out 4 days a week and try to follow a healthy diet.  I look forward to seeing what other changes might take place with continued use of this product.
 I have been very happy with the product. My mood swings seem to be a lot better and I'm getting better results at the gym. I will continue to purchase this product.
 I feel better than I have in the last couple of years. It was easier to get out of bed in the morning. I cant remember the last time I had this much energy.
 Thyroid Support has reduced the symptoms of thyroid imbalance such as fatigue, weight gain and unexplained bouts of feeling cold.
 It’s hard to say for sure because I am in menapause.<br/>I will continue to take. One thing I did notice is my hair is not falling out any more. That alone makes it worth taking.
 Didn't see much of a difference.
 Contains the vitamins and minerals my doctor said are important for Thyroid health
 Have not felt any of he mentioned claims. So not sure what the benefit really is but I am not having any side effects. Given lack of noticeable benefit, I will not be purchasing again.
 I have been taking thyroid support for several months now, and  I have started adding the adrenal support also. (one of each)<br/>I truly wasn’t expecting much, and was very pleasantly surprised. I have much more energy, and TSH numbers improved (from 8  to 4), and I lost quite a few pounds without trying very hard. I am very please, will continue using these products.
 So far I have noticed a bit more pep my step...and more clarity. I'm looking forward to trying it for another month to see if this improves and increases.
 Before I was sluggish and exhausted everyday, even if I hadn’t done something that day but this medicine gives me more energy!
 Thyroid support helps with mood swings and provides a balanced state.  It gives me more energy, especially in the afternoon when I would start to feel tired and lazy.
 I can feel a difference in my energy level already and it contains some of the same vitamins I was taking anyway only in one pill instead of 4. I will definitely buy this product again.
 This helps me to have more energy in life!
 It's helped my energy levels immensely, cleared the brain fog (almost immediately), as well as curbing my appetite a bit. I've had a lot of trouble managing stress, and this seems to help... I will definitely use this supplement longer to see if it helps any other of my thyroid related issues.
 After taking this thyroid support I haven’t had to continue taking thyroid medication and my lab work has come back with normal results and doctor advised me to keep up whatever I’m doing!
 Received positive results when taken on a consistent basis.
 It gives me energy and I'm also sleeping better. I love this product.
 need support for my thyroid
 My cravings have gone down and I’m sleeping better! My head feels clearer and my hair is growing!!! I wish I had found this sooner. I’ve been suffering for over a year with symptoms.
 I love the thing that Thyroid support feel completely natural. I tried another brands and after a few minutes I feel my stomach some kind of bloating, but with 1 Body its feels so normal.
 I've only been using this product for about a week but the swelling in my neck seems to be going down. Will post an update after longer use but so far so good!
 Great product. I recommend this product. After taking this product I have gained more energy and have felt alive. These pills have made my daily life better and have lost weight.
 Definitely seeing changes! I don't get cold as quickly, my hair is growing in a bit thicker.. my rest is more replenishing. I'm looking forward to more progress from these capsules!
 So far so good. I seem to have more energy. This product has all the things your thyroid needs so I will continue to take it.
 Seems to help if you remember to take it!
 It gave me a lot more energy than I thought that it would! I noticed that I wasn’t as tired as I used to be before taking these products.
 This product has helped with my symptoms since I am unable to obtain a prescription.
 Before taking Thyroid Support, it wasn't uncommon for me to still be awake 2-3 hours after going to bed.  Now I am falling asleep much quicker since taking this supplement.
 Works great and I'm feeling energized. I think the vitamins in this product are great and necessary for anybody and not just for individuals suffering with thyroid issues. So far, so good!
 I've been feeling better, a little more energy and not so tired as I have been in the past.
 I have so much energy since I have started this thyroid support supplement. I also have lost a couple of<br/>Pounds which I could never do being on just my medication.
 Good product. I don't know if it is placebo effect or what, but I have been using this for 3+ weeks and I feel more energetic and sleep better at night.
 I have more energy not feeling tired and sluggish anymore
 My energy level has improved and I have experienced no bad side-effects from this supplement.
 Product works well!!!
 Day 3 - I do notice a positive difference in my energy and alertness! I've been sleeping solid, which is HUGE. Normally I wake several times throughout the night and never need an alarm. The last couple days I've woken slightly late and well rested. Yeah for me!!! I can't wait to see how I feel after a month of this.
 So far so good-slight improvement in energy, and hopefully memory will start to follow. Have only been taking 1 pill a day so will probably need to go up to 2 like the recommended dose. Only been taking for 2 months and have been taking only a half dose, so I would say that it's definitely doing something!
 Blood tests confirmed I have low thyroid function.  My lack of energy was my most noticeable symptom. 1 Body Thyroid Support gives me my energy back.
 This product is amazing!  I felt a difference immediately.  My emergy level improved right away and my brain fog disappeared the first day.  I love this and will continue to use it.
 I began to see results after 1 week. The most important could be the strength and energy during the day. I began with 1 pill just to test it and after a week as recommended. It is amazing
 Helped me get rid of that sluggish can't get out of bed feeling.
 I just started taking this product and feel better.  I can tell the difference in my energy and mood.  I would recommend this product.
 can feel a bit more energy. have been taking it for only couple days but already feeling results. will leave another review in a month.
 I didn't know if these would work but they seem to get rid of the brain fog you get with thyroid problems.
 Love this product!!!! I have an underactive thyroid, though it isn't low enough to require medication. I stayed tired and felt like I was just dragging most of the time. I saw this product and decided to give it a try, nothing else had worked. Within just a couple of days I could tell a difference, I had more energy. I wasn't nearly as sluggish. I have also lost several pounds. This is definitely a product I will re-order!!!
 I have noticed a great difference in my energy level throughout the day. I feel more level headed and like I can make it through the day. I am sleeping better too
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for hypothyroidism for about 6 weeks now.  I feel that it is just the extra boost that my thyroid needs to feel "normal" again!
 I feel more energetic and focused since taking this product. I also think the quality of my sleep has been better. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 19 years ago and have been taking a prescription for it ever since, but this product helps my overall sluggishness that I still feel.
 Increased my synthroid dose and started taking this.  I noticied a difference in my mood right away and started to lose a few pounds about 3 weeks later. Will buy again.  Thanks!
 I just started using the One Body Thyroid Support and am hoping to suppress that tired feeling throughout the day and to get a better night's sleep.  I have already noticed a bit more energy and memory function. My metabolism has always been good but the cold feeling that I have has been irritating and uncomfortable.  This also seems to be subsiding.
 I have tried other thyroid support supplements, but this is the first one with noticeable benefits
 My stress levels are down. I have so much more energy and I've lost 5 lb! So excited that I am suggesting it to my family who also have thyroid issues!
 I have been using this product for 3 months and it seems to be working!! I feel better have more energy!! Great!! I would recommend this product!!
 I would give this 5 stars, but I'm a little sleepy during the day which is a sign of hypothyroidism.... it hasn't been every day, but I can't be lethargic during the day. With that being said, I'm a true insomniac and this has helped me sleep better and reduce the amount of prescription sleeping meds I take at night. This alone is huge!!  I have been taking Thyroid Support for 2 weeks, maybe three. I take it once in the morning and once at night as stated on the bottle. I may begin taking it only at night and see how I feel during the day. I go to the Dr next week so I'm eager to see what my Dr says. Also, I have high blood pressure and I feel like this has helped with that. Overall, I love this product. I just have to give my body some time to adjust!!<br/>I am not taking this product for weight loss. I am not overweight, nor have I noticed a change in my weight. Would have been nice to shed a few pounds, but that's not why I bought this. :)
 More energy since taking supplements
 So far It seems to be helping a bit. I will know more in time.
 My energy level has greatly improved.  It's amazing not being tired all the time.  Thank you
 I take this supplement because of the supeior combination of ingredients for thyroid support.
 I can tell that the supplement is increasing my thyroid function a bit. My body temperature goes up within an hour of taking it. I know because I feel less cold.
 Usually don't leave reviews but this product gave me palpitations and I gained 3 lbs in a week. if I didn't work out 4 days in a week the weight gain would be higher. I stopped taking it after a week.
 My energy levels have increased and it’s helped with some stubborn weight gain. Overall I can’t say enough good things about this product.
 Has affected my body positively. It works great! It worked rather quickly. Easy to take. No side effects.
 So far this is helping me, along with exercise and eating healthy.
 Thanks for the free bottle after trying the first. Seems to help when I take it at night. :)
 Helped with dry skin and breakouts. Do not feel as fatigued as I did before taking this product. I feel that I have lots more energy compared to before taking this supplement.
 I like that I am not freezing all of the time regardless of the temperature.  I wish that I saw more results in regards to my dry skin and increased metabalism.
 I seem to have more energy and less of an appetite with no side effects so far.
 I have been using this product for almost a month and definitely notice a difference in energy and mood.
 (Received this product to review )this product. gives me an extra energy I didn't't have before. I would recommend this highly.
 I have a thyroid problem for almost 8-9 month and couldn’t find any good products that could help me with that .So far I am feeling much better .
 I feel great again.  The product has increased my metabolism significantly and been rewarding.
 Energy is definatley up.  Hair feels thicker and I lose a lot less when I wash my hair now.  Puffiness under my eyes have gone down.  No weight loss as of yet
 The half moons on my nails are reappearing!  I have not had my thyroid levels rechecked since starting, but I am hopeful that they are improving.
 These don't make me feel sick or nauseous. They actually smelled really good when I took them out of the bottle. I feel more awake and have more energy since I've taken these pills. As for my hair situation, I have still been losing hair but have not lost AS MUCH as I was prior to taking these pills. I would repurchase.
 Feel very well taking these!
 Since taking, I have more energy and less brain fog. I also take the adrenal support and the combination of the two really seem to help me feel better on a whole.
 I ordered this because I have too many side effects from thyroid meds,I'm hoping it will help.I started today.Wish me luck.I will follow up with a review,if it's worth the  time.
 Frustrated with present energy level and gradual weight gain.  Levothyroxine just doesn't seem to be enough to treat all my symptoms.
 I find a have a little more energy than before beginning the regiment of taking the supplement
 While I'm sure this supplement is effective for some, I had a poor reaction to it. After one week of taking two pills a day, I started to get a very strange sore throat that would not go away. I continued to take this supplement for another week, and suffered from low energy, headaches, and a worsening sore throat. I have stopped taking this supplement, and am starting to feel better. I suspect that the iodine might have been too much for me. Like I said—seems to work for many people, just not a good blend for me.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The company that makes this supplement was kind enough to contact me and provide a refund for the product. I am impressed by their customer service, and will certainly consider buying (a different product) from them again. This supplement wasn't right for me, but the company is certainly reliable, helpful, and interested in keeping their customers happy.
 This will be my first time ever giving my opinion on amazon. I have been taking this product for 5 days now and so far so good. I am feeling more focused and I have a little more energy. I can't wait to see the results in the long run. I just purchased the adrenaline formula I heard they work good together. I will update.
 Since I started taking the thyroid support supplement, I have noticed that I have more energy, which is sustained throughout the day. I have less "food coma" downtime after meals. My hair is less brittle and is not falling out as much.
 Taken for first time today, ordered because it is a natural product, easy to swallow which makes it easy to take.
 I've only used this product for a couple weeks so not sure of it's effectiveness just yet.  I have thyroid nodules but my TSH levels are normal.  My hope is to balance the thyroid with this supplement and I'm certain it will take some time to see results, thus I'm impressed this company is willing to provide another free bottle to continue use and provide results.
 This supplement has helped me with my energy level.  It is also a good value when compared to similar thyroid supplements.
 So far so good.
 It’s working awesome! This has given me the energy I have been lacking. Has help reduced tummy bloat too.
 First I was skeptical, now I am just happy for starting to take this supplement.<br/>My life is is just so much better, my thinking is much clearer and my energy level has increased. Thank you!!!!
 Like the ingredients.
 After doing some research I decided to purchase Thryoid Suport Supplement. Today I begin the regiment of two daily.  Although I am not having any major problums and the Dr. says all is well; my Tish results were high and loosing weight is near impossible.  At age 74 my metoblism has indeed slowed down.  I am hoping for an increase in stamima and endurance so as to do senior exercises  for balance and strength.  I rate this a five for the wonderful involvement I have found from the company already...
 This product really helps balance my hormones. My disposition, mood and energy level are all helped by this product. I am so glad I found it.
 I've had a bit more energy and less fatigue and exhaustion.  Seems so far to work well.
 My fatigue and joint pain has eased. Not completely gone, but I feel better. Hopefully with continued use I’ll see greater improvement.
 I have noticed my energy levels increase and I also notice that my hair seems to be falling out less.
 This review is after only 30 days of taking Thyroid Support, plus a brown seaweed supplement. The reason I ordered it?<br/><br/>I've been frustrated with Synthroid/Levothyroxine (for hypothyroidism) and I've been on various doses for ten years. Doctors look at my TSH levels and say "Stay on Synthroid forever. We'll keep an eye on your levels." They don't listen when I point out that the hypothyroid-related symptoms I have (sluggishness/tiredness, dry skin, slow metabolism, mood swings, sensitivity to temperature) have not been addressed by the pharmaceutical. They also refuse to test my adrenal hormones. So I'm trying an experiment.<br/><br/>Last month, when it was time to renew my prescription, I opted to try an herbal supplement instead, to see if I could boost energy, feel better, increase metabolism, and maybe even address dry skin. NOTE: I will be having a blood test in the next few weeks to see what, if any, changes to my TSH levels there are. ***I'm running a personal EXPERIMENT. I don't advocate quitting your thyroid meds willy nilly.<br/><br/>So far? Two capsules in the morning. Easy. I have them with breakfast. I also have a brown seaweed pill morning and afternoon. Three things I've noticed (all around the 2.5 week mark):<br/>1) I'm in grad school and have been under a great deal of stress recently. Have been handling it well.<br/>2) I'm falling asleep earlier, having better quality sleep (insomnia was a recurring issue), and waking up at the crack of dawn, raring to go. Which is weird, and off-putting. Ha. (Note: this could be due to SEASON CHANGE-Spring, rather than supplement. But it's still unusual for me).<br/>3) My TASTEBUDS are acting strangely. I don't know if this is due to the Thyroid Support or the Brown Seaweed I'm also taking, but both have seaweed in them, and presumably are boosting my sodium/iodine levels. For my experiment, I'm trying NOT to change my diet, but simply note any changes I experience. I love wine and cheese, for example, but NOW, wine tastes less good (even weird) and I feel super tipsy after just a glass. Things with fat in them (cheese, mayo, etc) feel heavy and gross in my stomach for two hours after. This could be helpful if I were trying to change my diet. Coffee. I suddenly don't like coffee. I'm usually a FANATIC for a morning mug of it. I take it with half&amp;half and a touch of splenda. I don't know if I'm repelled by the cream, or the bitterness of the coffee itself. I can barely drink half a mug before I lose all interest.  I switched to English Breakfast tea this week, (which I take with cream) and all's fine.<br/><br/>So, as I said, it's an experiment, and not a particularly scientific one. For example, I'm combining Thyroid Support with Brown Seaweed pills. Also, the seasons have changed. Finally, I probably still had a bit of pharmaceutical thyroid running around my bloodstream for the first couple of weeks.  What I WILL do is order another bottle, and also have my TSH levels tested...
 I've had fibromyalgia symptoms my whole life. Since I've started taking this product, I've felt great. My body aches and fatigue are gone. I would recommend this product to anyone. I've already taken two bottles and working on my third.
 I tried a lot of different supliments and like this one a lot!
 My Mother is taking medicine for her thyroid and since I'm her daughter I was told I may eventually have to follow suit. I also have nodules on my thyroid that are being monitored. I started taking Thyroid Support as a more natural and safer means of treatment.
 I've been using this for a month and the dizziness and brain fog have disappeared and I have more energy. I'm looking forward to more positive results with continued use.
 Very disappointed. I believed the reviews and have taken faithfully for weeks. I'm not a big eater and seen no changes anyway.
 I have been using Thyroid support for a while now and it does help me to great extent. I recently ordered this item n the capsules were dark green in color instead of white. Has something changed? Is it wrong medicine??
 I gave this company a 4 star review because I have not used their product yet, but my first impression of their product's quality is great! I chose this brand of thyroid support because it was the highest and most rated product on Amazon. I hope I have great results also, then I'll update the review to 5 stars!
 Thyroid Support seems to help me wake up sooner each morning than previously. Also, TS seems to be giving me more energy throughout the day. I want to continue its use to see how much better my health can become. Thank you.
 My wife has been experiencing many thyroid related issues and we ordered this to see if it would help.  It has made such a difference! I would highly recommend this product to someone.  Who knew that such an "unknown" part of the body could have such a drastic effect on overall well-being.
 Good product. I live in a cold and snowy climate. My body hibernates and this is keeping me from napping everyday. When the snow starts to melt and the SUN comes out I'm sure I'm going to really feel the effects
 No earth shattering changes here, but my energy level has increased somewhat so I ordered another bottle. We shall see how this one works out.
 Everyday that I have taken this I have come down with a migraine.
 I’m feeling more energetic and it seems to be working fine. I definitely want to give it more time to be sure.
 I feel like I have more energy with the Thyroid Support supplement.  They are not hard to take every morning and night.  I'd love to share more after I finish this bottle.
 I've been using for approximately one month and so far I'm pleased with the results.  I have more energy, less brain fog, and a fine hair growth.
 Seems to work fine for me, no side affects.
 This is a great product to help detoxify your body. Highly recommended.
 This Product has made me feel much less fatigued. I feel more full of energy and my hair and nails have become stronger.
 The supplement seems to give me more energy. I like that it has the selenium and iodine in it
 I felt tired and couldn't concentrate every morning. After I took this product, I can tell I have more energy. I used to need to sleep around 8-9 hours to feel ok but now i can go by 7 hours. A very good product for me.
 I think it's working! And I got a free bottle from them!
 Feel better since taking product. Have more energy, sleep better, don't get as hungry either.
 I have been taking this for a little over a month now. Love it.
 I have been taking this supplement for about two weeks now and it has greatly helped me! More energy and focus, I can work my 12 hour shifts without feeling dead about half way through.  I have also lost a few pounds since taking this! I will definitely order again!
 Best Thyroid product I've ever tried!!  I have tried many iodine based thyroid supports in the past with no change.  Before using this product my hair was falling out in large clumps and after only a week I noticed a significant change in shedding.  I only lose a few strands now, when I brush my hair, rather than large clumps.  The company also sent me a free bottle just for trying the first one.  LOVE this product!!
 This product really works for me. Love it.
 I have been taken this now for a week and a half and have noticed major improvements in my energy levels, hair isn't falling out, and my appetite is increased, signaling a metabolism boost. I feel great and can't wait to continue taking this product and seeing further results!
 energy
 I had a baby in January and I felt very sluggish even though I've been sleeping great. I decided to give this a try since I've struggled with thyroid issues before after pregnancy. I immediately noticed more energy and started losing weight. I had a headache the first few days after taking it but my body adjusted. I have enough energy to start an exercise routine now.
 I have been taking this product for almost 3 weeks, so far the greatest thing I have noticed is my quality of sleep- I sleep better than I have in years, I would continue to purchase for that reason alone. I have also noticed that I feel better overall, and I don't seem to have as many cravings as I used to. Some reviews stated that weight loss took a little longer, I will update my review in a month or so as to whether that is true for me.
 I felt like even when I was eating right I had a hard time shedding weight. It was so frustrating! I really feel like these immune boost pills have done exactly what they were supposed to do. When I'm taking them and eating right I can finally see weight coming off.
 It has given me extra energy and stamina. I have always been somewhat sluggish due to an enlarged thyroid.
 I have only been taking Thyroid Support for one week and already have more energy.  I have been taking Synthroid for several years but still felt I needed a boost.  So far this product is providing that boost.
 On my second bottle. I highly recommend
 Finally, something works!!  I've noticed a significant difference in improved memory, clarity, and hair loss!  Will continue purchasing this product.
 I just started this today and am very hopeful.  I have hashimotos, but do not take medication.  I have little to no energy, feel awful all of the time, have trouble focusing, and am having trouble losing weight.  I am really hopeful I will feel better soon.  I will update my review when it has been longer!
 I started taking it due to a sluggish thyroid. Every since I started, I feel more energized, more alert and I’ve actually lost weight. I feel like it was the boost I needed to get my life back on track.
 I found taking this supplement has made me feel more energetic and feel more like myself. I sleep better. I can focus better.
 Although I have not been taking it long, I do seem to have more energy and will continue to use it.  In another few weeks this will probably be a 5 star review.
 This Thyroid Support seems to be working very well with my wife. She seems to be improving. We appreciate having a product that we can trust.<br/>Thank you.
 So far so good.  I haven't been taking this for long, just a few weeks and I know it can take longer to really get any benefit from taking a supplement, but I do believe its helping and do feel somewhat better.  I do not feel like there have been any negative side effects and hope with continued use it will alleviate some of the symptoms I've been having.
 I've specifically noticed a change in my mood. Hoping the longer I take it, it helps with some of the weight issues I've been dealing with recently.
 Like it so far, I only take 8mcg of synthroid a day and take one of these after breakfast and energy levels are maintained.
 Hoping Thyroid Support and Saffron 8825 make a difference in how I feel!!!! Status post RAI x approximately 8 years and I can't get out of my own way! Despite lab tests at MD being normal! Also looking into finding a functional medicine MD within the Boston area that focuses on thyroid disorders! I think I'm feeling better and it's only been a few days!
 I was looking for a natural product for Thyroid which included Iodine...I found it and I LOVE IT!  I will be looking into other products made by 1 Body as well.
 Quite happy with this product. It so far has done the things it said it would do.
 just starting my second month. I have noticed that my hair is not falling out as much as before. I also feel a bit more energy. I am looking forward to seeing how I do as I continue taking it for longer.
 Product is ama,ING felt it working about a hour after I took it. I love ed that the company itself emailed to check k and see how it was working g and if I had any questions ,and gave eek their email I. Case I needed anything answered.  Just amazing all the WY Round
 I haven't been taking this long but I did notice the energy right off.  The 1st couple of times I did have a dull headache but I pushed through and now I don't experience them.  Looking forward to continuing this and getting my energy and motivation back!
 I only started taking the product on January 22.  I have not noticed a significant difference yet. I am sleeping better though.  I think it needs to be in my system a bit longer.  I hope to experience a bigger impact on my system soon.
 Amazing product , I was skeptical and read bad review before the good ones just to see why some hated it but for me it is a keeper! I just found out that I have hypothyroid after noticing weight gain and then my hair started to fall out a lot! Happy to say my hair stopped falling out and i'M SLOWLY LOSING weight , very slow but it's something!
 Best product on the market for thyroid health! I stopped taking my prescribed synthroid meds,felt they weren't doing anything for me.Thyroid Support works wonders! Feel great,lost weight,more energy.Everything you need in one capsule. By the way, I only take 1 a day.
 I have very high hopes for these. Been taking for a week now and already have more energy and feel better.
 I've only been taking this for about 3 weeks, but so far I feel like i have more energy. I did get this in hopes of losing some weight, thinking that it could be an issue with my metabolism slowing down, since I am in my forties. I have been watching what I eat and excercising, but so far have not lost weight.  I'll update my review after I've been taking it longer.
 My daughter is so looking forward to trying this product it has all the wonderful ingredients that support a healty thyroid--- Thankyou
 I had a total thyroidectomy 13 years ago and have been on Synthroid since then. 3 months ago my dosage changed due to my lab results (don't know why it changed). I have felt sluggish and tired and have had weight gain since the change. Pretty horrible. So I started to take these supplements just to see if it could help at all. It's been 1.5 weeks, I started feeling better after two days, found the energy to go to the gym four times last week. Maybe it's a placebo effect or maybe it's the supplement, but I'm not going to risk finding out!<br/><br/>I'll be taking my TSH and T4 labs again in a month to make sure my dosage doesn't need changing, but honestly, the way I've been feeling lately (no longer that exhaustion come noon), I'd rather them change my dosage to accommodate the supplement.
 I like it a lot and it gives me more energy. I take it 2x per day. I will probably reorder the product.
 I Feel good taking it, twice a day. Enough boost to keep me going throughout the day. Will order again
 I have been taking the product for  a couple weeks and find that it has helped to boost my energy level throughout the day.  I have noticed a little trouble feeling tired enough to sleep during the first week getting adjusted to it but that has since passed.  Overall a great product to take with my prescribed medication daily.
 Started taking the product and the next day I noticed I had more energy. I stopped taking the second capsule at night because it effected my sleep. I have trouble sleeping anyway and this made it worse. I am taking one in the morning and it works out great for me. I really like the product and planning on ordering more.
 I seem to have more energy and sleep better when I am taking this.  I let is run out, and I feel a bit rundown.  I am reordering.
 Great product!  It gave me lots of energy throughout the day ,  and i also noticed ever since i started using it,  I've loss some weight!  I would definitely recomend this to anyone with hypothyroidism'
 I like that this is a safe way to wake up my thyroid. I have battled with weight loss for quite some time and with the help of thyroid support, I am on my way.
 I was looking for a supplement that would help with my Thyroid issues. This seems to work great and I don't feel sluggish anymore!
 See if it would help with energy while starting keto. I believe it has
 Since taking Thyroid Support, I have been feeling less sluggish and tired and have more energy. I have also noticed less hair loss and I am sleeping better.
 I have been taking this for a few weeks and noticed a slight change in my energy levels! I have received my second bottle just the other day and I am going to continue taking them! Thanks so much!
 I like this product because I try to take as less prescription medications as possible.  it helps with mood swings,  But not so much with hot flashes or losing weight.
 works well, I notice more energy and my skin is less dry.
 My wife started taking this supplement just about three weeks to date and has seen some improvement in her energy level. She has an under active active thyroid problem and is also on thyroxin. Hopefully will see some more improvement with continued use of product especially regarding her falling hair.
 This product has the same ingredients as the more expensive version that my naturopathic doctor put me on.  My labs have improved (t3 and t4) since being on the product my ND had me on, being that this has the same ingredients and approximately the same amounts, I am taking a gamble.. :-)
 my energy levels are up, i sleep better and feel better in general since i started taking thyroid support. it's a great product, so glad i found out about it.
 I really like the product. I feel more energized and healthier since I started taking this supplement. I've been taking this supplement in conjunction with Adrenal support. I'll keep on taking both of them together.
 I like the combination of ingredients included in Thyroid Support.
 Love this product. I been taking it for 2 months. i have more energy and sleeping a lot better. i would recommend this product for anyone with thyroid problems.<br/>Thanks
 This product is a nice supplement, I have Hashimotos and I feel like taking this has helped my thyroid function better.
 This product does not work. I am hypo.. and have thyroid problems. Save your money and buy elsewhere
 absolutely cannot live without this! It has so many amazing vitamins your thyroid needs in one pill! And it even gives me energy! A+++++
 So far this works great.  I feel more energy and less appetite.
 I have taken one capsule a day for the past month, since I'm cautious about overdoing iodine.  I have lost 5 pounds, had more energy, and am sleeping better.
 this mix of supplements really helps with getting rid of brain fog and feeling more balanced in conjunction with the thyroid hormone medication i take (t3). there have been a few times i’ve forgotten to take it and i notice the difference significantly.
 Many years ago my dad read article on health benefits of iodine supplements. He died before internet went big. In all my travels to other states I never found anything like what he read about. I then had tumor removed from thyroid. For last 2 years  I tried super foods like kale and multi vitamins without any benefits. I have been on THYROID SUPPORT 1 week and can't believe how much better I feel.
 Excellent product! Has a great blend of supplements needed for thyroid health!
 I have been hypothyroid for 20+ years and take a prescribed medication but I still have hypothyroid symptoms.  I read the reviews of this product and thought I'd better try it.  I did and started noticing a clarity in my mind and that I was remembering things better and felt I was quicker in my thinking rather than the foggy feeling I commonly feel with hypothyroidism.  After taking for a month and running out of the product I did not reorder because at that time I felt maybe it didn't work like I thought it did at first, so no reorder.  After a couple of weeks I noticed my mind was nowhere near as sharp as it was the month prior and I started thinking about what may have changed and I remembered I was not taking this product any longer.  I reordered and have consistently been taking it and find my mind to be clearer and sharper than when not taking it.
 Just starting today but I love that in the box came a coupon for a free additional bottle at no cost, no shipping either. :)
 My energy has improved and my skin is not as dry and itchy
 Just started to use it. No side effects! I feel its a healthy supplement
 Simple and works
 I recommend this product. I've noticed an immediate increase in energy since I started taking it.
 I haven't been taking the supplement long, but it seems that I have more energy. I hope to feel different one month into taking it.
 Very satisfied with this product
 I've only been taking this for a week, but I definitely notice an energy boost and just feeling better all around.  I've also noticed that I don't have the hair falling out that I did.  That stopped almost immediately!  I look forward to my next bottle.
 I have so much more energy!  I ran out and could definitely tell a difference!  My anxiety is also under control and it feels wonderful to feel "normal"!
 It is great it has helped me a lot before I was not able to feel comfortable also I had inflammation. It has helped me relief the pain and feel more confident of myself.
 Feeling some better after taking for a few weeks.  Looking forward to feeling better as I continue to take it.
 Just started taking it today.  based on other reviews I know this will help. I look forward to having more energy and finally be able to lose some weight.
 Have had more energy since beginning this.
 This is a great product.  Everything I needed but packed into 1 simple little pill.
 No negatives except maybe the smell of my urine. Has helped with energy and metabolism. Lost 15 lbs along with weight watchers. Noticeable difference in hair and nails also. Highly recommend.
 Bought this product after receiving blood tests showing low but within normal thyroid hormone levels.  I was having problems concentrating at work and generally feeling sluggish so thought I'd give it a try.  Huge improvement in energy level and concentration and don't have that late afternoon headache that I would always snack to make go away.
 I have been taking these pills for a few weeks.I'm finally seeing a difference. Finally started to lose some weight. And feeling energetic.
 seems to provide increase level of energy through out the day
 I have felt like I have had more energy and not sluggish all day long.
 works good when thyroid isn't. Would recommend
 I love this product. It makes me feel energized in the mornings and it helps curb my appetite while kicking my metabolism into high gear.
 Since I've started using this product I've had a dramatic change in my energy level. I'm not tired all the time anymore and I am more motivated!
 Chose this product because it contains all the ingredients that I read will help my thyroid.
 I have more energy and most specifically, my hair is growing in again
 Bought these for my daughter, as she has borderline hypothyroid that her physicians won't treat.  This helps, she says.
 I am taking it for about a month. I am also taking other supplements. I don't know the specific effect of this product but I am feeling better overall.
 I have so much more energy and wake up more easily each morning. I love this product!
 Great product it gives you a lot of energy. If you slack on energy this supplement is the one to add to your daily regimen
 I started to feel an overall improvement the second day of taking this supplement.  Will continue to use.
 I have been taking another Thyroid supplement and decided to try this one as it combined Vit B-12 with it and other valuable minerals. I have found it to help greatly with my sleep, focus and energy levels. Thyroid support is essential for menopausal women and I have found this product to work great. No hot flashes and is a great support with all of the changes.
 Great enhancer to my Armour thyroid. Energy lasts all day and late into evening. I’m not running on fumes! My clarity and focus is keen!
 I ordered this product hoping to help boost my metabolism and I definitely feel more focused and have more energy no as a result of taking this product
 Product arrived quickly. Have been taking for about 3 weeks now, no noticeable changes yet but am going to try it for another month.
 Great product-- I haven't lost weight using (been almost a month) it but my energy is up and I'm feeling better. It is a little hard to swallow- it's a large pill so if you tend to gag on things I wouldn't recommend it.
 As advertised
 So far, a little more energy. I have not been taking it for a month yet so that's pretty much it so far. But will continue to take it!
 Works with my medications that need additional support
 Liked the energy it game me!
 Just started taking after a recommendation from my MD.  The first week, I did have headaches but now am sleeping better and feeling more energetic.
 I got my first bottle of this product and it is helping with my energy. I am going to continue to take to see what other symptoms it will help with.
 I seem to be having more energy, it's not consistent yet but I am hoping with more time it will be.
 No nasty taste, one pill twice a day. My hair isn't falling out hardly and my mood has improved. Most of all I'm getting energy back.
 I have used this product only 2 weeks but I ordered it because it was a USA product and it contains ingredients not in the thyroid support I had been using previously.
 I take it every morning and it noticeably improves my mood throughout the day.
 Label does not match Vitamin B-12 type as pictured on the product. We should receive the product as pictured.
 Great product. Was using prescription Armour and decided to give this product a try. I also ordered Adrenal Support from 1 Body and the combination of the two supplement has allowed me to quit Armour and feel much better. The prescription medication had not been working for me.
 so far, I'm feeling better. There is great stuff in it, and know I am getting valuable nutrients in good forms.
 I have been taking this for about a month now, maybe more (one capsule twice daily) and I do not notice any real changes. My symptoms of hypothyrodism haven't abated. I still have very dry skin, brittle hair, feel depressed, and very fatigued all the time. My husband on the other hand feels that I am improving and that he has noticed a difference. So I really don't know what to say.
 This product is fantastic. I have felt better and slept better since taking it. Worth every penny!!!
 I have only been taking this for a week so I will have to update at a later time.  I have been on Synthroid  for 30 years.
 I really like this product. it made me more focused and more energetic.
 I have been taking thyroid medication for about 1 year and was experiencing unbalanced energy levels.  Test showed my levels a good, but still felt like my thyroid was unbalanced and energy levels were erratic.  After just 2 weeks on Thyroid Support, I experienced a balancing of my levels and had overall increased energy.  I'm very happy with this product.
 Outstanding product
 I ordered this product to see if it would help my fatigue.  It had good reviews, so I gave it a try.  I was very pleased at the almost immediate results.  I felt more alert, had more energy, felt actually happier, and was sleeping better!
 Seems to be improving my energy and I can play with my kids. Also it helps me to not become tired during my days of work.
 I have been taking this product for over 2 weeks now and can honestly say I am seeing a difference in my energy level as well as my concentration. I started taking two per day as recommended, but have now cut down to only one - which works for me. Highly recommend it!
 I like it so far. I haven't noticed a huge increase in energy levels, but hoping that picks up with longer use. Was only able to lose about 1/2 pound a week on WW plan. With this supplement have lost 2 pounds a week for the past 2 weeks.
 Almost finished with my first bottle. I used to take thyroid pills from the compounding pharmacy, but these seem to work as well! 😊
 since i started taking thyroid support ive noticed an increase in energy. as a truck driver who works at night this is a good thing.
 After taking for a week, I have been feeling extremely irritable. I am going to take a break, then restart them and see if they are truly the problem.<br/>I am changing my review to 4 stars based on the terrific customer service One Body has provided. They issued a refund based on my first experience. I will let you know if my next attempt at taking Best Thyroid Support does in fact cause my irritability.
 I feel more energetic in the morning taking less naps between sleep cycle intervals. Will re-evaluate product upon further results.
 Helps with my energy levels!
 Metabolism and energy/health
 I have noticed my appetite is lower during the first two weeks!
 I feel so much better than I expected. I could see a difference the first time I used it.
 I noticed an increase in energy and Thyroid Support helps with weight management - specifically losing extra pounds resistant to exercise &amp; diet.
 I have been taking Levothyroxine (I am hypothyroid) for more than 8 years. last year and a half the side effects took quite a toll on me-insomnia, nervousness, foggy head, etc. My lab results were in the range. I decided gradually to decrease the amount of medicine  and I was looking for natural replacement.  I am glad I have found this supplement. It has been 3 weeks since I am taking it with 3 times less of the Levothyroxine along with fresh lemon juice in warm water in the morning for vitamin C boost. I feel way better. It is still early, I know I will need to have TSH test in few weeks to compare with my last results. I hope everything will be OK. I highly recommend this product!
 Doing very well
 So far so good.  No crazy stomach reactions, but I am also taking this with other vitamins to ensure full balance.  The packaging was nice as well.  I knew I was getting a safe product.
 I definitely have more energy and less exhaustion.
 I've been taking this supplement for over 6 months now and I can't say enough wonderful things about this product! I am a cancer survivor and I was forced into a chemical menopause from all the chemotherapy drugs that were given to me. I suffered from severe hot flashes, night sweats, depression and mood swings. After doing much research I decided that none of these chemotherapy drugs were helping me so I decided to quit everything that I was on. Again after much research, I realized that your thyroid is extremely important to keep healthy and working properly. I would say about one month into taking this product I now no longer suffer from any of these issues. I use to have rolling hot flashes throughout the day and night, severe night sweats and was terribly depressed. Once I corrected my thyroid function my life did a complete 360* for the better. This supplement is a must!!
 Only one day after I started taking the vitamins, I  felt a difference in my body.  This product made me feel like a have energy through out the day.  I also started loosing weight little by little.  It is a great product and I recommend it a 100%.
 Helps keep my metabolism moving. Have suspected a thyroid problem and have been unable to get my pcp to help me out.  Decided to try this and am feeling much better.
 ordered one bottle and have been taking for about a week I feel better<br/>I would recomend
 Capsules are easy to take.  The ingredients seem reasonable.  Seller did a good job sending additional information.
 I have been taking it for more than two weeks and my energy levels has increased and also noticed that my appetite is curbed and loosing weight
 I have only been on this supplement for a short time, but I am already feeling its effects.  Terrific product.  And terrific company that stands behind its products.
 I like the thyroid support .. i feel like i have been sleeping better and i feel better .. i feel like i have lost a few pounds
 I received my bottle of Thyroid Support a lot soon than the expected delivery time. I have been using it for less than a week and have already noticed my energy level is higher than it was before. I usually take Synthroid but I'd rather take something more natural without all of the side effects.
 Since taking Thyroid Support  I have more energy and much more energy.... !!!!!!
 not a replacement for my medication but a great boost for my mood..Thanks
 I have more energy than ever and my sleep is improved.  I can even see a difference in other Thyroid symptoms.  I am so pleased with the results.
 I read all the reviews about this product while I was searching for an iodine supplement since I experience the symptoms of hypothyroidism. I was a little skeptical, of course, because almost everyone said it made them feel great after taking it a short while. While I have not experienced the energy boost that a lot of people claim (probably because I work a 6pm to 6am shift), I did notice that I was feeling a bit better after a few weeks. Nothing extreme, nor did it happen overnight. It was kind of subtle for me. But the main reason I'm leaving the review is that I'm starting to lose weight and this supplement is the only change to my diet/routine. Much like it made me feel a bit better, the weight loss is gradual and subtle. I've lost about one to one and a half pounds a week since I started taking it. I'm down almost eight pounds. As I said, this is the only change to my routine. So I'm quite pleased. I've never experienced weight loss with any supplement that is supposed to aid in that endeavor so I was pleasantly surprised to see my weight go down about 5 pounds the first month. I highly recommend it, but of course, not everyone will experience the same.
 I'm a new customer and I've taken THYROID SUPPORT for 4 days. It's way too early to expect a major change but I will be glad to give an updated review after two months. Thank you!
 Still evaluating.  The improvement in energy was good.  Also improvement in sleeping.
 This is a great product if you are struggling with thyroid problems.
 Excellent results taking this remedy. It really makes a difference. When my T4 tests are normal, I still feel tired and lack memory. This supplement has helped me to overcome. I've used it for 4 months and really enjoyed it.
 Ordered this product because of the great reviews and I cannot wait to see the results.  The shipping was super fast and their customer service seems very good.
 Awesome product! I love how this supplement makes me feel. I can tell it is making a difference. I feel more like my old self.
 I’m so happy I found this. The pills help so much with my energy, reducing my brain fog, and has helped me concentrate better.
 I received my Thyroid Support very quickly.. I have only been taking it for 2 weeks  . So far I have more energy and my hair feels thicker.. I will continue taking this as I like all the beneficial ingredients and it is an all natural product..
 Have noticed improvement in energy and alertness. It seems to curb food cravings and the few times I quit taking it I noticed I started feeling bloated again. I will continue to use and will hopefully start loosing some weight like others have.
 My emotions seem to be evened out since starting to take Thyroid Support. I’m still struggling to lose weight.
 I don't think I have been taking it long enough to really get the benefits.... I do feel my energy level it up!
 Only have used it for about a week. Already see a difference in my energy and metabolism. Finally able to lose weight!
 More energy. Stopped taking prescription when I started this. Not sure yet if long range results.
 I have hypothyroidism , and I think it's too early to tell if there is any improvement.  I will report later if there is any.
 a symptom of hypothyroidism for me was that i was always losing my voice, this product helps so much with that, also i feel less sluggish !
 Just recently started this product. So far I'm pleased with the results and the ingredients of the product.
 Just received the product, great customer support!  Excellent!
 After a couple of days I started noticing a difference!  More energy, more focused throughout the day!
 I feel a change. It is not huge but I feel more energy and less cold.
 I love that I have energy at 2pm.  This is typically my "groggy" time.  I feel that Thyroid Support has helped with this.
 I really am enjoying taking this product- I also have my teenaged daughter taking it as well. Little by little we're feeling healthier. It doesn't bother the stomach- very happy with it.
 Didnt work
 I notice more energy and possibly less hair loss. Thanks
 Seems to be working. I can tell when I stop taking it as I am tired and do not want to do anything after work or even get out of bed in the morning.
 After a few weeks, I felt like I had more energy and was not so sluggish in the afternoons.  I am sleeping SO much better!
 I always been owerweith and in the last three years gained a lot of pounds my sister suggested me to get something for my thyroid and I find this product in Amazon. I have been using it for about two months and I feel with more energy and the quality of the capsules doesn't affect my gastric problems. Defenately buying more. I also want to try their Liver support and detox products too.
 I was already taking a pill somewhat similar to this but this pill is easier to swallow with no after taste. The no after taste is a big plus!!
 This is a great supplement to add if you feel sluggish or lethargic. After a few days I noticed a change in energy along with eating habits (feeling full with alot less food) and water consumption ( I actually crave water now)
 My weight loss was stalled. I lost 3.5 pounds the first week taking the product.
 Is helping with hair growth and hormone balance
 I love the healthy ingredients. I’ve been out for a few days and my energy level has dropped to nothing by the middle of the day. Thyroid Support keeps me going all day.
 I was pleased to see, in one prodect the reccomendations that Isabella Wentz makes for people with my thyroid condition, I'm looking forward to taking this product.
 I have more energy!
 This Thyroid Support Supplement works well for my very under active Thyroid. I take it with a low cost generic prescribed thyroid pill as my thyroid needs a lot of assistance to work at a good level.
 Seems to make me more engerized after one month I’m going to check my thyroid and see if it’s working if so u am definitely buying more
 This product is amazing!  I have been on thyroid medicine for years and was still tired.  I have energy now to live life and get things done.
 This is working so far. I've been taking this for 2 months and will let you know after 4th month
 This supplement us great to give me what I need to feel like myself since my thyroid surgery...will buy again and again!
 I read the reviews and then the company's description of the product. It sounds like something made just for me. So I'm going to give it a try
 After doing a lot of research on thyroid problems, I learned that one can't depend only on the lab test results. Even though my tests looked good with the Rx thyroid meds, I still have several of the symptoms of hypothyroid problem. So I am adding this supplement to my meds for a month and then going in for evaluation at the Dr. office. I will update this review after I do that. I will say that my hair is not falling out this week and it was before last week. That alone makes me hopeful. This is a great company as far as customer support goes. So far, so good.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 My wife and I take this to supplement our nutritional intake on a daily basis.
 It has a good composition of ingredients. I have been taking it for the past 3 weeks. It has helped to improve my overall energy level.
 My 2nd time purchasing, and it works but is pricy compared to other brands but you get what you pay for.
 My thyroid flared and it has calm down since I have been taking this product.
 This product really helps me feel better.I have more energy, pain in my muscles and legs is better, and I even think my hair loss has decreased too.
 I just received my bottle of Thyroid Support after much research. I chose it because it appears to have the perfect blend of natural ingredients and the company seems like they really care about their customers. I will update in a few weeks if I notice any results.
 I've been taking this product for a couple of weeks now and I notice a huge difference with my energy level. I had my thyroid removed in 2002 and I've been on synthroid since 1998. I've been struggling with my weight and energy level and many other symptoms ever since. I also notice a difference in my skin and I'm hoping this helps with hair loss. But so far, so good!
 Liked everything. Easy to take. Much more energetic. Prefer this to prescription medications.
 This supplement has truly taken the place of my prescription thyroid medication.  It keeps my thyroid in balance.
 no more sluggishness, i was always tired, even on my synthroid meds.  Had normal "levels" but still felt tired all the time.  This product has helped with that issue.  Glad to have found it!
 My appetite is so reduced that I forget to plan meals at times and I've lost a few pounds already. Sleeping better and energy/clarity better throughout the day.
 I have noticed a increase in my energy levels. My body in general has responded better to this product than the last one I purchased. My swelling in my feet has diminished. I will order again.
 just  started 2 weeks before,didnt tell much about that ,but came back for update as I get results.
 No more foggy brain, no more fatigue!!! I am waking up without an alarm in the morning...FANTASTIC product!
 So far, I have felt amazingly good and energetic. No more fatigue. Also, I have noticed it helps me to lose the water.
 I bought this for my husband and it has helped him tremendously! Our doctor just kept telling us his labs were within normal range but he was still having severe symptoms. After only 2 weeks he felt a lot better and I could see a BIG difference!
 I really liked how I could feel the increase in my energy level.
 I started feeling better within the first few days of taking the thyroid support product. Particularly I noticed increased energy.
 The jury is still out.  I will continue taking because I know it has ingredients that my thyroid needs.
 Purchased for my husband. He has just started taking and I will update after he's been taking them for a while.
 I am very happy with this product.  It arrived very quickly and well packaged. So far is seems to help me.
 Reduced my daily fatigue and brain fog. My hair is thicker and growing.
 Couldn't tolerate prescription.  Found this to be a good alternative.
 I have more energy and seem to be sleeping better. I would recommend this product. I will be buying it again.
 I stopped taking my prescription because I had no energy and was not losing weight. I started taking this and I have energy and I sleep great at night. I'm also starting to lose weight. I will not go back to prescription I'm sticking with this.
 Don’t work for me
 I began using this product after reading some of the reviews. I didn't have much energy and felt sluggish much of the time. I had tried multi-vitamins and other supplements which didn't seem to help much. I figured it couldn't hurt to give this a try. After using it for just a few weeks, I felt better. I seemed to have a lot more energy, and I didn't have to fight off the afternoon doldrums. I have continued using it for months now and will keep using it. It is also great to know the product is vegetarian. The vendor ships the product quickly, and the price is good for such a great supplement!
 I started taking this product, and in less than 1 week I noticed the difference in my facial structure, energy level, and fluid drawing off of my body.  I will continue to take this product as directed.  So far, I've lost 5 lbs.
 Doesn't seem to be doing much, even after taking it for a month. Maybe it's just me.
 I have been taking thyroid supplement about 2 weeks. I feel like I am less tired but hoping to see more improvement.
 I try to remember to take it every day. All I really know is I am definitely sleeping through the night much better.
 I've been taking this product for 1 week and I have a lot more energy. i asked my Dr. if I can take this with my thyroid meds and she said yes. I'm excited to see my blood work in a few weeks. Thanks for getting it right 1 body!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Mood swings have decreased and hot flashes are few and far between.  Haven't noticed a difference in focus or energy level though.
 I feel a real energy boost from this supplement, especially during my workouts. My daily workouts are so much more productive now.
 As a 59 year old diagnosed with thyroid problems, I'm incline for the holistic approach. I have a blind faith this supplement will help me to overcome my thyroid problem. My thyroid condition is known as hypothyroidism and I rather go natural than using the pharmacological approach as I done in the past, besides it contains zinc and selenium which also help me with my prostate.
 As far as I can tell it is helping me with hair loss as long as I take it twice a day everyday.  That is why I got it.  I can't say that I am noticing anything else that it helps with
 I lost my thyroid due to cancer and have been struggling with low energy. After taking thyroid support supplement for one month I noticed an increase in energy and will continue to take the product.
 I have not been compensated to review this - I've been on this supplement for a few weeks. I have absorption issues that are being dealt with, so I know I'm not absorbing it fully at this time, but for the small amount that I am, I do feel better. I will buy again.
 I have taken this med for 1 month and have felt better, more active.
 Good product
 Great product! Really helped me with my crazy dieting plan...
 I was a t skeptical but this supplement has worked wonders! I use it in conjunction to my armour thyroid medication and I have seen a great difference in my mood and energy. Highly recommended
 I enjoy the product greatly it seems to be helping my energy levels.
 Within a few weeks of starting the Thyroid Support I noticed a difference with the way I felt.  I wasn't as a tired and felt more alert ...  I could actually stay awake after work!  My appetite has decreased, skin doesn't seem as dry, and hair loss seems to be less.  I'm definitely going to keep taking this supplement.
 Love it! I feel much more energy and no more mood swings.
 Since starting to take this product I have had more energy and been more clear headed.  I think it is really helping me
 This stuff really works!! I've been taking it for over a year and I'm totally off of synthroid and my thyroid levels are normal. When I run out and don't take it for several days I notice a huge difference. I start getting all those crazy thyroid symptoms again. I'm very thankful for this product!!
 just started using it. too soon to tell if it works or not, so i will update in a week or two.
 Fantastic! Gives me so much energy, and I think I'm even starting to lose weight... Have been taking it about a month and I definitely will continue taking this product
 Happy to start using your product! Thanks for the free offer as well :)
 I have experienced more energy since I started taking this product.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support Supplement for only a month and I can already feel the difference. I have more energy and mental clarity throughout the day.
 Just received the product but I purchased this based on great ingredients that cover everything I needed. No added junk!
 Excellent mixture of herbs vitamins and minerals. I have been feeling better since starting to use this product.
 I will definitely buy this again. Works great
 So far I have experienced improved mood, better sleep, &amp; decreased appetite.  No adverse side effects.
 So far so good, I have more energy and is a great appetite suppressant. I can't wait to try the Hair, skin, and nail vitamins.
 I like that I feel better after taking this.  I have more energy and less brain fog.
 Doctor pills have never worked, with this treatment I don’t have side effects and it take cares of my thyroid.
 it's okay so far. I will update this review as I've only been using it for 2 weeks. I haven't seen or felt any changes. I do go to bed a reasonable hour now tho so there's that.<br/>I will update again when I'm at the end of my bottle to see whether or not I will need to purchase again.
 Great product has really helped me alot
 Good quality, Good price.
 3 weeks and my hair is nicer, I'm not freezing all the time, and I seem to have a little more energy. I haven't lost any weight as of yet, but I am planning to continue until I finish the bottle and then make a decision
 My thyroid was not doing very well so I decided to try this. I have had a complete turn around in how i feel and the energy is great. I recommend this to any one. It really helped me alot.
 I am feeling very good since taking Thyroid Support. The pills are easy to take and I have had no side effects.
 I've taken for over a year.  I'm borderline in taking medication.  This has helped me avoid taking medications.
 I am struggling with hypothyroidism and losing weight so I am hoping this product will help resolve some of those issues.
 I feel like I have more energy, especially in the late afternoon.
 1638 Customer reviews scoring at 4 1/2 stars got my attention. After reading the reviews, I decided that this product was worth a try. What I didn't expect was a no catch offer for a free full bottle of product. Wow!! Just took my first capsule and will write another review on how it works out for me later. Thanks 1 Body for the free gift!!!
 Caused side effects
 I notice my skin is clearer and more bright. I also have more energy.
 I liked this product and will be buying more. I noticed an increase in energy with this product.
 Been taking for two weeks. Feel more energetic. Waking up feeling good/not sluggish. Appetite seems more moderate. Lost a bit of weight.
 I have hypothyroidism and this product helps to give me energy and to keep my hormones balanced.
 I've been using this product for about 3 weeks  now.  While I've noticed some improvement in my energy levels, they could still use some improvement.  I've noticed the biggest change in my ability to concentrate and focus again.  The brain fog is mostly gone and my moods have stabilized.<br/><br/>I made some dietary changes about 2 1/2 months ago which resulted in some weight loss.  About 10-14 days after starting this product,  the weight loss kicked into gear again.  And the longer I've been on it,  the more my body temperature is regulated.<br/><br/>The reason I've given this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my energy levels haven't improved considerably yet.
 I have only been using this product for about two weeks, but after the first week I have already noticed an increase in my energy levels so I am very hopeful. I took my bottle to my hormone doctor and she was pleased with the ingredients. I will continue to use this product in the future!
 I haven't been taking it that long but my mood does seem to lifting a little and I have a little more energy in the morning.
 I take this supplement every morning. It seems to work on balancing me out throughout the day. I plan to continue to use it.
 Just received this and think the ingredients are great, so I'm hopeful that it will work for me.
 no effect yet  only been taking it two weeks  fingers crossed
 I notice a big difference when i dont take it!!
 I have been taking this supplement for almost 3 weeks now and am feeling slightly more energetic but more importantly there is a slight reduction in the size of my goiter that was caused by an iodine deficiency. I will continue to take the product
 Waking up more alert after just three days of use and I notice no bad effects.
 Decent supplement for thyroid support. Helps with brain clarity and energy levels, though maybe not quite as strong as a few others I’ve tried.
 I started taking this product to replace armor thyroid. It works well and is a natural, over-the-counter replacement. I have been using this product for over a year and I can definitely tell when<br/>I've missed it a few days. I will continue to use this and a recommend it for anyone who has a problem with hypothyroidism.
 adds energy with key elements
 I ordered this product due to a recommendation by my doctor.  I feel more energized and it is helping me to sleep finally!
 Es un producto muy bueno. Me ha dado energía, ya que sufro de hipotiroidismo y me pasaba los días sin ánimo.
 The contents look great to me.  I'm optimistic that they'll boost my metabolism.
 I've only started this product today but since I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism my doctor will not refer me to an endocrinologist  so I have most of the symptoms &amp; no chance of relief.  The reviews have been great &amp; this product was affordable &amp; came much quicker then expected so I'm excited to see if I get the same positive results as most other consumers
 I started on this asupplement bout 3 weeks ago and I believe it has helped with boosting my energy. I have had to reduce the amount of synthroid I take as I have anxiety especially while driving. On the reduced dosage however, I feel extremely tired and have other hypothyroid symptoms. I am hoping this will help me bridge the gap.
 It's seems to be helping but I think that I need to take it a little longer to know for sure!
 I'm hoping this will aid in keeping my Thyroid Gland operational
 I like that it's vegetarian capsules.  I'll know more about the results when I ge my next lab work results.
 So far my body is responding to this Thyroid supplement.  I am happy this product comes in a capsule form because that is simply better for one's digestion.
 Well I must say!  This product works for me!  I have energy, I feel whole as a person, and I sleep better at night.  I have only been taking a short while and I have been losing weight.  My mind is sharper and I can't wait to have my thyroid checked in a couple months to see if it is working better.  Thank you for your product and for the free bottle.  I am telling everyone I know about it.
 So far I am feeling more energy but have only been taking it a couple days.
 I wasn't so sure about this but so far I seem to be feeling much better and have a lot more energy.
 I just ordered another bottle. I think it is helping my energy level somewhat.
 Product seems ok, I feel good after around 2 weeks of taking it.
 don't usually reply, however, your thyroid support supplement has helped<br/>me tremendously and it only had it for a few days. It has taken away my<br/>sugar cravings and I've lost 4 pounds. I've been taking other thyroid<br/>supplements for years. But yours has been the fastest acting. I am very<br/>pleased thank you.
 Better mood and more energy
 I noticed I'm getting back my energy every since starting the Thyroid Support pills and am very happy with the Purchase!
 Ive waited lil over a week to write my review and honestly i can say i do feel better im not sluggish anymore it has increased my appetite but if your thyroid is working better i expect more hunger i dont know if ive lost weight but i feel i may have ill be ordering more once im out and the shipping was super fast!!!
 It helped me to be energetic. I didnot loss any weight but overall my health is better.
 Awesome product the medication I was on would tear my stomach up
 I can't review this yet as I have only been taking it for two days, but after reading the reviews I have very high hopes for it
 I have not noticed any results, no aid to my metabolism or support.
 I feel less tired and have more energy and don't feel as hungry all the time.
 I like that this is a natural way to treat my hyperthyroidism. It is easy to take and isn’t a synthetic pharmaceutical.
 So far so good...
 My energy has increased, concentration has improved, and hair growing again.
 This product is a God send.  I was tired sluggish body was hurting but now I have a good night's rest and I have energy.  Definitely will order again!!!
 Just received my first bottle and cannot wait to try it. I have heard great reviews about it and will let you know what I have to say about it after I get some in me!
 I feel like I have more energy and my skin and nails are better
 I have really enjoyed using this product! I have seen an increased amount of energy and have felt alot better using it!
 After taking this product for about a week, I noticed a slight increase in energy and more mellowness.
 I have been on Naturthroid for 5 years now. While it certainly have helped me, I never felt REALLY good in the way I feel I should.  I also haven't been able to get my FT3 levels above 2.7 - which is really low. So something isn't working. So I decided to try a more natural way. I have only been using this for a few days but I have to say, I have felt different in a good way while on it.  I feel more even in my energy without the spikes that my 2x/day Naturthroid gives me.  I also feel calm and balanced in a way that I haven't for years.  I'm not sure what my thyroid levels will be when I test them (plan to do it in a month of taking this) but if I continue to feel this good, my guess is that they will be just as good - and hopefully better - than when I was on desiccated thyroid. The more natural the better for me, so this product feels better in lots of way.  I think it is worth a try for anyone not feeling quite right.
 So far so good with this! Definitely much less tired through the day. I have only been taking it a week or so, so I can't speak for weight loss from my thyroid issue or having my thyroid retested but so far I like it.
 Improved that "foggy feeling" and gave me more energy. I've even lost 4 pounds.
 I have been on thyroid supplementation for over 20 years and always felt fatigued.  Since starting this product I have noticed more energy and that I am sleeping better.
 I just started taking these, so I'm not sure how well these will work for me.  I can say that I think you should take them with or after a meal.  I took my evening pill about an hour before I ate last night and I ended up with some stomach issues.  I'll post a review later, after I have taken these for a while!
 I had a subacute thyroiditis. After taking this supplement, I felt like all the symptoms like insomnia and afraid of heat have reduced gradually. I can see the outcome!
 Let's just say, after a few weeks trying this...I have not had to take naps on the weekends :) I am only taking one per day, but think I should probably increase to the two/day now.
 works with my other meds and makes me feel better
 My energy and metabolism improved and I noticed that I have more restful sleep since using this product
 Noticed an increase in energy level I am also taking liver support and a vitamin D supplement.
 I am very satisfied with this product. It has definitely helped me feel better and it has improved my hair thickness.
 I think it is beneficial in dealing with my hashimotos disease.
 So I thought this vitamin supplement did not work. But after I stopped taking it, I noticed I felt fatigued.Once I started back taking it, I was back to normal.
 I have heard great things from a co-worker.  I am anxious to get started
 Been taking for a couple of months now.  Stopped taking Synthroid.  Seems to be helping though I haven't had labs checked.  Will continue and see.
 I feel as if I have had a lot more energy since I have added this tip may daily routine.
 I've only been taking these pills for sixteen days, but they seem to be helping me lose inches
 Was recommended by my Anti aging clinic staff.
 Helped me focus and sleep thru the night and gave me energy thru the day !
 I started taking Armour thyroid med based on symptoms that suggested hypothyroid, even though my blood results were "normal" about 5 1/2 years ago. I had all the symptoms, cold all the time, no energy whatsoever, major hair loss, couldn't sleep etc. I literally could check off everything on the list. The Armour helped a lot but didn't make me feel 100% like my old self. Then all of a sudden it didn't help at all anymore. After months of feeling like I was on no med at all, I found out big pharma had changed the formula or something, lots of people were complaining about it's ineffectiveness. I decided to stop poisoning my body with the unknown and look for something natural. I read a lot of the reviews before making the purchase, and was so excited to try it. Many people said it gave them their old life back and that's what I was looking for. I have completely finished one bottle now. I was initially disappointed because I didn't feel that jolt of energy that many described in their reviews. Some said they felt a difference in a couple of days. I was looking for that same reaction, because I needed it so badly. Nevertheless I continued to take it as prescribed. It took about 2 1/2 weeks for me to be able to stay up all day without a nap, so it was working albeit slower than I would have liked. My hair loss slowed down and I was  not as cold all the time. Some days I only took one cap in the a.m., it would get too late in the evening to take the second cap, I didn't want to risk not being able to sleep. I was feeling better but not close to my old self and decided to take both caps at the same time in the a.m. I found that actually worked better for me than twice a day. I went back to one cap a day as supply became lower, just to make it last longer. My takeaway after 30 days is that everyone reacts differently to products, so it may take longer to work  and you may have to make adjustments to the directions. Also I think I may need to look into taking some iodine separately (which I have not done yet), as well as getting some adrenal support and then add this to my regimen. I will keep taking this product.
 It has really help boost my energy levels and keep everything including my mood levels regulated. Excellent product!
 Seems to help so far.  I feel that I have a nicely supported thyroid, now.
 I have taken this product for several weeks now and have more energy to get through the day. Will buy again.
 Hopefully this product brings my antibodies down.
 Definitely one of the better thyroid supplements I’ve taken. It does much more than the typical ones.
 I purchased this product for my wife and she is extremely happy about it!
 Had a complete blood work up with my Internist a month ago. Said my thyroid level was borderline low and wanted to place me on a synthetic thyroid medicine. Didn't want to do that, so I researched supplements and found 1 Body to have great reviews. Have been using it for a more than two weeks and feel better already. Not as tired, more energy, fewer tension headaches, AND I lost 2.5 pounds in a week without changing my lifestyle at all. It somewhat bothered my stomach the first couple of days; now all is well. Ordered a bottle for my sister. Very pleased.
 My product arrived in very quickly along with a coupon for a free bottle if I submit a review. I am excited about the mix of ingredients in his formula! I  tried another brand that I found out had WAY too much iodine! This is a much safer mix and has the bonus herbs to promote thyroid healing &amp; balance. Only time will tell if it works for me, but I am optimistic!
 I've only been taking this for a few days but my energy level as definitely increased.
 Just got it - will update after using for a month.
 I haven't felt a real difference.
 Has helped my energy considerably
 My third bottle purchased really helps with my energy and feeling better
 I feel more energized and healthy. I’m sleeping better and feel better than I have in quite a while.
 I like it, seems working there is an improvement on my weighing scale so i surely buy it again ..
 Looking forward to starting this supplement.  From what I have read online, Iodine, Selenium, and L-Tyrosine are what I need to help my thyroid. I recently developed nodules on my thyroid and I am hoping this will prevent more from developing or even get rid of the ones I have. I am anticipating great results.
 Works well
 Cant give it 5 stars yet but think that it may deserve it.  I have only just started taking it.  I did feel an immediate change in energy levels.  Do not take it right before you go to bed.  Found that dinner time was best (around 5 or 6).
 I take Levothyroxin for an under active thyroid.  Doctor assured me that I would start feeling much better in a couple weeks.  More than a year passed and I still did not feel any better.  In fact, I felt awful. The fatigue was crushing me.  So I did some research which led me to this product.  It contains all of the herbs I read about.  Taking one capsule is so much easier than buying and taking all the herbs and supplements separately.  I tried several brands of thyroid support.  This is the only one I have taken that has made a difference.  I am finally feeling more like my old self again.
 I really feel like this is benefiting me. However, they have raised the price $10 and now say they are giving a 'free' book on thyroid. Very disingenuous to say the least. I was going to put this on auto ship. I will not buy it until the price returns to $25. The product is a 5. At the current price a 1.<br/>Update. They were great about this issue. The price is back down. I am on my third bottle. I feel it helps. In fact I ran out of my Naturthyroid and I think this helped me to stay fairly even keel.
 Seems to make me feel somewhat more energetic.  I am anxious to see my thyroid numbers in Jan 2019.
 I have more energy since using Thyroid Spport. A better sence of well being.
 Only been taking a short time, but feeling some improvement.
 I started this supplement after having more symptoms of hypothyroid including tired, fatigue, irritability, and intolerance to cold. After my first dose I noticed the difference in energy levels. I follow the recommended guidelines and have noticed that even my raynauds does not flare like it used to. I will continue to take!
 Due to hormone issues I do not sleep well.  This helps me go to sleep and stay asleep for 8 hours.
 I feel much more energy and have also been able to lose weight easier. All other hypothyroid symptoms are also improved.
 Gives me more energy, I'm not as cold as before, heart rate is getting normalized. I'm more focused.
 Very high quality and has helped with energy and provides what my doctor suggested.
 This product has helped me with my energy levels and helped my hair began to thicken and stop shedding so much.
 Synthroid did nothing to relieve the effects of hypothyroidism after 18 months. I just quit taking it. A few months later I found this product and paid full price. Will definitely continue using!!
 I am very pleased with this product. It seems to give me more energy. Will continue to take it. Thanks.
 I typically have used a thyroid supplement from Gaia herbs but was looking for something that had other supportive herbs such as the ashwagandha and bladderwack. I like that you don't need to take many of the pills (one when I wake up and one when I get one from work typically) m. So far I have no reason to stop using it!
 Love the product and customer service is excellent.
 I just had the product for 2 days, I only had the product for a couple of days, I haven't experience any changes as of yet. As soon as I do, I will post an update.
 I take this product in conjunction with my thyroid medication. I find that it gives support to my taxed thyroid, which gives me an energy boost. A noticeable one.
 As I aged I realized my thyroid was sluggish .I have tried other product this is by far the best
 Since I started taking this supplement, I feel much better , specially on my weight control. I will keep ordering
 it's only been 15 days. So far I feel a little less sluggish throughout the day. I am hopeful I will feel much better with long term use of this product. Thanks!
 I don’t normally see a difference with natural products, but I did with this one!  I will likely purchase this again and would say you should give it a try.
 I have struggled with horrible reactions to prescription medication so quit it, was borderline. Stopped the meds and started this with an adrenal supplement. I cant say enough about this product. Its reduced my fluid retention, my energy level is much better, less thyroid symptoms overall. This is a supplement I will keep with.
 It has help level out my hormones in my body. I am sleeping through the night, losing weight, and no more weird blood sugar spikes.
 No side effects. More energy and feel much better.
 I have just been on it for about 10 days.  I tapered off my synthroid and onto this supplement.  I have been using one capsule a day so far, but may increase it to two.  I am sleeping better than I have in months, and my stomach has calmed down, but my energy level is low.  Hence the 4 stars. Hoping It will level out.
 It seems to have helped with harmone regulation and reverse my balding.
 before using 1 body thyroid support, my skin was extremely dry and my hair was falling out.  this has all stopped which means the product is working.  I am very pleased with this product.  I did not give this product 5 stars because I have not used the product long enough.
 I've only been using the product for about a week while on vacation.  I seem to have a bit more energy but I'll really only be able to tell once I get back to my normal daily routine.  Will update in a month.
 Helped so much with my lethargy. I now can make it through my day without constantly thinking about bed. No crash like caffeine just natural energy. Love this product
 I have more consistent energy  throughout the day since I have been taking this product.
 Since I started taking this I have been feeling great.  Noticed overall improvement in energy.  Been taking synthroid for years so I am anticipating my next thyroid check.
 I did quite an extensive study of thyroid products and yours was the best.
 My nails aren’t splitting any more and my skin is not as dry. I recently received the free bottle of thyroid support and I have ordered 2 more bottles.
 Very helpful; it changed my numbers so that I did not have to use a prescription to help with low thyroid numbers.  And reordered several times.  Also, delivery was spot on.
 I started taking this a month ago and I've already seen a big improvement in my health!  I have tons more energy and I don't feel fatiguedand drained all the time.  I also noticed that I'm finally starting to lose a little bit of weight (which was nearly impossible to do before no matter how much I dieted or exercised!) which is great, considering that ever since my hypothyroidism got bad, I'd gained 70 pounds. So far, ive lost about 10 lbs! I truly do feel like this is working. I take one in the morning and one at night. I also feel a lot better taking something that's natural rather than getting on some prescription drug that's probably doing more harm than good. Great product!
 Thyroid support has helped my energy levels to remain constant through out the day.
 Seems to be working.  Had blood work done and levels seem to be better than usual.  Have only been taking it for about 3 weeks.  Going to keep taking it for at least a couple of months and then decide.
 Cant say I have seen much difference and have been taken them as recommended for about 3 weeks now.  I haven't seen a down side though.  I won't be reordering these unless there is a dramatic difference after taking the second bottle.  I didn't get a free bottle for trial - could be the difference in my review and the others on this product.
 Taking it in conjunction with adrenal support and have found to have more energy. Will continue to take both
 Product definitely boosted my energy levels. I'd recommend to anyone that's in a slump. I hope to comment on the long term use of the product.
 After I get my lab work done, I will know how my thyroid is doing.
 I have not started this yet, but it has all of the minerals/herbs I was looking for.
 working really well so far for me and hubby I'll give a 30 update later
 I have lost Inches on my waist and it has curbed my apetite that I am not eating as much. Overall it has given me more energy and I feel great
 I think this product is working well. My main issue is adrenal-related, so it's hard to differentiate whether my remaining symptoms are thyroid-related or Adrenal...But I like the ingredients list. It has all the stuff I was looking for in Thyroid Support.
 Loved it will keep getting gives me energy
 Good stuff.
 I love this product. I switched to a cheaper version by another company for a month and was not happy so I came back. I had a partial thyroid extol and this product helps boost my metabolism.
 I am still on my first bottle. So far there are no complaints. I will have a full review after two bottles.
 It has helped regulate hormonal issues with my monthly cycles, I have also noticed a decrease in migraines.
 I've been using this for a few months and have noticed a great change in myself.  My skin is less dry, my hair is healthier &amp; not falling out in clumps, and my energy level is more stable, to name a few. I will continue to use this product.
 I just received my order today. I needed a thyroid supplement &amp; your's sounded like a good one.
 Gives me the energy boost I need and makes me feel better overall
 So far so good! My daughter and I are both taking this supplement, we wanna give it a full month.
 Was taking a kelp and ashwagandha when I found this. It is easy to take one supplement than several individual ingredients. It has only been about a week, but I already feel a little less fatigued and less fuzzy headed. May be too soon to know for sure, but I feel like it is making a difference.
 Me ayudo bastanate con mi problema de tiroides ,mi estado de animo a mejorado y hasta e perdido peso ...buenisimo 👍
 Had significant energy boost first day!
 I feel that my energy is increasing. I sleep is a lot better. I'm planning to continue buying the product. So far is working good.
 Great company. Hope this works.
 I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism for about 5 years now.  I was always tired, headaches, lost hair, weight gain, all the symptoms that comes with this.  I started taking Thyroid Support for about a month now and I love it.  I have more energy now, I feel like I dont have to have a nap in the middle of the day.  Not as much hair loss and the big thing is, is I have had three separate people on different days to ask me if I was losing weight.  Such a great confidence booster especially since I had always been a smaller person.  I will definitely keep taking the product.
 Not sure if it is a placebo effect or if it is working but I have more energy and possibly less hair loss.
 So far so good! My energy levels are awesome and I feel much better! Will update once I have taken a full month!
 I have been taking it once a day and have noticed a difference in my energy levels. It works very well.
 I turned to thyroid supplements since the meds were not working for me.  A friend recommended Thyroid Support and I decided to give it a try.  Within 5 days I could feel the difference how I felt. My energy level is what I noticed first, I was not feeling as tired and slept better too.  I am glad listened to my friend and highly recommend this product.
 Great for my thyroid!  Easy to use. I take two at night before bed
 I chose this product to supplement my thyroid medication after being on it for over 20 years.  I have never regained the lost energy after my thyroid started having problems, so I am hopeful about this product.
 I have experienced better mental focus and increased energy. I am pleased with my purchase.
 awesome
 I tried this brand before and they are very good, I felt the difference form 2nd day. highly recommend it
 Great substitute for synthroid!
 I have so much more energy since I started using. I recommend.
 I really love this stuff.  As soon as I started taking it my achy knees went away, I felt way more energetic and my sleep improved.  I also was having horrible mood swings and I haven't had that issue since taking it.  Great stuff!
 My sleep improved and migraines decreased significantly.
 Haven't  noticed any difference  but willing to give it more time.
 Love it! It’s super easy to swallow and I will continue to use
 Have only been taking for 1 month, going to continue for evaluation purposes. Will update later
 I feel better energy and mood after just 2 weeks
 I noticed that I had more energy and that my muscles didn't become as tired doing every day activities.
 So far so good, been taking a week and I feel so much more energy!
 I feared negative side-effects.. That has not happened. So many thyroid supplement products can really mess you up. I have nothing negative to say about this product. I feel more alert and energized on it.
 I have just recently started taking this after running into an issue with a slow thyroid within a few days I have already noticed a difference<br/>with more energy (not needing to take a nap in the middle of the day) I will keep taking this and write more once I have been on it awhile.
 Works Well !!  My wife is "subclinical" hypothyroid- meaning the test results are always on the low end of normal but she has all the classic symptoms.  These make her feel better mentally and physically.  I've started taking them as well with the same results.
 Has been long enough submit a review.  I don't current see a change but I'm hoping this will help regulate my thyroid.
 Second time I purchased this product.  Feeling better, less sluggish.
 Very good quality product that gave more energy and I think helps me to go to the bathroom. It is a little early to say something about the product yet but I 'll update in about a month.
 I notice a huge difference in how I feel when I wake up when I am consistently taking this product.  If I miss just one pill, I feel more groggy and tired.  It has been working great.
 good product so far, i feel more sleepy for some reason, but my mood is getting better
 It has given me more energy. I do not feel as sluggish as before, and it is helping in my weight loss.
 I have been taking this product for over a month and I feel great.
 I just started using this product about a week ago, but so far it's really helped with my thyroid problems. I noticed results right away! I even ordered a second bottle to make sure that I don't run out. I also love the fact that these supplements are vegetarian.
 I just started this product for a bit over a week, but I can feel the difference. I feel more energetic than before. Fatigue was a problem for me and now it's getting improved. Everything is good so far. I will continue with this product. I highly recommend it.
 Symptoms associated with underactive thyroid improved almost immediately.
 It seems to do as good a job as the prescription medication (Thyrozene).
 I have only been using this product for a few weeks but so far so good. I figured I would at least five it a try before looking into prescription medicines. I feel a little more awake during the day but at this point its a little too early to see any real results
 I'd been using this product for almost a year. I noticed that my hair is thicker than what it was. I also have more energy than I used to.
 If you're hypothyroid this product helps keep you aligned. Works for me!
 Clearer thinking and more energy.
 This has all the necessary vitamins, love it!
 My energy is up, and I feel better after a month, but it is not jarring. It is subtle.
 Not quite finished with the first bottle but do have more energy and my appetite is slowing down.  Will give more input when I'm into my second bottle.
 I was hesitant to try a new brand (my naturopathic doctor went out of business).  After researching, I decided on this product.  I was so thrilled that i didn't have any symptoms but more importantly the supplement was equivalent in keeping my thyroid symptoms null and void.  Plus they sent me a free bottle after the first order.  Works for me.
 I take a thyroid pill, but am also missing several other key nutrients that help my thyroid to perform better and not be over-burdened. I've tried several, but this is the best by far. I either order 2 at a time, or one every month.
 Has helped my energy &amp; focus, so far, so good.
 I absolutely love this product! Since it became a part of my everyday routine I feel more active and my metabolism is boosted. I didn't have any real thyroid problems before but I've got some symptoms which made me worry (low metabolism, fatigue, low energy level etc.). I'm using Thyroid Support for 4 months already and will continue for sure!
 Hi I am Jesus F Matias I have hypothyroidism and my doctor had prescribed levothyroxine which is very common. lets just say i used it less than a week and felt weird on it, i couldn't perform as i normally do when i exercise, lifting weights etc i started looking into forums and got recommended to take the natural route, if i stayed taking levothyroxine it would of maintained the problem, rather than improving it. and most users of levo, end up taking more pills later on for the side effects. I been on 1 body's Thyroid Support and I feel amazing, I recommend it highly and eventually you won't need it anymore or as much as you think. I finish the bottles and then wait a while to restart that wya my body can get used to its own production without the natural supplement of 1 body but anyways this is a great start to fixing your problem, research a lot, read read read, you can fix it!!
 "I have been struggling to get past a certain weight for a long time.. This product helped me break through that plateau &amp; helped with my brain fog.. I'm on my second bottle!"
 I lost 2lbs already, but still watching. More relax and incessant headache disappeared.
 I just started taking this week.  Am excited based upon reviews.  I am not considered "hypothyroid" by my Western Doctor.  But my levels are all creeping at the low end of the spectrum.  Am going to use this to get a boost and to get rid of incessant Brain Fog.  Will come back with more later...
 This is the best to have when your body is going through the change.
 Feel positive about product but have not been taking long enough to see any results.
 Been taking for 2 months and do not feel any different at all. I have not noticed anything it claims, I will stop and not purchase again
 I feel like I have more energy to get to the gym. I am also sleeping better, less hot flashes too.
 I was always feeling sluggish and with this I no longer feel that way.
 I'm taking this in conjunction with several other supplements, but this seems to be helping.  It includes several ingredients that normal nutrition does not commonly provide.  I plan to keep on taking it for the time being.
 It seems to be working. Saw a clip on U-tube to help with thinning hair and my hair seems to be getting thicker. I'm feeling better too.
 This product has given me more energy and I hope to start seeing some weight loss soon
 I have more energy with this supplement.  It's so much easier to get up and going in the morning!
 I feel it boosted my energy and overall feel better.
 I had so much energy with this product.  My joints felt better and my workouts rocked.  That said, I did experience serious insomnia.  I feel encouraged that this supplement can help me, but I am hoping to find a way to overcome the sleep issues.
 Works as described in support of a ketogenic lifestyle.
 More energy to do the things i want!
 I think I'm having less brain fog
 I like the product.  I have been taking it for about 2 months and it seems to boost my mood and energy.
 I am currently taking nature-throid which has helped tremendously compared to levo, but I still didn't feel myself. I started taking thyroid support a few weeks ago and I feel so much better. Not a hundred percent but I've got more energy I'm also in a better mood! I still have my off days but so much better!!will be a customer from now on!
 I believe the product is helping my  tyroid function .
 I was looking for a supplement with some B's.  I was feeling very tired, sluggish, and worn out.  A lot of it is due to stress.  I started taking one capsule in the morning and one at night.  However, I couldn't sleep when taking the one in the evening. Then I started taking the second one at 3:00 instead of 6:00 pm in the evening.  I found that I still couldn't sleep.  So, now I just take one in the morning and I'm good for sleeping at night.  Why thyroid supplement?  My mom had thyroid issues and my brother is on thyroid medication as well.  I had tests for my thyroid and I'm fine.  The test was before taking the supplement.  However, I feel better when taking this supplement and I will continue because it is giving me more energy and it is helping me managing my stress. Maybe its helping my thyroid as well.  I'm a male  53 years old.
 Speedy delivery. Purchased hoping to increase energy level. Will update after using.
 It’s making my hair grow back! I’ve also seen an improvement in my energy levels.
 I decided to try this product because I have every symptom of hypothyroidism but my levels are fine. I've only been on it a week, but I already feel 100% better. Much more energy and all around feeling better, plus I've lost 3 pounds! I didn't give it a 5 star rating just because it's only been a little over a week.
 Great product!! My level of energy increased a lot. I am feeling more light with less water retention...
 Maintains energy levels through the day.
 A great supplement to support the endocrine system.
 Excellent deliver time. Tried out the product for past three days. The respiratory system is open I can breath. It's giving me energy during the day and I'm getten a good night sleep. Great combo...  I would recommend this product and will be looking to buying more of same products.
 Seems to be working as stated.  I ordered another month's supply.
 I have been taking this for almost one (1) week now and I can definitely feel a difference in my energy level. This product is very similar to a product I took before, that greatly helped me with energy and weight loss, but was discontinued.
 I will have to continue this product longer to know if its working but so far so good.  Thanks
 I notice a difference right away.  I have more engery and final hungry for once.
 I feel balanced and my hair loss has subsided.
 I seem to have more energy and my hair seems to not be coming out as much. I know it says it could take up to six weeks to get this product in your system good or get your thyroid levels up so I plan on ordering again to hopefully see more positive progress.
 I have much more energy since taking Thyroid Support and overall feel more balanced.
 So far it is helping along with my Levothyroxine medication. Gives me an extra boost and I'm not experiencing side effects.
 I've only been using it for about 4 days and I notice some difference in my energy levels (for the best) and my overall feeling.  I feel better.  I will keep taking it and hope that this is the answer to what I have been suffering with these last three years.
 First of all , I have never been one to take any form of supplement ,but, as I'm getting older I felt the need to try them.  I have been hypothyroid since 1997, I'm currently 44 yrs old. The life changer for me, was developing vitiligo  earlier this year.  I read up on a link between hypothyroidism and vitiligo and the need for certain vitamins to help the thyroid function better. in my search for a supplement I came across Thyroid support supplements, I read the reviews , most positive and decided to order them. I received the product in 2 days , which was yesterday, and immediately took one. I am hopeful that it helps alleviate some of my chronic symptoms of fatigue, and brain fog and maybe even help me shed a few pounds. fingers crossed
 Great product
 great product
 I feel better when I started taking these medicines.
 Excellent product
 I bought this based on reviews. My bloodwork numbers are always in very low normal range so Dr. doesn't prescribe anything. I'm hoping thyroid support will do the trick and raise those numbers. I have only just started taking this supplement as I just received it a couple of days ago.
 Great great product. The last three years I had gained 30 pounds, were constantly tired and my was hair dry and broke.<br/>My hairdresser suggested it was my thyroid. Before I went to the doctor, I thought I give it shot and just try the product.<br/>After two days taking it, I felt already better. The brain fogginess was suddenly gone, I could focus on my worked. I lost 6 pounds in 4 weeks without dieting (just skipped the daily 4 coffee lattes I needed to get through day before), my hair looks better and even my ongoing headaches are gone.
 I have had a thyroid issue for quite some time and I am loving the results from this product.  I just had my blood work completed so I will update in a few weeks my changes.
 within two weeks feeling less sluggish and more alert....excellent product.  al the herbs in the product work great together.  Very happy .  Suggested to my acupuncturist as well and she purchased.
 This product has given me so much more energy since I have started taking it! Woah! I love it! I can actually wake up now and not feel dead!
 I do feel more energy and notice some weight loss, definitely worth a try!
 Just started taking it.  It has what I need in it.
 The thyroid support helped me regain energy and mental focus.  Such a great product.
 Seems like a great product! I have been taking it for a week now and I already have some of my energy back and my hair seems to have stopped falling out by the handfuls! Hopefully this will prevent me from having to up my dosage of thyroid med...yay!
 So far I like the product very well.  In 30 days I have seen a difference
 I feel I am able to sleep better and noticed that I am not so bloated anymore.
 Felt positive changes in energy levels within three days!! Very excited about using this supplement. Only downside is it tastes like seaweed, but if you are okay with that, you're good to go!! I deal because it really does make me feel better. Synthroid alone wasn't cutting it.
 I have much more energy, and a better emotional outlook on life.
 I do feel a bit more energized and there is some stability when it comes to food regulation.
 I have seen more energy and hope to see more changes as I continue to take it.
 I think it is giving me more energy and alertness.
 I would like to continue taking for a while longer
 Love this product! Has restored my thyroid to a healthy functioning level - my eyebrows are even growing back! Not to mention my energy level is back to normal!
 Made a huge difference WITHOUT having to increase thyroid meds - felt increased energy, better sleep, and better mood!
 I just started taking this today, and I'm hoping it helps. I've experienced most of the symptoms others have described, and I'm borderline hypothyroid with a B12 deficiency. I ordered the product and it was delivered within 3 days, and on a Sunday no less! I'll report back in a week or so with an update.
 Thyroid support has been helping with my energy.
 I've been using Thyroid Support for about two months now. The first thing I noticed was that I felt a little more energetic. The other surprise was that the breakouts on my back disappeared - which was a wonderful surprise.
 Will be sure to order again soon.
 I feel like Thyroid Support gives me energy, but it isn't like a caffeine energy...it is more steady throughout the day. I have just been taking it a little over two weeks and I'm excited to see/feel any long term benefits.
 Great product. Works like a champ.
 Works but cost could be factor for continued use.
 Feel more energy, hope get my blood level back to normal.
 I feel like I’m giving my thyroid  good nutrition to help heal it.  I am less tired and more alert.  I’ve been on this for a few weeks and I like it.
 great product, will buy again, feeling much better, more energy and helping to lose weight.
 using it I feel better
 I feel like I have gained back some of the energy I have lost.
 I've been using this product for about 2 weeks only, too early to provide an objective review....but  I feel a bit more energy and have not noticed any adverse effects
 I'm only 2 days in, so I'm still trying to decide but I will say my energy level seems to have improved a little. I'll update review after 30 days.
 My friend loves it. I have ordered several bottles in the past. I am sure he will order more and appreciate the free bottle!
 I have been taking this for about one week and feel more energized.  My husband said that this *is a miracle*.  I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) in 2004, but even with hypothyroidism medication, I still suffered from fatigue, joint aches and hair loss.  I noticed a difference after the first day of taking this Thyroid Support supplement.  I am able to sleep sounder and feel refreshed upon wake-up.  Also, I have more energy and my joint pain is nearly gone.  I plan to update this review with my observations periodically.  I do recommend this product and encourage others to try it, what do you have to loose ... your fatigue?
 Awesome product!!! I'm on a ketogenic diet and use this supplement to boost exercise endurance. It gives me lots of energy without irritability or jitteriness.
 Great product!
 Works for me!  Definitely increased my energy.  In addition, I recently had my T3 &amp; T4 levels checked, both are almost in the optimal range!  My TSH levels are still borderline high. I am adding a gluten free diet to the supplementation schedule to see if that helps.
 Just started taking but already feeling like I have more energy.  I Will keep taking the product.
 I've taken other companies herbal thyroid supplements in the past, so I thought I'd give this product a try. Today is my first day, so I cannot say how it's going to work, but this product has similar ingredients to others I've taken, and they made me feel great! Slept better, woke up easier, faster metabolism, more energy. What's not to love?
 So far has helped feeling better
 It seems after taking product for a few weeks that I have more focus, less brain fog and more energy/motivation.
 This product really works great!  It has really helped with energy levels as well as with the other side effects of hypothyroidism.  I will be ordering again soon.
 Although my labs were ok (low end of normal range) I knew something was wrong &amp; this product really helped my energy! I lost a ton of water weight (8 pounds in 2 weeks)!!!
 Thyroid Support helps my body provide additional energy &amp; zest.
 Helping regulate my energy levels and keeping me going throughout the day.
 this product has boosted my energy level.  I see positive changes in my skin, nails and hair.  I will continue the use of this produce.
 I can definitely feel a difference while taking it... I will definitely be ordering more
 I have had more energy since taking the product!
 I have started to see a bit of improvement. This hasn't been a "miracle product" for me but I'm hopeful it will continue to get better.
 I have noticed a huge difference in my appetite. I am not always starving. I have lost weight in result without really trying.
 Feel like I have more energy and way less tired mid day on this supplement
 Great product. No adverse affects. Digestive system is finally responding correctly on a daily basis (if you know what I mean). Eureka!!
 Very good product.  I have not used it very long but I already notice a difference in my energy level.  Also nice to only having to take one capsule twice a day as some other brands dose is four capsules a day.
 A friend of mine suggested me to help my thyroid with this product. I purchased this product to counteract some of the symptoms I was having regarding what appeared to be an underactive thyroid got borderline . So far , I like it. It is helping me with my energy levels.
 I feel somewhat better after taking these for about 5 days now. I have noticed a slight increase in my energy levels. Looking forward to seeing how I feel by the end of the month.
 Hi everyone,<br/>I don’t like to write reviews typical. I really don’t have the time in my busy life. I have had such great success with is product that I have to tell my story. So I have hypothyroidism and am being medicated with your typical thyroid medication which isn’t perfect. I looked on amazon for a supplement that would help my thyroid even more. So the first day I took it I felt a difference. I have more good days then bad now it’s been a couple of weeks now. It just works, I was very amazed with how much of a difference it has made in my life. I have read all the reviews and you have people not feeling anything to people<br/>Like me where it’s night and day difference. I think it depends on how deficient you are in these vitamins and minerals. You don’t have to take my word for it by a bottle and give it a chance. You have nothing to loose and a life to gain!!!!
 Nothing it doesn't work at all.
 had some concerns about stubborn weight gain. This is definitely the answer.
 Hard to tell so soon, but it seems to help with energy levels. Thank you.
 This product has helped my endocrine system get back on track after a powerpak of prednisone. Good support. Thanks.
 I am taking this along with a prescription thyroid medicine since my Dr wanted me to use a supplement along with it. So far so good!
 Haven't experienced any side effects after taking it for 2 weeks. Will know more once I visit my doctor to have my thyroid test done.
 It's a great product which gives me much more energy. I would definately recomment it to my friends!
 I liked the price and the customer service.
 I take it in the morning and late afternoon after my workout. It’s helping me combat belly fat and promote a healthier me!
 I have taken this supplement for several months.  I feel the ingredients,especially the ashwagandha,  are very important for those of us with thyroid issues so I plan on taking it regularly.
 This product is amazing!! Been using couple months an d I feel revived!! Years of misery lead me to this life saving hopefull product😇
 This is an excellent product. My TSH levels have improved after taking this product.
 Just started and really like the product.
 I'm a 60 year plus woman with insomnia issues. This supplement seemed to help with that. I have been taking one in the am for the past 10 months.
 So far so good...  We shall see what my labs look like in a couple of weeks.
 This is a great product.  It has helped me a lot with energy and general overall feeling better. I highly recommend that you try it. Customer service is superb, also !
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a month now and Ihave more energy and my nails have started to grow.
 way more cost effective than prescription medicine alternatives.  Works great!
 I feel more energetic since taking this. Also I feel more focused throughout the day and rest easier at night.
 I have been taking this everyday and my levels are becoming optimal!
 My TSH level is borderline so I decided to try this product to boost my TSH level.
 I start to wake up easier. I have more energy and my wellness in general improved.
 I have generally felt that I have more energy, but I have not yet noticed weight loss.
 Have not really noticed significant difference, but product is easy to take.
 It helped me stay focused I’m a natural way. No jitters like caffeine.
 So far so good. It's hard to tell anything in just 3 weeks, but I have noticed that I feel a bit better.
 I have been taking this about a month and I have noticed I have more energy, I've also been taking their adrenal support.  Overall they seem like good products
 I have been taking a few supplements for hormone balance and proper metabolism and so far the thyroid support has been helping properly metabolize these supplements and works well in conjunction with them. I have been able to get back to my maintenance weight in part because of hard work and the help of these supplements.
 One pill covers several areas of concern
 After years of complaining to my doctors about feeling tired and sluggish. Feeling like I can barely lift my arms or walk up steps.  Gaining weight and never losing it.  Being told my numbers are good...UGH!  I was searching Amazon for another book to read about Hypothyroid, trying to make my everyday life better.  I stumbled across this, decided to purchase.  Best decision EVER!! OMG! What a life changer!!! I have energy!  I wake up in the morning feeling rested.  "I have forgotten what it feels like to severely fatigued"  LOVE IT!!!!
 I purchased this product in hopes of reducing symptoms of hypothyroidism. My mood swings and fatigue are better and I'm sleeping better.
 Have only been taking it for a couple of weeks, but I feel like it is helping with low energy levels and poor sleep.  Hoping to see more improvement as I continue to take it.
 I really like this product. Been on it just 1 week. I must say I feel so much better. I plan on staying on this product. I have tried other formulas. Nothing quite like this one. I feel more energy, a tad slimmer. more like myself. Thank you.<br/><br/>  Marie Frenz
 Fast shipping!  I've only been taking for a week or so. No negative side effects so far.  I feel like I need to finish a whole bottle before I can say whether it has truly helped. So far so good though!
 This product has helped stop hair loss and renewed my energy.  Thanks for a great product!
 Great price.  Fast ship.  So far so good.
 Great product
 Love this stuff! Have waited a couple weeks to do a review so if know if it actually helps anything. I do honestly feel better while I have been taking this product. I don't seem to have the fatigue that I had before and my joints hurt less also while using it. I will be buying again!
 Clear instructions, good value.
 this product has given me more energy...and hoping to help me lose some weight..
 I've noticed a difference in my energy levels since I've started taking the product.  I plan to buy more and would recommend to anyone whose thyroid tests are always normal but yet you still lack energy and have hormonal issues.
 Fantastic product. Noticed a difference within a week and feel much better. The company will also send you a free product coupon for an additional bottle at no charge...unbelievable! Great product from a great company!
 I feel like I have more energy and am not in need of a nap midway through the day.
 Havent try the product in long term yet. But as far as the ingredients and benefits concern, compare to the other thyroid support supps. I can honestly say that this will helps me to have a great results and maintaining a healthy Thyroid functions. Will post more review after 1 finish the 1st bottle. thanks 1Body :)
 Its important to me to have Iodine, Selenium and Zinc. This product helps<br/>I with my energy level. I usually take it mid morning. It’s worked well for me.
 good but have to wait for some more time for more accurate review
 I like this product. It is really helping with all my  hypothyroidism symptoms.
 I have been using this product for about one week now and while this is a very premature review I do feel that my energy levels are slowly slowly going up. What I can say for sure is that customer service is very good and I am very pleased with their responses and the offer of a free product
 I have had a partial thyroidectomy and have started on thyroid medication.  I chose to purchase the thyroid support in hopes to make sure I am giving my partial thyroid every advantage to do it's job well.  I have only been taking this for a week.  I am looking forward to seeing what happens after a couple months.
 more energized and active than before. directly affecting my daily performance.
 Came as orderd.  Kind of expensive.  Didn't notice a difference.
 I started taking this today.<br/><br/>And I ALREADY feel more energy.<br/><br/>Tired of the Dr. telling you your thyroid isn't under-active?<br/><br/>Take this into your own hands, and try this product.You won't' regret it.
 I have noticed more energy and clearer thinking since using this product.<br/>It has ingredients that I was supplementing with anyway so this makes it easier!
 It makes me feel alright. Not a bad to have pills.
 Increased energy
 In conjunction with the medication prescribed, my thyroid levels have boosted.
 I was so very tired all the time and my doctor couldn't help me.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for a couple of months and have noticed a huge improvement in my mental clarity and energy levels. I notice immediately when I stop taking it. Definitely signing up for a monthly subscription so I don't run out again!
 I just ordered a second bottle. Will update review at 3 months!
 I have just received the Thyroid Support  and WOW  what a nice surprise to find the FREE bottle offer in the box !<br/>The formulation is superb, more complete than  the other  Thyroid products I researched.  Another review  will be written after using the first bottle.
 It has help with my fatigue
 I have lost 11 pounds in the last 2 weeks!!!!!!!!
 For thyroid well-being
 I have only been taking the thyroid support  for a few weeks but I am already starting to feel the difference. I have a little more energy than before and my mind is not quite as foggy.  Hopefully it keeps improving.
 I’m starting to feel like myself again. Bloating is down considerably.
 Really good product. Glad I bought it.
 Been taking for 3 weeks now. Really feeling more mental clarity and energy and over all wellness.
 I have been taking this supplement for about two weeks now. It feels as if I have more energy and mental clarity. I did lose 2 pounds, but I'm not sure if it's because of the supplement, or because I watch what I eat, or a combination of both. I will keep taking it for a few more weeks and will probably reorder.
 Good product that seems to help. I've only been taking it for a short time, but my energy levels seem to have increased and I'm not as tired as I had been.
 Seems that working out good. I have noticed improvement in cold feet which I have been experiences for a while.
 I WAS FEELING BLOATED
 Just ordered and I'm excited to try it.  I've read all the great reviews and I hope it helps me as much as it does other people.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Didn't work for me. I'm on my second bottle that I got for free if I reviewed the product. I haven't expierenced any change whatsoever.
 I've been buying a thyroid support supplement from a nutrition store, just a generic brand but thought I'd try something better. Thought I'd try this product due to good reviews and was pleasantly surprised. I'm usually sensitive to herbal medications but this seems to be working great. My energy is back and will definitely buy again.
 It's subtle but I have noticed my energy level is more consistent throughout the day instead of swinging up and down.
 More energy; less fatigue; and, overall, much more active for a 74 year old! Love this product.
 I’ve only been taking them for 2 weeks, but I’ve noticed I’m sleeping better.
 Great product, helps with the symptoms of hypothyroidism, the feeling of tiredness and lack of energy is gone, they even give you a free bottle of the supplement that comes in the box the first time you buy it, and not manufactured with wheat, gluten, soy, milk, egg, fish, or tree nut ingredients.
 Taking it every day. So far I feel better and less drained. Also it seems like my digestion is smoother. I don't want to go into too many details, but I believe it's helping me with what I bought it for.
 I liked it
 So far so good. A little more energy, but I have read that it is most effiective after taking it for 30 days.
 I have used it for about three weeks, and I feel great.
 I really can't say much I just started taking but seems to be good
 Love this product. Along with some other lifestyle changes, this product has contributed to improved sleep, weight loss, and overall well being.
 Noticing increased energy and more restful sleep.  Will be buying again
 Going on 2nd week.  I do notice that my hair is not falling out as much and I do feel a little more energetic.  Hoping as I get further into taking them I will really notice more of a difference.
 Details and reviews.
  I have only been taking the Thyroid Support supplement for 15 days, but honestly feel a bit more energized and emotionally more stable as a result. It is too soon to accurately rate the product, but I am keeping my faith that it will assist in balancing my thyroid. I purchased this supplement in hopes that it will provide me with energy and help correct my hair thinning/loss. 1 Body has offered a free product as saying thank you for shopping with them; I appreciate their customer satisfaction priority. 
 I always have cravings later in the evening after dinner, and when taking the Thyroid Support, I no longer have cravings.
 Not sure..contains excellent ingredients...might make me slightly nauseous.  Mixing with my medication.  Too early to tell of it's effectiveness.
 There is a history of thyroid issues with the women in my family.  At 53 I knew losing weight would be more difficult and take longer to get to my goal weight.  In my search to find a thyroid support supplement, I read many reviews.  After seeing such positive feedback, I decided to give the 1Body Brand a try.  I have been taking this for about a month and can already tell that it's making a difference - even though most of the reviews said they took the supplement for approximately 2 months before really seeing an impact.  SO, I'm looking forward to seeing future improvements on the positive impact this supplement is having on my energy level (don't require as much sleep and sleep better, in addition to weight loss acceleration)!!!
 awesome product! Seen changes within and absolutely love this product!
 Excellent! Have seen Great results in just a few weeks. Higher energy levels!
 I am more focused and I’ve lost weight and inches!!
 Hi , I have heard of your products and very excited to get started. I just purchased your thyroid support* I have had hypothyroid for many years, and believe this product will be my "ticket" ;-) I just received my product I am on day 2!! Like I said..can't wait to get started!!!
 Pretty good so far...
 feel more energetic and fluid retention in leg reducing
 So far, great product! This is only second day that I've been using the product and I honestly feel a difference in my energy level. I'm ecstatic and I can't wait to see how much more of a difference will it make in the days to come.
 It is a good combination of minerals to support the thyroid.
 Noticed a difference within a few days!
 Unfortunately, I haven't noticed any difference with this product.  To be fair, I am not taking 2/day as recommended and instead take 1 so maybe if I up the dose I will notice the difference. I have taken other thyroid supportive supplements and notice that they work better.  I have no thyroid (due to cancer some years ago) so am on Synthroid and wanted this supplement to assist in supporting my medication and eliminate some of the tiredness, inability to lose weight etc that goes along with hypothyroidism - even if your doctor says your blood work is "normal".
 I have enjoyed adding this supplement to my daily vitamins.
 i like the product
 I've been using this product for about 4 weeks now and I feel like it's doing the job. I'm feeling more energetic, and overall I'm feeling pretty good, so I plan on continuing with this supplement.
 Good. Thanks
 Just started taking the product and immediately noticed an energy burst and I am not as cold as I was all day long. There have been no side effects and I will need to evaluate more changes after taking these for a longer period of time. So far, so good!
 My hair starting growing back in and my dry skin is starting to go away. I have a lot more energy.
 great so far would, although i would like to take it a llittle longer before posting a complete review.
 Great product. Felt better than I have in years since Hashimotos has stolen my life. Clearer head and more energy.I have only been using a few weeks. I will update more in a few months.
 Starting taking Thyroid Support about a month ago!! I have felt great taking the product. My energy levels are great and I feel it has helped me maintain my weight! Great product. Thanks 1 Body and Amazon for a great selection of supplements.
 I just started taking this and can tell a difference already.  I haven't been getting my afternoon crash and find that I am sleeping better already.  Very pleased and plan to continue to take the product.
 So far, so good. I need more time to rate it as a 5 star product.
 I think this helped my brittle hair and dry skin.  Very responsive and customer friendly service when ordering.
 good
 I could feel a real difference after only a few days of taking this product.
 Haven't been taking it long enough to feel results, but I could the e-book to be  EXTREMELY informative and helpful. I also appreciate the offer to receive another month's worth of the product for free. This will ensure that I say on the healthy regimen, and will incorporate it into my daily life. Thank you so much
 This product is such a blessing.  I now feel extra energy, and actually awake more refreshed!
 Good Stuff.  Ever since I started taking it, I have noticed a number of changes, particularly that my energy levels have shot up, and that my head is now clearer than ever.  Also, I have lost six pounds since taking the product and my hair is no longer riddled with constant dandruff.  Definitely would purchase this product again.
 I am experiencing more energy!
 Love this product, I've used it for a year and found I had more energy.
 I like the fact that it gives me energy. I did not see any weight lost.
 Feeling refreshed and more energy!
 I couldn't lose weight until I started using this product. I have more energy and my mood is better. Definitely buying this again!
 Feeling more energetic during working hours
 Great product. Has helped with my exhaustion.
 I have more energy and my appetite is back under control
 Keeping my energy up so I can thrive in my life. :) Ron's wife, Deb
 Gave me more energy and no low energy in the afternoons.
 Haven't started taking this yet but many family members have thyroid problems. I have been working out 2-4 hours most days, reducing calories and eating better quality foods...only 10lbs lost in 3 months:( Hopefully this helps boost my system!
 Just got it today, but its exactly what I'm looking, Thanks again!!
 I have noticed a lot less fatigue and my skin and hair are improving.
 Be consistent and you’ll noticed more energy!
 More energy better sleep and weight loss.
 Very healthful
 I have been taking this and adrenal support as suggested on the bottle (1 morning and 1 evening) and I really have noticed a difference!!  I am one of those women that has been tested for thyroid issues but always come back "within range".  Even though my mother, sister and brother all have diagnosed thyroid conditions.  I feel clearer and more well-rested in the mornings after taking these.  I really hope they help me with recent weight gain in my upper body which is bothering me but too soon to tell.  Definitely worth taking!
 So far so good. I've only been taking it for a couple of weeks (which is why it's 4 stars for now) and already notice a difference. Looking forward to committing to this for a while and see if I continue to feel better.
 been using this for a week and at same time gave up coffee, I expected afternoon crashes and yet I'm pleasantly surprised I actually feel great and this is what I added. Will continue to use
 I have had thyroid issues my whole life and am not reacting well to the thyroid substitute. With thyroid support and essential oils peppermint oil I am taking one third of the substitute that I was a year ago
 I have noticed a difference with my digestive issues. I will continue taking this and expect to have continued relief.
 I just started using this product for a few days now. I have noticed a significant increase in energy and my appetite has decreased.  I haven't had any negative side effects at all and I love the way it has given me the extra boost that I need!
 I suffer from Hyperthyroidism this product is amazing!
 Hoping to feel more energized, less cold and to lose some belly fat.
 It has helped keep my moods more consistent and given me more energy
 Had terrific energy levels and stamina missing previously - love it!
 I feel better...
 I am extremely happy with the results of this product
 Excellent product - has helped me feel better!
 Love that it was free. Haven't tried it yet.
 It has everything I was taking and more, and in one convenient pill. I’m definitely going to keep taking this.
 Works in helping keep my metabolism up.
 I took a month and only felt results from the first 2 weeks, so I skipped the next month.  I went back on it the month after that and have only started feeling small improvements near the end of the month but I am going to try one more month so I will have been consistently taking it and report back after the end of it.  I am also going to have my labs done to see if there was any difference from my last labs before ever taking the supplement. Hoping for consistency and great things to add to my review!
 Love it.  I feel over All much better.
 I feel more energized and more “me” 😊
 I have been using it and it really works fine, I feel really good, not tired at all, with more energy.
 A very good product
 This has been a great supplement for me while trying to lose weight! I clearly do not get enough iodine in my diet, and these help a great deal!
 Great stuff!
 Love this product! Will re-order....A++ all the way
 Just started taking it and have no problems so far.
 Fell like I have more energy and seem to be sleeping better!
 After taking 1 pill a day in the morning for about a month now, I definitely have much more energy and certainly feel better since I started taking it.<br/>No more mid-day crashes!
 Gives me the extra energy I need to get through my day!
 Does exactly as advertised and more thanks a bunch
 It seems to be working.  I will know more when I get my next bloodwork done.
 I have more energy, brain clarity and initiative. No weight loss but maybe I should up my dosage to 3 a day.
 I haven't noticed a significant difference since starting to take the supplement a month ago.
 I have just started taking this product and cannot give an appropriate review as to wether it works or not but I was directed to leave this review.
 This is a great Supplement  Thanks so much.
 Shipping is fast, customer service is great! I have been on thyroid support for about 2 months now and definitely feel like I have more energy. I also feel like my last two menstrual cycles have been lighter and cramps are less (I believe it's related to the zinc).
 I dont have any thyroid related problems. But I feel fatigued all the time. Taking Thyroid Support and Adrenal Support has really help me being more energetic and active ! love the product and will easily recommend it to friends!
 All the right ingredients for thyroid support.
 just started to taking. We've tried many of other brands. So far,  My husband likes it so much.
 after taking Thyroid Support for a few weeks my energy seems to have picked up have not needed afternoon cat nap
 I am taking this with the adrenal support and seem to be doing well with both products.
 I love this supplement. It gives me lots of energy I never had before.
 Hair loss seems less.  I get less tired.  I will be buying more.
 I was told by my doctor that my thyroid levels were off and it was in relation to being severally anemic. I ordered this product last year and I received it the day after Thanksgiving and I took it and felt so much better like two hours later and I have been feeling better since. I like the natural products.
 I love it. I will be buying again. I have notice a big improvement in mood and energy.
 Great product, I received a boost in metabolism, mental clarity, and energy. I have lost 5lbs and I have not been working out much maybe once a week and that's from work.
 Good product
 It helps maintain my overall hormone levels like my testosterone and energy.
 So far I feel well rested in the mornings and my hair feels healthier. I love it so far!!! Thank you 1Body 😊
 I've only just begun this product, but so far, I have had no ill side-effects as I have with some other supplements.
 Helps with the energy level and control weight.
 I love this product. I just wish it was a little better price
 Great Product. I definitely feel more energized now that I'm taking this. Before I lacked energy and everyday was fog like. I couldn't stay awake during the day. Now can just pop out of bed and be ready to go. Would definitely recommend this.
 It keeps up my energy level and I don't have "brain fog" any more.
 less naps needed!!!!
 Have been using for<br/>Months could not be happierZ
 I have only been taking it for a few days but i can already tell a difference in the way I feel and the energy i have.
 Worked as expected.
 Easy pill to swallow
 I have alot better focus and a increase in my energy levels!
 Helped with energy levels and cleared mind fog
 I just received thyroid support in the mail and am excited to try. I've been feeling sluggish, cloudy headed, tired, etc for quite a while. I am hoping this will help. Will leave an update after i've tried.
 Great product!
 it works fine as described, I feel much better, great product!.
 this product gave me more energy
 I've been taking product for about 2 weeks now. I've experienced more energy since.
 I have more energy since I started taking Thyroid Support.
 Definetly gives me more energy than the synthroid I was taking. I can truly tell a difference.
 Just finishing my 2nd week, Thyroid Support is giving me the energy I had lost.  I will definitely be re-ordering.  Excited to see how my lab numbers have improved after being on this.
 I like the fact I wasn't hungry
 This product has definitely increased my energy. Thank you!
 Only on day two with this item, already have a sense of well being already.  Noticing energy picking up, better sleep, less brain fog.  I look forward to the full rewarding experience after prolonged use and clicking on the 5-star rating then.
 I feel better when I take it.  Less tired and run down feeling.  I can tell the difference after a few days if I run out.
 I've only been taking this for 2 weeks. Not as tired as I was &amp; now working 12 hr shifts. I was also having trouble with my weight while dieting and excersing 5 days out of the week.But I finally started losing more weight. 5lbs is a great start! Hopefully continue To take this product and see more results.
 Unfortunately, I do not get earth shaking results from this supplement,  I do get benefits, I use this with my prescription Synthroid, I suffer from Hypothyroidism.  I believe it does help, used this when I ran out of my prescription medicine and I felt ok till I refilled it.  I think it has a lot of benefits.  I would recommend it if you know for sure you have thyrouid trouble.  I would recommend with a Prescription medication.  nice product.
 Great supplement. Vendor was exceptional. Very satisfied customer.
 best product I found really works. keeps my thyroid where it's suppose to be at. just don't care for the size of the capsule
 This product has made me feel better.  The slight headaches and fatigue have decreased and my mental clarity is returning
 More energy, and no more brain fog!
 Just Started. Let you know. GERRY
 So far so good! Feeling more energy and sleeping better:)
 Love this product I have tried many and I feel results
 I just received this product and am very excited to start taking it. I have hypothyroidism and need major help with how tired and run down I stay. I plan to up date as I go on how the product is working for me. I received the product quickly and will start taking it tomorrow.
 I feel much more able to get around to do the things of life.  I have also lost some weight
 Great Compliment to my Naturthroid. I take this because it has all of the ingredients my Naturopath recommended to support my Hypothyroidism.
 I like how it gave me more energy for my long work days.
 I haven't had any bad side affects from this product and its has kept my thyroid levels within normal limits
 It has made a great difference in my energy level!
 I feel this is a great compliment to my underactive thyroid treatment plan.
 I've been looking for a solution for my thyroid issues (hashimoto's disease) and this may very well be it! Have been taking it for a week and it feels great. It seems that in general I have less fatigue and better attention span. Though would need to wait longer to be sure of actual results.
 I had previously been on a prescription for a low thyroid medication. The prescription ran out and I decided to try this instead of the synthetic meds. I have felt great! Don't think it's going to help you shed weight simply by adding it to your routine, but combined with proper diet and exercise, you may have that result. WIthout thyroid medication, I have a hard time dropping pounds, even with a strict diet and exercise. But adding this has helped! My energy level is sustained as well. Glad to have found this!
 I've used this product for 3 weeks. It seems to have given me more energy despite the stressful events occurring in my life. I have high hopes it will continue to improve my energy level as I continue to use it.
 Still evaluating
 Waiting to try
 Love them. I'm energized my hair stopped falling out like crazy and my weight finally is stabilized. Well recommended!!!
 Starting to feel more energized after 2 weeks.
 I believe it has been helping but I have only been taking if for a little over 2 weeks so I will post another review in a couple months.  I plan to keep taking it and I think my energy level is better.
 i am looking for a product to help me with several symptoms including weight gain, moodiness, sluggishness, and others. hoping this thyroid supplement is the thing ive been looking for
 Product arrived quickly....only taken it a few days....selected it because of so many people saying it helped them feel better in spite of thyroid bloodwork always showing "normal" results.  Hoping to have good things to report myself...too soon to tell.
 Great stuff.  Worked better than normal kelp.  Will try again.
 It did worked.It made me focused and have more energy throughout  the day.
 Keeps me alert and active. And increases my metabolism.
 Great product, I feel amazing!
 Thinking more clearly and hair loss has slowed! Thanks!
 I have been taking the thyroid support for 2 weeks and I can really see this is working for me. I would really recommended this product.
 So far so good will keep taking and see
 I like the extra support that the supplement gives me.
 Great product, fast shipping
 Great product would recommend to anyone
 I received my first shipment today. It shipped very quickly and well packaged. I have been looking forward to it based on the reviews of how it made other people feel so much better. I took it a couple of hours ago and already feel less sluggish and more energetic. I'm excited to see my results!
 I seem to have more energy and less brain fog since taking this product. My mood has also elevated.
 I really don't know if this is helping or not.  I self diagnosed myself with low thyroid due to lack of Iodine in my diet.  I have been taking it faithfully for about a bottle and a half.  Feel good.  Might have helped.  I will continue for awhile.
 It works.<br/>Confirmed.
 I absolutely love this supplement. I started feeling better immediately after 2 weeks. I have more energy, I feel invigorated, and I'm losing weight as well. I'm already on my second bottle. Two thumbs up from me!
 I just received this supplement for my wife and she is excited to try and see if it helps with her hypothyroid symptoms.
 I loved it!
 I received my Thyroid Support Supplement 2 days ago.  I started taking it right away and I definitely feel increased energy. I am looking forward<br/>to my progress, as I continue to take the supplements.
 I love this product, i feel energetic and alive again.
 Feel great, have more energy and skin is much softer
 I've been on this product about three months now and feel significantly better. Much more optimistic and better health all around. Thank You!
 I purchased this product because I liked the combination of ingredients in one supplement rather than having to buy and take a bunch of different ones. I am also happy that it is does not contain wheat.
 This is my second bottle of Thyroid Support. I can tell when forget to take it for a few days. I feel less energy and my mind is less clear. I took a chance on this product and I am glad I did
 I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I noticed more energy and also a bit of weight loss!
 I am very happy with this product and will reorder!
 Adds afternoon energy if taken at 3pm
 second time I ordered this.. still Happy :-)
 Chose this product for the list of ingredients, it contained, that I was specifically looking for...<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-natural-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - natural blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 Noticed an increase in energy within the first week. Purchased along another product from 1 Body called Adrenal Support. Not sure which one is helping the most so I am reordering both. So far its been great .Dramatic decrease in fatigue level.
 I have just started so will do a more lengthy review after a couple of weeks.  I stumbled across this product and decided to try because of the rave reviews. After purchasing, I found out my sister has already been using it and she loves it!!
 Seems to work for the wife.
 It is giving me more energy. I have fibrocistic disease and it seems to help my pains associated with it.
 I have more energy and my thinking is less foggy.
 This product has helped me gain more energy and get my levels back to where I feel best. I do take a prescription med along with it.
 I have low thyroid problem but it is fluctuating so my Dr. doesn't want to put me on RX medication.<br/>Few month ago I was doing really bad - extremely tired everyday and depressed.<br/>I also have low Vit-D level and was not taking D for a while.<br/>So I started to take Vit-D and Thyroid support together.<br/>Wow , I felt alive and really started loving my life again.<br/>I only take one a day and still it give me enough energy.<br/>This pill has done wonderful job for me.
 Great supplement!  Great seller.
 Me siento mucho mejor desde que tomo  el producto
 I've only been taking this product 1 week and I feel a difference!  I'm very impressed. I've been suffering with hypothyroid for 12 years. Where has thus product been for the past 12 years?! I'm happy I ordered this.
 Only been taking it for three days.  Haven't noticed any effects but it might still be early.
 I've only been using for a couple of weeks but it seems to be working for me.
 Greattach product. I noticed the effects within a few days. I was no longer sluggish and my weight loss journey began to increase in the right direction.
 I buy this for my mother that has thyroid problems. I have noticed a huge change in her mood and her energy level.  She is very satisfied with the results of this product and says she feels much better and has more energy.
 Healthy hair
 I haven't used this for long, but so far I feel better
 I seem to have a lot more energy as soon as I started taking only one a day, plan on adding the recommended second one soon. No bad side effects. Also received a follow up from company
 I have more energy and gradually losing some weight.
 No negative side effects. I feel great and am off of my prescription thyroid medication.
 I"m hypothyroid and I can tell a difference in how I am feeling both emotionally and physically since I started using this product.
 Support for thyroid.
 I give it 4 stars because I buy it for a family member and can't give first hand experience. The family member seems to be benefitting from this supplement, mood is better, energy and sleep seem better too.
 Energy
 Ive been taking Thyroid support for about a month and I feel more energetic and better overall, I highly recommend it for anyone with thyroid issues and I will be buying it again, I was diagnosed hypothyroid a few months ago, my tsh was 13.4, my worst symptom has been fatigue, severe pms and dry hair and skin, I am not taking any prescribed medication, but I have been eating healthy, drinking more water, focusing on stress relief and taking the Thyroid Support supplement and I also take vitamin D3 and Evening Primrose oil, Im glad I found a good supplement and from the research have done all the ingredients in Thyroid Support are highly beneficial for the thyroid, I plan to go back and see if my Tsh has changed and will share the results, give the supplement a try, you have nothing to lose, I have not had any bad side effects, best of luck to everyone!
 I feel less exhausted during the day and I feel more rested after I sleep.
 I have taken this product in the past with positive results and am now restarting it.  I really do feel more energetic when I take it...also more alert.
 my clothes seem to fit better now
 This supplement has made improvement in my body, less fatigue, more energy and I sleep much better!  Also, I'm not as hungry.
 So far this has been great, better energy for me as well! I'm pleased and excited to see what my full results will be in the future.
 This product helps give me a new energy that's so mild or unnoticeable you fiinish the  job which is great feeling of accomplishment. So yes to this  thyroid support supplement .
 I've been using this for about two weeks now and have noticed an awesome increase in energy, my appetite has decreased and I've been losing weight - which is fantastic! will report back after using it for longer period of time
 I have only been taking the Thyroid support for 2 weeks and I feel more energetic and it seems my hair loss has slowed.  I'm hoping to see improved results with continued use.
 I love my thyroid support! I'm so glad I found an all natural alternative to thyroid health.
 just want to say it eorks for me
 I love the product , it gives me more energy and I sleep better
 I like the product but have to take with food
 I've gotten 3 bottle of this and love it! I feel human again.
 I liked it cause more energized
 I really think it did anything.
 My thyroid function shows normal on blood tests, but have fatigue and hair loss and some of the other symptoms so decided to try this supplement. It makes me feel more alert and not so foggy. I will continue to take.
 I have a lot more energy and I'm loosing weight too, very happy with this product.
 I have taken two bottles of Thyroid Support. The best thing about it might surprise most people. I sleep much better at night. I had been taking the natural sleep aids, but now there is no need for them. Even if I get up in the night, I go right back to sleep. One would  have thought the opposite would be true since the point of it is to give your energy a boost. I would highly recommend those who have trouble sleeping to try it. I have another long standing health issue that this supplement has probably helped, but I will save that one for the next time.
 I've only been taking this a few days and can already feel the difference
 Good so far i hope to continue taking it and continue to enjoy the benefits
 Awesome my wife loves this
 This review is for my husband, who sings the praises of this product. He has more energy and the weight is finally coming off.thank you
 I just started using this product and I like the ease of the capsule. I will have to wait awhile to see if the product is helpful in maintaining a healthy thyroid, but I'm hoping it will.
 I never wrote reviews but I have just finished my first bottle of Thyroid Support and this has completely changed my sleep, my energy, my mood, my appetite and my clarity. Seriously. It works!
 just started taking this product,so far seems to give me more energy,hope it will help my thyroid to work more efficiently
 Helps keep my thyroid in on check and gives me a boost of energy that I need.
 I do feel better since I started taking this Thyroid Support Supplement.  I have lost some weight since I started taking them and I have a lot more energy.  Thank you for a great product.  I will continue to use them – twice daily.
 haven't used long enough to post any findings.
 I feel as though it's working for me. My metabolism has gone up a little since taking it.
 I started getting my energy back from being so tired all the time. I didn’t feel like I was in a fog all the time.
 It gives energy
 using as a replacement for a more expensive weight loss clinic product, increased from once a day to twice a day to get the last 10 pounds off and it is definitely helping get there and keep it off
 Thyroid Support has become a daily supplement for me for several months. I have more energy and adding the Adrenal Support has made a huge difference for over all feeling of healthy living!!
 This Thyroid Support Supplement has given me tons of energy and I feel more alert!!!  Highly recommend!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for about a month and lost 5 pounds.
 Gave me tons of energy!
 From my experience it's working as intended. Will purchase again.
 Helped me lose weight and have more energy
 I've been taking this product for 6 months now and I love the way it makes me feel.  I recommend this product.
 --It's only been a week. But today I felt better than I have in the last 3 years.
 I noticed a increase in energy with in the first few days
 Very fast and efficient. Product has improved overall sense of well being, and I've lost 12 pounds in 1 month.
 It works as specified!
 I've been taking this product for a few months now and I can certainly tell a difference. My mood seems to be more stable, I sleep better at night, and I don't have crazy cravings anymore. Love this product.
 Have been taking for a few weeks now and can start to see a change in my metabolism and reduction of fatigue.
 have been taking for a week and I feel better already
 This seems to be effective at managing my sluggish thyroid. So far so good.
 Increased energy level and doesn’t cause nausea or upset stomach. No bad taste and easy to swallow.
 This product has made me feel less tired!
 I don’t feel any difference
 I really like this product.
 Since I started this, I can see a huge difference. My energy levels have improved and my metabolism has improved.I'm very satisfied!
 Love it!
 I have a little more energy from taking this product. Very good customer service as well.
 I was disappointed at first. The product I had been taking was discontinued and I had to find a replacement. I only needed to take 1 a day of my previous thyroid supplement. Once I started taking 2 a day- 1 in the morning and 1 at night- of the Thyroid Support it worked fine.
 This is my first time actually writing a review about a product this pill is amazing I been taking it for a week now an it made me sleep more better an it giv me more energy throughout the day I highly recommend this product to anyone that is suffering from hypothyroidism.It is a really great product
 i was pleased with the results. have added it to my morning routine in conjunction with my thyroid medication.
 Just Started 15 days back and feel some positive change in my energy level.
 I feel so much better with a stabilized thyroid!
 Just started. Nothing to report yet. Will update results.
 This product is amazing! I was second guessing purchasing it but once I read the review I took a shot. I have lost 5 pounds in one week with diet and exercise plus taking this supplement. It's doing my metabolism justice! Let's not talk about my energy level it went from 4 to 10!
 Great product I will recommend it to anyone gave me energy
 I've been taking this for about 4 weeks, feeling much better with extra energy!
 I like the product made me feel better
 Thank you.
 I have been taking this for over a month and it seems to be helping me.
 I was looking for a new thyroid boosting supplement and have been taking this one for two months now. I have been very happy with the results, price and ability to get it quick through Amazon prime.
 Prior to taking Thyroid Support I was feeling drained and lethargic almost daily.  After taking Thyroid Support I have more energy and overall feel much better throughout the day.
 I like this product and use it instead of a prescription.
 Shipped Quickly, does what it says on the tin.
 I love the enery level!
 Just got the product today - Im hopeful! I will update this review after I finish the first bottle.
 I'll know better when I get by thyroid panel test back.
 I'm not as tired,and I just feel better. My body feels better. Use to depend on coffee to keep me going and now I only drink it on Saturday just for the Taste. And its decaf
 I take one 1body thyroid support and one 1body adrenal support daily (For the last 6 months). I do feel better and have just placed another order.
 I was feeling real tired but after I took the thyroid support I had loads of energy.  It arrived very quick.  Packaging was good.  I am taking along with levothyrosine 25 mg.  I say at least give it a go.
 I have only been taking this supplement for 2 days, so I cannot personally say if it is benefiting me or not.  The good reviews were the reason that I decided to give it a try.  I will have to update my review in a few weeks.
 I just started taking the supplement, so don't have complete feedback yet; however, there is no negative side affects, which is good thing since I am very sensitive to most harsh supplements.  Will update results in 1 month.
 Awesome supplemt. I feel much better
 Product gave me energy
 More focus and energy!
 I have only been on this product for about two weeks. I will say that I can stay up later (which is rare) and I have been in a better mood... Other than that, I will update my review when I have been on it for longer.
 It's great this has the methyl form of B12 and Ashwagandha root. Two supplements I can't live without.
 me ciento mucho mejor
 It’s working very well for me. I will continue to use this product in the future.
 I stopped Levothyroxine and started using thyroid supplements. This has really helped and now after 3 months I have been completely off Levothyroxine. I would recommend this product.
 Sounded too good to be true from the other reviews, but this really is a great product.  It suppressed my appetite almost immediately.  Within about a week I also had increased energy and mental clarity that I thought I'd lost forever.
 I haven't started this product yet. I bought this product based on many positive comments and will give try it out. I hope it will meet and exceed my expectations. Thanks for reading.
 So far so good. I've only been taking this supplement less than a week so I can't review the results yet but no negative affects so far. Packaging was good. I bought this based on previous reviews and will review again in a few more weeks after taking it longer.
 Love it
 Taken it for 2 weeks and cannot tell a difference but I have not had negative effects either.
 I found this product after doing some research on natural alternatives to boost thyroid levels.  I've been taking Thyroid Support for about three weeks now and can tell a noticeable difference in energy levels and alertness. I highly recommend this product.
 Just started using the product and I have been giving it to my 13 year old husky.  We are both doing quite well and we will be buying more of the Thyroid Support.
 I have more energy. My thyroid medication seems to work better.
 Have had more energy, overall feel better and some weight loss
 I like it, because after taking it, I felt like natural energy. And I sweat like crazy! I love this product.
 I have seen a great deal of energy from this product.  I was using another Thyroid support supplement from Amazon and decided this month to try this.  I am glad i switched.
 I loved this product
 I bought this product after reading some of the other reviews, I have high hopes that this product will do what it says it will do. I just started taking it today April 11,2016 and i will give it a few weeks before i can determine if it works or not.
 Bought this for my husband. He's been taking it for a month and is very happy with the results so far.
 I have more energy, and stamina and a feeling of calm and peace.  I take it twice one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.
 I was using just kelp and about to order some more when I stumbled upon thyroid support. I'm really happy I did.  This product gives me energy and motivation. It keeps my metabolism moving and I have an overall better feeling. Thanks
 this is a great product....it really works!~
 This works great!  Would recommend for anyone with Thyroid issues.  I have been taking Synthroid for years and I have so much more energy after taking Thyroid Support Supplement!  Excellent Product!
 I definitely notice that I have more energy!  I also "feel" lighter.  I'm hoping to have the same results as others who have lost weight.  Since I turned 50, I have had a horrible time losing weight.  I also take 65mg of Nature Throid daily but never felt a difference taking just that.  Now I don't get that middle of the day sleepy period like I do otherwise and I wake up ready to start the day not still sleepy and groggy.  I LOVE IT!!!!
 So far it seems to be helping.  I specifically chose this product for the iodine, and I like it.
 Looking forward to trying it and thank you!
 After using this product twice a day for about a month, I saw an improvement in my mood, energy levels, and overall physical alertness. Issues such as brain fog, listlessness, and body aches seemed to lessen.
 So far I've been using this supplement for a few weeks now and have already started to feel better. I have more energy, my head doesn't feel as foggy, and my hair loss has slowed. I am also not needing to nap as I did before.<br/><br/>I'm currently on synthroid, but was feeling lackluster and was pulling out a ton of hair. I would definitely recommend trying this supplement. It has made a big difference for me already.
 Great product . Since day one I feel 100% better. By 5:00 pm I was extremely tired but thanks to this product my life is much better. I have now energy to do everything that I wasn't able to do before taking this supplement .
 The customer service is outstanding for this product. I was so happy to find a product that has everything I need instead of taking multiple pills.
 Feel better physically and emotionally
 Increase in energy
 Love this product!
 It took about a week for me to feel a difference, but I am feeling more energy than I have felt in two years. I'm excited about this product!
 Just recently started it but hopeful it will be a positive experience, will let you know after a couple of  months.
 My thyroid levels have returned to normal while I have been taking this supplement with medication.
 I have more energy than before!
 I like how this does as it claims
 it helps for thyroid conditions
 So far so good.  No negative side effects like the other thyroid supports I've tried.
 Began taking about 2 weeks ago and am already beginning to feel the difference with more energy and focus. Would recommend giving it a try.
 Great product, quick shipment, help me with hypothyroidism.  This product is a healthier way to keep thyroid problem under control compared to prescribed medicine
 I have been only taking it for about 2 weeks. I take thyroid medication so I hoped that it would help<br/>with losing some weight so far it has not. The one thing is my nails are growing.
 I started taking this after I read the reviews.  I was hungry all the time and after I began taking this I could go all day at work without eating some kind of snack nonstop.  I haven't lost weight but my hunger seems to be getting under control.
 Have not been using this product very long but have noticed an increase in my over all energy and focus. The product had many good reviews which is why I chose to try it out. So far I am impressed, would give it more stars if I had more time taking it and new the total effects.
 It has improved my metabolism which I was struggling with and with weight gain
 I have taken one bottle and started another bottle. It seems to be helping my thyroid.
 Great product! I was looking for a replacement for Synthroid because I was having no luck with it and feeling worse. This product has helped me to feel much better than I ever felt taking my prescription medicine.
 I had never taken supplements specifically for my thyroid, but after reading all the reviews decided to give it a try.  Just ordered my second bottle, I really do feel a difference in my overall energy.
 My daughter is still testing this product.  Unfortunately, she may had botched up the first bottle by storing it in the refrigerator after opening it.  Posting this (neutral) review for the free bottle.
 Excellent!
 I am still unsure about this product due to only taking it for about a week.  I am hopeful that it will help me to get back on track.
 Great supplement! I feel it keeps me energized and alert. Usually I feel tired and moody but this supplement helps in balancing things out with the appropriate nutrients I am missing.
 Amazing results!
 I feel like I have more energy than with just my regular sythroid.
 Gives a nice, natural-feeling energy surge without the jittery, restless side effects of caffeine.  Makes me feel motivated to exercise in a non-forced way.  Good product.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE This product!!
 I've been taking the thyroid capsules for approximately 3 weeks, and already notice that I have more energy. I hope it continues to amaze me the longer I'm on it.
 I have been taking this thyroid supplement for over a week now (once a day with breakfast) and i don't feel great after that. I don't think i am continuing with this supplement.
 Whole truth: I'm taking this and several other supplements/homeopathics to get my thyroid and adrenals back on track, but SOMETHING is clearly working. I have waaaaaay more energy. For a few weeks there I was sleeping 10 hours a day and the emotions were bonkers. Still holding out verdict on the emotions until I hit that pms time frame, but the energy is much better and I'm so glad. My naturopath doctor liked the look of these when I brought them to her, and she is super picky. So definitely give these a try. But also look into adrenal fatigue to see if what ails you is beyond just your thyroid!
 I like this product because it has all vegetarian ingredients! This product works great! It was recommended by my doctor for my low thyroid hormone levels.
 This product is a natural hormone supplement. It's really helping with my low thyroid.
 This was actually ordered for my wife and she loves it so far.  She felt a lot of energy and focus and is excited to see what it does for her in future use.
 helping with my night sweats
 I have just received this product so I can't rate its effectiveness just yet. However I do appreciate the free bottle "coupon" that came with it and will provide a more useful review after a few weeks of use.
 I have noticed improvement in my symptoms but need to finish the first bottle.
 I've only been using for a couple weeks.  I'm not sure i notice a difference or if its too soon to tell. My bottle did come with a coupon for a free bottle, so I logged online and got it too.  lol  Pretty cool I thought.  Thanks.
 gives me energy in the afternoon
 after just one week of taking this product, I have more energy and feel better.
 Fast Delivery.  Product contains all the necessary vitamins and minerals I was looking for in a Thyroid Support formula.  Will update on the efficacy after a few months.
 Great product
 I feel that this product is working to help me loose weight. I feel like I have more energy.
 I've been taking this supplement for over 6 months. Always shipped on time. No issues.
 I switched over to this product and it's been helping with energy. I'm going to try it another month and see  if it continues.<br/><br/>I continue to take thyroid support.  I've been taking it almost a year and can t
 I have just started to take this supplement and do feel more energy so far.  However it has only been a week so far.
 for weight loss and increased energy
 About to start this supplement. Product was shipped promptly and was given a free bottle coupon. Looking forward to great results based on other people's reviews.
 I've only been taking for a few days and I've noticed my energy level has increased.  I haven't been sluggish and wanting to fall asleep at work.  I feel more alert.  I take it in the morning and the evening, but the evening one doesn't keep me awake.
 Excellent product! Worked for me within 2 weeks...I'm buying more!
 I just started taking this product, but have already noticed more energy, better "bathroom times" and a few other things. Really like it so far, I'm excited to see if it aides in losing weight too!
 My hair stopped falling out!!! How great is that!!!
 I have more energy and focus. Also, I am able to control my weight with this product. It's wonderful!
 No effect, kind of useless.
 I've only used this product a few weeks but have seen some small improvements with my skin and with concentration.
 Wlee packages and a good price
 Just started taking these supplements a few days ago. I felt a bit more energy not sure yet but will plan on continuing to take them.
 Amazing!
 Works great!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for about 2 weeks at first i was taking it along with my Armour thyroid but notice I was not loosing weight nor feeling better, so after one week I started only taking the Thyroid Support and now I am feeling must better without getting tired and slowly loosing inches as well. My sleep pattern at night has greatly improved also. I will update at the end of 4 weeks with more results.
 I consider this supplement as important as my prescription to treat my thyroid issue.
 I've been using this product for a week now, so far so good! I chose this product because I have concentration and energy problems, and just to be the first week it seems to be helping me stay focus and energetic.
 Thyroid Support is worth trying, it differently gave me more energy.
 Great all around product.
 Been using this for a couple of weeks now and there has been a noticeable change in my energy levels and the way i feel.  I will be using this again
 I generally choose a new product not just for the rating but the amount of people giving the rating.  So far this was the best choice for me.  It was delivered quickly and was well packaged.  So for this product is off to a great start.
 Thumbs up!
 Taking while on Keto, love it.
 Definitely helps feel more balanced and energized...LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!
 I have been taking it for 0ver 2 month and my weight swings have stopped.  I now can start losing the weight.
 Great Price
 I just took the first pill. I'm looking forward to seeing if this helps.
 I've only been taking the Thyroid Support Supplement for a few weeks now, but it's made such a difference in how I function day to day that I'll be returning in the future to purchase more on a regular basis. Within a few days of taking it (twice a day) the stiffness in my joints and the weakness in my hands improved dramatically. I've also been dealing with plantar fasciitis for the past six months, as well as TMD caused by my underactive thyroid and daily headaches. I've only experienced one headache in the past few weeks, I can get around more easily on my foot and while my TMD is still bad, it's not as frequent or painful. While I'm often still tired, the brain fog and irritability has also decreased. The biggest difference of all  is that I can keep up and play with my active 16 month old. If you're a parent of a young child, you know how much it means to be able to do that.
 Clear Thinking, I noticed how much better I can concentrate, and remember.  I'm hoping I will be able to lose some pound and boost my metabolism while I am taking the Thyroid support  supplements.<br/>Thanks , dj
 good but  need excerise
 Works on just a few days! Big difference!
 More energy and general wellness.
 Excelente
 I've been taking this supplement for about 3 weeks now. I've noticed an increase in energy and an overall more stable, relaxed mood. I only gave 4 stars because I haven't been taking it for that long. But so far so good.
 Already feeling a positive difference. Just ordered my 2nd bottle.
 It's very helpful if you feel your on the line with thyroid problems. It has helped with my tiredness and lack of energy, and seems to help curb my appetite. It does make you thirsty, but I can't take that as a bad thing. I drink tons of water
 Ive been taking these for about a month and I definitely can tell a difference in my energy levels.
 just received the product and started this week.  It appears my energy level is gaining and hope it will continue to improve my health in the next 4 weeks.
 This actually had help me lower my thyroid and my symptoms had improved,I'm also able to have energy which I was lacking.
 I love this supplement
 First time taking supplements like this, and not sure what to expect, but this seems to help me feel a little better, with more energy, and also more focus.
 I like this product as it helps my digestive system and it also helps me to sleep.
 I haven't start yet. But, I bought because I read a lot of good review about the product. I will get back in a month to let you everybody about my experience. Main reason to get the vitamin is the good ingredients contained.
 I have struggled for several years to lose weight.  I am being treated for Thyroid problems.  I started taking this product the beginning of September and within weeks noticed weight lost.  I am currently down 15# and take Thyroid Support faithfully everyday.
 A noticeable different in my energy levels and metabolism.  It's a keeper!
 I will purchase again
 Seems to give me energy so far, but I have only been taking it a  couple of weeks. I'm willing to continue to see how it make me feel.
 I've only been taking this product for a week. I love it! I feel  my energy has increased tremendously. Will definitely continue taking it. Down side is taking two pills a day...I'm not a good pill taker... BUT it's worth it.
 I feel it has done me some good and want to continue to take it.  I seem to have more energy.
 Worked good for me.  I feel better. Will buy it again!
 I feel more energetic after taking this product. Will continue tinuse.
 I felt lethargic prior to taking this product.  Someone gave me a suggestion to try a thyroid supplement so I got this one.  I've been taking it for almost a week.  I do feel more energized.  So far I love this product.
 Love the product and the company. Love that there are no animal products in it.
 Love this supplement
 I began taking this product a few months ago for hair loss and low energy levels. I do believe that it has helped both of these issues. I also like the fact that it doesn't contain many of the questionable ingredients other thyroid supplements use.
 Love!!
 So far, so good.
 I have only been taking this supplement for 1 week and my energy seems to be improving.
 i've only been taking it a month so I don't have long term experience however I have noticed a small amount of additional energy that may be attributed to the supplement.
 I feel with more energy, less tired. I sleep better.
 My hands and feet are less cold and it appears that I have increased energy at the end of the day. My sleep patterns are closer to normal. I may re-post after another month.
 I started using about 2 months ago and feel a big change in energy levels. I was also struggling with hair loss and acne due to what I think was a thyroid issue. Since taking Thyroid Support my symptoms have dramatically decreased.
 I have just received the product and have used it for just three days.  I did not<br/>expect much improvement this early, but I do feel I have a little more energy<br/>each day. If this keeps up over the coming days and weeks I will be very satisfied<br/>with the product.
 Just started taking this supplement a couple of days ago and I already feel better! Waking up is easier and I slept through the night! Can't wait to see what else is in store!
 for thyroid support
 So far I feel more energy and less fuzzy. No help for weight loss yet... I have been taking for only 10 days.
 So far great product I have more energy
 I love the product
 This product is awesome!.. I love the fact that it is vegan capsules and has natural herbs ingredients which is a plus.. I feel so much better and my energy level has increased.. I recommend this product definitely!..
 I have been taking the product for about 3 months. I seem to have more energy and have lost 10 pounds. Will order again.
 I love it. I've noticed if I skip a dose I feel lousy. It works :)
 Worked great to help with Hashimoto thyroid symptoms.  Would highly recommend to any one with thyroid issues.
 I just received it in the mail and took my 1st pill.  Too soon for results but I am expecting good results based on the ingredients and reviews from others.
 I’m not tired have more energy. Lost a little bite of weight a bonus with this product
 Great product!
 This product worked right away. I feel great and have been losing 1 pound per day with no dietary changes. I will continue to purchase.
 Great product, sometimes just getting your Thyroid in sync with your body will do wonders for your sleep, energy, skin, nails, brain function, mood, this is it!
 I've been using Thyroid Support for about a month now. I haven't really felt any changes, but I will continue to use it. It may just take more time.
 I have only been taking for just a few weeks. But hopeful and confident this product will help my slowing metabolism due to age. I saw so many great reviews and am hoping I can post even more in time ! Thx ! Great so far !
 I have been using for a week. Once waking and one, two hours after lunch.  I have found it has helped with my sluggishness and crankiness during my day.
 Gave me an energy boost! Good product!
 Feeling much better wish I knew about this year ago.
 Feeling less tired, and test results improving
 Great product.  Felt a difference beginning the second week.  Will definitely continue to take.
 Love this product.  It is the only thyroid support I will take.  Highly recommend.
 I have more energy, my hair looks and feels 100% better and over all I feel a lot better
 This helped a lot with how I feel. More energy and not as sweaty lol
 Just started taking this product,  however I am looking forward to see my energy level to increase along with helping my weight to decrease with my dieting efforts.
 I have only been taking this product for one month but have noticed an increased energy level.  I have had no negative side effects so far.
 My wife feels a bit better taking the supplement, wants to continue using it to see how it goes.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for almost three month, and I can feel a difference in my energy levels as well as better results in my lab exams. It is also helpful in weight control.
 Can't really tell yet if it's helping
 Works great for me!
 I have been using this product for a month and so far I have seen great improvement in my energy level and brain function.... I'm just starting to lose weight again and it feels amazing !
 No explanation for my renewed energy other than I keep taking Thyroid support daily.
 I've been using this product for a little over a month, and I do feel that it has given me more energy.  I was hoping it would have helped more with weight loss, but that hasn't been the case.  But it is very nice having more energy!
 Just received the product and I am hoping it will work well. I was using a different brand, but I wanted something vegetarian so I chose to try this! I can't wait to see the results!
 I've been taking these for a year now. I no longer have the night sweats! It has also help with the growing of my hair! I feel refreshed, I love them!
 I can only take one in the morning, if I take one in the evening, I have trouble falling asleep. Energy stays with me all day. Mood is enhanced. Appetite lowered
 I feel better, more energy, better moods. thanks
 Per naturopaths recommendation, have been on this product for approx. 40 days.  Have more energy.  Labs have not been drawn yet for actual results.  Delivery was fast.  Anticipate will order again with improved lab work.
 Just started taking it. Will see in 30 days what we think.
 Since taking this product I have noticed a huge change in just day to day life. I have more energy and more mental clarity. I would definitely purchase this product again.
 I just recieved my Thryoid Support and have only taken it for a couple of days. I watched The Quest For A Cure and realized that most of us are iodine deficiant. I saw this product and it looked great so I decided to try it. I like that it's made in the USA.
 Takes a few weeks to see amazing results but the will happen!
 gives me all the supplements in 1 pill suggested by my doctor.
 I just received this 1Body product and I'm looking forward to seeing the results. Its so difficult to find an "all-in-one" thyroid support supplement with this many ingredients. The capsules are clear so you can see the powder. So far, a great product.
 I noticed increased energy within my first week of taking Throid Support. My hair stopped falling out by the handful. Love this product!
 Feel better since starting this
 I have only been taking this one time daily for a month now. I am not great at being consistent with taking supplements but I do think it is helping so I have ordered more.
 I seem to have more energy!  The only change has been that I added this product to my routine.
 I absolutely love it!
 Received this product promptly. Ingredient list looks like a great combination. Looking forward to giving it a try!
 I can't wait to start thyroid support. I've been reading about all the different supplements available and this one has the absolute best reviews of them all.
 Hoping it will help my hypothyroid problem.
 I've been battling thyroid imbalance most of my adult life, but the last 12 months it exploded to a point that I could no longer function the basic day to day errands. My heart rate will pump like I was running out of air in the middle of the day all the way till the evening until I felt asleep (that is 'if i could stay asleep' at night without waking up every other hour). Went to sooooo many doctors that couldn't figure out exactly what was wrong with me, until last year I've found a doctor that suggested that it was very likely that I have thyroid imbalance and yet he still couldn't properly fix me. Out of frustration and because my body could no longer deal with all the medications prescribed I've decided to do some of my own research. That is when I've come across 1 Body and decided to give it try, and based on the recommendation I've also ordered Adrenal Support as well as Liver Support. Combining all these 3 supplements and all the others recommended by my doctor, it took 5 weeks to finally start seeing the result. I like that 1 Body took the time to educate patient to understand what needs to be incorporated in your daily lifestyle to bring back a balance on your thyroid. For the first time in 12 months I no longer suffer a weak heart rate and the urge of fainting in the middle of the day, and I can fully sleep thru 9-10 hrs. without staying awake for hours in the middle of the night for no important reason. As recommended, daily exercise and healthy diet is crucial, but without 1 Body one supplements it wouldn't be possible. Now I am excited to see how much I can bring my life back and start catching up on all the behind projects since I've got sick a year ago... Thank you for reading this, and I hope this will help you bring some of your life back!
 Feel more clear after a just a couple of days and seem to have more energy so far...  Just been a week, but so far so good!
 I have been using the product for several months.  It has definitely helped with the hot flashes. I am going to continue using this to see if there are any other benefits.
 This product is amazing i feel so much better.
 It has given me more energy and my sleep patterns are much better.
 I just got the product, but I'm very excited to try it. The reviews are what made me want to try it.  All the symptoms everyone discussed as being resolved or getting better is the most motivating factor for my buying the product. I will be back to say how it worked.
 This product has good reviews so I thought I'd try it out.  I have been on Synthroid for a thyroid condition for years but don't feel it is fully helping.  I've only been taking it a little over a week but so far so good!
 Just Received my order!  Included was a coupon for a free bottle! That's customer support and recognition! I purchased this product because of the reviews on Amazon.com and hope the product live up to so many positive reviews.  If it does, I will be a customer of "1 Body" for life!  I will return with a more in-depth review as I use the product over the next month of my personal results. Thank you to a great company for their recognition of their customers. Oh, almost forgot, shortly after my order was sent out I received an email with an attached PDF article on Hypothyroidism.  ***Stars
 Muy bueno
 still waiting on it to work and giving it a chance
 Just started taking product today.  I was most impressed with the formula.  Being someone who has studied a lot about nutrition and health, I feel very excited about the potential of this product.
 Works
 Have more energy and less headaches. Will definitely keep buying!
 All the ingredients to help support thyroid function..
 Big difference in my mood,  and everyday function.
 Great product! I love the iodine in it because your doctor will prescribe you thyroid meds but won't tell you to supplement with iodine for it to work. Thyroid Support has everything you need to assist in your thyroid working properly.
 Started taking this account I was feeling not myself..Fatigue,insomnia,weight gain, and no motivation. I am pretty depressed to feel this way constantly. After the first week I was feeling alot better more energy to get out and exercise. I also noticed I could put my hands around my neck and over lap my fingers when before they just barely touched. Wow I am impressed and will continue to use this fabulous product...
 Very fast service and great packaging. I've only started taking the product today and I already feel more energetic. I truly believe this product is going to be good for me. The ingredients in the product are very good.
 Great tool to feeling healthier.
 seems to be helping with fatigue and moodiness! thank you
 My husband and I are both hypothyroid.  We have found that this gives us an extra "boost" and we sleep better and awaken feeling more refreshed.
 I have only taken this product for a couple of days, and I already feel better.
 Seems to be helping the symptoms I was experiencing
 Was debating on either this or gaia thyroid support but saw noticed that there were more herbs listed in the ingredients, which I thought was great! Just started yesterday and will update in about a month!
 I have an under active thyroid.  Thyroid Support really helps me have more energy and feel better.  I have tried other supplements and this one is the best.  I have been using it for over six months.  I highly recommend it!
 I wanted to wait to give a review until after I've been taking it for a little while and actually seeing results. I work out 5-6 days a week and was gaining excessive weight uncontrollably. I've been taking this product for 8 days and I've lost 8 pounds. My hair is growing back and is healthier. My body temperature is normal. I have more energy and don't have to keep hitting the snooze button. I'm a lot less irritable. I've tried everything imaginable to fix the issues that I was experiencing with no results, until now. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is going through the same problems.
 Take one day
 I have more energy and sleep better when I take this regularly.
 My energy levels have gone up and I feel much better.
 I've only been taking this for a week, but I can already tell a huge difference in my improved energy levels. Also, less hair loss in the shower in such a short time! I will definitely keep taking this product.
 Please try this product. It has changed my life in only two weeks. Unbelievable results. I can now sleep at night, and over a dozen terrible symptoms are disappeared. Thank you so much for creating this product....
 This really seems to be helping me since I've been using it for a couple months now.  I haven't had to increase my dose of levythyroxine since taking Thyroid Support.
 This product is great
 I ordered for my dad. He has problems with its thyroid and has pretty good reviews. I would update as soon as he starts using it
 This medicine has helped with my sleeping issues and my well being
 I love it my nails and hair grows,I loose a few pounds.And I have more energy.
 Wow! Only been using it a few days, and I don't wake up sluggish in the mornings anymore. I feel more motivated to tackle my day. Before taking this, I was dragging my feet. Now I feel a lot more alert. This stuff works great!
 I used this supplement for a month hoping to replace my prescription medication.  Very disappointed!  Just had bloodwork done and my numbers were higher than they were before I went on the prescription.  It did not work for me.
 works great
 Started taking this a couple months ago before being put on Thyroid medication.  It actually improved my TSH levels!  I still ended up getting thyroid medication but think this is a nice compliment and support.
 I have had this product for less than a week but I already feel more energetic.
 I have hypoparathyroid. After just two capsules, I could feel the difference! This has changed me!
 I just started using Thyroid Support.  My doctor suggested certain levels of Zinc, Copper, and Manganese to support my failing thyroid.  This was the only product that I found that had the levels he suggested.  Thank you.
 Have only taken for a few weeks. Still waiting to see how it might be helping me
 I used this for a month and felt better. I felt like I had more energy and was not as tired.
 Love this product!!
 Seems to Work
 I'm almost finished with the first bottle and just placed a second order for it.
 Made quite a difference in my ability to function
 I felt a difference almost immediately.  I was transitioning off my synthetic and was on a fairly high dose (125mcg). Does anyone know the approximate dosage equivalent of one of these capsules so I can get back on track?
 I've only just started taking this a month ago and so far so good. I am hoping for the positive affects so many others have spoke of!
 I just received the product. Have only taken one evening and one morning dose. Have noticed a slight difference today, I seem to be able to focus better and not be sleepy.
 Amazing feeling more clear and less groggy
 Great product.  It gives me a lot of energy.  I don't recommend taking it at night because it keeps me up.  I take it first thing in the morning and then at noon
 I feel more energy during the day. I have been using Thyroid Support for a month now and I will continue to use it. I feel not as sluggish like I did before this product. Thanks!!
 Thyroid support seems to have provided me with more energy, digestion has improved tremendously and overall I feel much better.
 I have only been taking the product for about 1 week, but I already notice a huge difference.  I have more energy than I've had in years, and plan on continuing to take the product.
 I have more energy and not so grumpy all the time.
 When using this product I experienced a significant decease in brain fog; I have been suffering from this for several years. Such a relief, at the age of 60 to be able to think clearly,  again.
 I really like this product and feel better after taking thyroid support
 This product has really helped me with my thyroid related fatigue. Before I started taking 1 body thyroid support I was tired from the time I got up to the time I went to bed. Now I have so much more energy and really feel great.
 Shortly after I began taking your Product, I lost practically all urge to do the things I normally do. Since I stopped taking it a few days ago, my desire hasn’t returned. I don’t intend to take anymore until I get my desire and energy back, just to see if the same thing happens.<br/><br/>I did get the Free Bottle that was offered.
 Seems to be working so far.
 Already noticed a big improvement energy wise in the short time I've been utilizing this product, will continue to use it.
 It’s helped my energy
 I don't know yet, need more time to figure it out.  It has been 2weeks.
 Best ingredients for thyroid health.
 I feel it is helping with anxiety. I have only taken this for a few weeks but I feel less tired and less anxious
 I haven't been taking this very long but I do feel like I have more energy.  I'm going to order another bottle and take it awhile longer and then I will update my review.
 I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE SINCE TAKING THIS PRODUCT WITH MY INCREASE IN ENERGY.
 So far I am feeling good energy taking this product
 Quick Delivery. I will start this evening and hope it helps my symptoms. Super Excited!!
 I like this so far, but cannot tell if it has improved my thyroid or now to be honest. I will update after a little more of taking it.
 I have only been taking this for a few weeks but I can already feel a difference in my energy levels. I have tried other supplements and not felt any difference. I will definitely keep taking this.
 I like it
 This supplement has been helpful for my immunological disorder, assisting in the reduction of overall inflammation. I would recommend to anyone.
 I feel the beginnings of an improvement after about 2 weeks. Just ordered more.
 I just received this amazing product 3 days ago and I can't get over how it works!! I got the product at 8pm and immediately took it and in the morning I woke up energized at 6 o'clock in the morning! This never happens to me! I was always tired, grumpy, and oversleeping, but this!!! THIS PRODUCT KEPT ME AWAKE! That's the only thing about this product is that it seriously keeps me up at night, but I always feel energetic once I'm up. I'm going to keep taking this and we will see!! I'm positive it will work great!<br/><br/>My husband tried this product as well and said it's working so far!! (Will keep an update on 4/2/16) once I am done with the product and will definitely order more if it keeps this up! :)
 highly recommend
 I am excited to try this product.  The ingredients are exactly what I need to boost my thyroid.
 Since i started using the Thyroid Supplement, i feel like i have more energy. It also help me stabilized my mood swings. Its definitely worth my money! I will surely purchase it again! Highly recommended!
 Great product works great
 Great product for a terrific price!
 I have just started this product. Will post at a later date.
 Help me regain my lost energy.
 Overall made me feel better, more energy.
 Before I started taking this I felt awful, had zero energy and was sleeping almost 16 hours a day on the weekends. Since I started taking it my energy level has increased exponentially.
 I just started the product, but so far, I really like the company's followup and responsiveness.  I hope I am as happy with the product as the others who have purchased this seem to be.
 prescribed by my MD... to improve my blood test stats for thyroid... will be monitoring every 90 days... I should be able to give more informative response in future...
 I just received the product in the mail today. I am very excited about taking it.I started a few days ago. I have noticed more energy. I don't feel the need to lay in the bed all day.
 Quick shipping, no issues
 Thyroid support lifts my mood and gives me energy.
 I really loved this product and when I ran out I could totally tell. It came fast and is a reasonable price, I will always be ordering this
 I've been taking this for almost two months now and have noticed increased energy and improved concentration. I would recommend this to friends.
 I wasn't sure about the product when I purchase it, but have noticed I have more energy taking and i will purchase it again.
 Based on the reviews and my initial opinion, this appears to be a great product. The ingredients and reviews convinced me to try it and I've been happy with the results so far.
 I have only been taking this product for a week or so and I already feel like I am healing and more energized.
 I have more energy, and can think clearer when I take it regularly.
 I still can not give an opinion I'm just taking them
 I started taking the product immediately upon it is arrived. Surprisingly, next day I felt  more energized and active. Thank you.
 i have just began taking it , it does seem to give me a bit of energy.  I will update my review after a month.
 Thank you it's helping will buy more if it continues to help thank you
 Started taking this because I recently found out I have large nodules on my thyroid.  Not sure if this will help with that, but I have noticed an increase in my overall energy since taking this product.
 Received the product quickly and to my pleasant surprise, it included a free bonus bottle of the same thing as a thank you. I look forward to trying the supplement. Thank you 1 Body!
 Have more energy and stay active all day.

 I have great energy and am mentally alert all day. Love it!
 I'm starting go get my energy back and the brain fog is much better.  I've been taking for 2 weeks so can't wait to see how I feel at 1 month.
 Just received product a few days ago, so too soon to know how it is working for me.
 Just started product, but I'm excited nonetheless. All positive reviews have encouraged me. So am hoping product delivers as promises and I'm sure it will.
 GREAT product.  I switched from different product and can already see the difference with this brand.
 Only have been taking it for a week but have noticed that I am less achy and not as fatigued as before. Will keep taking it and hopefully more positive effects to come!
 Helping with energy and loosing less hair.
 I feel better when I take a natural thyroid supplement . It's peace of mind because it provides much needed minerals, herbs, and vitamins that nourish the thyroid, and contains iodine that is no longer accessable in our food like it once was. Fortunately I found a supplement, Thyroid Rite, that does the same thing, with the same ingredients, with more pills, and for less money. Sorry.
 Good product, helps with fatigue
 At first I wasn't sure if this supplement was working. .. until I forgot to take it one day.  I felt a noticeable decrease in energy. I've also noticed my hair doesn't fall out nearly as much when I'm taking this regularly.  If you're having doubts spend the money.  Your health is worth it.
 This supplement has been good so far. After taking it for one month I am yet to see any significant results.
 I have barely started taking it (only a day), but I do feel a bit more energetic than I did before. I am currently not on my normal levothyroxin medication. I hope over some time it will start taking effect a lot more.
 Haven't noticed much of anything at this point.  Hoping to see something in the next few weeks!
 Helps my sluggish thyroid...have more energy...less hair falling out!
 Received the product right away! Just started taking it about 10 days or so.  Havent noticed any effects yet but will finish the whole product and update you! so far so good
 I am still trying out this product, seems like it is helping.  Will surely continue.
 I noticed a huge difference in energy within just 3 days. I was on levothyroxine for 2 years. I completely stopped the prescription and replaced with this product. It is amazing! I take once in the morning and once at night. I once forgot to take it for a couple of days while traveling and couldn't figure out why I was so tired all the time, then realized I had been forgetting to take the Thyroid Support. I love this product! I still have an Iodine deficiency even with taking this supplement, however i wouldn't stop taking it as it definitely helps me.
 I haven't taken it long enough to know  how well it works.  I do like that I only have to take it once in the morning and once at night instead of a bunch of pills all throughout the day.
 Gave me more energy.
 The booklet came almost immediately in an email. The product arrived in the mail today and will start taking it tonight.
 Just received it and will update once I have used this product longer.  This would be to help increase my energy levels since I have hypothyroidism.  My doctor has also cleared it for me to take this, as long as the synthroid is in the morning and this is in the evening.
 I have a family history of hypothyroidism. I have had speculations that I may have an underactive thyroid. I have been on a plateau for weight loss, as well as fatigued even with a full nights sleep. After taking this product for the past month, I feel that my energy levels have increased, clarity of the mind has also improved, and I am better able to get through my day with enough oomph. I love this product so far and will continue to assess its benefits!
 Have only been taking this product for 3 weeks. I feel so much better and am sleeping through the night. I am hopeful with continual usage I will see an improvement in my weight, that is why 4/5 stars instead of 5/5
 Started to feel ebergy right away! Have only been taking this product for about a week. Can't wait to see how many more improvements I notice over the course of taking this!
 Good product, seems to be working
 Your prompt service was awesome. The product is living up to its name. I have more energy and feel better overall! Thanks for your professional care."
 This product really seems to have some effect on how I feel.  My fatigue has lifted and other symptoms seem to be subsiding.  Thank you for making this available.
 Recieved in a timely manner. Have been taking for two weeks l. Feeling more energetic. Will continue taking suplimates.
 Just started one month ago  and I already can feel a difference. Especially at 3 in the afternoon. Do not need a nap, hoping for more improvement. Ordered another bottle.
 It works
 I received this product and I’m unsure of it. Didn’t really notice any changes. I tried it for a couple months. What I did notice was that the pills were different. My first month they were green and my second month they were light powder color.
 I cannot contribute much to this review as I have only taken this product for four days.  I very much liked the components of the product.
 Love It!
 I like it!<br/>My body feels lighter and better and I can sleep comfortably whole through  the night
 Just started using the product.
 Only took a few times before forgetting to take it. I hope to get back on the product.
 I was just diagnosed with having a hypothyroid 6 months ago. After researching the many supplements out there, I'm very eager to try this supplement.
 This product has really helped me to be more active and focused in my daily tasks!
 I have been taking this over over three months and my thyroid has stabilized and I have been able to lose weight. No side effects!
 I just received this product so I can't say if it works for me yet, however I know several friends taking it and LOVE IT, so I will post again after I have given it time to work.
 Starting to feel better and gaining strength and sleeping better.
 I have a bit more energy recently. But I won't know my true numbers yet until the next medical exam.
 Love this supplement! I have hypothyroidism so I need a supplement that will help to give me the nutrients that I may be lacking. People with hypothyroidism have trouble absorbing certain vitamins and minerals like B-12, so these with extra B12 are awesome. They also contain iodine, bladderwrack, and kelp. All of these have long been used to stimulate the thyroid. An added bonus is that bladderwrack and kelp are also good for detoxifying the liver as well. I have been taking these supplements for several months now and I will continue to take them!
 Having experiencing the symptoms of hypothyroidism for years, I had my doctor do an TSH test.  After receiving TSH results of .5 on a scale of .3 - 3.0, I was not prescribed prescription medication, but felt with such a low result, a natural remedy would be helpful.  I received the product today and will take my first does tonight.  It was delivered as expected and to my surprise, they offered a free bottle with purchase.  I was not expecting this and am well please since sometimes it takes more than a months supply to see results.  I am optimistic that this will provide feedback in later weeks if possible.
 As of right now I love this product and will continue to use.
 Body temp regulation is better
 really have enjoyed it.
 Been taking it a few weeks. So far so good.  I don't have bad symptoms like other reviewers.  So I don't notice a huge difference.
 I have been taking it for 2 weeks, I have not noticed any changes yet, but will update later on if any effects are noticed
 My mood changes are so much better
 My sister told me about this product. She has used it for quite a while and feels great! I Think it will do the same for me!
 Feeling good like it
 I like this product and will continue to use it. The price is affordable for me and the product has helped me, I only wish it was a little stronger. I've used other products that worked extremely well, however they were too expensive.
 It’s great
 I just started taking the product.  I read the reviews and thought this sounded amazing.  The constant battle with your Dr. over your thyroid numbers is tiresome.  I just want to feel like myself again.
 This product has helped with mood swings and feelings of isolation.  I have only been taking the Thyroid Support for a month but I can tell a subtle improvement.
 Too early to notice a major difference. I've only been taking for a week. I am hoping it helps reduce my thinning hair. I have been sleeping better though.
 The company has good customer service. After I purchased the product they reached out with an email to see if I liked it. I wish their product was as good as their customer service. This supplement may work for some but unfortunately did NOT work for me in the least and ended up giving me stomach cramps every time I took it.
 Great product... very comprehensive. Ive only taken one bottle and the my free one is on its way... very generous of the company as well. Thanks for making this great product. All the best to you and the company.
 Lost 20 pounds since I started taking this in June!
 i feel more energy so far - but still feeling it out! I have only been taking it for four days. a friend recommended it that is very knowledgable in holistic health
 I have just taken for one month and I see a difference already in my increased energy level and my hair seems to be thickening.
 I ordered this because it had several ingredients in it I was looking for to supplement a vegan diet plus the other stuff to help with thyroid.  I've been taking it about 3 weeks now and I seem to have more energy.
 still taking it, 4months now and energy is good and mood is more stable, will never stop taking
 I only started taking this product for 1 1/2 weeks and I can already tell a difference in my energy level and I have even started sleeping better..will order this again.
 Seems good so far ( 1 week), not much to say since I just started. (will update once I get to know the product more). I do seem to have more energy as well!
 I've really neglected my Selenium as I age.  No wonder my T4 is borderline despite the Armour Thyroid.  I expect this herbal blend will really do the trick.  My scalp, energy level, sleep have already improved after 3 weeks.
 I just started taking this supplement but I can already tell it's given me more energy.
 So far I like this. It helps with my energy.
 I feel more energetic.
 I have been using this product for a a few days now. So far I do feel more energy, I need to give it more time I think to see the other benefits but am looking forward to feeling better!
 I've been using this product for a couple of weeks and i feel a lot better!!! This product has improved my mood &amp; increased my energy!!
 I feel like this is helping me wake up in the morning. I feel more alert and remember things I have not been able to remember most of my life.
 I can actually feel the benefits from this supplement.
 I just started using this product so I really don't have a full review just yet.  More to follow after I use this for a month or two.  The reviews on it look good so fingers crossed.
 A solid combination of essential vitamins, minerals, and adaptogenic herbs that support not only thyroid function, but WHOLE BODY function. I'm very satisfied with the quality of ingredients too!
 To date this is the best thyroid supplement I have ever tried. My energy level has increased immensely.
 Only taken for a few days so little physically to report. Has all the ingredients I'm looking for.<br/>Packaging great and secure.
 I've lost 5 pounds and feel great all throughout the day.
 gentle energy support
 I had been stuck at my weight and now I'm beginning to loose weight after my first month.
 It had the same make up as another product that I've taken which is no longer available, therefore it should work exactly the same as the other one which made me feel energetic.
 This supplement worked like a charm! I Was purchasing this for my fiancé and wanted to give it a try...we saw a major difference in a positive way in a matter of days! Will definitely be ordering more!
 Just took for 2 days now. Shipped very quickly. No nausea. No problems.  Excited to see how I feel in a week.
 Am excited about finally being able to have a product that address the underlying cause of thyroiditis and being able to homeopathically correct it instead of just taking a synthetic hormone that does nothing for me.
 👍great
 Great product. I chose it because I had most of my thyroid removed and am looking for a supplement to support my remaining thyroid function.
 This product is fantastic
 I have switched to this thyroid supplement from my compounded prescription. I actually feel better. My body is getting the nutrition it needs to balance my endocrine system.
 Less tired but haven't seen any change in weight. Have only been taking it consistently for about a month. Giving it some more time. My thyroid tests show I'm in the bottom of the 'normal' range.
 Had more energy after using
 After taking Thyroid Support for 1 month I have more energy and I have lost 5 pds.<br/>I just ordered my second bottle.
 I haven't been taking this product long but can already tell the difference it is making in my energy. I can't wait to see how I feel after a month!
 Has the same ingredients as the more expensive brands!
 I have been using this product for a week and have already seen a difference.  I'm excited to see what happens the longer I take it.
 Not sure if it is working, but giving it a try
 Hypothyroidism runs in my family, and I am positive mine is functioning at a less than optimal level. After a year of trying to explain to my doctor that having just about every symptom of a hypoactive thyroid, and tests show me in the extremely LOW yet normal range, probably means I have a hypoactive thyroid.. and being shot down each time, and prescribed meds  THAT DID NOT WORK] that could kill you if taken incorrectly, I decided to take matters into my own hands.<br/><br/>Through the headaches, lack of energy, regular stomach issues, etc.,the most annoying of my symptoms would have to be the weight gain. No matter how well I eat or how long/intense I exercise, I simply can't reach a "healthy" weight. I grew up in multiple sports and have always been active, but have never been the lean size 4 expected of my generation. At 5'9, I knew that was a pretty unrealistic expectation, but constantly gaining regardless of activity has been beyond frustrating.<br/><br/>After extensive research and thoroughly combing through thousands of reviews, I finally decided to test my luck and went with the company/product with the largest amount of positive reviews.<br/>I've only been taking the supplement for a couple days, but I felt an improvement by the 2nd day!<br/>I am the type of morning person that needs a million different alarms to drag myself out of bed, but I haven't had to do that! I am up and alert by the first alarm! You may think this isn't something that requires celebrating, but trust me when I say this it a HUGE accomplishment. I also have been having less cravings, and honestly feel happier as a whole.<br/><br/>I know it's too soon to tell if this supplement will help my thyroid function at its best, I am optimistic. This is why I'm giving a 3 star review. Too soon to tell if it will last, but I am positive it's not a placebo effect. Only getting 5 hours of sleep and waking up alert and ready to start the day simply does not happen for me, especially not before coffee.<br/><br/>I'll update in a month or so  :
 Good product
 I liked it
 I have been on this product for a few weeks and feel better than I have felt in years!!
 WAS TIRED DOWN AND OUT, NOW I HAVE GET UP AND GO.
 Have not started taking this yet but after reading reviews I decided to give it a try in hopes that it will help with all of my aches and pains and tiredness
 So far,it seen to be working.
 Works wonders
 I have only been taking this for a week and a half and have noticed a huge difference in my energy and mood. I would recommend this and will continue to keep using it.
 I have more energy than I have had in years!
 Has really helped with energy, moodiness, and other symptoms that did not stabilize once my thyroid levels were under control.
 My digestive system improved almost immediately
 Have felt much better, sleeping better, more energy, etc.
 I have more energy throughout the day and my hair is not shedding nearly as much.
 I was looking for something with no side effect and this product has the right vitamins,<br/>it has been only one week  I will let you know in one month.
 Great energy and metabolism booster!
 So far, I feel great using this product! I would be really happy if I could stop prescription thyroid medication for a natural supplement.
 I have hypothyroidism and I have been taking this tablet for over a month. I have experienced less fatigue when taking this medication. Recommend to al
 NOT USEFUL at all for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Use Ashwagandha rather
 just started to take this 3 days ago. i just never felt like my dr-prescribed synthroid was doing it's job. i have high hopes for this after reading all of the favorable reviews.
 Just received this today and am excited to get started on it.  I bought it because of the high reviews and because I have had thyroid problems for over 10 years and need a little help feeling good and losing weight.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for a month or so along with my prescribed compounded formula. I seem to have more energy for my day &amp; don't always need a nap in the afternoon.
 I've kept a stable weight all month.  This is very difficult for me.  Love the product
 Just started using this product but have already noticed an increase in my energy level. I'm anxious to see the long term benefits of this product.
 Makes me feel better!
 Quality product and quality company
 These didn't work for.me. I never noticed a difference
 Definitely noticeable benefits. Wasn't on them for a while and immediately decided I needed to make this a priority
 I've only been taking this for about ten days so don't know how my thyroid is doing yet, but I do feel less brain-foggy and sluggish, and find a bit more pep in my step.
 Works very well so far.
 I'm 65 years old. Before beginning to take this product I was feeling completely drained. I've only been taking for about a week now, but my energy level is such that I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed.
 I didn't notice any difference until I stopped taking and I wasn't sleeping well.  I bought another bottle and now started sleeping well again!
 I love this product. I finally started to feel more energy and loosing weight. Once I stopped taking it, my Symptoms Returned. I am reordering!!!
 
 Been taking Thyroid Support for three weeks. Results have been noticeable starting week two. Been feeling more energetic and focused at tasks.
 noticed a difference in 1 week. I would love to try this again
 it works reall well, i take one at the evening and it hels me a lot with my energy levels in the morning, its a really helpful compliment to my eutirox pill
 makes me feel so much better, when I ran out I really noticed the difference. Glad I found it.
 Excellent so far. I look forward to seeing what it continues to do as I take it for longer. Already my energy is better, I feel more 'clear-headed', and I am definitely sleeping better.
 Haven't started taking it yet but I have heard great things from family about this product. Looking forward to seeing how it works!
 Lots more energy
 Noticed improved energy.
 If you are looking for a supplement that helps with energy and focus then this is the one.  I work 12 hour shifts and have 3 children, 1 of them being a 1 year old.<br/>The thyroid supplement has increased energy, and focus.  I can rest when I sleep, and I am more alert when I am awake.<br/>And 1 added side effect is I have lost almost 20 pounds taking it greatly appreciate that.<br/><br/>Try it after the first month you may not reorder right away until you stop and you become slugish and tired, then you will reorder.
 Great products. Gets the body back in sync. More energy and upbeat mood. Sun shines brighter thru these products.
 Feeling better after just one month...
 I've been taking the product for about 3 weeks now and I can notice a change in my energy level. Plus , I've been more tolerant of the cold temperatures. Im very pleased.
 Very happy with the results. l have more energy.Have lost a little weight.I have started walking and also watching what I'm eating.I will keep taking this product.
 I chose this product as a natural supplement to help with thyroid issues - just got it today so I will have to come back later to discuss how it goes.
 I have only been taking the Thyroid Support Supplement for a couple of days, but I have already noticed a huge improvement in my energy levels and overall mental outlook.
 It gave me energy.
 I think this is a great product and am using it in the hopes of getting off my thyroid medication.  No report on this yet as I'm not due for a thyroid panel for a few weeks more.
 Awesome! Helped my thyroid tremendously
 I have been looking for a supplement specifically for the Thyroid so I thought I would give this product a try. I have only been using for a couple of weeks, but so far I feel great.
 My fiance has been taking this and he has been feeling much better. It gives him more energy, has reduced his headaches, and his mood has improved significantly! Would highly recommend!
 Works great so far. Lost weight not as hungry
 good stuff
 Slowly starting to notice a difference - hoping I keep getting my energy levels up!
 I really like this product, I just ordered my second bottle.
 I'm on my second bottle and I have had so much more energy since starting this! Highly recommend!
 Been taking for a month and notice more energy. I feel over all better than I did I started taking it.
 Better sllep so far
 Works great!
 I was having extremes hot flashes and night sweats.  After about 10 days of taking 2 pills per day my body seems to be back to normal.  I am so grateful to have found theses!
 I haven't started taking the product just yet but am excited to do so.  I have had hypothyroidism for some time now and am looking for anything that can give me more energy.  Wish me luck!
 Very good. Fast shipping and excellent supplement. Very recommended
 With diet and exercise I feel this product helps one maintain a healthy weight while providing an additional energy source.
 I just received this and started taking it yesterday, so I can't really talk about results. I decided to get it based on the other, very positive reviews. My thyroid levels are just outside the normal range and I'm having a lot of hypothyroid symptoms (but no hair loss). My doctor gave me a prescription for a very low dose Synthroid and said I could try it if I wanted to. I took it for a few days while I researched it, and have decided that I really would rather go a natural route if I can, and who knows - maybe my symptoms are more indicative of being middle-aged and fat than actual thyroid issues. :/ So we'll see. I'm also taking Gaia's Adrenal Health, so hopefully in a few weeks I'll start to see some real improvement.
 Great prodct
 I am impressed. I definitely have more energy, a month ago my lack of energy was really having a negative impact on my life. I feel much better.
 good product!
 I haven't used this long enough to give a strong positive or negative review but I get a free bottle for submitting a review.  I'll visit again when I have something meaningful to say about the product.
 My wife has tried it for two weeks now.  She has more energy and feels the product is helping her.
 Good stuff. I have more energy and it does not upset my stomach as the other brand I tried did.
 This product gave me hope, it's amazing, work very fadt
 Excelente
 Great results! It's Fantastic!
 I have been taking this product for several weeks and see an overall increase in energy. I believe it is helping me lose weight as well!
 Just started taking this. It seems to give me more energy on days that I take it compared to days I don't take it. Fast shipping. So far I am pleased
 So far i really like it...ran out for about 1.5 weeks just got my new stash felt really not energetic so im going to see if i improve after a week back on.
 I'm giving it five stars
 I have been diagnosed with underactive thyroid but didn't want to take the prescription meds.  After reading the reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  I've only been taking it a week but I seem to have more energy.  The strange thing was that I kept getting a persistent rash on my neck that was itching like crazy.  I had tried every cream imaginable.  The itching stopped on the second day of taking this supplement and has not returned.  Maybe just a coincidence, but I don't want to stop taking it to find out.  I have Amazon Prime and received my supplement two days after ordering.  Great service!
 Good stuff
 Have been taking for about a month. I have had a lot more energy the moment I started taking it . A great product
 Results were noticed in less than 30 days. This product is amazing! My whole body feels completely balanced and in check more often!
 I`ve been suffering for months and my doctor said there is nothing I can do. Well he was wrong! I feel so much better.
 Just received the product. The capsules are large which are not always the easiest to swallow, but I am excited to give them a try to revive my thyroids.
 Incredible product!  Just started third bottle and am really seeing more changes kick in!  Hair growth and weight loss have started now as well!  This really works!
 Just ordered my 2nd bottle. Thanks for the free product
 This is a great product especially for the price!
 Works.
 Feeling more energetic since taking the product. No side effects.
 I was prompted to post this review when I went online to request the free second bottle of Thyroid Support, after receiving my order yesterday afternoon.  Had I known this would be a required part of the free product process, I would not have made the request this early since I have thus far taken only one capsule this morning; personally, I find reviews from customers who do not have sufficient experience with the product more annoying than helpful.<br/>I was looking for a product to help my body's thyroid function because, even though my lab testing falls into a range that would not necessarily warrant a prescription (low-functioning but still in the "normal" range), I nonetheless have had hypothyroid symptoms for years.  Most troubling to me has been depression, and since my doctor was unwilling to prescribe a thyroid medication, I decided to at least try an herbal approach for a couple of months to see if it helps.  I'll post again if I have noteworthy results over the next few weeks.
 I sleep better at night and feel better overall.  I would recommend this product to family and friends with thyroid issues.
 Helping with energy levels.  I notice when I don't take it.
 Awesome product that actually works well :) thank you very much!
 So far so good!  Happy with my purchase!
 As far as I can tell it appears to be working. I was having trouble losing weight and while I have been taking the Thyroid Support Supplement the weight seems to be coming off better. So...so far, so good.
 So far it's working great. I didn't experience any of the side effects some reviewers discussed but I also started at a half dose.
 I've been taking the product for 5 days so far and haven't experienced any significant changes so far. Since it may be too early to tell any difference, I'll check back in the future if things change.
 noticed a difference in my energy levels after the first week!
 I have only been using a couple of weeks. So far it seems to be helping but I am also taking a thyroid pill so not sure if its the supplement or medication or both that is helping.
 Important backstory: I had an appointment with an endocrinologist in the Atlanta area last month. He said (I kind of was expecting it halfway) that my thyroid gland seemed "normal" however I always felt like I fit the symptoms and signs...So seeing that this product looked like an excellent deal and rated well I thought I would give it a go.<br/>The trouble is, I am learning that the symptoms of pre-diabetes (which was ruled out at the doctor visit, not hypothyroidism) seem to overlap a little. (the fatigue, thirst, and weakness symptoms) I was prescribed Glucophage and started taking it as prescribed. So I honestly cannot tell although it has been about three weeks since I started taking Best Thyroid Support. I wish I could give a better answer but right now it's hard to tell. Moods are fine...and that is good...I do know that B12 is recommended by doctors who are also treating diabetes patients, and this supplement contains B12, and the other ingredients, many of them I recognized...a few of them are good for mood support.<br/>The representative who contacted me (Ryan was his first name, I think) seemed to have a good professional attitude, so kudos in that department, and the bonus e-book I enjoyed.<br/>I hope this review doesn't come off as discouraging as I am coming to the conclusion that I should do my homework better on "diabetes symptoms" vs "underactive thyroid symptoms"!
 My thyroid was destroyed by radiation for cancer and I am on thyroid meds. My energy level was destroyed with it.  I had always been a high energy go getter, up every morning at 5:30 ready to get started and very seldom stopped until bedtime.  It was hard to deal with having to push my body just to make it through work every day, and  then crashing by 6 pm.  My doctor recently suggested adding selenium to my thyroid meds to up my immune system and energy level.  I found this and thought I would give it a try.  I have only been taking it a short time, but I can already tell such a big difference!  I am excited for the first time in a year!  Thank you so much!!!!
 great product
 Great product. Bought it again.
 I've only been taking for 3 weeks. Have noticed a change in appetite. Also my energy levels. Hope see what else this product does for me
 This product works very well and supports my thyroid health! I can definitely tell a difference in my energy levels when I'm not taking it.
 I feel thyroid support is a great addition to my thyroid medication I am currently on.
 I just started taking it but I feel better already.
 I feel I have more energy.
 Best thyroid supplement I've ever used!
 Made my stomach upset.  Did not like them at all
 I love this product  I have been taken it for the past. 2 weeks and I notice the difference. Already if u have thyroid. You need to try this
 It really seems to give me more energy...helps with that afternoon slump.
 So far so good!  More energy and feeling good!  Bought in combination with the adrenal supplement and like it too!
 Great stuff! Just ordered an additional bottle. A must try for anyone struggling with Thyroid issues.
 I have only just received this product and have taken it for 1 day. I can already feel the effects of more energy. I have a good feeling about this product.
 Helps!
 Love it
 Seems to be working fine. Need to continue using to be sure.
 On my third day &amp; I have a lot more energy.
 My doctor suggested I take some thyroid so I got this from Amazon.  It's wonderful, my feet have stopped being so cold at night and I have more energy.  I'm 82 yrs old and don't like to take prescription meds unless absolutely necessary.  When I can use a supplement instead I do it and don't have awful side effects.  Thanks for a good product!
 I just starting taking this week and I do feel like I have more energy.
 I have been on this for around 6 weeks. It has made a  huge difference in my thinking and energy level. I am ready to order again. I would defiantly recommend to others.
 it is good support. It help me a lot, keep my organ work well!
 amazing product! It's only been a month but I can feel the physiological changes happening within. Highly recommend!
 Sofar I have seen an increase in my energy, I'm  not exhausted  after work, and the "brain fog" isnt as bad. No weight loss sofar but its only been a week since i got this product.
 I've just started using this so I can't explain any long term results, but so far it has made me feel very good and energetic throughout the day!
 arrived immediately, happy with product
 Seems to be helping. I am feeling somewhat better.
 This product is all natural. It took a week or so to feel results. I have better mental  clarity, more energy and feel better overall.
 I've only been taking this a week but I definitely notice an increase in energy without the jitters.
 Well, my thinning  hair situation has been improving which I believe is the result of me using the 1 Body Thyroid Support supplement. A lot of people say it has been helping them sleep better and feel more energetic. For me, I'm still struggling to fall asleep at nights and my energy is still on the low. But I have been taking it for only a couple weeks, so I will continue to take them and see what else happens.
 Great product
 excited to try.
 I have found that it does help me have more energy. Quite a bit actually.  I have been using the product for 1 month now.  I am loving it.
 Been only taking this product for a week now and can already feel a difference in my energy level..along with this product I also purchased the Adrenal support
 I have been taking for about a month and have more energy. It also assist with weight loss.
 I've only been taking it a week - but I stopped taking all the individual vitamins/supplements... this is much easier!
 My massage therapist recommended this and I do feel it has helped my thyroid function.
 This product is amazing! I will definitely be adding it to my daily vitamin routine!
 I have always had low normal thyroid tests.  Added to that, I don't use a lot of salt out of preference, so was probably not getting enough iodine. Since I started using this product, my energy level seems to have increased.  I do get enough magnesium and zinc, which is why I think it's the iodine that's helping.  I'm also sleeping better.  It's too soon to say if my brittle nails will improve, but I don't get cold like I did.  I've taken my time reviewing this product, because I wanted to make sure I wasn't experiencing a placebo result.  But given that it's been the holidays, our furnace broke, water pipes broke, house guests arrived, windshield was shattered by a stone, bought a new car (not related to windshield), and hubby had a guy problem, I don't think a placebo would have been up to getting me through all this.  I plan to continue taking it to see what else, if anything, changes/improves.  Update 10-13-15 I've continued to be very happy with this product and grateful for the increased energy and better sleep it's making possible<br/><br/>8 months later - I'm still taking this supplement and plan to continue.  I'm pleased with the effects: my nails have improved somewhat, energy levels are up, and I'm sleeping more deeply.
 The product has helped, I would usually feel tired after exercising and take a nap around noon for an hour, this product has helped in keeping my eyes open!
 I have been looking for a good thyroid supplement for a very long time and I believe I have finally found a supplement that works for me. Unfortunately my lab work always comes back borderline and my doctors won't put me on a hormone replacement regimen and for the last few years I feel worse and worse. The thing that has scared me the most is that as a Californian I commute to work (as many of us do) and waking up in the morning with zero energy and literally falling asleep while driving to work from time to time got so scary that I had to find something. I have gone to wellness centers and purchased sublingual drops that tasted terrible and did nothing so I started to search the internet and found 1 Boby on Amazon. I figured I had nothing to lose, but $25 and if it worked it would be so worth it and if not at least $25 doesn't break the bank. I am so glad I tried it (purchased mine on 9/17/15) because I'm not scared to drive to work or back home anymore since my energy levels are definitely up. I also find that I am not that hungry and I do believe after reading some of the reviews that it may be because of this. I have recommended it to my sister (who has been on hormone therapy for years) because she still has low energy and she should be ordering her first bottle soon. I would definitely recommend giving this product a try.<br/>Oh, I almost forgot... the first time I tried the product it did upset my stomach a little, but I followed the advice of a few reviewers and started taking it with my breakfast with no problems. :-)
 Just started using the product. It has been about 2 weeks. My energy level has increased (I feel less sluggish).
 Great product!
 iI've been taking this for 2 weeks and so far I rest better at night and have more energy during the day,  Also, I can focus better.
 I haven't used the product yet. I am placing this review to get an extra bottle in case I end up liking it. I will come back and edit it when I have feedback.
 Great Product. I ordered this for my brother who has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and this has made his life better.
 Love this supplement. I notice a huge difference in my energy levels when I take it! Easy in my stomach! Highly recommended
 I just started taking it 2 days ago. it appears to be okay. I will give an update at a later time.
 I have only been taking Thyroid Support for about a week, but I'm already feeling extra energy and focus, and just a general feeling of well being.
 Just received product. I am hoping the reviews are accurate and true if so they have a customer for life.
 love it
 Has increased my energy throughout the day and has made my day more productive overall
 Great reviews for this product so I am giving it a try! Great company to deal with so far. Will update my review in a couple of weeks after I see some results.
 I've only taken it for a couple of weeks but it seems to be helping me, I have more energy and feel better.
 Love this product! More energy and the odd "lump in the throat' ache that nagged me when I was tired is gone!! Good Stuff :)
 Bold thyroid support with T-3 and additional herb support.
 Helps with TSH and energy level.
 I purchased the product Thyroid Support Supplement based on all the positive reviews.  I've been taking it for a week now and my sleep has improved as well as my energy levels.
 I just received my Thyroid Support  !  Ready to give it a try and see how great it is.  Only heard great things.  Will update with more when I know more :)
 Excited to start taking this supplement. It is loaded with so many vitamins I was considering taking individually. This will be so much easier!
 Just received my order and I am hoping for great results.  Ordered because of the great reviews of others. I will update my review after I have been taking them a while.
 I saw that this product received great reviews. I've been taking this for about six days. Too soon to report any definite results. I can report back later.
 Excellent product.
 I love this product....gives me energy but doesn't make me feel jittery.  I feel it helps my thryoid function better.
 The price is right.
 Experiencing an increase in energy and lessening hypothyroid symptoms.
 Noticing more energy. Hoping it will show some change on my next blood test.
 I have been taking an herbal supplement but wanted to try something else to see if I noticed a difference. I tried Thyroid Support for a month to compare and am pleased with the ingredients not found in other supplements, such as B-12 (as methylcobalamin!!), kelp, bladderwrack and cayenne. I am switching to 1Body. It's a better supplement.
 I ordered this product in October and have been taking for about a month now. I chose this product because of the ingredients and the reviews.<br/>The first thing I noticed was the full feeling in my neck started to go away within a day. Within a week, my digestion and fatigue had greatly improved. I signed up for the monthly automatic delivery. Worth every penny!
 I am experiencing some increases in energy after using product for one month. Hope to enjoy more when starting the second month!
 i have been taking thyroid support for over two months and feel good. hopefully i will notice a bigger change as i keep taking it
 Just started it but my roommate is thrilled with her order and she has been taking it about 2 1/2 months.  Looking forward to good results.
 Awesome stuff, I've been steadily losing weight since I started taking it. Will be a lifelong customer.
 Works well and even received a coupon for another free bottle!
 Only taking for two weeks but I can feel a bit more energy and clear-headed. Hopefully this will get better as I finish the bottle
 So far so good! See more energy after the first week, but will update after a month or two on the product as well.
 Fast shipping-great product.  1 Body is highly recommended -- very helpful folks.
 Have only been using this for a few days. So far I have not noticed a difference. I will have to follow up after more time has passed.
 I've just begun this supplement and I'm excited to see if it'll help address some of my hypothyroid symptoms.
 I have been using the product for about 2 weeks. So far so good, I have good energy and I am losing weight!
 So far it has been working well. I have more energy doing the day.
 I haven't started taking it as yet but a friend of mine said that it has worked wonders for her! I will come back and update this review once I start taking it.
 I'm excited about the health benefits I will recieve
 I have felt better with this supplement than I have in years! LOVE this!
 I've only taken for a day but I woke up feeling more energized. I will update my review once I have continued taking these supplements.
 More energy and helps with weight loss!
 I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos Thyroiditis.  My doctor gave me a prescription and suggested that I also start taking selenium.  However, after doing more research on my own, I discovered that there are other supplements that are beneficial to those who have hypothyroid issues.  I already take a few other vitamins and supplements, so I was looking for something that would encompass all of the thyroid beneficial supplements (B-12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, etc.) in one pill.  After the reading the reviews and reviewing the ingredients, Thyroid Support seemed like the best option for me. I just recently ordered it, so I can't provide long-term use feedback at this time.
 Fast shipping &amp; great customer service. I noticed a change in my appetite &amp; energy the first day. I've only been taking this for a week but I know I will be purchasing more!
 I just received my tyroid support and excited on starting to use it.
 I have taken this now for more than a month and I know this is helping me!
 Have only used a month but feel that it is helping me feel more energetic.  I am planning to try for about 90 days before I decide for sure.
 Increased my energy within on month of starting this supplement
 I think I feel better.  Not as exhausted.  Only two weeks into the bottle, so hopeful that it helps
 I definitely feel much better when I take this thyroid support than just the levothyroxine alone. Great customer service and fast delivery.
 Seems to be helpful.
 SO FAR SO GOOD...HAVE BEEN TAKING APPROX. 3 WEEKS AND WILL CONTINUE TAKING THEM UNTIL I GET MY BOOD TESTS DONE ON 3/1/16.
 Couldn't be more happy with this purchase.
 Great product
 So far so good going on my second bottle of this stuff and have noticed significant changes in my energy levels
 Great product! Stabilizes metabolism!!!
 very excited about this product.Prefer natural over synthetic.Feel better already
 Seems to help stabilize my blood sugar and help keep my sugar cravings under control a bit better.
 I think this product makes a huge difference....one time I had to order something else because this was out of stock for almost a week.....hope to never have to do that again!
 Very happy with this product, will buy again.
 I'm not sure how I would know how well this works since it isn't a high impact type of product.  I wanted to give my thyroid some support since it runs on the low side.
 I love this product ,I have better focus and energy.
 I just got the product and I hope that it works for hypothyroid issues. Got the product in 2 days and waiting for a free pack as well.
 I feel it gives me great energy!! Great help.
 Have been using it for quite awhile and it has enabled me to get off a prescription drug.
 this product has really helped me
 I've been taking this supplement less than a month but I do feel more energized.  I will definitely continue to use it.
 Great product! I just started one week ago and I already can fell more energy.. I will definetly buy again
 I started taking this supplement a little over a week ago and can already see an improvement in both energy level and mood....
 I just received the supplements. I am so excited to begin... I am actually about to take my first capsule. I will update again after I have been using it consistently.
 began feeling great after a few days-
 Seems to help a lot, but time will tell!  Definitely no side effects.
 I have become a daily user of this product. Made lot of difference to my health.
 just been taking for a week now. ive just noticed a slight increase in energy but otherwise not much else I think I need more time with it. good so far
 I feel like this product really helps give me a little more energy and less fogginess.
 Trying a new product.  This one has all the ingredients my specialist suggested, plus it's vegetarian.  Looks like it will fit.
 Just received it, but by all the reviews I'm confident I will like it
 Good Product. Helps with energy through the day.
 still working with it will keep you posted
 After years of prescription meds for my hypothyroidism and years of living with harsh symptoms, I had had enough and just came off of them myself. I figured I was already feeling horrible, how much worse could it get? Well, it did, and I realized I have to be taking something to help me. I didn't want to go back on the prescription ones and I did talk to my Dr. about going on a NDT, but he said he wouldn't put me on it. So I started searching and came across this. I read all most of these reviews and ordered it based on that. I received this on March 1 and have taken the 2 a day since. It's only 5 days later and I am amazed so far. I actually have been able to make it through these past 2 days without having to crash sleep for a couple of hours in the middle of the day. I actually have had dreams again each night since I started taking them and feel like I actually got rested sleep. I don't ache when I wake up or throughout the day. I noticed today that the hair loss I always have when showering was noticeably less. I feel much better already and lots of energy! Will continue to take and thinking about ordering the Adrenal Support to go with it.
 Only been taking a few days and seeing an increase in energy.
 Within a couple of days of using the product, my energy level increased and I wasn't mentally tired at the end of the work day.
 my mom uses it as thyroid support supplement. It works good for her, she has more energy after having it. And she is satisfied with this supplement.
 Definately notice a difference since I started taking it, enough that I don't want to be without.
 "Just started this to help with my thyroid issues. Lumps in my neck are<br/>reduced after one week so I think it's doing a good job. Anxious to see if I get<br/>more results!
 My energy level is getting better. Will stay on it for a couple month and hope it will increase even more.
 I am really glad I tried this product. I have more  energy and I'm sleeping better, too.
 So far, so good. I have more energy and just feel better.
 A decent replacement for Thyrocsin which I can no longer get
 I've been taking  this product for 12 days and haven't felt the need to nap every day.  No side effects...sleep hasn't improved much yet but I'm going to give it more time.
 FINALLY found something that makes me feel good again! Great product.. thank  you!
 Even on synthroid I was always tired. Thyroid support has given me so much more energy to get through the day.
 I just ordered this product. I chose it because it had excellent ingredients and my Dr approved it. I received it very quickly and I am looking forward to increased thyroid function.
 So far so good.  Appears to help regulate my body
 I have a low thyroid, not a fan of big pharma.  This does seem to help in combination with proper nutrition.
 No noticeable difference with my hypothyroidism, I went back on medication cause this did not work for it.
 Not sure how effective it is so far. Reviews are good and I'm hoping this will help my sluggish thyroid
 My hair stopped growing, gain weight, don't feel good. My thyroid is very low. I need these vitamins.
 Love Thyroid Support! I was so sluggish and always tired before using this product. Now I seem to be back to my old self again, full of energy.
 Works great so far. Have noticed I have more energy already
 This helps my thyroid and I no longer have to take as much synthetic hormone replacement.  It is natural.
 This product is excellent!!!!
 Just started, but I really like all of the ingredients.  Waiting to see what changes I will notice.
 Really helped me be balance out an stay on tract.
 This product is seriously amazing. I started to feel better within just a few short days. My energy level dramatically increased. GREAT BUY!
 I haven't tried this product yet but my Sister told me about it. We have Hypothyroidism in the family and we are always struggling to just feel good. You honestly don't understand what "good" means until you can't remember the last time you've felt good. Its an awful feeling.<br/>So my Sister has been taking 1-Body Thyroid Support for almost 2 months and absolutely loves and swears by the results. She said withing the 1st month she started to notice a change and said she is feeling amazing and herself again. I got immediately excited and ordered right away. My Sister is not one to try new things and always one to be boldly honest when she doesn't like something, so I am looking forward to feeling good and back to normal again! After I finish my first bottle, I will definitely follow up to see how it has gone for me.<br/>Samantha
 I have not been using the supplement long enough to notice any changes, will continue to take for a period to determine if there is any benefit
 After 2 days on theses supplement my body started falling back in line and weight started going down, if I miss a couple of days I know the difference. Good product
 So I took the entire bottle and decided to write a review even though it’s not required. I’ve been suffering from hypothyroidism and no pills I’ve helped me. Basically I gained about twenty pounds in 2 months I used to be 118 and now I’m 140. I’ve been stressed out about this weight gain for a long time now so I’ve been trying to lose weight. I thought this pill would help me lose weight but I have only lost one pound at the end of taking these pills. It has helped suppress my appetite sometimes but I never lost weight. I believe that one needs to take this for more than a month to see results, so what a second bottle I’m hoping I will see results.
 I've been using this for only a couple wks and cant tell any difference in my 'temperature sensitivity' problem, so far. But I am seeing a steady increase in my 'dry eye' condition starting around that time.  (Note: I started taking something else around then, also, plus I've changed the dosage amount of some supplements I take...so it could easily be something other than Thyroid Support)  Has anyone else noticed an increase in their 'dry eye' condition after taking this product?
 I stated feeing more energetic with first day of taking Thyroid Support Supplement.
 Love it
 Great product!
 have not used it long enough to tell a difference. will review after my 4 week supply.
 It worked for me- I have noticed both weight loss and an increase in energy.
 I have only been using this product for 1 month and have noticed that I do seem to have more energy.
 Excelent product great review
 This is the first time I am using this product. I have used it only for 2 weeks, but I think I am starting to see good results.
 Seems to work well. Wake up feeling more rested.
 Have been taking this product for a month and and find myself more energetic. Seems to work for me!!
 I can really see the improvement and i'll keep using this! I'm still using it and it really helps me out a lot! Thank you!
 Wife's been taking it and is seeing a difference.
 I'm very happy with the product I don't struggle with being as tired anymore!
 I have only been using this for a little while, but I can tell a difference already!!
 I have only been taking it for about a week but I can tell you that my energy is incredible from it. I noticed this right away! SO grateful for that! As far as weight loss, I have switched to eating clean, removed gluten and increased water and I have lost 7 pounds in less than a week, also while taking this supplement.  I am not sure if it is from the supplement, diet changes or a combo of both but I am going to continue to take the supplement since it has most of what I need in it anyway. Just having the energy from it is way worth it! I was skeptical at first because of the free bottle with review BUT I can tell you with 100% certainty that my energy is through the roof and I had to nap EVERY DAY before this supplement.
 Awesome product! Has definitely helped me with my symptoms.
 Haven't taken it long enough to be able to give adequate review.
 Product arrived on time.  Seems to be helping me with my thyroid swelling.  Will keep using it.  Thanks
 Works well for my body.
 I have only started on this for 7 days and I am starting to feel less tired.
 I feel like this has jump started my Thyroid even though it's pretty early.
 I just started to take this for a couple of days. Already felt a difference.
 So far I feel more energized and my sleep is a little deeper - So far so good!
 Only 2 weeks in and I'm feeling more energetic
 Just started using this along with low dose of synthroid...will get labs drawn in one month and will let you know more then
 I have been using this for about a week and have noticed an increase in energy and less stiffness in the morning.
 Love this supplement. It has really increased my energy and helped with brain fog
 Great product, has helped me to improve my lifestyle in so many ways!, helping me to rest deeply and feeling more energized.
 Have only been using for about a month, but I like the way it makes me feel already, and plan to continue.
 Good product
 I just started using this product but I can already feel the difference!
 I've only been taking it for almost two weeks and I feel better.  I have more energy and the weight is starting to go down again as well.
 So far, definitely feeling much better thanks to this products. I can tell a difference in my mood and I've only been taking it for a month
 I've been taking this for 2 months now.  I believe it's helped me to lose weight by helping me to burn fat.
 Wasnt expecting to feel a difference immediately but I did.  More energy and improved mood.  Hoping to see a difference on the scale too.
 This product really does the job to keep you on the go!!
 I'm amazed at how much energy I've had since taking this.
 I just started taking the product&gt;hoping it helps with my Thyroid.
 Good product. Trustful &amp; would recommend to anyone looking for simple thyroid support
 So far it seems to be doing the job
 Only been taking it for a few weeks but can already tell a big difference in energy level and no longer waking up feeling tired.
 More active and less fatigue through the day
 what a great company which stands behind its products
 Have great energy after taking this for just a month. Would highly recommend this product.
 I have only been taking the Thyroid Support for just a short time, but have felt an increase in my energy level!
 So far I have felt a little more energy, and I am hoping that this will continue with my next order.
 It's ok ... I was taking 1 twice a day ( 1 morning &amp; 1 at night ) and I didn't notice much of a difference. I started taking 2 in the morning and there was a notable difference. I'm going to try something different. If I don't like the next brand I'll come back.
 Very happy with this product. I believe that since I've been taking Thyroid Support I have more energy I'm feeling better.
 I have more energy and clarity in such a short time of taking this.
 Just took First pill today,been having thyroid symptoms,had great reviews,hope they work!
 so far this capsule has been working i lost about two pounds within 2 days of using it not bad... my energy is really good I will keep updating results
 Absolutely notice a difference when taking this product!  I have been taking it for several months and can't stand to be without it.
 I have been severely hypothyroid for many years and have primarily been treating it with natural thyroid rememedies. While my health has improved, there are still many times when I feel fatigued and sluggish. I had done some research and found 1Body products thyroid support through Amazon. I began taking the supplement a few days ago and have already noticed a slight increase in my energy levels. I plan on continuing with the supplement for a month at which time I will again update my review based on my results.
 Feeling a bit more upbeat,  mornings are getting better, not so sluggish ,only been using a little over a week.
 Haven't seen much difference although I do feel more energy. I bought it a week back , will update soon
 I have only been taking it about a week but so far I have been feeling better and have more energy.
 I have just started using these in replacement of another brand. So far they are working great.
 great trace mineral supplement found from Suzy Cohen Thyroid book. Its not possible to get these trace minerals, in the correct amounts in any other vitamin.
 Just started taking this product seems to be helping with "brain fog", too early to tell if it is helping my metabolism.
 I just received my first bottle of thyroid support. I hope it will help with some issues I've been having.
 I think it's too soon to tell yet. I will continue  taking  it and see. So far ne side effects .
 Just received the product, but decided to try it due to the reviews that have been written.
 This is by far the best thyroid suppliment I have used, it has improved my energy level, as well as relived my  joint pain.
 These are great and give me lots of energy. Highly recommend these!
 After taking Thyroid Support for about 2 months now, I can honestly say that I am sleeping better, am less hungry all day and am less moody.
 I've only been taking it a couple of weeks but I have noticed an increase in energy in that time. I'm pleased so far and will continue to take it.
 I haven't taken it long enough to see any results with weight.  I am feeling a bit more energy.
 It works!
 It's worth the money .Feel better and energetic after four days!
 It Thyroid Support Supplement (1body) is very good for me. After used 3 days good sleep,eat , working jobs and I'll be order next one. Thanks a lot.
 Very Helpful with energy.
 Seems to help with brain fog and low energy. Overall pleased with the product.
 Great product! Even received a free one after my first order. I thought it was a gimmick but it arrived couple days later.
 I felt really good on this.
 I haven't started yet but I am amazed with all the ingredients that it has. Can't wait to start tying it!
 It has helped give me more energy and think clearly. I have also lost 10 pounds from taking this
 I've been suffering with hypothyroidism for decades.<br/>The levothyroxine and synthroid are ok, but this in combination has my hair growing,  nails growing,  helps keep me more alert and my skin isn't as dry.<br/>The BEST.
 After a blood test I found out that i had hypothyroidism. I did some research and ordered a bottle of these supplements. After about 5-6 days I noticed an increase in my energy level which was a major symptom I had been suffering from. I take one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The company also sent a voucher for a free bottle (no catch) which was very nice!
 I have been taking one bottle, and it doesn't have any bad effect, and I feel it's working. i feel more energetic than before.
 Increased my energy level and reduced my sluggishness.
 Works well
 Just start to use it, will  come back to post my feedback in a month.
 This supplement has helped give me the little extra boost that I need and deserve as a woman approaching 50.
 Great product! Definitely worth trying it out to support your thyroid!
 just started but hopeful based on reviews
 I was hoping to avoid going on thyroid medication so I tried this for a few weeks. It took the edge off of my fatigue, but it didn't do much for my appetite or energy. If my thyroid problem were minor, I'm sure it would do the trick to kickstart it, but in my case it wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Updated to add: Upon seeing my review, the seller contacted me to offer me a full refund. The money-back guarantee is legit.
 I have felt better taking this twice a day while taking my prescription thyroid medicine once a day. Hope more improvement come in the months to come
 Super fast shipping and quality, sealed product, will update more as the weeks go on.
 Just started, It works
 Great so far. I normally get sick from vitamins but this product has no negative side effects.
 Yes
 UPDATE:<br/>I am changing my rating from 3 stars to one. This product has given me extremely bad flare ups of depression and bad headaches. I would continue taking it to see if it gets better but the depression is so bad it's causing to much harm, emotional thoughts, loss of motivation and sleep. I know autoimmune diseases, which is what hashimotos is, can flare up from cayenne pepper and peppers in general. The maker of this product may want to think about removing this ingredient. I think more people would benefit from it. Do your research. It might also contain thyroid hormones that aren't listed that could've had a negative effect on me, but there's no real way of knowing, unless you test the pills yourself. Be very careful with this product if you already suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts. I've had a minor problem with depression and this product escalated it 10 fold. I've honestly never felt worse and it did scare me a little. Be careful!<br/>Supposedly, this product helped a lot of people but i would recommend starting with one pill and slowly progress to two, or only just take one and keep in mind a lot of people are paid to write good reviews. I always look to see if there's a consistent complaint from customers in the bad reviews. It seems, with my experience, to always be correct.
 Just received this in the mail today and I'm so exited to start because of all the good reviews and the all natural ingredients!
 So far so good.  I really feel like its giving me a bit more energy- which usually never happens for me!
 Excellent product!!!! Feeling great since started taking this supplement.
 From the research I have done I was impressed with the ingredients used in this supplement.
 Seems to be helping with low energy. Have only taken for one week so could be placebo effect. No bad side effects. Will keep taking.
 I love this supplement, i belive i have lost 5lb and no more afternoon naps, this is a Lifesaver. I would order this product again, little pricey, but works
 I've been super happy with this product, one of the few supplements I make sure to order again &amp; again!
 So far seems to help with my energy levels, excited to continue taking and see more long term benefits.
 Changed my life!!!
 Has really helped my metabolism
 One product that replaces three others I used to take. Good quality supplement. Am reordering now.
 Getting good sleep after taking pills. Sleep is getting regularized. Feeling good and no more tiredness. Thanks.
 Very pleased with this product thus far.  I've only been using it for a week but I seem to have more energy and warmer feet.
 Just started taking the supplement, so I don't know the complete results yet.  Felt more energetic and had no side affects.
 Great product!
 I am glad that found this Thyroid Support Product. I struggle with weight issues as well as low energy levels. I've researched this product and found that it was of pretty high quality ingredients and they are all natural. Feeling fatigued and tired, depressed, irritable and lack of concentration were always bothersome symptoms I've experienced thanks to under active thyroid. I have always preferred more natural remedies and found that 1Body provide thyroid support supplement that was a good fit for me. Since taking this supplement I feel more energized and less moody. My brain fog is gone. My energy level stay pretty consistent throughout the day and I don't experience the debilitating afternoon exhaustion! It works quickly and I have felt a difference in my appetite and that makes me think that it is helping my metabolism. If you are ready to stop feeling fatigued and drained, this is the product for you!
 I have just got my bottle and I am excited to try it. I will update later :)
 within the first week I could feel an incredible positive difference.
 After researching the best natural vitamins, minerals and herbs to support healthy thyroid function, I was very happy to find the 1 Body Thyroid Support supplement. It combines all of the most highly recommended ingredients in capsules that are easy to swallow and to digest. And it's vegetarian. I've only been taking it for about a week and a half, so it's really too early to say, but I do feel a gentle increase in energy. I actually get out of bed before 5AM with no alarm and no snooze button. So I'd say that's a good start. I'm also eliminating caffeine and some foods that make me want to go take a nap, and finally incorporating exercise into my daily routine. As things continue to progress, I can't wait to see how I'll feel in a few months. It's definitely worth a try.
 Excited to get started based on so many good reviews.
 Product arrived quickly. Have only taken a ew days but think I feel some improvement in energy levels.
 I have much more energy, no longer need afternoon nap. Feel less anxious.  Great product.
 A noticeable change in energy level.
 So far my energy level is back were I want and need it to be.
 I have only been taking this product for just over 3 weeks now, and am doing this review because the company is generously sending me a free bottle (which I believe you will get as well with your order).  I was told by my doctor that I have hypothyroidism but did not want to go on a prescription so I am trying supplements instead.  This is the one I am currently using.  I do not experience many of the symptoms others do, except that I have gained weight.  When I started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, I also started working out, and have lost a couple of pounds since.  Otherwise, I don't believe I've been taking this supplement long enough to feel its full benefits.  I can say, however, that I have not experienced any negative side effects.  Give it a try!
 I like it so far because I'm sleeping really well. Going for another bottle.
 Just starting this product but feel a change in energy.  Am excited to evaluate after a month.
 I've only been using this product for a month but I definitely feel a difference already!
 oddly enough this also releived my hot flushes that I was getting quite often, after trying other methods to relieve to no avail.. love it
 Gives me more energy
 I just started taking the thyroid support and already I can feel the difference in my energy level!
 Great product from a great company
 I had an ulta sound done on my Thyroid and they discovered it was rough on one side, not smooth as it should be.  The dr. thinks it is small goiters, but wants to do an autopsy.  I'm not thrilled with that thought, so I thought I would try the Thyroid Support to see if it helps any.. I will have to update this review since I have not been on it long enough to have results.
 I have been with this product for a few days. I already see improvement. Can't wait to find out more. :)
 I have had no side effects and noticed a difference within a week.
 It gives me the energy I need very happy!
 This supplement has given me energy.  I have taken it now for over a month. I highly recommend!
 Very good product.
 I have hypothyroidism and have been doing everything to bring my T3 and T4 levels up and after two months of taking this I went in and got tested and my T3 is off the charts good but my T4 levels did not improve. We now know I have a conversion problem and are addressing it but this really seemed to help get my thyroid healthy. I'm happy I tried it, I'm starting to feel much more energetic and I swear my focus as improved which I am really greatful for.
 I am very pleased with this product.
 Just started this, have family that has good results taking it.
 only used for a few days.
 Wow this works! Im 35 and have 3 kids. I'm active and eat right but, I was gaining weight rapidly whuch bever happened before. Fatigue, hairloss, cold etc were other signs something was off too. So i looked into this and researched it. I've been taking these pills for i week now and ive lost a half a pound to 1lb a day along with my daily workouts.... 10lbs total!!! I definitely recommend it.
 Just started taking a week ago.  Chose this for its natural ingredients!  No side effects so far
 I'm just starting the product but already feel more balanced having always had mild thyroid issues.
 I have tried three different brands of Thyroid Support with the same ingredients as listed on your product. With that being said I felt the best while taking this brand, so, I am now on the list with Amazon for subscribe and save each month. Thanks! You have a quality product with an average price.
 I've been taking this for 3 weeks now and I've lost a couple of pounds and my midsection feels slimmer. So far so good, just ordered a second bottle ready to open for next month. Keep you posted with additional results.
 i often tired and i just used this supplement i feel the body is better thanks the company to help me
 Read the reviews so I'm giving it a try. Just arrived today.
 Just new to the product and excited and hopeful that the product does what everyone else has discussed under reviews.
 A good mix of vitamins, minerals, and herbs for hypothyroid
 Good customer support and a pretty good product.  I've noticed an increase in energy and with proper eating and a workout regiment, I have noticed a positive change.
 Just 2 days in but seem to have clarity and focus.
 I've just started taking 1 Body Thyroid Support but I da already feel increased energy and focus by taking this product. Thanks!
 Has helped so much - feel better than when on prescription thyroid med - give it a try!
 I just started taking this supplement about a week ago.  It's too soon to tell it's affect.
 I've only been taking it a few days but I already feel more energy and clear headed!!!
 This has helped with my stress level and energy.  It is very well tolerated.
 Appears to be a good product.  Their customer service is wonderful.
 Odered by my ARNP who practices functional medicine.  Great metabolize booster, easy to tolerate.
 energizing
 I purchased this recently so I can't go into great detail about how this product works yet but I thought I'd review my experiences so far. For a little background info I've always struggled with extreme symptoms dealing with hypothyroidism from struggles with losing weight to hormone problems. A lot is against me and taking synthyroid does not alleviate my issues and makes me extremely tired and moody. Reason I decided to seek a more natural solution and ended up purchasing this product.<br/><br/>First thing to cover is that I have a very sensitive system. Taking medicine and herbs is like Russian Roulette with me so I have to be careful starting anything new. I gave this product a try and I will admit it packs a punch. I had slight stomach pains with the first couple of doese (taken with a meal each time) and it probably lessened the blow but there was mild discomfort and it made me tired. I highly recommend anyone with a sensitive system/sensitivity to herbs(like me) to take half of the recommended dose a day until you get used to it. It took me about 3 days taking only one tablet then I started two by day 4. After that milestone I began feeling a lot better. I do notice a change in energy and I can think more clearly. People I know have told me I'm acting more like myself again because of the energy boost. I really enjoy that about this product since energy is one of my biggest concerns/problems since diagnosed. It did also help me with sleeping better and I wake up feeling rested. I haven't felt this way in a long time.<br/><br/>Despite all the good I will admit I do find a small fault so far. I haven't taken this product long so this can only be taken with face value but I gained weight since taking this product. I gained 3 lbs and this is with a controlled, healthy diet. This concerns me since weight is always an issue and losing it is very difficult and one reason I bought this product is the help lose some. It could be water weight since I do feel bloated sometimes but I'm not sure. I don't know why I have gained weight but I want to give this product a chance concerning this since herbs have to be taken daily and for awhile before they truly start to work in all areas.
 I've lost quite a bit of weight. This product seems to help.
 Great product. have definitely noticed improved energy
 love it
 I have just started using the product and really like the changes it is making and the supplier was very easy to work with.
 The item seems to be working, I'm not falling asleep at my desk any more
 I have been using this product for about 2 months now and am very happy with it. I will continue to buy it !
 I've been taking this for about 3 weeks. I have found that my mood is improved. I have to take it with food.
 Although I just started using this product I'm feeling more energy daily, looking forward to the results over time.
 seem to work for me.
 This product is great. I've been taking it for 3 months now and I love it.
 I just received the product.  I am happy that it contains so many good things for thyroid support.  We shall see.
 I feel less sluggish after taking this product for a short time. The capsules are easy to slow.
 Been taking for a few months now. It helps with my mood and energy level
 I have hypothyroidism and was hoping to help my ever-changing levels by using this product in addition to my Synthroid.  It did not provide the help I had hoped for as my levels did not stabilize.  I am always one for stretching my dollar to the max and with that said, I have to say I would not repurchase.
 Makes me feel much more energetic daily.  Works within about one week of using it.
 I really enjoy the product and have ordered a new bottle.  It beats prescription drugs anyday!
 I just started this today and can't wait to see the results.
 Within a few days my energy levels were and began to feel more like my old self.
 Very pleased with the results. More energy and generally just feel better.
 Great product. Great service.
 Seems to help ... Although the price is a little high, it may be worth it in the long run.
 First day I took Thyroid Support I felt a difference.
 I have been taking it for about two months, and have noticed a difference in my behavior.
 love this stuff... def notice a difference!
 AMAZING PRODUCT.. LOVE IT
 Just got the product so can't really say if it works or not. Give it 5 stars for fast shipping. Will review after taking the 1st bottle.
 This product has allowed me to maintain my dietary needs. Great thyroid support supplement, I would order again!
 Great product.  Great customer service.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
 Very good product
 My doctor suggested this product and I am excited to try it.
 Improved energy, hair, nails, skin and menstrual cycle as well as PMS symptoms.
 I have been taking the supplement for a week and already the slight discomfort in my throat from my thyroid has subsided and I am not feeling as depressed as I was, so it appears to be doing something positive as it is the only change I have made.
 I have only been taking this for 2.5 weeks,but my skin feels healthier than it has a long time.
 Have only taken for 2 days.  Will leave a better review when I have taken it longer and given it time to work.
 Just started the product. So far have a little more energy through out the day
 This is a good product. I find it helps fight fatigue. Good company.
 I got so sick while on these. I wasn't sure if it was these pills so I stopped them for a couple of weeks and then started them again and got sick again.
 Haven't noticed a difference yet..will continue to use
 The supplement has been great. Gives me so much more energy and I just ordered another one.
 Nice
 I've been involved with supplements for a long time and this thyroid blend is wonderful, amazing energy.
 One week in, so far so good but look to have a better understanding of its impact mid-bottle.
 So far so good
 Just received it - hope it helps improve symptoms!
 It's works pretty good in comparison to other capsules, best non liquid thyroid supplement I've used.
 I have not taken the product long enough to know for sure the results, but it seems that I'm doing pretty good energy-wise.
 Pretty useful, helped reduce the swelling in my Thyroid glands and makes me more energetic.
 week one completed, starting to feel a bit better
 https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B00M13NHFY#
 We have ordered this product for low thyroid function because we were impressed by ingredient list.
 Love this supplement. It's doing wonders for me! I feel so much better!
 Awesome
 I've been using this for a little over a month now and LOVE IT!! I was taking a prescription medicine called Nature Thyroid but ran out and couldn't get more for about another month. Thank god I found this Thyroid Support!! Even without my prescription meds, I feel great! My nails and hair are growing like weeds and I have energy. I just received my prescription meds and I'm now debating on even taking them still. I'll have my thyroid levels checked to make sure everything is okay.
 Works better than Probiome Rx brand, from Dr. Axe products.
 Since using this product I have more energy and am in a better mood. I love the results!
 just started taking it, waiting to see the results at this time
 I have been only using it for a little while so I can not determine how effective it is just yet.
 Haven't been taken too long, but it seems to be giving me more energy. Like to have the extra pick me up.
 Great product.
 Awesome product
 I've come back for this for many times. Really like it. It seems to help my thyroid function better.
 I have only been taking for one week, but fill like it has helped with my energy level!
 Pretty good product
 Good Brand
 I have all the symptoms of a dysfunctional thyroid but since my levels are within normal limits my doctor will not prescribe anything for me. When I saw this product I decided to give it a try. I have only been taking it for a week but I can tell a huge difference. I get up as soon as my clock goes off in the mornings now and I no longer feel tired throughout the day. My energy level has increased and I do not feel as moody as I did before. I will definitely be purchasing bottles in the future.
 My DO recommended the product.  I have only been on it for a few weeks, but it seems to be helping.
 Very good thanks
 So far so good with this product
 I just received this product and opened it today.  The packaging was done well and the bottle itself was sealed.  The graphics look very medicinal-like.  If that makes sense.  It arrived well and there were no issues with its packaging.  I will follow up with another review after I've tried it for a few weeks.  I've tried Thyro-Aid before which worked okay and it was noticeable when I stopped taking it, but I also took it along with Synthroid.  I want to see if this might be better than Thyro-Aid.
 i have been using it for over 3 months and it is still helping me with night sweats.
 I felt more energy and better mental focus
 Very good product
 Was looking for a thyroid support that was vegetarian with no bovine hormones
 Great
 great product i love that its all natural
 working good so far. taking it from 3 months.Feel more energy than before.
 I have just started to take the product, and I feel better already.
 Not a miracle; but really good!!  Definitely more energy.
 More energy already excited to see how else it helps
 Thyroid Support is helping me to be less tired and grumpy. Usually, I am a person that hits snooze on my alarm at least 5 times. Now, most mornings I am waking up before the alarm goes off for the first time.  I am also not as hungry or craving as much junk food, like sweets, Since I am not as hungry and craving less sweets, I have lost over 7 pounds. It is taking some time, but well worth  the benefits.
 Love it
 Just started taking it, but I've already noticed more energy and better digestion.
 started taking three weeks ago and feeling a bit more energetic. Will continue to take and hopefully see positive results.
 Provides me with the Thyroid Support I need.
 I take 2 capsules in the morning, and I notice increased energy.
 Have noticed a great improvement in my energy and alertness.  Definitely will continue to order !
 Love this product! It has helped me a lot and I will continue to take it!
 Will review once I've started the product.
 works very well for me love it
 This product has made me feel so much better.  I am looking forward to continue to take it!
 very excited to try this product, looking forward to the result!
 I just got this product today, so I have yet to know if it works for me. However, being that I have ALL of the symptoms that everyone else who has ordered this product has (extreme fatigue, weight gain, hair shedding, broken concentration and memory issues), I'm praying that this will get me back on the right path. As many have stated, the doctor's said my numbers are good and I should continue to take my Synthroid medication that I have been taking for years since I had my thyroids removed. However, I know when I am not feeling right. I'm anxious to witness the results. So I'll soon post another review! Keep your fingers crossed!
 more energized
 Excellent product, fast  service.Will buy it again.
 So far so good. Only been using for a few days, but already feel more energetic.
 Seems to be working well - More energy!
 Great product really works
 A friend recommended thyroid supplement ,
 I have been using this product for a little over a week. I noticed an energy bump almost immediately and lost 3 pounds. I will definitely continue to use it.
 After reading all the reviews I had to try this product.  Yes I am getting a bottle free for this review.  But here is why I am trying:<br/>1. Reviews were great<br/>2. Tired of my doctor treating me with partial labs, (only checking my TSH)<br/>3. Tired of doctors wanting to put me on anti depressants because of tiredness, brain fog, dry skin, hair falling out.<br/>4. I take Amour Thyroid and I have to fight to get it, told the doctor I would not take the synthetic s***, most have no idea how to get the dosage right.<br/>It is time for me to do something.  I will review this product again after I take it for awhile.  I can tell you it isn't hard to swallow.
 I've been taking this for three weeks. I felt an increase in my daytime energy within the first few days, and I find it's been easier tackling my daily to do lists. I'm hoping for a continuous nights sleep, every night, to happen soon - that has been on and off and has taken more time to happen, but it's getting there. I don't want to run out, so I just ordered my second bottle.
 Good product
 This thyroid support is amazing! I have hypothyroidism and even though I take the proper dosage of my synthroid and get back blood results that say I'm within normal range I still felt so cold, sluggish &amp; foggy all of the time. Within a week of taking, "Thyroid Support" there was a huge noticeable change. I feel like I'm getting my life back. Thank you!!!
 Had very good ratings and reviews! Very excited to try it
 Just started this supplement and have not noticed any effects as of yet. Easy to swallow and was shipped quickly.
 I did feel my symptoms lessen while using this product
 feeling better after a couple of weeks on this!
 My last blood work shows improvement.
 Arrived way faster than expected. Super excited to start taking it today.<br/><br/>Update after 1 month of taking it: the company was very pleasant to deal with but unfortunately I have seen no improvement in my energy levels or other thyroid issues so Im going to try something different.
 Haven't tried it long enough, but seems like its working. I'll write a review in a month
 I've definitely felt a difference taking this in addition to my levothyroxine.
 I feel so much better while taking this.
 Great product and excellent customer service!
 Trying it out. Need something that really works.
 Going the natural way? This is it! Great product and I feel great too.
 Only have taken it for a couple of days but my energy is improved. Hopeful for this product.
 good product. only been using a month
 Feel like I have more energy and it has helped with weight loss. I have been taking it for almost 6 months.
 This is a great product. I strongly recommend
 Arrived right on time. Have only been using a couple of days. Energy seems increased.
 I felt great while I was taking this.
 Gave me so much more energy!
 My energy level has increased and I am finally sleeping!<br/>Will continue to purchase.
 I've only been taking it for a couple of days, and I can already tell a difference in my mood
 Great product! The energy is back and moodiness is gone.
 After some blood work I was informed by my doc I had hypothyroidism. Not severe, but none the less she recommended a prescription. When I asked if there was a more natural approach, (supplements, diet) she laughed at the idea. I opted out of the Rx route and did some research.  I came across these supplements and decided to give them a try. After taking them for a few months I had another blood test.  The results came back as normal. What a relief! No more hypothyroidism!!
 Good product. Fast shipping.packed well.
 havent started it yet but im veru hopeful, it has helped all the women in my family
 Received a week back, hoping to have good things come from it!
 Look no more, this is your best thyroid support!
 Good product! Gave me energy and I am looking forward to starting another bottle!
 SO far, so good!
 Great product with everything I need for thyroid support.
 It has helped me so much, when regular medication hasn't.
 Really helps with my energy level
 Good item thus far!!
 REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER !!!
 Just started a couple weeks ago. Feeling ok. Hope it works as good as Thyromine.
 Love this product
 Absolutely love this product!!!
 I've tried other thyroid support products and they've made me feel strange. This seems to work well so far.
 I have been taking for a few days now and already have noticed more energy.
 I felt good difference
 I've been taking this for two months now in place of my Levothyroxine. I can honestly say I see and feel the difference. My energy has returned, my hair loss hair stopped and I am losing weight.
 Does help with hair growth. I also have more energy.
 I've only used it for a week or 2 so far, but the results are good.  Not feeling as tired.
 So far so good!
 So far I feel more energy from this product. Have taken it about 3 weeks.
 I will know in a few weeks , a have hope will be good for the body
 Very good product.  I feel the difference it makes.
 Just started taking it a few days ago. I think it is helping with my systems though.
 Works very well! Helped with my intense brain fog and concentration issues.
 Great product and more energy!!
 just received, looking forward to seeing if this product helps me!
 I have had more than my share of feeling the chronic symptoms from my thyroid. I felt crazy because my bloodwork would always come back normal.  The Doctors, would not go beyond that because everything flagged normal, but I was FAR from feeling normal.  Let me tell you, I eat clean foods, yoga daily and drink only water with lemon in it.  I have literally removed all garbage going in, so why isn't my body responding after months of hard work, I mean daily hard work? I have found what works for me.  I take two per day. One after breakfast and the other after dinner.  BOOM!!!! I will not be without this product.
 Awesome stuff! Best thyroid vitamin I have yet to try!
 Just started taking.....no difference yet but hoping it will help.
 I have been using this product for about a week.  I seem to have more energy
 Early days yet but seems good product
 Exactly what I was looking for! Just started, but got it very fast and hope it helps!
 Great product!
 Great product! Saw a difference after 2 weeks
 Does seem to help with energy.. will be curious to see how it works in the long term.
 Still waking for results. Just got this week.
 I received today, hope it's as good as all the great reviews!
 Seems like I have more energy.
 Love this product, using it from 8 weeks. My friend suggested me 3 months ago.
 great
 Thyroid Support Supplement seems to work. I noticed a difference in my energy level within one month.
 Just received this. Hoping it helps with energy.
 Have noticed improvement in energy and alertness.Will continue treatment. It's worth it.
 Just started but no side effects - will follow up with review!
 read the reviews excellent product just started taking this.
 Awesome
 Started it only 4 days ago. Too early to tell but feel little more energetic!
 Have been using it from a week and I already see good results.
 Love it. Brought my t4 and t3 up!
 JUST STARTED AND AM HOPING FOR GOOD RESULTS  TOO EARLY USING THIS PRODUCT TO EVALUATE.
 I've only been using it for a few days, but I'm noticing a difference.  Thanks!
 Just started product for low thyroid levels
 It works great!
 Although I have never been diagnosed with any type of thyroid condition, I have suffered with many of the symptoms for several years.  Such as weight gain, extreme fatigue, dry itchy skin, dizzy spells, and hair loss.  After reading many promising reviews on this product, I decided to try it.  I recieved my first bottle today and will try to update this review after a couple of weeks of usage.
 Just started a month ago but seems to be working.
 looking forward to starting considering all the great reviews!!
 I'm desperate to try anything to help support my thyroid
 just received hope it works
 Great product
 Just starting out but seems like a great product!
 My thyroid numbers were out of range again.  Rather than increasing my hypothyroid medication, I asked my doctor to let me try this Thyroid Support Supplement from 1 Body instead.  Three weeks later, my TSH numbers are back to normal.
 Energy, energy, and more energy - I have not felt this good in years!
 My hairdresser has recently noticed that my hair seems to be thickening!
 Great product!
 I have lived with hyperthyroidism for many years.  I had nothing to loose so I order the Thyroid Support Supplement.  I have been taking this for about 3 weeks and  my results are amazing.  First, my nails are growing again, I finally am loosing weight, but the most important thing is  I have had a large goiter for many years and fought off doctors who wanted to operate.  I had a biopsy and everything was fine so I refused to have the surgery and after taking this I am happy to say it is shrinking.  My husband even notice that the large lump in my neck is hardly noticeable.  I am just so happy I decided to try this and will keep buying this miracle in a bottle.
 I have more energy and feel more alert
 It seems to be working. Definitely more energy since taking it .
 I have recently started taking this product and already notice a difference. Great product so far
 It's only been a week but hope it works!
 I love this product. I finally have my energy back without coffee.
 Great product! I have so much energy and feel a lot better on a daily basis!
 I feel AMAZING since starting this!!!!!
 Just got it and excited to try!
 Started two days ago with this product and it seems to work!!!! I'll keep you posted. :)
 Fast shipping.  Product seems to work well
 Great product! Really helps with metabolism
 Happy happy happy
 I just started this product, I have a lot more energy
 Helped my mood and energy levels. I also noticed it was a little easier to drop weight.
 Good stuff
 I am 80 years old and have problems related to the thyroid for some time. I ordered this product on the recommendation of a friend who had wonderful experiences with it. My order for Thyroid Support came in the mail two weeks ago, and I began taking 2 capsules per day as recommended. I can already feel that the product is working. I especially notice that my energy level has increased and that I no longer have cold hands and chills. I  plan to continue with Thyroid Support, as it is definitely helping with the way I feel overall.
 Only used it for a few days but so far seems to give me more energy!
 Just started, but so far, so good...
 I have hypothyroidism, so usually I would feel myself very tired and sleepy. I found out that I may need iodine. I made some research and found Thyroid Support. At first, I was little bit sceptical, but after I read some reviews, I decided to try Thyroid Support. I have been taking this supplement for 3 weeks so far and, honestly, I love it. I feel less tired and more focused. I even, finally, have started losing weight. I love this product.
 My energy levels have improved, so far so good.
 Great product -- this is my second month of using and have more energy !
 My doctor even liked it.  He asked me where I bought it.
 the product is helping my problems with thyroid, I would recommand
 I love it. It has helped me as soon as I started to take it.
 Seem to have given me more energy
 I have started this product again to help for tiredness.
 More enregy, happier
 Came fast, gives me hope.
 Unless you have at least some thyroid function, this isn't going to be helpful. Can't support what isn't there, after all.<br/><br/>This is NOT to say that it's a bad product... only that for me (and likely for you, if you have no thyroid function, like myself), there was no benefit in taking it. Before purchasing, I would suggest printing out the labels from the product photo's and consulting with your endocrinologist first. I did it backwards, first purchasing and then consulting with my endocrinologist and was very dismayed when I was told that this couldn't benefit me.
 Unfortunately don't see any results as of yet,,, I hope it will start to work soon!!!
 I feel better, waiting to lose some weight!
 Enjoying results so far.
 Nice package haven't tried product yet but will give an update .
 Just got in the mail, looking forward to starting it!
 I noticed a difference immediately.....
 TT, not sure this will work, too early to tell. TBD
 Perfect balance for me.
 Just started taking and so far so good.
 I feel much more energy
 Wife is feeling much better . Will continue .
 so far so good
 Just starting it today so I"ll give three stars and update later if I need to.
 I haven't tried it yet, but I have heard great things and I have high hopes.
 I have only been taking it for one month.  I cannot attest to the results yet, but will continue to take it and will edit this review in the future.  I believe I have more energy, but I also started some other products at the same time.  More to come...
 Works great! I feel like I have more energy.  Very happy with product!
 Just started yesterday, will update if/when i feel any difference.
 Just started on it!  Will know more soon!  So far so good!
 seems to work well. very interested to know what another month of this will do.
 used product for a month now, will order it again
 Arrived quickly and am looking forward to feeling better.
 I've just started taking this, and so far i'm loving it.
 great product
 Product came quickly. Works great.
 I love feeling healthy and energized.
 Nice product, shipped quickly.
 This support pill gave me instant energy.
 Works really well. I feel great.
 Has helped my health in many ways! I would certainly recommend
 So far, I have more energy.
 im excited to try this!
 I feel a noticeable difference in my energy levels
 Made my stomach hurt.
 This had the best review that's why I got them
 So far so good
 Still new to the product but definitely seems to be helping.
 Love the resulsts just is few weeks
 works great!
 I feel energized and happier since I began taking this supplement.
 Good product
 So far liking it
 So far I've been taking this supplement for about a month. I am very busy so on occasion I forget a dosage possibly once or possibly for a day or two but no matter what this supplement has definitely made me feel much more energetic. I am still tired because I think I need to take two pills in the morning and two in the afternoon but haven't attempted it yet. I have a much easier time waking up in the morning now. On top of that these supplements have been keeping my weight within the range of a lb or two which is how my weight would fluctuate before this disease appeared into my life. I have to say that this supplement has definitely helped me a lot being that I have completely stopped taking my levothyroxine and have been off of it since before receiving this product.
 So. This is a pretty good product. I decided to try it because a lot of people in my family have thyroid issues which makes it harder to lose weight...I just wanted to jumpstart my thyroid into good working condition so my weight loss journey would benefit...which it has:) after a few days I could feel a difference in my body..like energy and waking up more refreshed..cause I always feel tired a lot even though I sleep a lot too...anyways I lost 50 lbs with my diet plan and incorporated this into it for a month..which gave me a little boost...still dieting and considering buying another bottle or trying something new...I like trying things and seeing that they work..
 feel great taking this product!
 I have more energy just after a few days!
 My concentration has improved since taking this product.
 Good  product
 great product....
 Just started taking it. Will update later
 Don't seem to be losing as much hair as I was before taking the product.
 This product is awesome! It really helped me!
 I like this product! Has helped with my thyroid issues. I would recommend!
 Good product great customer service.
 Excellent product
 One week in and feeling like I have more energy.
 look like this is the best product out there!
 great product -- fast shipping
 Have been taking only 2 weeks.  I have a lot more energy, and feel much better!
 Works great as an additional supplement to synthroid.
 so far so good! I really like it
 Very good.
 Ashwaganda root is a great supplement!
 Love this one! More energy.
 Love it!
 The customer service is awesome! Second bottle received free as promised. As with many health issues, positive results sometimes take a long time to see. I'm hoping to report back in a couple of months with a wonderful review of this product.
 Seems to work . I only take one a day.
 Too soon to tell
 Works as expected. Would like to get more information about quality testing, an independent verification of ingredients and process. Called and they could not provide this information.
 I just received it, I think it will really help.
 Great product.  Definitely has boosted my energy levels.
 One month in--more energy, better sleep and mood  Warlock
 Great
 noticed a difference in energy level
 I noticed I slept more soundly and would awake easily in the morning.  Usually don't buy into supplements but this was worth purchase.  I will continue to buy.
 Love it!
 Years ago I took a prescribed natural thyroid product because my thyroid was sluggish. When it was no longer available, I stopped because I did not want to take synthroid. Now at age 67, my thyroid function is off again. My doctor wants me to take the synthroid, but I am going to give this product a try for the next few months to see of it will correct my problem without having to take a medication with side effects. So far I have only taken it for one day, but I am pleased to see the levels of the ingredients in this product are much higher than any other product I have tried. I am hoping for a fantastic result and will let you know if I get one. Thanks for the free bottle.
 Just ordered product to support thyroid and loose weight.
 Replaced my prescription.  I love this product.
 I have liked this product so far.
 Nutritionist recommend, feeling great!
 I admit I was skeptical but I figured this was worth a shot because I was really, really feeling bad and my symptoms were just getting worse. I started the first week with a half dose just to keep any potential side-effects in check. I experienced no bad side-effects at all. The first day, I took 1 capsule in the morning before work on a Monday. I actually got all my work done that day and went home to clean my entire house. This is something I wasn't capable of doing before because I felt so tired all the time. I've got increased energy, I'm sleeping better, and I have greater mental clarity all from this little supplement. As far as weight-loss, I haven't experienced any but my weight-gain has stopped. I gained 40 lbs in the past year without any increased calorie intake. I am waiting to see my Doctor next month so he can run my numbers. I'm anxious to see if they have improved. I've always been in the low-normal range but my Doctor says not enough to treat.
 Shipment was right on time.  Bottle looks fine, pills don't smell too bad.  I'll report back in few weeks as this is my first morning taking this.----Update 4/26/15 -  I've been taking 2 capsules a day and so far so good. I've been really low on energy and yesterday I worked in the yard!  I have been working on going to a gluten free diet and a more plant based diet since last year.  I've lost 15 pounds gradually so far.  I have a histamine issues with wheat and sugar causes me to get really bad headaches.  I kept a head ache log because my head aches lasted days and low and behold Diet is everything!  My diet was causing my headaches.  Now I don't use my headache log, I've gotten so good at taking the food triggers out of my diet.  I also juice more now too.  I have a vita mix at home and a blend tec mixer I keep at work. I'm very sensitive to foods and supplements so I'm pleased with how this is going.  I'll give another update in a few weeks. Take care. UPDATE:  5/6/2015- I really notice a big difference in my energy level, so much better than it has been in a long, long, time.  I am taking 1 to 2 pills a day.  5/26/2015 - I've lost a few more pounds!  I have energy to do the things I thought I was just going ignore because I felt so tired.  I also started taking nascent iodine and I am currently reading The Iodine Crisis.  I ordered 2 more bottles.  (I ordered Nutracraft ThyroAid and have been taking that to see if I notice a difference between the two products - I'll update soon)  6/3/2015 - I prefer 1 Body over Nutracraft.
 Great product
 Good product.
 It helps with my thyroid condition
 excellent
 Fast shipping. Only been taking for a few days but good so far.
 This supplement gave me the energy I needed and also lost 11 pounds in a month!
 Seems to be making a difference in my daughter's energy levels.
 Great Product!
 looking forward to seeing results
 Great product, help me feel better within a day.
 Arrived on time. Great value and coupon offers inside!
 Worked amazingly well for me!
 great!
 Great Product!!
 I just received my order and have taken the first dose. No adverse affects so far. I realize it's too soon to tell if it's going to work for me or not. But I do want to state that the item arrived sooner than I expected and was packaged well. I will be posting another review at a later date to tell of my experience. I do think it is important that people realize this product may not work for everyone. I also think I should state that no doctor has diagnosed me with thyroid problems. I have suspected for years that my thyroid isn't working properly and am using this product with the hopes that it will help me.
 so far so good really hopeful
 excellent product .. excellent !
 I suffered endometriosis symptoms in mid-late 2014. I did not want to have surgery just to get an official diagnosis so I thought I'd find an alternative route to address the underlying issue which I suspected was a thyroid disfunction. I started to take this supplement and it worked beautifully! My endometriosis symptoms disappeared, my cycle was like clockwork; every 28 days. I lost weight and I felt great. I continued to take this product on and off for 1.5 years with no issues.I stopped taking thyroid supplements in early 2016.<br/><br/>Fast forward to August 3, 2017 when I began taking this product again. I regained my energy and my sleep improved slightly but it has had an OPPOSITE effect on my weight and menstrual cycle. I've gained 5 pounds in 4 weeks and my cycle was as bad as it was back in 2014. I'm not sure if the formula changed or my body has. Whatever is going on, this supplement is no longer beneficial for me.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/>My order was refunded a day after this review without my asking. The vendor gets a couple more stars for excellent business practices
 Just ordered...1 week taking it...will update review later..
 Seems okay
 It came right away and I'm excited to start taking it!
 it works !!
 THanks!
 More energy, less lethargy.
 Seems to be working
 Helping so far

 Awesome!!!
 I tried other products and this I found to be the most effective
 works great
 Waiting for a change
 Product does what it stated to do.
 I've taken these for two weeks and don't really notice any difference. After reading the reviews, I was hopeful. The pills are on the large side. They have a bit of a taste to them that quickly goes away.
 Works great for me!
 I was having a great deal of trouble swallowing. After taking the thyroid support it has improved.
 Gives me more energy great product.
 Fabulous product.  I've been struggling with a thyroid problem for years. These are the best over the counter pills. I've already seen improvements in my mood and have even dropped a few pounds in the process. Will definitely buy again.
 MorE energy!
 great product
 Arrived quickly and you get a free bottle.....
 gave me more energy for sure
 Improved energy.
 I think it's working.

 I like it and think it works well.

 I have been having issues with my thyroid since the past 2 years.  My TSH level gettiing higher with each blood test, I have been having other issues associated with thyroid dysfunctions, so I decided to take matters in my own hand and researched Amazon Website to see what were the supplements available and upon reading all the reviews and evaluating them I decide to give this supplement a try.  I ordered a bottle of the Thyroid Support which I received on November 3 and took one capsule the evening and continue the dosage as prescribed the following day ,  I don;t know but I think this is a miracle, because within  48 hours I started to see improvement in over all wellness based on previous symptoms with my thyroid dysfunction.  My menstrual cycle was messed up as a result of the problems I had and I must tell you I started taking the capsules on the 3rd of Novemebr and my period returned on the 5th of November, which had been irregular.  The last time it came was April 2, 2014.  I don/t normally write reviews but certainly I had to comment on this product.
 Makes me feel great!
 Good product.
 Great product
 Great product!
 great product !
 Great Product!
 i did not notice any change in my energy, weight or overall physical feel. i think it was a waste of money. i purchased this product based on the wonderful reviews but it did not help me.
 SEEMS TO REALLY BE HELPING MY ENERGY LEVEL!
 Seems to help
 So far its working!
 Product works great.  Feel well more healthy.
 It's good.
 Great product.
 Seems to be helping as long as I take it regularly.  I would recommend this for added energy and it seems to help suppress my appetite but not sure if its doing it on its own or if its because I take it in conjunction with the Adrenal Support.  I will be reordering for sure.
 Great product!
 Love it so far!
 Fast shipping, but didn't work for me personally.
 Not as good as Kelp.
 Good Stuff
 Good product
 GOOD PRODUCT
 it looks grate
 it 100% does what it says!
 Not sure yet
 It looks good
 Love it
 This product did absolutely nothing for me.  I had high hopes that it would give me a bit of an energy boost, but by the time I finished the bottle I still hadn't seen any improvement.  Maybe it works for other people, but not in my case.
 excelente product
 Great product.

 good product!!!
 I just received my bottle today can't Waite to start . I have every symptoms of thyroid problem but doctors say test don't show anything. I see on other reviews other people notice in 3 weeks I hope I see it before the 3 weeks. I will come back and give another review when I see.
 Great product!
 Great product!!
 Didn't do anything.  Felt no different, and my thyroid result did not change. But the seller offers wonderful customer service.
 The levels of energy that I have achieved using this supplement is something I hadn't experienced in a while. My doctor's prescription helped a little bit in the beginning but this supplement helped me on going back to my normal state. I decided to test it out by not taking it for a week and I was able to notice the difference from day 1. Give it a try.

 Disclaimer: I received a free product for writing this review. I started taking Thyroid Support in addition to a bunch of other vitamins because I felt tired all the time. I live in Chicago and the winter is long here and one gets down and depressed especially around January. I feel overall in a better mood and more energetic. I am also taking B complex and magnesium. Good luck!
 I've been taking this for almost 2 weeks now and I am pretty sure it is making my symptoms worse, especially concerning mood and energy.<br/>An hour or so after I take it, every time, I feel really sleepy and my mood is terrible.  :(<br/><br/>I was really hoping this would help me, but it makes it worse...
 Since I just received the product I don't know if it will be effective in my personal case; the reviews are fantastic, so I decided to give it a try.<br/> All I can say right now is that I received the product very quickly and in perfect condition. Also received an e-book from the company with some great advises regarding the proper diet for hypothyroidism's suffers. As I use the product I will update my review.<br/>07/11/17<br/> This is the only product that has helped me to lose a few pounds and to diminish the uncomfortable symptoms from this condition.
 This is the first time using this product, I've decided to try this product after reading all the reviews. Good and bad reviews and I think I made a very good choice in choosing this product. Today is my second day trying and it seems to help, I don't feel tired or sleepy all the time.
 I haven't taken this consistently, I'm horrible about remembering to take pills. When I do take them I can tell a difference in my energy but the most important thing is that it feels like the dreaded "brain fog" has lifted. I feel much less scattered and fuzzy minded.  I will make a valiant effort to take this daily and make another report on the effects.
 So disappointed how you change the recipe. It’s gone from being amazing and working well  to me feeling like I’m wasting my money.  The pills of gone from a herbal green color to white and are not nearly as effective.
 I started this product two days ago and have noticed an improvement in my energy level and overall health in just this short amount of time. Hopefully the great results are cumulative and things will only continue to get better from here.
 I wish I could select out of the iodine bit.  Makes me break out.  The rest of the ingredients are fine.
 I have been taking the products for 2 months.  I reviewed the symptoms that the products is supposed to eliminate.  I am still feeling fatigued, sensitive to cold, and joint pain.  I am taking 2 per day.  My skin seems to be drier.  I don't know whether to continue or what.
 I've just barely purchased and started taking this product I'm a lower energy person with a slow metabolism. Hoping for more energy and metabolism improvements, and relief of fatigue. At this time, I haven't noticed any difference, I should come back and alter this review after a month or two to see if results have changed.<br/><br/>I was offered a second bottle of this product for my unbiased review.
 I have used  Thyroid Support for about two weeks and I have noticed that I have more energy and a better mood.  I am hoping that the benefits will continue to improve in the future.  I like the combination of the many nutrients, vitamins and herbs in this product.  I highly recommend this product.
 This product is excellent. I myself have to take thyroid medication and this product helps me to get through the afternoon without being so tired.<br/>I take about 4 hours after my prescribed dose.
 My mother and one sister have thyroid issues so I thought wise for me to take some non prescribed medication.  I've taken thyroid support for about 10 days and I may be experiening a little less tiredness.
 This Product makes me quite ill. Headaches and nausea, messes with my vision and may stomach is a hot mess. Not sure what it was but tried this product a few different ways and just ended up miserable.
 Most immediate benefit is great improvement in bowel function which greatly improved my quality of life. Energy levels are greatly improved and as another reviewer mentioned, I no longer have to think about moving from my chair. Just ordered Adrenal Support and plan to take 1 Adrenal and 1 Thyroid daily. I have stressful work and am hoping that the Adrenal support will help offset some of the stress effects.
 I take this in addition to thyroid replacement levothyroxine.  It really has helped me feel better without messing with my TSH levels. Love it.
 Very good
 Just got the Thyroid support pills. They came earlier than I thought they would. Delivery was great. My free ones are the way. I started taking them today. I will let you know after I'mon them for a while how they are working.
 I can't express with words how satisfied I am with this product. Thyroid support gives you natural energy, instead of that toxic junk I was putting in my system beforehand, like caffeine. This product has saved my life and has gotten me on the right track and I really appreciate the free bottle. I would be more then happy to promote these bottles around my campus for students that are lethargic and need that natural young energy again.<br/>P.s.<br/><br/>Thanks for the free bottle again.
 Have not really noticed any difference while taking these supplements . Was hoping it would work as well for me as it has for others.
 i was trying really hard to love this. but there must be something in there that upsets my tummy. i’ve tried a previous thyroid supplement before this and had the same issue. but this one has so many positive reviews i had to try it out. guess it’s just not for me or some ingredient doesn’t go to well on my stomach.
 So far so good. My TSH levels are borderline so doctor will not treat. I have taken it exactly as directed and no bad side effects. This is weird for me because I am very sensitive to medicine. I have more energy and have only been taking it four days. I am hoping it will help with my brittle nails and weightloss.
 I don't notice any difference and since it has to taken one pill ; twice a day and it's only 60 pills it's only one month supply. I wanted to try it longer than one month because I realize that probably is not a long enough time to make a discernment on how well the product works. So I am reordering elsewhere where I get double the supply at a cheaper price, and the products also has 5/5 star raving reviews. I am giving this product 3 stars because I don't know how well this product actually works. I haven't given up yet, I just need to get it elsewhere.
 No noticable changes after two months.
 Just received Thyroid Support today and will start taking it tomorrow morning. Hoping it helps reduce Hashimoto's symptoms.<br/>So, 3 weeks later, I'm still taking Thyroid Support, but only 1 capsule per day, because 2 increases heart palpitations.
 I just received this today.  It does have all the vitamins recommended for having thyroid issues.  I'm glad it's gluten free.  the selenium I am taking currently is not gluten free.  Looking forward to getting all the recommended vitamins in 1 pill.
 Went for my yearly physical and my Dr told me my thyroid was a bit low. It wasn't below the level it should be, but it was close to borderline. Had all the symptoms which I don't need to recount. I got this thyroid support about one month ago. All I can say is it works, and fast! It was like giving my brain a drink of water. My energy level has gone up a lot, and my ADD has gone down. Skin is not as dry. I have a sense of well being and motivation I haven't had in sometime and my productivity at work (which is measured) has gone up starting the first day I took this. Also, I had put on 14 lbs, and though I had cut down to one meal a day and no snacks for one month prior to taking this, I didn't lose one pound. Since taking this for a month (and continuing my diet) I've lost 9lbs. I have to go and have my thyroid screened again, as Doc was going to put me on meds if it didn't look better, so will try to remember to post the results. One little thing is I would say don't take this close to bedtime cause It seems to keep me awake. I take my second one late afternoon. All in all really happy with it...great product : )
 I just received this and took the first pill this morning. I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and have been taking prescription medicine for about a year. I've really wanted to switch over to a more natural alternative as I really don't like taking medication. I have high hopes for this supplement. I will check back in a few weeks!
 Only been using this product for a month but I can tell you I have more energy and for some odd reason a little better outlook on my health. My mother has had Thyroid problems all her life and had to have it removed. I just want whats best for myself and so far I really like this product. Thanks for putting it on the market. And thank you Amazon for have so many valuable products to choose from.
 I can only give 3 stars because have not taken it long enough to fairly evaluate effectiveness for my thyroid (which is somewhat unfair to the supplier, but it is their requirement for a free second bottle). I can attest to no side effects and that ingredients are consistent with what I have seen listed in my online research.
 Both my wife and I have been taking it for a month and have not seen any difference
 So far, so good, I feel like my energy level is up, before I was really dragging.  I will wait to add more feedback once I've been using the product for over 3 months.
 So far I like this supplement. I want to take it one more month before I retest my TSH test. I want to take a natural supplement for my thyroid and I hope this is the one.
 Although I was tested for thyroid problems and it did not show a problem, I was having difficulty losing weight.  I tried this product and the weight started to come off.  THANK YOU!
 I had mild chills, hair loss, and lowered energy, and was looking for several supplements to support my thyroid which had B-12, Selenium, Copper, L-tyrosine, etc. I was pleasantly surprised to find them all in one blend from a reputable supplier. I also try to support my adrenal glands, so supporting my thyroid is important since they work together in my endocrine system. I've had great results and increased energy, so I use it daily!
 I've been using this product for a while now, I've found that it really helps with my energy, and I even noticed that the area where my thyroid would be is a lot smaller, it honestly looked like I had an adams apple before I started taking thyroid supplements! It's also helped a bit with my acne, and overall it helps me feel so much better, I would recommend it in a heartbeat!
 Have had the best results taking this - sleeping better, energy levels are wonderful and overall feeling great! I've even been able to start exercising again and my body is responding well in recovery.
 By the end of the first month, I do believe I was feeling a bit better. That's why I'd like to continue on it, and give more of a detailed review.
 I didn’t notice ANY difference whatsoever, unfortunately. I was extremely hopeful this product would help me in conjunction with my Armour Thyroid.
 I have severe hypo thyroidism and Hashimoto's disease....I was feeling HORRIBLE!  Went to my doctors and you did put me on new medication and recommended Selenium.  After the appt went straight to Amazon to check out Selenium and came across Thyroid support.  After one week of taking the support along with coconut oil capsules,  I noticed a huge energy increase, more clarity , positive mood and smoother, clearer skin.  I am hoping it lasts and will continue making this a part of my daily regime.  Thank you!
 In box was code for free bottle. Put in all information did not work. Called company answering service answered let message but they did not answer my call
 So far I have not felt any difference on how I feel.....I really have high hopes and be able to tell you how great I feel after more time has passed....
 Made me super tired and didn't see a difference....
 So far so good. I've only felt a little difference so far but can certainly some difference.
 Just started, so I haven't noticed anything yet but read some really great reviews.  I hope it helps for me.  Vegetarian capsules so this is a plus...
 I have only used the first bottle so far and I like to continue with a product for a couple of months or more to be able to make a decision on its effectiveness. However, I do feel like I have more energy so far.
 I really haven't been able to tell any difference, and I have been taking it as directed.
 Just received this, so can't really say whether its helped me or not, but after reading all the other great reviews, am looking forward to trying it.
 Don’t know if it works or not.  Capsules are HUGE and very difficult to swallow.  They stuck in my esophagus for hours.  I emailed the company on their website to see if I could mix contents of capsule with applesauce or yogurt...never received a response.  Pills are TOO BIG!
 I actually waited until I ran of this product before writing a review.  After having been out for over a week, I again am feeling sluggish and out of sorts.  I hadn't realized until I stopped taking it how much better it made me feel.  I'm going to be ordering more.  TODAY.
 Only been taking these a couple days so i can speak on the results yet but I am happy to say I've had no issues with nasty taste or after taste like a lot of supplements.
 I have noticed a huge difference in my energy level and alertness. I have used supplements with Iodine before, but I think the combination in this product is more beneficial. I'm hooked!!
 I used to have horrible flaky skin all over my clothes and it's now gone! I also noticed a difference in my energy level and depression. Great product!!
 I have super energy and super focus when I take these.  I take two in the morning and I feel amazing all day.
 They smell a bit funny . So that’s why I haven’t finished taking them yet. I do not notice any improvements in my thyroid function . But I have noticed it makes me sweat more than usual when I play light sports .<br/><br/>Will not be buying again , not really sure what it’s supposed to do .
 I normally do not write reviews but thought it was important with this product. I have only been taking the supplement for a couple of weeks and I can already see a major change. I have an overactive thyroid and it causes major break outs along my chin and neck of cystic acne. The knots have already started to clear up! Not to mention the added energy! Major difference. It is defiantly a supplement worth taking if you are experiencing thyroid issues.
 So far so good. I don't feel as tired or bloated as I did 30 days ago. I can't wait to see how I feel in another 30 days.
 I was able to get up in the morning and go about my day while taking this supplement. Once I ran out, I noticed a decrease in energy so now I ordered more!
 I didn't really see much of an improvement using these thyroid supplements. In the beginning, there was a bit of change - I felt energized and woke up with more energy the next morning. But that faded about 1/4 way thru the bottle. Eventually, I think the effects reversed and I started gaining the 1 - 2lbs back (that I had lost initially when taking these pills).<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend taking supplements to correct thyroid issues. In fact, your first direction should be to change your life style and diet before looking at supplements / medication. I've changed my lifestyle and diet and I'm seeing significant results.
 I have not been using this product long enough to comment on its qualities but I was very happy to see that someone is addressing the fact that the doctor's subscription medication to treat thyroid issues is inadequite at best - I have high hopes for this product - shipping was fast ans excellent and the free additional product offer was exceptional!
 I noticed a difference in my energy level when I ran out of these and was not taking them for a couple of weeks. I reordered.
 Looking forward to feeling better soon - after reading other reviews, I'm looking forward to getting off prescription thyroid meds - soon!
 I have been taking this product for about a month and notice a difference<br/>in my energy level.  I take a prescription thyroid medication but found<br/>that I was still tired.  I find that now I do am much more energetic and able<br/>to get a lot more accomplished.  Very pleased with Thyroid Support.
 I have not started using this supplement yet, but I have hypothyroidism and a lot of the same symptoms as most other reviewers of this product. Hair loss, weight loss problems, cold body temperature, ridges on my fingernails, etc. I am hoping this product will help alleviate those symptoms and regulate my thyroid function. I will update in one month now that I have started taking the supplement.
 I don't usually leave reviews, but this product came so fast and I was also given a free bottle just as a 'Thank You' for trying the product.  From all the reviews I've read, this product looks very promising and I am so excited to start it tomorrow.  I will post again in a week and share my results.
 Started taking product but was told by Endocrinologist to stop taking
 After taking for several weeks, my hair is falling out less which is very good because I was literally going bald on top as a woman this is devastating.  My energy is the same, I do not feel a boost or anything, so I hope to try their adrenal support in the hopes of changing my energy levels.
 My dr wanted to put me on meds to get my levels back to normal but I swear by natural meds so he put me to the test and gave me a month to get my blood levels back to normal and this did the job.
 I couldn't tell a difference. Thank you.
 My thyroid tests always come back barely in the normal range and I have struggled with many symptoms of hypothyroidism for years. Now that I have entered menopause early at 43 I have felt more anxiety and depression, cloudy thinking, and lethargy and even through I try to diet and exercise I haven't been able to lose weight. Instead of going back to my doctor I decided to try supplements over medication. I did a lot of research and found this product to have the ingredients in the dosage I was liking for. I have quickly felt a difference in my anxiety and have been sleeping better and have more energy. Overall I feel more "balanced" and have not had any side effects and will continue to take and would recommend to anyone who has the same problems.
 Leaves me feeling weak, but I think it helps my daughter's hormone balance.
 Just received my first order of 1 Body Thyroid Support.  I read the reviews on Amazon about people who have tried the product and how much of a difference it made in how they felt.  I wanted to stay with a natural product and felt that this one was the one for me.  I am looking forward to writing a  complete review in a couple of months with very supportive results.
 I got this supplement for my mom. She's been using for couple of days and she says it's working. I am sure after couple of weeks she'll see the difference better. Since so many people recommended I feel like we made the right decision. Thanks!
 I love this product! I have been having issues with brain fog, fatigue, weight gain, and every box you can check in regards to low thyroid function. Within DAYS I had so much energy I couldn't stop smiling. I feel like I am me again. I feel great. Thank you for such a wonderful product!
 This seems like a quality product and has everything in it that I wanted. Very well packaged and quickly shipped.
 Did not have any positive - nor negative - effect.  I have been taking this supplement for over two weeks and I feel exactly as before.  Probably it is not the right product for me.
 works on fatigue
 Easy to swallow (I have problems swallowing pills).  Have not taken it long enough to know about results.
 Took pills religiously for over a month- into my second month now and have not noticed any difference in energy levels, and no weight loss. Has done nothing for me.
 I wanted this to work so bad but I tried this several times now and it makes e SICK!<br/>Feel light headed and nauseated<br/>both times I took the pills I felt like I was going to vomit. Bot times took several hours for feeling to go away
 Works great. I’m started to feel more energy after couple weeks of taking it.  I highly recommend.
 Did not work for me...more of a fluid pill than anything else...much care needed to not get dehydrated...
 It appears to be helping with my sleep, but I need more time to see if this is coincidental.
 I've been taking this for 2 weeks and have had terrible headaches and extreme irritability. After doing a little research, I found articles explaining this product could contain hormones and that the ingredients could actually cause harm to the thyroid. Considering my symptoms, I'd say that's highly likely.<br/>Other than a few hypothyroidism symptoms, I am healthy and do not take any other medications, and I rarely have headaches. I saw no change in energy or weight while taking this. Thankfully, when I ceased taking the supplements, my headaches went away.
 My energy level has tremendously improved since using this product now for 2 months.  I started seeing a difference after the 3rd week of using the Thyroid support.  I will highly recommend it!
 Half an hour after having only the first tablet, I started feeling a pain in the back of my head. After 1 hour I started vomiting and my head was exploding. My blood pressure drop. I have never had any allergy to a drug or food in the past. I thought I was dying it was the worst experience.<br/>This company literally sales toxin in the name of food supplements. They don’t have the slightest concern about human life. To escape the law, companies like this usually move to states where laws regarding government control and inspection over food supplement companies are lax. Nevada is one these states. That’s why almost all of companies like this reside in Nevada. So my advice to anyone who wants to buy food supplements would be to first find out where is the manufacturing company located, if it’s in Nevada, avoid it like you avoid the plague.
 Great product.  Already bought my second.  Have noticed a pick up in my attitude, energy level.  Plan to inform my doctor at my next physical to recheck thyroid values. I only take 1 tablet a day in the morning.
 my body doesn't feel as sluggish as it normally feels, I feel less tired and more enegentic!
 I have been experiencing an Increase in energy.  Since taking this supplement I've been losing weight and feeling great.  I wouldn't say that this is solely shedding the weight, but I believe with the increase in energy, I've been more active in the gym, thus losing more weight.
 I have been taking this for a month. I haven't seen much difference but am ordering it again to see if consistency will help.
 I've beeb taking thyroid support for 2 weeks now &amp; the swelling under my eyes jas gone down no headaches im sleeping all nite &amp; all so im not so tired. This is the best natural thyroid you or anyone can buy. ..Thanks L. Timmons.
 This made my thyroid levels normal after one month! WOW. That's all I can say!
 I feel much better since starting this product.  I have a clear mind and I have been able to lose a couple of pounds.  I am not as tired as before.
 I really couldn't tell a difference by taking this for a few weeks, so I won't be reordering.
 Just started using it - but it contains the supplements that should help my hypothyroidism.
 Really appreciate this item. I have borderline hypothyroid and new doctor does not want to continue medication I have been taking for over 20 years. This product has helped significantly with the sluggishness, fuzziness, and moodiness; as well as several other symptoms that are associated with issue. Felt a difference after first few days.
 I have been using this about two weeks. I am noticing huge differences in my energy and sleep already. I have tried several other brands, and by far this is my favorite.
 Every dose after that felt like nothing. I wish it would have continued to work.<br/>**Update 9/13/16<br/>Although I initially gave a 2 star rating because I was disappointed with the results that I got from this product, the company overall gets 5 stars. The company reached out to me and provided a full refund. That is what I call integrity and incredible customer service. this was extremely considerate of them because these types of products work differently for everyone and there is no guarantee that it will work any certain way. A+++++++ customer service.
 Going through menopause &amp; thought this helped the first bottle. Not so sure now
 I was really excited to try this product when I got some benefit from the Adrenal Support from the same company. However this product made me feel terible, tired and in a malaise. I am returning the product. I have super low energy but have never been diagnosed with a thyroid issue.
 I bought it for my mother who is hypothyroid, she has increased energy and feeling better
 This product is very inconsistent. The first time I ordered this product it worked very well. The next two times that I ordered this product it did not work well at all. The potency of this product changed.
 it's good but i feel there is a ton of iodine in here. ask your doc about this.
 I waited to finish the entire bottle and keep a weekly log of my symptoms before reviewing - the only thing that seemed to improve was my regularity. Nothing else changed. I was diagnosed with hypo years ago and was prescribed a medication that I took for about 5 years. I then decided to stop after my blood work came back normal for a year. Recently, I felt the symptoms again but was not able to get back on medication because my blood tests were normal. I decided to take the natural route and try these supplements.<br/><br/>I hate how big they are plus you have to take 2 a day. I already take a few pills so the addition of 2 big pills was a lot. I was happy to stop taking these after I finished the bottle. My nails seemed to get thinner as well. Again, only thing that improved was my regularity. I did switch to the Adrenal Support supplements (same brand) and am having great luck with it but the pills are still the same size :( If you don't notice a difference after taking these supplements, try switching over to the Adrenal Support ones.
 Too early to tell if it works as it has been a week and I see no difference but will give it a chance.
 came early.  Doesn't upset my stomach or anything...will see how it works
 Seems to be helping with my energy and I feel like I have more clarity with my thoughts.
 Definitely gave me more energy
 Haven't noticed any difference after taking this supplement. Will not reorder.
 So far so good... after 2 weeks I feel as though my thyroid levels are doing better. I will try to update after 6 weeks!
 Not sure if it works, but great customer service.
 My Naturopathic doctor recommended this product to me because I was showing early signs of hypothyroidism. Tt came in the mail quickly and I just started taking a few days ago it to avoid getting on pharmaceuticals later in my life.
 Great product! Felt better taking it than when I was on the prescribed medication.  Will buy again and again
 So far so good. I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism in May 2017. My Doctor prescribed Levothyroxine 25mg, the first 5 weeks I felt good, then I refill the medication, and I don't know if it was from a different Lab, but I felt terrible!! :( I felt like I was being poisoned. I had to look for an alternative. I found this product, and even though it was not the cheapest, I liked the reviews and ingredients made sense so I ordered. I stopped my medication a few days before this product arrived since it was making me sick anyway. Product got home on August 18th, 2017 and since I was taking a low dose on the medication, I started taking only one tablet of the Thyroid Support a day. By the end of the first 5 days, I started to feel more energy and more like myself. All days after that (I have been 9 days on the Supplement)  I noticed I was not that hungry, felt more alert and I was able to fall asleep at nights easily and will have a more restful sleep. My mind is more alert now. I have drop almost 4 pounds. My next medical check up for the Thyroid is in January 2018. I guess I'll follow up here how my levels were and if I can say I am free of medication for good.<br/>Now, I also received an  e-booklet from this company, as a bonus, that confused me a little bit: one section says to avoid all green leafy vegetables, but on the recipe section it says to add Kale, which falls in the category of green leafy vegetables (Goitrogens)...Hum! I guess a little isn't bad?  Also their theory about Alcohol, caught me by surprise. My mom, 3 cousins and 1 of my closest friends have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism years ago, NONE of them are alcohol drinkers ever! So I am not sure where they got the idea.. Anyway, the product seems to be working very well, I am thankful for that. Let's see how the Labs come out in January 2018. Thank you!!
 Product as described. Quick shipment.
 I will come back to review this as it has been a short time, but basing on the reviews hope to see better results
 I am definitely not as tired and am sleeping much better, however still waiting to see how it affects my hair and nails.
 I took one bottle and have not noticed any difference.
 So far it has helped some but I need to take more than 1 month of it to really tell.
 I've been using this product since December of 2014.  I've seen great improvement in my energy levels and mood stability.  I've also seen an improvement so my skin, hair and nails; they are now less dry and brittle.<br/>At first I thought I might be experiencing a placebo effect, but a decline in overall health and well-being was evident anytime I happened to run out of the supplement.  My doctor diagnosed me with a mild hypo-thyroid problem just a few months ago, and he is convinced that this supplement was a major benefit to helping me to feel better.  (The increase in symptoms when going off the supplement helped him in getting an over-all picture of my hypothyroidism).  When my doctor reviewed the ingredients he was impressed and suggested that I continue this product along with my thyroid medication.<br/><br/>I won't let my supply lapse again. Great product for a super price!
 Haven't used this very long but am really satisfied so far. Seems like a great company.
 I used to feel  fatigued and depressed throughout the day. I have hypothyroidism and refuse to take the typical prescribed medications due to the side effects. I started taking this thyroid support, in addition to becoming more physically active and eating better, and I noticed a significant difference in my mood and energy levels.
 I absolutely love this product. I have suffered from thyroid symptoms for a couple of years now and just felt terrible. Since I've started taking this product my life has changed completely. I feel so much better, have more energy and have been able to start losing some of the weight that has piled on since my thyroid problems began.
 Although not a wonder pill lol still a difference in how I feel. I am hoping the difference will continue and improve as I have only been taking it 2 weeks. And if you have a thyroid condition you know how tired and wore out you feel. This did help my energy, even the "bloat" and fog feeling. Worth it for me.
 Very excited to start this product, I'm impressed with the level of support they offer their clients. Shortly after purchase I received an excellent supplemental document detailing lifestyle changes I could make to support my thyroid health. Seems like they've given me all the tools to support my thyroid health.
 I was allergic to this product. I love the customer support who checked in on me, but overall it did not last in my system.
 These made me so sick! I thought I had the stomach flu. Stopped taking them and I felt fine. Tried one more time just to make sure. Thought my stomach was going to explode.
 I've only taken for about 3 weeks , so it's hard to write a review right now.  Will review again after approx two months.
 more energy and light headedness going away
 These smell and taste pretty terrible, but they did help with my mood and energy a little.
 Initially I felt a little more energized however it may have just been in my head. After 2 weeks I had gained 4 pounds and my skin had broken out. Very disappointed because I had high hopes for this product
 Don't buy! Often times we are told to take supp. like these to help, it doesn't. I lost hope and cracked under pressure to buy these and regret it.
 I am on thyroid medication since I was very young. It didn't seem to help a lot with daily fatigue. Thyroid support is helping me with my energy levels. My nails are stronger and I feel better overall.
 I am looking forward to seeing positive results from these supplements. I have been taking thyroid medicine for 20 years and if these supplements can give me what they say they can I will be happy! This is my first day taking so crossing my fingers!! I'm giving 3 stars for quick delivery, packaging and easy to swallow capsule.
 I just recently was told I had low Thyroid. I didn't want to go the pharm route and wanted to try natural. It's too early to tell. So far so good.
 it did nothing for me! sorry I wasted my money
 Love these makes me feel great and have lots of energy through my busy days and no jitters ❤️
 I don't really notice a difference taking this supplement.<br/><br/>I used to take Ioderal which is an iodine/iodide supplement for my hyperthyroid condition.<br/><br/>I have trouble loosing weight and can gain weight easily though I eat well, not perfectly, but very well including GF and dairy free almost exclusively.
 Made me feel sick to my stomach, but the return was free.
 I have tried this for a few months.  I notice a difference and will keep using this product
 Great product, highly recommend to anyone looking for a thyroid supplement. Bravo!
 I have only been taking this product for a little over a week.  I know my thyroid needs a push, and I am hoping this product will do the trick.  I will update with my results when I have been taking it longer.  I have no complaints so far.
 After my thyroid surgery I needed something to help support my system.  Blood work has come back good!
 Its had been 15 daya taking this product and I do really feel less tired!
 I am excited to try. Thousands of reviews say it works. I am taking thyroid meds and have for a long time but like so many I still struggle with symptoms that just won't go away and weight I can't get rid of. Praying that this works.
 I love this product!  I started taking this product a month ago and I feel so much better!  My hair is healthier, the brain fog is clearer, and I have more energy.  I also lost 5 lbs since I started a month ago.  I love it and will continue to take it.
 Did nothing! I will not be buying this again. Infact, I will not be even using the coupon for a free bottle that came with this order.
 Great product, really works.
 I have been taking these for almost a month, and haven't noticed any change so far. They don't seem to help my slow metabolism, which was solely the reason I bought this product in the first place.
 I'm usually too lazy to leave reviews but this product has dropped my TSH level from 2.5 to 1.48 in 4 weeks. I'm impressed.
 A very good product. I feel much better. Thank you for unexpected gift ,by the way ,,to "1 Body".
 Still early days but I think I've got more energy since I've been taking thyroid support. I'm going to persevere and buy another bottle.
 I do not have a thyroid gland anymore. I am on medication but without certain vitamins and minerals, it can put you in adrenal fatigue. This supplement helps me with just that. I have noticed a change for the better in just one month so I am going to stay on it.
 Did not have a huge difference, which was sad. I was ever hopeful....
 I don't feel worse.
 I already feel a boost in general energy, mood, and thought process.  Though these supplements vary by producer and ingredients, I find the best plan is to try them, see if you like them, and if you do, buy it again; if not, try a different product.  This is a great one so far, I must say.
 Although  haven't tried it yet, it seems like a great product. Can't wait to see how much it helps.
 works good
 I feel more energetic. My metabolism isn't so slow anymore. I'm having less hair loss.
 I just started taking it, so cant attest to results yet.  Product was delivered promptly, nice packaging, like the ingredients.  Will update as I find out how it works!
 I'm looking forward to seeing how this product works.  I will update once I have used it for a month.  It contains many of the ingredients that the thyroid needs so I'm hoping that it makes a difference.
 I have only been taking this supplement for a few days and have noticed a huge change in the way I feel.
 I just received the product, but am looking forward to seeing how well it works to alleviate hypothyroid symptoms.  If the product lives up to it's claims, I'll be a very happy camper!
 I stopped taking these thinking my vitamin would be sufficient for giving me energy.  Not so...  I just started taking them again, and can't wait to get all the energy again.
 I've read reviews on this product and I'm excited to get started. The reason for a 5 star review is they're sending me a free bottle. Once I'm taking this for a couple months I will submit another review. Cheers.
 I've been only using this product for about 4 days now. Decided to buy due to excellent reviews. I was feeling tired throughout the day especially after 3 pm or after a afternoon nap,  cold hands and feet, retaining water (just mild), hair falling out.<br/>Maybe is too soon to say that how I'm feeling right now is due to this supplement but i feel less tired. Before I could feel struggling to get a few things done now I feel with more energy after waking up, and in the afternoon maybe like normal person with mild sleep deprivation and been able to wake up without any much trouble (not the case before). Feel more motivated to do exercise now too.<br/>I'll keep using it and in any case i'll update the review<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Took a bottle for a month and I can't say it did much for any of my complaints. At first I started feeling with more energy but after a couple of days maybe a week, I was on baseline again. Finished the bottle(30 days supply) about two weeks ago and it feel the same as I felt after 1 week of taking the supplements. So I won't buy again. Didn't hurt but didn't work too much either. (At first my review has 4 stars and now I took 2 off)<br/>Sorry, this was my experience, doesn't mean that it will be the same for anyone
 So far ok. Will see what blood work says.

 I've only been taking this a few days so far and have a little more energy already! My doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and my synthroid actually makes me feel worse. I am really hoping this helps for the long term and am looking forward to much happier and healthier days ahead.
 Decided to try due to mild hypo... Horrible experience after one dosage panic and anxiety at nightime, wasted night. Will not try again.
 Have Hashimoto Thyroiditus. Just started today hoping my levels will test clearly and help with symptoms. Will make a future evaluation.
 I took this product only a couple of times and each time it made my stomach upset and my pulse become erratic.  I won't be taking it again.
 Received today the thyroid support, has good presentation , and I took the first pill ! I decided to comparlo it is based on natural products. I hope soon to have results as good as I've read from other users who already have longer using this medicine.
 Was prescribed to me by a respected doctor, a family practitioner, and a close friend. I have a border line case of hypo-thyroidism. So, I have high hopes from this product.
 Helps me. I am not as tired throughout the day as I used to be. Also my hands and feet are no longer cold to the touch. Give it at least a month to assess how it works for you.
 I have been taking this supplement for two months and really feel like it is helping me feel like my old self.
 Just received my order of Thyroid Support bottle and it is too early to say anything about the product. I will come back to review how it works after finishing the first bottle.
 Good supplement for those with minor thyroid problems. Helps to boost energy and feel more normal.
 It upset my stomach, so I was unable to keep taking it to get the full benefits.
 I ordered the Thyroid, Adrenal and Liver Support products from 1 Body and have been taking all three for two weeks.  My energy level has definitely perked up and I'm getting good sleep again!  Will continue taking and order again!
 I just received my first bottle and haven't started taking it yet. Based on others' high reviews, I'm hoping this will be what I need to help with a sluggish thyroid. I'll check back in after I start seeing results.
 I felt very unwell and the use of the Thyroid Support helped to improve my disposition and I'm very happy with it.
 Great product.  Really helps.
 No good for anything. No results. Very dissatisfied. Would love to have my money back.
 Increased hot flashes
 So far so good but still in early stages of taking supplement but stay tuned
 I've had a good impression from the staff.  Hoping the product does as good as the people reviewing it have said.  I'm hopeful.
 This medicine cost me lost time at work and medical tests.. I kept getting extreme nausea and stomach pain.. finally figured it out.. must not be able to tolerate the iodine.. 🤮🤢🤑
 Today's my first day and I can't wait to see how it goes!
 After taking this 2 weeks, I have tons of energy and feel more focused. Love this product. Deffentily will buy again..
 I just received thyroid support today so I don't have any real feedback regarding the product itself. I bought the produce given the reviews and am hoping that it will be effective. I will review after taking it for a month to see if it works
 Was skeptical but works great! I'm on my third bottle and I can tell if I don't take it. I have more energy and feel better.
 I am now on my second day.  Really too early to tell; however my energy level seems much higher,
 I feel like I have more energy during the day. I have less hair come out during my showers. My mood seems to be leveling out as well.
 I have been taking this for a few weeks now and have not noticed a difference.  Based on the other reviews though, I am hopeful.
 I just received it a couple of days ago so I really can't say if it's helping or not.  I bought it after reading prior reviews and I hope to get similar results.
 👍🏻
 these pills gave me a bad stomach!  did not help in any way - threw them out after reading some of the negative reviews.  i'm starting to realize that when there are "thousands" of positive reviews on amazon, they are most likely fake!
 Significantly helped my wife's hypothyroid issues following thyroidectomy surgery. Symptoms of hot/cold, mood swings, muscle cramping decreased significantly. Will definitely stay on as a supplement to her Synthroid.
 I have only just begun taking Thyroid Support, thus the 4 stars.  Hoping the product is as good as 1 Body seems to be, so I can change it to 5 stars!  This company is generous in offering a free bottle!
 Just started but has everything I have been looking for and at a decent price.
 Really good product. I've been trying different thyroid suppliments to find one that's best for me and out of the six I've tried first one I actually liked!
 I purchased this products person based on personal research and consumer recommendations.  Looking forward to the results of this product in conjuction with a healthy diet.
 Very good so far. Looks like it contains everything I need.
 I've just now received this product for the first time, but I'm hopeful that it will assist with symptoms of Hypothyroidism. Will update this review after I've tried it for a few weeks.
 Looking forward to experience the benefits
 I've notice a change in energy and I'm sleeping better. I haven't notice any weight change, but I am maintaining my weight and have the energy to exercise.
 I unfortunately have not felt any of the benefits as described by the manufacturer or by the reviewers.  No issues with the quality packaging, delivery, etc.  It just isn't for me - I will not be re-ordering..
 I just ordered this product because after researching, it looked like the best combination of vitamins for thyroid issues. I just started it and I love the look so far. Will write again with how it works!
 I received my bottle about 2 weeks ago I feel better taking it.so didn't feel any different the first few days.I will continue to take it.
 This product is helping to give me energy and I seem to feel more full and eat less when I am using it.
 I didn't feel any different!
 I can't really tell if this is working yet.  I'm almost done with my first bottle.  But based on the great reviews this product has I will be ordering again.
 I couldn't take it.. it gave me horrible abdominal pain!
 I started taking this about 1 month ago and already feel better.  I have more energy and actually started losing weight.  I tried another brand but it did not work as well.
 Happy with this product so far! I can tell a difference. Definitely makes me feel a little more energetic.
 I have not taken the product long enough to give it a review but I am very pleased with the ease of ordering and the friendliness of the 1 Body Company.
 I can't say it's changed my life, but I do think it's helped with the general fatigue, and regulating my metabolism a little bit as well.
 I definitely feel more energy since taking this the past few weeks.
 stomach pain, insomnia, and weight gain.  threw the rest of the bottle away
 I just received I haven't tried it yet. I giving 5 stars because It gives you  a free identical product for your purchase. I will give a most accurate review again once I've tried it.
 Made me very nausea, even after I took it will food.
 I've been taking it for a month now and not sure of any changes. Will continue for a few months and give it some time.
 its been a good product. Sure helps with energy and brain fog..And I don't seem to get daily headaches anymore. Will continue to use
 I wish I could say that this worked for me like all the raving reviews but it did not. I have Hashimoto's and my hair loss was already slow rising issue, but as soon as I took this product strands of hair was falling out left and right.<br/><br/>A little back story: I bought this product twice. I finished 1 bottle a few months ago and at the time I had paired it with my Synthroid medicine which I had been taking for a few months. I noticed a lot of hair loss and boiled it down to being my Synthroid medicine.<br/><br/>Now that I'm off synthroid and wasn't on these pills my hair loss slowed down for a few months. Then I decided I would try these again by themselves without any thyroid medication and my hair started falling out again and my face started getting puffy and retaining water. I did notice that my energy levels were much better but the hair loss and water retention is a no go.
 I am trying to take care of my Thyroid naturally.<br/>I have been taking this for less than a month and can feel my system changing. Just ordered a second bottle.
 It is hard to say how much if any this supplement works.  I do have somewhat more energy.  It has all the required ingredients so it should be good.
 I just started taking this product, but I've heard good things about it.
 seems to work fine.
 Just diagnosed with Hashimoto's, hoping it will help with subclinical symptoms.
 Used this for a month so far. Noticed a loss of energy after I ran out. I had a balanced energy while using
 Very good product. I did purchase this and after a couple weeks of taking the thyroid support, I felt more energetic in the morning and throughout the day. I do recommend buying this.
 Haven't tried it for long enough to say for sure that it has helped me with my hypothyroid symptoms but subjectively I have noticed an improvement in my energy level since taking it for 4 days now.
 I just starting talking this supplement, but after reading all the positive reviews, I figured how could I possibly go wrong.  I will update soon on my actual results.
 Unfortunately it did not work for me. Gave me headaches on a daily basis. I'm not saying it won't work for others it was just not for me. Shipping was prompt.
 As soon as I try the product I will come back in 1 month and give an update.<br/>Just received my first bottle and with all the previous reviews, I am looking forward to some positive results.
 Just started on this product so I'm not sure yet.  Not the greatest flavor but manageable.  I do feel more "alive" than before taking it.
 Love it.  been taking it for approximately a year....It really helps and gives me energy to work out.
 I ordered this as someone who likes this product recommended it. I am yet to try it. I will give the product the benefit of the doubt as far as star ratings, but will return with an update.
 I read a lot of reviews and this product seems to be the best!<br/>I just received this in the mail and can't wait to start!!
 Thyrocontrol better product
 Love the product and the great customer service!
 i cannot leave a complete review just yet as i have only been taking the supplement for three days. I will leave a better review after the first 30 days.
 So far so good. I want to wait until I've been doing it for 30 days or more before I really decide.
 Haven't been able to tell if it's made any difference yet but I've only been using this product for a month.  Plan to continue it's use for longer to see if I see any improvement.
 I dont really know how i feel with it yet. I have to use it for a longer period to really get a good sense.
 Haven't taken it long enough to know if it's working but my nutritionist said it has good ingredients in it.
 I am giving 3 stars as I am not sure if I notice any difference yet.  I am trying another bottle and will update with my thoughts at that time.
 Great product!
 I have taken one bottle of this so far. I haven't really noticed any changes. Feel the same. Started second bottle today. Will update if I notice any changes.<br/>Update: After I completed the second bottle of this supplement I thought I would review. Sadly for me there was no change. Hair falling out more now than before. Feeling the same if not worse than before. May work for some but not for me.
 I've only taken it for about 2-3 weeks.  I haven't noticed a change yet, too early to tell I suppose.
 Increased energy. Improved focus and mental clarity. Great buy!
 Most amazing service I am astonished at this product, I have taken thyroid med for several years nothing has worked like this, this is the best I have taken hands down.
 Haven't used it enough days, but it sounds like a good product.
 I only took it for one month along with the adrenal support but would definately purchase again.
 That's what I am looking for.<br/>Very briefly tell (the doctors failed to diagnose cases of this product and succeeded)<br/>Thanks alot...
 Did not work for me. Will not purchase again.
 So far so good.
 This product is great so far after only taking for a few days. My insomnia has gone extinct and I sleep like I'm laying on lavender clouds. My anxiety is reducing right before my eyes and I'm fighting less with family. And I do feel stronger in my workouts and can go longer as well. Mind you, I've only been taking this for 4 days. Awesome supplement!!
 Amazing product!  I feel more alert and am actually sleeping better with Thyroid Support... no, woops...I meant with Ambien. I would highly recommend.
 I haven't been back to the DR since i started on it. It will be another month before I have a check on it. i have started to lose a little weight
 I haven't started the thyroid support yet, but am optimistic after reading all the other reviews.
 Just started taking this supplement. I've heard great things about it. I'm confident that it will make me feel better. I will submit another review in a month.
 this didnt work for me at all.  threw my thyroid way out of wack.  be careful with taking supplements as such and discuss with your endocrinologist.  if you are seeking to go more natural vs the synthetic pill.  they have natural options... possible they will help with all sort of problems related to hypothyroid.  weight loss, fatigue...hair loss, moody, sleep loss etc etc
 More energy ssince taking these supplements! Will continue.
 I've only been taking for 2 weeks but I can feel my energy improving.
 It seems to help.
 Have been using it for about 2 weeks.  Ordered it to help supplement my thyroid medication that I take and hopefully replace it one day.
 The product shipped quickly and now I am taking them.  Will wait and see if they are helping to boost the thyroid function.
 I am still early stage, but it definitely makes a difference
 I bought this thyroid supplement hoping it would help with the fatigue, mood swings and weight gain I have experienced with a hormonal imbalance.<br/>About 30mins after I took the first capsule I started feeling dizzy and as if all my blood went straight into my face. I never get headaches and this was a seriously bad one. It also made me even moodier. I lowered the dose after a few days to one pill and then after about a week had to stop taking it altogether. I would NOT recommend this product... I'm not sure how this happened or what ingredient really threw me off. I also tried to request a refund, but the instructions were extremely confusing.<br/>I am certain that it had nothing to do with what I ate, since I lead an entirely gluten/dairy free diet. I had high hopes for this one.
 Gray buy
 I LOVE this product. Within the first couple days I could already tell a difference in my mood. My appetite has also change. So far I've lost 10 pounds. I use to be on medication through my doctor for my thyroid but this is so much better. I feel so much more energetic.
 Just received product, chosen because of good reviews.  Hoping this is the answer to to feeling better. .
 Just started taking supplement, but with a background in medicine, this product has everything you need in one capsule!
 I think this is pretty good stuff.  I've tried it for 30 days and feel better.  I'm going to try it another 30 days and see what happens.
 I have not been taking long enough to tell a significant difference, but I am willing to keep on trying. I will
 only been a few weeks, but it seems to be working.
 Got this for my wife to try.  She hasn't started it yet, but we are hopeful this will help. Read some good reviews on it, so we'll see....
 I tried this product based on other reviews . I really feel a difference after a few weeks . I have most energy now than ever before.
 Amazing product.  Works great for anyone who has thyroid issues
 I have been taking this product for over a month now. I can tell a difference with using the product.
 Great product, pills are a little to big for me to swallow so I'm.having a rough time. But great customer service
 I have more energy and have lost the brain fog. I am very satisfied with this product.
 I don't understand all these great reviews.  These supplements did absolutely nothing for me except give me chronic diarrhea and cramps.<br/>I wasn't sure what was causing this, but Stopped taking it yesterday after 3 weeks and my stomach cramps and diarrhea simply disappeared.<br/>Should have returned it while I was able to.
 Only been using it for a month, too early to tell if it is helping with my hair loss due to my hypothyroidism
 Good product, arrived ad expected. Thanks.
 excellent
 I purchased two bottles, one for my husband and one for me. I have hypothyroidism and was diagnosed six years ago and have to take prescribed medication for this condition everyday. I have to admit, after taking the prescription, I felt a lot better than before my diagnosis, but somehow, I just didn't feel quite right yet. I never had energy and some days, I would just drag through the day as if I never even took my medication to begin with. As for my husband, he's in his mid 50's and sleeps whenever he gets a chance. He could sleep the day away, thank goodness he has a reason to get up for work. He has complained of constant distractions at work, forgetfulness, and very low energy.<br/><br/>Our first week of taking this supplement, has proven to both of us that it is what we needed. My husband actually bounces out of bed in the mornings now. He has said he is more clear headed and has more energy to work in the hot Arizona sun. I can tell his overall mood has changed and he appears much happier and content. He has stated he has lost a couple of pounds and wasn't even trying. It's easy for me to see his changes, and honestly, I really see the changes for the better. I don't think I've ever heard my husband say that he felt great in the mornings because he had a good rest, until now. As for me, I have an overall feeling of well being. I do not feel the achy drag that I had felt before even when I took my medication. My digestive system seems to be working differently, but for the better. I am finding I am waking up quite rested myself and I look forward to the day ahead. If I can feel better by not always wanting to just go back to bed and rest, I am sold on this product. If you can honestly say that you feel like you're dying inside, this supplement will help you to find the betterment you're looking for. I am much happier now knowing I can feel great again.
 More energy, feel better in general, hoping it will help with weight loss eventually.
 I have been taken this thyroid support for a month and it seems to work well for me.
 Have not yet tried the product though from other reviews, it looks promising. Will write back when I have!
 My wife and I have both been using this product for almost 2 weeks since 8/20/2016.  We noticed an immediate effect the first day we used the product. We both had a strong metallic taste, but that stopped after the first week of use.  But it seems to be not making much of a noticeable difference at this time.  We have decided to continue with the product in the hope that the additional iodine supplementation will have a cumulative positive effect overall on our health.  The primary difference we have noticed is a slight ability to focus better on mental tasks at work when needed.  It could be a placebo effect.  We were both hoping for additional energy as others have reviewed but unfortunately neither of us have experienced any significant change overall.  I will be updating this review in the upcoming month.
 I just recently stepped back &amp; took a good look at how I was feeling, health wise. I realized that despite taking levothyroxine for years, I still had practically every symptom of low thyroid. My test results are in the "normal" range, but I feel like crap most of the time: no energy, great difficulty losing weight gained, water retention, constipation, and so on. I just received my Thyroid Support capsules today and am very hopeful that -with all the positive reviews - I will feel more energetic and just generally more healthy soon. I will update this review in about a month to report back.
 great customer sevice.  Great ingredients that help with thyroid.<br/>Thanks
 I've found that the thyroid support supplement really helped!
 I have not tried yet but judging by the reviews I believe this product will be great!
 Seems to help
 I'm not sure if it is working on me yet.  I'm going to try another bottle and see.
 Made me horribly sick. Not at all what I was expecting. I had to go to my doctor on an emergency visit because this supplement.
 Upset my stomach on first try. Company was great by returning my money. So, I feel comfortable in telling you to go ahead and try it. Since the company seems to stand behind its product.
 I've tried it for a few days now, it seems like it's worth it. Too early to be sure though.
 Just started taking it after reading the positive reviews I hope it helps me
 Just started taking it. I purchased because of all the great reviews. I'll let you know how I like it.
 I just started taking this product so I don't know if it works yet, but I've read really good reviews.
 I just received it but the reviews prompted me to try it
 I have only taken this for one day but already see a difference in my energy level.
 It's been three weeks since I started using this product. I had hoped to experience an increase in energy and maybe lose a few pounds, especially when combining this product with a sensible diet and exercise. I suspect three weeks is not sufficiently long enough to observe results and will continue to take the product for a few more weeks. However, as of this writing, I am not impressed.
 It's great never been better
 Did not seem to make any difference in my Fibromylagia as I hoped....the taste of the pill was terrible - had to swallow it with milk as quickly as possible.
 I just recently started and will need more time to accurately determine it's effectiveness.
 Fast shipping, good product, and will continue taking. Will update later...
 Did not work and made me sick to the stomach
 Just started taking them but I can tell already they've helped my energy levels out a lot.
 didn't seem to notice a difference
 I did get the second bottle free which was nice but I could only use my thyroid support for a few days because it gave me big bumps on my skin,definitely broke me out.
 Best Thyroid Support Supplement on the market!
 I enjoyed taking taking Thyroid Support supplement.
 could not take. sorry.
 The smell was to much for me
 I️ love this product more energy
 It has enhanced my mood. I feel more energized and focused.
 Just received so cannot judge it.Sounds like a very good formula, however.
 I usually do not give bad reviews ,and I was not unhappy with product but really did nothing for me at all unfortunately
 Improvement on my chronic fatigue related to thyroid disease.
 I just received my product and will start this week.
 This has Iodine in it, a big no-no for true thyroid disease sufferers. The company did refund me, no questions asked, so I give them props, however read the labels!
 Works great
 I have the energy but not the focus.
 Great product for an old goat like me.
 Excellent, so far.
 I am leaving this review because of the offer in the box that came to get a free bottle for doing nothing (I was delighted!!!.....).  Then I came to screen to leave a review.  I haven't even started taking the first bottle yet - but I'm leaving this review to get the extra free bottle.  That's shy I'm giving it 3 stars --- because I really don't know if it works yet.  Wish they had better defined "free" from the get-go; instead of hitting me with this 'requirement' at the end after I filled out 3 other screens.  At this point I'm a little pissed but like I said, the extra bottle won't cost me anything but this time.  If I do indeed like it I'll log back in and up the stars rating  --- or do a nice follow-up review.  We shall see folks.
 Wish I could give it 0 stars, its a joker its only some type of orange powder filler,  don't trust the reviews.
 Great products
 Very Good product.
 I am not sure if it is due to the product, but I lost 5 Lbs after taking it. So will see if I lose additional 5 Lbs with a new bottle.
 Just started today.
 Unfortunately these did not work for me.  I quit taking them after 3 weeks because for some strange reason my hot flashes came back in full force shortly after I started this product.  I didn't put it together for awhile but as soon as I quit taking, the hot flashes stopped.
 👍🏻
 Am in the process of trying this product.  I think I am going to like it!
 Unable to use it because the package arrived totally broken!!!
 I am truly amazed!  I've been taking for just one week and feel 1000% better.  Its been so long since I felt like my old self.  Thank you for this product--I am planning to buy over and over.<br/><br/>Also, wanted to add that I haven't slept so well in years, my mood is light and happy again and I'm not craving carbs all the time.
 I have recently ordered this product before I left my country to vacation in the USA and it was already waiting for me when I arrived. Everything was in good condition.<br/><br/>I am always looking for the best health supplement. This product was rated as the bestseller, and I looked at the reviews. Based on that I decided to give this brand a try. I have used thyroid support before, but a different brand. I just opened my bottle today to try it for the first time. I also liked the fact that it came with a bonus hypothyroidism diet pdf.
 I haven't really noticed too much of a difference with this.  I am only taking it once a day though.
 3 stars only because I have no idea if it works or not. Yes, I am hypothyroid and take levothyroxine. Sorry, its the best review I can offer
 Each time I've taken one of these I've gotten a terrible headache along with feeling nauseous. I'm sweating &amp; feeling awful as I'm typing this. Hoping chugging some water &amp; eating more will help. Bummer, all the good reviews had me hopeful.
 I discontinued use of this product after carefully determining it caused me to have diarrhea.
 I can't say whether this is a good product because I have not taken it. I did bring it to my endocrinologist and he said that I must not take it, because it would actually make my thyroid more sluggish, because of the iodine content.
 just received my bottle, hoping it does all that other reviews from people say it does. will right another review after being on it for 2 months to see if it does truly work .
 Didnot see any dfference.  Although I have a Hypothyroid and my medication has helped my levels to be normal I was hoping that this would help with  being sleepy but no effect.  I am going to try something different.  Waste of money for me.  Also when i received it, it smelled like it came from an environment that someone smoked alot!  Yuck!
 I returned it after using it for 2 weeks. Never experienced any positive results
 I noticed the very first day I started now day as of 3/31/16 and very well please. My neck had started a goiter and as I swallow I could feel it. I have only half and I am all natural. I know my body and I do a little of research and study...Thank you Jesus I feel so much better. Next purchase adrenal support, liver detox...
 Did nothing for me at all what a waste of my money very upset 😡
 I have been suffering with hypothyroidism for a few years now and my prescription medications just hasn't been doing enough.  After reading all the good reviews for this product I thought I would give it a try. Hopefully after taking thyroid support I will start to gain energy and lose this excess weight this condition has caused.
 Just received the item and I am very excited to try it. I bought this to see if it would help my being so tired all the time plus helping my thyroid. I bought this of all the good reviews. I will list more comments once I know how this products works.
 I only  started taking this product 3 days ago so it is a bit early to itell if it is beneficial.  I ordered it  because I am hoping to boost my metabolism.  I will give it a 3 star rating because I don't know enough about it yet.
 Mild depression,  extreme sleepiness and palpitations. Wasn't for me.
 I have not taken the product long enough. Will write another review in a month.
 just started using this product. not sure if it works yet. hope it does!
 Yea ... Does nothing.
 One word: PLACEBO!<br/>Also these smell and their pill casing has a strong fishy scent and taste/aftertaste. Do not bother!
 Hazardous!  I tried to find a word to explain the effects this drug/supplement has on my body and this is what I came up with.  I have taken a thyroid supplement for many many years and have always felt a fatigue that bordered on lethargy.  Almost none of the doctors that I went to even paid attention to this complaint.  I’m sure they thought it was insignificant, but to me not having the energy or stamina to even want to take care of daily chores was daunting.  I know this is true for many people who have hypothyroid problems.  As a result I’ve tried almost every known “energy” and “thyroid supplement” I could find that had decent reviews.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I’m pretty naive and didn’t realize that companies hired people to write positive reviews about their products so that they can sell more and increase their profits.  So believing some of these reviews, since there were so many positive ones, about the 1 Body Thyroid Support, I purchased a bottle and hoped that I could stop the prescription thyroid medicine that I have been taking.  Of course they want you to write a review immediately before having had time for the supplement to really take affect, so I waited.  The following is what my experience was:<br/><br/>I started out by stopping my thyroid prescription medicine and replaced it with the two caps per day (1 morning, 1 evening) as prescribed.  The next day I had a mildly severe headache across the base of my skull in the back and also on the sides just behind the ears and towards the top of my head.  Thinking it might be related to my sinus congestion, I continued to take the caps for the next day.  The headache remained.  This is not a normal headache and I was concerned.  So, I decided to take one cap per day.  This was somewhat ok, but I still had headaches but not quite so severe.  I then decided to take 1 thyroid prescription pill in the evening and the thyroid supplement in the morning.  Still headaches but still not quite so severe as two caps per day.<br/><br/>Yesterday I reached into a lower kitchen cabinet to pull out several disposable aluminum baking pans and had such a pain in my shoulder that I could not even take hold of the pans.  I tried with the other hand and had the sale effect in the other shoulder.  I was immediately reminded of a number of years back when I had a problem with hormonal imbalance that left both shoulder joints permanently damaged even after months of physical therapy.  I never recovered full range of motion and the shoulder joints are a bit knobby from the associated problems.  I have stopped taking the thyroid supplement all together and highly recommend that no one else take it.  I believe that it would cause me either a stroke or damaged joints if I continued it any longer.  I have returned to the prescription medication, taking one in the evening as I understand many things that we eat or drink early in the morning interfere with absorption.<br/><br/>I truly feel that this is a dangerous supplement to take and caution each and every one of you to be extremely careful if you decide to take it.  The positive reviews all proclaimed more energy, overall feeling of well-being, and as a side effect of having more energy some weight loss.  I just wanted to feel better so that I could function better daily.<br/><br/>The thyroid gland is sort of the master regulator for almost every bodily function that we have so please please be careful what you take and be very aware of negative effects that you have when taking this that are not a normal feeling that you have every day.  If you have any of these effects please stop taking it immediately so that you will not have any severe adverse effects.<br/><br/>This is my personal experience and opinion only.  As a result of this, I have thrown away all supplements that I have in my house with the exception of a multi-vitamin and three other supplements that I use for specific problems occasionally and will never try another.  I feel after all of these years and my experience with this supplement that they are just too dangerous.  Take care my friends.  You only have one body to carry you through life.
 I didn't see much of a change. Been using for  2 weeks. I am sure it works for others. I have had a total thyroidectomy about 6 years ago.
 I love this supplement. It really seems to be making a difference.
 This seems to help and works good for me
 I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto Hypothyroidism. This is hard to rate as I just ordered and received this product in the mail.  I have a scheduled endocrinologist appointment but it is not to July. I am hoping this product will provide me some relief until I can get into the specialists.
 It's only been two weeks since I started taking this supplement and I can already tell the difference.  My metabolism has begun to speed up a little and my sleep patterns have changed.  I have more energy and i love it.  Thank you.
 Constant headaches, mild depression, anxiety and palpitations. I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster. Buyer beware!
 I've felt good
 Great product, would recommend to anyone.
 It might have raised my body temperature to 97 from 96.8, or maybe the 99 degree temperature outside did it.  I'll give it some more time to see if it continues to increase my temperature or if the outside temperature is causing it.
 Did not notice a difference
 Seems to be helping my gi and energy level
 Didn't work for me
 Great
 I just received this product.  It came quickly with Prime, great packaging.  I will update once I have taken it for a few weeks!  Hoping this helps with my hypothyroid symptoms!  Purchased based on other reviews of what a great product it is.  I will follow up!
 Have been using it for few months and I like it better than the couple of other supplements I have tried. My main reason for getting a supplement because my current prescription does not help with Thyroid symptoms like fatigue even though my lab works comes back normal. Since I have taken this there has been a noticeable change in my energy levels.
 Just started last night. Will update later.
 Did not help at all.
 We just started this and are very hopeful. I bought one because I suffer from a number of health issues and also for my wife who has been dealing with thyroid issues for a few years now. Based on the nutrients, it looks as if this product will be beneficial.
 Extremely happy with this product from 1 Body!
 It is not doing anything
 Great product in addition to my thyroid meds
 So far it works very well
 Awesome
 Didn't work for me
 Great product.  Fast shipping.
 No difference at all
 Just received today,  but very excited to start using.
 Didn't work for me.
 Great product! It works!
 I feel good again!
 Rough in my stomic. After took it I had headache and dizzy all times
 I haven't lost weight in the 1.5 months of taking it but hoping over time it helps.
 As Promised
 No improvements noticed.
 This is an outstanding product for the prevention of cancer forming cells due to the amount of iodine contained in each capsule.
 Excellent product!!
 This didn't make a difference for me. I've tried quite a few different ones that were slightly different combinations of ingredients and none of them have worked.<br/><br/>Now, what has worked for me is BestMade's Hypothyroid Remedy. I've been getting into cell salts lately and I can say that after taking this for about a 45 days, it's still helping me. Check it out!
 Great product! Great company!
 my friends love it .so I hope the will be good for me to
 honestly noticed no difference
 Love this product!!!
 I love it
 This is an awesome product.
 Has all the key supplements for a healthy thyroid
 Ive been taking this for awhile now, awesome product.
 EXCELENT  PRODUCT.
 So far so good! Stopped gained weight and have energy!!
 Been using since a week and started seeing results already
 I haven't try it yet but like all the reviews I have read about this product.
 just started..so far so good......
 Looking forward to trying this product.
 Works for me
 Seems to be working great!
 Love that it has all the supplements suggested for thyroid support.
 I definitely have more energy
 I'm excited to try this.  Rating it a 3 because I have taken one dose.  I am trying this product because I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, having been taking Synthroid and levothyroxine, and still feel tired, cold, irritable...still have hair falling out.  All of the above.  I am hoping that this will help!
 Excited to try this product!
 Great product!
 I have just started using this product
 So far so good!!
 Good product
 Just received this product.
 1bodybrand
 still early to tell if it works,
 Good
 Did not work for me , took it for a whoke month and didnt see a change.
 Great product
 love it!
 Great product!
 This made me horribly sick. So I sent it back and two months later, I'm still waiting for my refund.
 This supplement did nothing for me, and really gave me a terrible upset stomach. One star is because customer support was excellent and refunded my money immediately.
 Not working for me. may be because i had radiation therapy to kill my thyroid and I need to look into other products.
 I really don't have a clue about this product because I just received it yesterday.  I had to write something to receive a free bottle in case it actually helps
 I can feel that its working
 a big rip off....amazon charges too much for products that are crap
 Just started taking this product but it has the ingredients I was looking for. Don't have to buy multiple products.
 Did nothing
 I thought i would try this product to see if it would help me get more energy and stamina. I'm always tired in the morning and would like to get a better restful nights sleep.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Supplement-Vegetarian-A-complex-blend-of-Vitamin-B12-Iodine-Zinc-Selenium-Ashwagandha-Root-Copper-Coleus-Forskohlii-more-30-Day-Supply/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement - (Vegetarian) - A complex blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more - 30 Day Supply</a>
 Bad product i have hypothyroidism,  i finished whole bottle,  i dint feel any change i get wors heart palpitations.  More lack energy . I am surprise how people gave 5 stars .
 I just started taking these about a week ago. In my opinion these capsules are a little too large in size. So far I haven't noticed any positive or negative effects, however I have been craving protein more
 Well I actually just received it so I can't comment yet.  I did however choose this product from all the reviews I read on Amazon!  Fingers crossed and once I have used it for a while, I will be back with a better comment on product!!
 Didn't work for me
 Had a real bad allergic reaction. Can't take it. Please do not sent it anymore. Sorry and thank you
 While I am not sure what improvements I should be looking for, I am very happy with the product. No side effects, and I think my energy level is better.
 Did absolutely NOTHING!
 Ordered this product because it contains all of the ingredients recommended for Thyroid support.<br/>Have not used it yet, but I am getting a free bottle through a very easy web site.  Fingers crossed - hoping this product does the trick.
 Just started taking this will give another review when I've taken it longer. With all of the reviews I've ready I hope that it works the same for me as well.
 This product literally made me sick within 3 days of taking it. I ended up with dizzy spells, causing me to fall and bust my lip open. I felt awful for the 3 days I took it. Sorry but didn't work for me.
 Not sure if its working.  Buy we'll see when I go back for blood work.
 I haven't been taking it very long, but I can say that I get no nausea with this supplement (and I get nausea a lot from them). I'm feeling more energetic and hopeful I will start seeing results soon.
 Double check the label. Has sun a low level of iodine that its basically worthless. I'm sorry I spent the money on it.
 Wife has serious RA along with other issues... This prod. should hopefully help.
 Haven't started yet but arrived on time and as described.  Looking forward to trying it out.
 Product looks good, will update back with result soon
 The supplement contains unrecognized components beside the vitamins and my doctor couldn't recognized these items. I returned the supplement and won't order another one.
 Does nothing
 I didn't notice a difference.
 Did not do anything. I seen no changes.
 I am not sure if it is effecting me, however I think it may be!  Will continue as it to see if it builds up!
 I just started using this product ( a few days) it's seems to be working just from my energy level and mood  Feeling like I found my niche in helping me live with thyroid issues.
 My thyroid function shows normal on blood tests, but have fatigue and hair loss and some of the other symptoms so decided to try this supplement.  It makes me feel more alert and not so foggy.  I will continue to take.
 Product came fast. Website easy to use! Hope it works like the reviews. Can't wait to start!!
 Excellent service, great product
 Great product!
 Great supplement !
 So far so good! It hasn't really been long enough for me to tell if this product is doing anything???
 Haven't started taking it, but looks like a good product.
 I like it
 Not sure yet. I am receiving a free product for this review.
 I did not notice any difference taking this product.
 Great product and company. Will keep ordering to help me with my thryoid issues.
 Looks like good product by reviews
 Going to start it today.
 The product is good
 My wife loves it.
 the product didn't work at all
 I don't know which ingredient it was, but I broke out in hives after just 4 doses.  It took 4 days for the hives to resolve.
 Just started using this product. Hopefully the reviews are correct and I see some changes.
 I just received it and can't wait to try it!
 Well just started this product today. It was shipped fast and the reviews were what caused me to order this. I hope it helps me get my thyroid working better!
 I have yet to try this product but I am very excited to see what it can do!
 I just got my second bottle in the mail today. I was very pleased with the first bottle received and was feeling great taking this. The bottle I received today was a different bottle, different sized capsules with different colored herbs from te first bottle. I don't feel safe taking them and am now wondering what color and size they should have been to begin with. With something like a supplement there should be some quality control to ensure this doesn't happen or at least alert the buyer that something has changed. Looking for a refund and will look for a different supplement.
 helps!
 Just got my product. Can't wait to get started. I'm looking forward to having more energy which is why I decided on this product. The delivery was fast too!
 It tastes so bad I almost throw up every time I swallow a pill. I can't tell yet if it's helping me lose weight because I haven't been on it long enough.
 Haven't noticed many changes yet, too soon to tell, but I'm hoping for the best.
 Did nothing to help.
 I have just received this so I don't have any personal experience yet.  I rate it 4 stars because of all of the reviews I have read, the ingredients, and the hope that it will be exactly what I need!
 Haven't started it yet, only have half a thyroid left, stopped taking synthriod years ago. Thought I'd give this a try
 Thyroid problems run in my family.  I have high hopes for this product.
 I'm not sure I noticed any difference after taking it, but I appreciate the company sending me a free gift:)
 Just got this in the mail today and so far so good.. will update in a few weeks on how things are going then..
 Bad not good on the market
 Just start taking it and feel more energized.
 A FRIEND OF MINE TURNED ME IN ON THIS. I JUST KNOW I'LL USE IT.
 Had no improvement. No refunds.
 i do not feel comfortable leaving a review on something i have not used nor do i support others doing so because i value reviews and use them frequently.<br/>thank you for the free product. please request a review at a later time when i am able to adequately leave feedback on the product.
 Package arrived as expected. Have not started product yet, but eager to! Purchased during prime day deal.
 I just started taking my first bottle on Saturday, but I will be sure to give you an update in 2 weeks.
 On amazon the image shows this product uses methycobalamin for B12, which was the reason I bought it, even the package has the same info on it, but on the actual bottle it becomes cyanocobalamin. The first is the bioavailabile form, the second is a cheap synthetic version.
 The product didn't do anything and it sent my hormone out of whack, I ended up gain weight I my adominal of all places.  I really want to send it back and get a refund, I only take half of the bottle at the most. If you let me send it back, I will delete this review.
 will not buy again
 It wasn't even in the package! It was wide open and EMPTY!
 The bottle was empty when I received it.
 This had great reviews.  I am just starting and will update my post later.
 I've been using this product for over a year. My thyroid has been "sluggish" (low end of healthy range) in my last two tests. Since the birth of my daughter 8 yrs ago, I've felt like somethings not right. I suffer from extreme fatigue, extreme weight gain, insomnia, bad PMS/moody swings, heavy periods, anemia, etc. I'll go up &amp; then it's like I just crash. These "crashes" happen in waves. I'll do good for a few weeks/ months &amp; then it hits me- the extreme fatigue. This is no ordinary fatigue. I relate it to an evil witch that puts a spell on me &amp; I go to sleep &amp; can not wake up! My husband calls me sleeping beauty. This is debilitating when it happens. I've been to my gyno &amp; endo &amp; they both say my thyroids not bad enough for a rx. They both dismissed my symptoms as chronic fatigue syndrome or metabolic syndrome. Well, my research indicates that these numbers can swing drastically due to many factors. I notice during these very bad episodes my thyroid actually feels sore, my voice is rhapsy, my energy is gone &amp; I require an insane amount of sleep.. like 14+ hrs a day.  I have extreme brainfog &amp; can barely function. In extreme frustration I researched supplements one night &amp; found this one. I took a chance &amp; ordered it right away. Within two days I noticed a HUGE difference! This was the prince's kiss! My memory came back, my energy came back increasingly more every day.  I could operate normally off a typical nights sleep &amp; slept better! My mood improved. A miracle! But, there's more.. I felt better for months &amp; got very busy. My job picked up dramatically &amp; I was feeling so much better that I enrolled in college full time (I'm a natural hustler). I stopped taking my supplement in all the hustle &amp; would you know the witch returned! It took several months but I went down so fast I never saw what hit me! Sleep, sleep &amp; more sleep. I work nights &amp; was getting up just 5 mins bf work then going to bed right after. One night while I was waking up momentarily from my slumber to pee I remembered this product. Ah ha! I broke the spell again &amp; daily started feeling better! Within a week I was humming along keeping up with everything &amp; feeling good! Don't hesitate.. please! Spend the $- they even had a promo where you can get a free bottle with purchase! I don't care if its your very last $25 buy it!! I'm not sponsored in any way by the company but I'm a believer &amp; this product allows me to live! Best of luck! 😗
 fight yydddfddddydyyyyyyydyyyyyyydyf dr
 I didn't feel any different. Got to help me lose weight, should have bought hydroxycut.
 Did not notice any difference. Wanted too!
 Just didn't work for me....sorry
 i am absolutely giving this zero star rating...this medicine is a crap. i have been using it for a month now and this medicine has tremendously increased my apetite.i have gone from medium to horribly looking fat lady now.because,i guess i have retained so much water in me that i look more like a water melon. tried to return it but they havent responded to me and in the meantime i decided to continue to use it with a positive hope. pl do not waste your money.it is very expensive. i decided to try it out as my levels are closer to normal lower range and my doc has denied putting me on medicine.i couldnt take the lack of energy to finish off my day.but this product actually made me more lethargic and not wanting to do any work at all.horrible and very very disappointed.i am sure this product has many fake reviews giving it the rating they did.
 So this may not show up as a Verified Review, because my mother ordered this for me after she had a good experience with it. But I felt so strongly about this that I had to write a review myself! I have been diagnosed with hypothyroid since I was five or six, when a teacher noticed I had a goiter in a class photo and recommended that my mother get it checked out. So, I've been on the same dose, 75 mcg levothyroxine for about 20 years.<br/>My mother ordered me some of this because she had ordered some for herself, suspecting a sluggish thyroid due to menopause. I tried it with a skeptical hesitance, but I have to say, after a few weeks of faithfully taking these pills, I'm beginning to wonder if the Levo I've taken for 20 years has even done a damn thing.<br/>On Thyroid support, I have more energy and focus than I have really ever known possible, being hypothyroid for so long. My moods are more balanced, depression and anxiety is so much calmer.<br/>When shark week comes, cramps aren't life-ending, and on a more vain note, my shower drain no longer looks like I routinely shave my head every time I wash my hair, and it no longer feels like an uphill battle to lose weight. Did I drop 20 lbs overnight? Of course not. But I finally feel like I'm making progress as I diet and exercise, instead of feeling like there is no point, which is a feeling I know many hypothyroid ladies know all too well.<br/>I will continue to get this stuff, absolutely. For the first time in way too long I feel human.
 I get a free gift if I do this
 Threw this one away....almost gave me a heart attack. Yet I'm still tired, hair is falling out and skin is dry and scaly...sweet.
 No tamper proof seal on mouth of bottle. Outer plastic around the top of lid fell right off.
 Just started and really hope it works.
 I believe it is helping me as I recover from lifelong thyroid problems. I reduced my medication and took myself off (with my doctor's support) of the medication about 3 months ago. I will be retesting function soon and see if I am doing all right. Ingredients SHOULD be helping as Iodine and Selenium are both needed for healthy thyroid function; the others are good support as well.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/dp/B00M13NHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Supplement with Iodine - Metabolism, Energy and Focus Formula - Vegetarian &amp; Non-GMO - Vitamin B12 Complex, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more 30 Day Supply</a>
 I started taking this one week ago. My energy has been much higher and my digestion is more regular. The first few days of taking it I took it on an empty stomach which made me nauseated. One of the sales consultants, Ryan Kotts, told me to take it with a little food which I did and no more nausea. He was also very helpful and friendly. They email you a short e-book telling you what to eat and what to avoid if you have hypothyroidism. It also comes with a coupon for one free bottle of Thyroid Support. If this helps with weight loss, I'll come back to update my review. Also, the first few days I was more thirsty than normal. Not sure if that was just coincidence or my body adjusting to the product. All in all, as long as this keeps making me feel good, i'll keep ordering it. Good luck to you all :)<br/><br/>Today is 5/24/2016 and I have noticed more noticeable changes with the Thyroid Support. My cravings for sweets and fat have decreased tremendously and my appetite is milder, more controlled. I still like a taste of something sweet but now I am satisfied with a piece of fruit versus a pastry.  Also, I've started sauteing my veggies in 1/2 teaspoon of coconut oil and it seems to make the Thyroid Support work better. My energy is also stronger so I've started working out more frequently. 1 Body did send the free bottle as promised. So far so good! I will keep taking the product as long as it keeps working!
 I have been taking this for about 2 weeks now. I have only been taking 1 pill in the morning with breakfast to see if I had any negative reaction since I tend to be quite sensitive to supplements. Not sure how to describe my reaction other than... feels like it is a good thing for my body, but no one thing I can put my finger on. I started taking 2 capsules yesterday and will continue with the product as long as it is beneficial for me.
 I've been taking this supplement twice a day (with food) for a little over a week now. I am excited that I have noticed slight improvements.<br/><br/>I have been to three doctors in the last 6 months with almost all the symptoms of hypothyroidism. All bloodwork kept coming back "normal" according to the doctors and they kept blaming hormones since I had a baby 2 years ago. After being on the supplement for a week or so, I've already noticed my hair shedding is back to normal and I'm not losing near as much as I was. I no longer feel bloated or uncomfortable most of the day especially after eating. I'm not hungry all the time anymore and my weight is slowly decreasing (I have changed my diet some and started a new workout program this week as well). I'm not as tired and sluggish either. Which is fantastic because with a 2 year old who doesn't sleep much, I need all the energy I can get! Hoping to kick the caffeine addiction with this supplement as well!<br/><br/>So far I'm extremely happy with the results that happened in just a short time and I am hopeful this supplement with continue to help me.
 For my 40th birthday I went to a doctors appointment to have my standard blood work done. I was feeling sluggish had hair loss, overall malaise, my periods were irregular, a lot of things just did not feel right. My doctor chalked it up to perimenopause. I didn't feel good about that answer. I felt like there must be something I could  do you do. After some research, I found 1body Thyroid Supplement product on Amazon. At first, my heart palpation's (that I've had for 20 years all through the day and night) felt a little bit worse, but my gut  told me to stick with it. The first week my palpitations were zany, much different than my normal. By two weeks they were almost completely gone, which is miraculous to me because cardiologists had told me I would need an ablation to stop them.  This product has  give me energy all day. I am a mother two four kids and we homeschool. Having all day energy is so amazing. I would have never believed that could be possible.  I started sleeping better. My periods are more normal. Now I'm waiting to see if my hair will come back. From my lips to gods ears! LOL I'm hoping this next bottle, which will be my second, will do that trick. I love this product and I'm ordering that adrenaline supplement next. I can't wait to see how I feel on that one, as I'm already feeling like a new person on the thyroid supplement alone. This is been a miracle to me and I have told everyone I know about it. I was given an offer for a second bottle for free if I shared my experience. The first bottle I paid for. Even if they hadn't offered it for free I would have purchased a second bottle! (And more in the future.) Its worth every penny!
 I don' t know how it works yet...I got it just 3 days ago...
 When comparing labels, this has less kelp/iodine and some other ingredients than my usual thyroid supplements.  That said, I didn't suffer serious symptoms as I have with some thyroid supplement failures. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because it didn't make me love it, but it worked okay.  I am always on the lookout for the most powerful thyroid supplements to help my thyroid function at it's best.  This one is not quite there, but it definitely was something I would consider again...if I don't find  better that is.  I haven't yet.......but I believe it has to exist!<br/><br/>I'm not getting my blood tested currently so I don't have numbers to report.....I go by how I feel. Sometimes my numbers say I should feel terrible and I don't.  Sometimes they say I should feel okay and I don't......so I go by how I feel for weeks....not days.
 After reading the reviews on various thyroid support supplements I decided to give this product a try. Being that this was the bestseller and the fact that it had great reviews I was excited to try the product. I received the product in a timely manner &amp; immediately started taking it as directed, once in the morning and in the evening everyday until the last couple weeks when I increased it to 3 times a day (as another reviewer did-since it didn't seem to be working) until I finished the bottle. Unfortunately, I didn't experience any big, significant changes like other people have other than a little more energy than usual.
 I usually don't send feedback, however this product deserves attention. Prior to taking 1 Body Thyroid Support, I felt sluggish, difficult to keep my attention, forgetful and just tired out all day. After taking this product for 2 weeks I noticed my symptoms of fatigue decreased and energy levels improving dramatically. My thought process and attention span improved as well. I would recommend this product for anyone who experiences symptoms of adrenal fatigue and low thyroid symptoms. I will continue to take this product gladly for the results it gives me, however ONLY thru 1 Body will I order it.
 This supplement didn't work for me. I became more lethargic than ever. I thought it would give me a boost of energy but it didn't. Additionally, I was getting slight headache when taking this.
 I got this for my daughter who was experiencing under active symptoms. Since her tests showed her thyroid to be borderline under active they wouldn't treat her. This product has given her amazing results and she's back to having her usual energy, etc.  It took about two weeks for her to see the difference but she's been taking it for a month now and the results are consistent. If you're not sure if you want to invest in this product I urge you to give it a try.  Based on my daughter's experience I highly recommend this product!
 It has given me a lot of energy, energy I did not have before. My aches all over have improved. My nails have improved, no more brittle nails. Not as much joint pain as before, I have Hypothyroidism and that is huge. Also my mood has stabilized and I am actually starting to feel like I did before my diagnosis.
 It's been only a week so I don't really know but I'm definitely not losing as much hair as I used to. I honestly didn't know I was losing hair but my boyfriend washes my hair sometimes to give me a head massage when I take a bath and he noticed that he got almost no hair on his hands after I started to take it. I will update the review when I see more differences
 The package was very easy to open and the capsules do not have a rancid smell compared to some other products I have tried. I noticed a difference with in the first week. I started to get out of bed with no extreme fatigue or being tired from not being able to sleep. This has been my down side lately. Always needing an afternoon nap. I started to take this product and within 4 days I noticed a difference with my energy levels. I don't need all that coffee.<br/>Like some people I never felt nauseous. I can honestly say its made me more energetic during the day. My concentration has improved at work. I will definitely  be reordering before I am out. I did receive this product as a discount but by no means does that reflect my experience.<br/><br/>My blog:http://doyouneedenergyboost.blogspot.com/2016/01/httpwww.html
 I currently take levothyroxine for my thyroid, and have been noticing again the same symptoms that were occurring several years ago when I found out I was hypo...hair loss, weight gain, restless sleep. Have been taking this for nearly three weeks and have already noticed improvement in my sleep and hair loss seems to be a lot less. Hopefully in another couple weeks I will drop the couple lbs I have gained. So far so good and am happy with my purchase...
 My doctor has prescribed synthroid which I don't want to take due to reported side effects.  While on another natural thyroid supplement, my thyroid test number keeps creeping up and now its in the high normal range (I have no symptoms, but as a type 1 diabetic, synthroid is recommended).  I plan to take this natural thyroid supplement for at least 6 months or until my next blood draw to determine if my thyroid number goes down which would mean my thyroid gland is functioning more normally with the support of this supplement.  I'll be back to report the results then.
 I tried to find a more affordable version of Emerald Thyroid supplements, and this does nothing for me. My body temp went back to 96.4, my skin got really dry and itchy, I scratched my legs raw. My hair started thinning. I gained 9 pounds even though I was eating the same foods. I had no energy and felt like I could go have a nap after being awake for two hours and having a quad latte. I don't take thyroid supplements for 2hrs before or after coffee, either. So, this is a NOPE. If you don't NEED supplementation and just want to feel better, these probably won't make you feel worse. I wish I could find a good dupe for Emerald Thyroid, but I guess it's the one for me. This kind certainly is not.
 I purchased this product while waiting to get in to see my endocrinologist. I was told that I had low thyroid levels and I needed something for the exhaustion I was feeling. While I am not at my best, I am also able to get through the day without having to take a nap. Other symptoms have subsided slightly as well, I no longer am freezing all the time. It is believed that I have an auto-immune disorder that comes from extensive stress. This is to assist your body in getting the adequate vitamins that it requires. Until I get the full diagnosis, I am happy with the results.
 I have been taking this supplement to help with sluggish (but within normal range) thyroid hormone. DO keep an eye on iodine if you take it since this supplement contains 100% of DRV but since I don't get much iodine from my food, I have not suffered any ill effects. I have noticed more energy and less brain fog since I started taking it, and I am hoping it will help a little with the hair loss I have been suffering from for a while.
 I happened to get this right in line with my monthly, and I'm so happy I did. I was having the worst cramps, but I noticed that once i took a pill the cramps would subside almost instantly! That alone was worth making sure I always have a bottle. The other thing I've noticed is my cravings have left and I eat smaller portions of food. I also have had more energy. Whether any, or all, of this has anything to do with what this product was meant for, I don't know. I DO know that it works for me.
 I'm not quite 30 days in to my first bottle but feeling better already.  I feel that I have more energy than I had in the past.  In 60 days I will be back to give another update.  Feeling positive!
 I was put on synthroid by my doctor while trying to get pregnant due to subclinical hypothyroid(low but not outside of normal range).  I recently went off after having my daughter, and the brain fog and fatigue set in.  I had a suspicion it might be my thyroid, so I tried this out after seeing it as a lightening deal on Amazon.  I'm already on my second bottle because it increased my productivity at work because I don't have a constant low grade headache.  I did have some strange sensations in my breasts for a few days when I started taking it that worried me, but I read that someone else had to same side effect and it went away.  I'm curious to see what my thyroid levels are next time I go into the doctor after reading other reviews.
 After a couple of days, I noticed that I was waking up feeling rested. I've been struggling with low, but still within "normal" range for about 2.5 years, and have finally started to feel like I'm climbing my way back toward normal. My energy levels are definitely coming back, I'm able to do light-to-moderate workouts without feeling wiped out, and all the anxiety and heart palpitations I was having are GONE! I've seen a slight change on the scale, and I anticipate that will shift more in month 2, but the most important and wonderful outcome of taking this supplement along with the Adrenal Support, is that my energy levels are climbing back up and I feel closer to my previous, energetic self. This is huge. Thank you!
 I ordered this product based on all of the positive reviews. I struggle with hypothyroid and have been feeling horrible lately. I only ordered one bottle of thyroid support and I'm wishing right now I hadn't let myself run out. I was feeling better taking this product, I noticed more energy after about a week and my mood was better. Now that I have been without for a couple of weeks I am starting to feel terrible again. Working with my Dr. to get my meds right and trying to eliminate a lot of items from my diet. In the meantime I am going to order more thyroid support and keep on making positive changes to help me feel better.
 I'm feeling a little better- not as foggy.  Little bit more energy.  I have a lot of problems with taking the prescription meds.  They have just stopped working for me.  I think I need to take this for a while longer to know for sure how well they work for me, but so far so good.
 I bought this product on a whim because it was on sale. I've never been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, but my father has low thyroid function and I've had a few mild symptoms myself for a while so I thought I would give this a shot. I've since been taking it for about a month and it is definitely working for me. After the first couple of days I noticed an uptick in my energy level, and then after about two weeks I started losing weight. My girlfriend noticed first and she didn't even know I was taking anything. Altogether I've lost about 15lbs since I've started taking this supplement.<br/><br/>Like a few others I do get a mild upset stomach when I take this without food.
 I am 57 y.o., and I started taking this supplement about two to three months ago, hoping that it would improve my low energy level.  Typically I don't believe in taking vitamins or supplements but my husband saw this and recommended it to me.  Within thirty days, I actually felt a difference!  Not only was my energy level up but after two months I lost eight pounds.  The beauty of this particular product is that the change you experience is gradual and sustained, not instantaneous and overwhelming like with RockStar or 5 Hour Energy, so it's easy to continue on the regimen.  The only negatives are the price (though it's not excessive) and the size of the capsules (I have a pretty bad gag reflex when it comes to pills), but these are truly minor quibbles in contrast to the benefits you reap from this supplement.
 So far, I feel happier and generally less anxious on these pills. I was diagnosed with hyper-thyroid several years ago but the prescribed drugs made me feel moody and generally unstable and ultimately had zero impact on regulating my thyroid. So here I am looking looking for viable alternatives and I like the results so far and plan to use this product for about 4 months, which is when I will have new tests performed. My fingers are crossed. And I will follow-up a secondary review after the tests are completed.
 I have found after 5 or so days of taking it my energy levels began to increase. After 14 days I find myself no longer needing 6 cups of coffee to stay awake in the afternoon. I also haven't felt as many cravings for sugary foods. I am excited to see how the rest of the bottle helps me.
 Just started
 I have had a good experience with this product so far. I'm hopeful that the positive response continues. Much better than syntho thyroid medicine I took. I have seen a boast in energy and a general feeling of wellness within a few days. I know if I have forgotten to take it! Really important to be regular and follow directions which are simple. I can recommend this.
 I struggle with all of the typical thyroid disease issues - acne, low energy, weight gain, and hair loss. I am taking this now twice a day and already in the first month into using it, I can tell a marked difference. I have forgotten to take it a couple of times on the evening dose because I am not used to taking evening medications. This is a routine change for me but even when I do forget, I still feel the difference overall. I am really looking forward to how this will help over a three to six month period.
 Vitamins required for tyroid issues are all in one. I would buy this product again. 1st bottle done waiting for more results to post another review.
 haven't really noticed a difference,  pretty dissapointed
 I've been taking 1Body Thyroid Support for about two weeks, now, and I can confirm what many other reviewers have said--I have more energy and am more clear-headed and focused than I've been for months. I've had no ill-effects whatsoever, and I will definitely order this product again.<br/><br/>For a bit of background on why I ordered this product, I've been struggling with incredible fatigue unlike I've ever experienced in my life as well as joint swelling and pain, weight gain, sore, bloodshot eyes, and myxedema, as well as a number of other symptoms. I was diagnosed, after a year of various doctor visits and diagnostics, as hypothyroid. After a month on the lowest dose of levothyroxine and little to no improvement in my condition, my doctor decided I am NOT hypothyroid and insisted that I see a rheumatologist. Incredibly frustrated, I sought out supplements and came across 1Body's Thyroid Support. Encouraged by the positive reviews, I ordered it.  I'll admit I secretly hoped it would cure all of my symptoms, and alas, it has not, but my energy levels have improved demonstrably, and perhaps after a few more weeks of taking it, other symptoms will improve, as well.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll note is that 1Body's customer support is tremendous.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence about trying this product, I hope my review has helped nudge you toward trying it.
 Although I don't see any energy improvement, I am sleeping much better at night and wake up feeling much more refreshed.  I'm going to continue to take this supplement to see if any other symptoms improve.  It's worth a shot!!  The company is extremely responsive as well, which is an added bonus!
 I've noticed quite a substantial difference in my overall experience with my pre-menopausal symtoms. The mood swings, lack of energy, hot flashes and generally feeling like something has taken over my body that I can't control.Have been significantly  reduced since taking this product. I would definitely recommend this product to others who are suffering with the same thing.
 From day one on taking it my cravings vanished.  I felt like I had more energy but not jittery like caffeine.  I'm sleeping better also.  I've only been taking the one pill because I seem very sensitive to dietary supplements.  I may up the dose to the recommended down the road.
 I'm taking this support for thyroid because I think that my thyroid isn't functioning correctly. I decided to try this to see if anything would change and I think I am already seeing results. I have an overall higher level of energy throughout the day which is huge. I usually get tired easily so this was a big sign that something was working!
 I feel like using the Thyroid support I have been able to function with better stamina in my running and overall physical exercise.  I play Frisbee and I am able to play longer and run harder and still do my regular activities without feeling tired and weary for which I am thankful.
 Works for me! I have taken b vitamin and iodine supplements before and they made me feel better, and this one does the same thing, for me. If you're certain these are your deficiencies than this appears to be a quality product to help you out. I am pleased with my purchase anyway!
 Bought this for the other half. She has problems with her thyroid, she says it gives her a ton of energy and keeps her awake when otherwise she would've been falling asleep during the day. It definitely works, but don't take it at night. You won't get any sleep.
 I take Thyroid support because I have an unattractive swollen neck. It helps as I don't see that big ugly nodule in my neck anymore. My weight is stable now too. I was getting weight but I lost excessive weight and I am normal again. Must have if you suffer from thyroid problems.
 I have only began taking the product.  My girlfriend recommended it.  She has had great results taking it.  Originally, I was taking Armor thyroid for the past 10 years.  I think my body needed a change.  I have only been taking it a week.  However, I have lost 2 lbs.  So, I will give it a few months and see if the results continue.  Then, I will update my review. I want to see if my hair will start growing back.  Will keep you posted!
 More energy than I have had in quite a while. Hoping this continues. Haven't noticed as much hair falling out :-)
 I take first thing in the morning with breakfast. I feel more like my "old" self  because I feel more positive, calm, energized and also a decrease in appetite.  These are feeling I have struggled to achieve even on prescription medication!  So give it a try!
 I have hypothyroidism and even though I take my levothyroxine, I still feel tired and fatigued most of the time. This thyroid support supplement has given me a good bit of my energy and metabolism back and it makes me feel more "normal", if there is such a thing.
 I have been taking this pills for one month now. Can't tell a difference. I go to the Dr. next week and I'll see when I get my test back if the really helped.
 Smells horrible can’t stomach it
 Since my thyroid tests have been variable over the past few years, I decided to try Thyroid Support. By adding just one capsule to my other daily supplements, my hair loss ended and I've received many compliments on its silky texture. Also, I feel more energetic. This result is thrilling for a 69 year-old.
 I basically only do reviews far as my vacations, but I've been dealing with unraveling these symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Had a biopsy done which was benign, praise GOD, started with  prescription Synthroid couldn't take for more than 1week, such a weird feeling. Started with seeking out options cked out amazon read reviews for thyroid support and after 3 weeks as stated from previous customers it does start to make you feel so much better, still waiting for the weight loss into my 2nd week, worth trying!!!!!! Better than pharmaceutical  pills which I try to avoid at all costs.
 I have been taking the supplement for going on two weeks. As of right now it appears to be giving me more energy and I can focus better. I do notice if I take it two times a day I can feel a little jittery as if i have two much energy so I have cut back on the amount a little and it seems to work well. I also notice that it helps to drink plenty of water with it.<br/><br/>It has been hard finding something that really seems to help me feel better and like a semi normal person again. I am looking forward to taking this over a longer period of time to see how well it benefits me.
 I’ve been taking this supplement for about 8 days now.  I did not expect to see a difference in less than two weeks, so I’m very surprised.<br/>I’ve been treated for something else which was not responding to medication.  That issue is a symptom of thyroid problems, but my doctor said that all of my labs were “normal enough.”<br/>My grandmother had a goiter.  My aunt is currently battling thyroid cancer.  The issues are there in my family.<br/>The first thing I noticed with taking this supplement was the energy.  When my alarm went off at 6AM, I hopped out of bed and started getting ready for the day.  Before, I would just snooze the alarm until I absolutely had to get up.  Over the past week, I am up before my alarm doing things around the house.  I went to the 5:30AM spin class this morning!<br/>The next thing I noticed is that I am regular.  This is most welcome as I go to the gym in the mornings, and I hate working out with that “heavy” feeling in my body.<br/>Anyone who looked at my neck could tell that my thyroid was slightly enlarged.  In just a week, the swelling has gone down some – not all.  I can tell because I can now swallow pills and food without feeling like something is stuck in my throat.  I used to have to take all of my supplements/medications one pill at a time; now I can take them all at once, and they go down my throat with one swallow of water.<br/>Also, I can sing again.  When my thyroid issues first began, it hurt to sing.  I didn't know why.  I just thought that my voice was changing with age, and I would no longer be able to hold notes that I used to.  This was a most welcome surprise.<br/>My hands are still cold, but my feet are not.  I am sure the hands will catch up soon.  It’s cold here in WI, and they are out more than my feet; so that may also have something to do with it.<br/>Really, the most amazing thing for me is my eyesight.  I had LASIK ten years ago.  Over the past few months, my eyesight started to blur.  I thought it was just a fact of LASIK.  Last month, I bit the bullet and got glasses because I could not see the words on TV when watching Jeopardy or Family Feud.  Yesterday, as I was watching TV, I realized that I was reading the print just fine; and I was not wearing my glasses!<br/>Overall, I am very happy that I took a chance with this supplement.  I have already recommended it to a few friends who have issues with thyroid and iodine deficiency.  I will be ordering again and again.
 I will be updating my review after taking this for a full month. So far, it seems to be doing the job. Headed to the doctor's to test thyroid, so that will be telling. Hoping for a move in a positive direction.
 Hello, have ANY of you been taking this medication alone with your prescribed thyroid medication? I take Levothyroxine 150mg. Even if I still take it, I as well suffer all the main symptoms, mainly fatigue, weight gain, and being cold. I'm concerned if I should take my medication and this at the same time, or if I should wait a period after my Levothyroxine.<br/><br/>Please let me know,<br/><br/>Thanks!
 just got it e-mail me in a month and I will be happy to rate.
 After reading the reviews from people who have thyroid issues, I figured I should give it a try. I'm a vegan and work out 6 days per week, I wasn't losing any weight and had constant mood swings. I felt out of balance and didn't know why, since taking this product, I now have hope!! I feel more balanced and optimistic about my weight lose and emotional stability. Bye bye mood swings!!
 I eat a plant-based diet and exercise daily to manage my thyroid and this seems to supply me with that little something that helps my energy levels keep up with my grand ambitions.  I am just finishing up my first bottle and am curious to see if the positive effects continue.
 I do feel better but it's hard to say.  I am going to give it another month to see if there is a marked improvement.
 After taking 1Body Thyroid and Adrenal Support for 30 Days I am feeling much better. My energy levels are back up to where they used to be and the fatigue has decreased significantly, my skin is not as dry, my hair is in much better condition and overall I feel drastically better.
 It gave me an uplifting feeling, to do things around the house.
 I am posting this review as a part of a promotion.  I've been taking this supplement for 16 days and so far so good.  No negative impacts.  I'm changing my diet and adding more exercise into my daily routine.  I expect to be seeing some good changes soon!
 I have been researching for about six months on an alternative way to deal with my hypothyroidism.I chose this because of its natural ingredients and have been taking this product for two months. I have noticed an increase in my energy level and my hair is not falling out as it was. I have had no negative side effects so far and am happy with the supplement.
 It's hard to tell for sure, but I do believe this product is supportive to my body. I have felt more energetic since I've been taking it.
 I got this for my wife's under active thyroid problem. The product is legit and seems to be working slowly on her. She's noticed a bit more energy in the mornings and her hair seems to be growing as well. She is actually losing weight which was almost impossible before she started taking 1Body. I went all out and also got the adrenal and the liver support. So far this product is very good and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Two Thumbs Up to 1 Body
 Taking for under active thyroid support in hoped of increased energy and long term ability to loose weight.
 My wife bought this product. After giving birth I noticed a huge change in her behavior. She had no energy and was depressed. This has helped her soooo much!
 I have more energy, hopefully some of the weight will start to disappear. I also like that this product does not cause me any stomach upset. I will absolutely buy this product again, and refer it to others.
 It works. I have more energy,  better skin, and hair with this.
 I'm still taking this supplement of one in the morning and one at night. I work graveyard noticing that having a little bit more energy and not as sluggish. Have gone through menopause so all I can get. So far liking medication. No adverse side effects.
 Have been taking this supplement for over 2 months in addition to my prescription Levothroxine for a mild hypothyroid condition. Results of my latest blood test showed normal levels. I am pleased.
 This product jump started my weight loss! Glad I tried it!!
 I LOVE getting a free bottle! Thanks so much!  It seems to be making a difference.  I'll take it for two months and see how it goes.
 I  don't buy things like this for thyroid support, just because counteract my meds..<br/> NO PROBLEMS!! So Glad!!<br/> I  am feeling more awake, not draggy after my new 15 min workout... awesome! I am hoping in a few more weeks I will see my weight loss  come back  to normal rate.<br/>I will be ordering this again!!
 Your experience with<br/><br/>Thyroid Support<br/><br/> My thyroid levels per my blood work were way out of wake and they are now slowly becoming more normal where they should be with out those stupid Doctor prescribed medications...which a lot of the time make people worse than they were or those mess interfere with what they are already on. I wanted to try all natural to see if I would have any changes and I have seen some.
 I purchased because of my sluggish thyroid.  I have been taking this product twice daily for close to a month and have noticed some improvement in my energy level. I have not noticed that it has helped with my hair loss as of yet but will continue to take this product to see if it helps.
 Too soon too tell.  Only been using a little over a week. Do not know how long I should wait to give a good review on how it is or isn't working for me. I did appreciate the free bottle sent to me just for buying one. Was not expecting that.Hoping it helps.
 My husband is quite please, I will probably start using this product also.
 I love that this product contains quality ingredients! I take for thyroid support and feel great!
 It has become easier for me to shed the stubborn pounds that my body has been holding on to.
 I have been taking this Thyroid Support for over 3 weeks now. I feel a more sense of clarity and energy in the past week. Seems like a good product. Will keeping taking to see more results in the future. I would recommend this product if you have any type of thyroid issues in the past, it may very help.
 I was hoping I'd notice a difference after taking this for a full month, but I did not. It didn't help nor did it hurt. I have Hashimoto's.
 I have a little more energy and not as sluggish in the morning, but nothing dramatic yet. I will continue taking it to see.
 There is no quick cure for weight loss. Thyroid Support took a few weeks, but I am now seeing results on the scale. Before this product I was working out and eating healthy without results. I feel more energized and am slowing loosing weight. Finally! Also, I do not feel jittery.
 No side affects and was able to get off levothroxine.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for about three weeks now and I really like this product! I have a lot more energy! My sleeping habits are improving! I will definitely buy again
 This stuff is amazing I can feel a big change in my energy will purchase again
 It helps my mood be more upbeat. I get better sleep which improves my energy level.
 So far so good. Going to the Dr. In a couple of weeks to have my blood drawn to see if my thyroid is still low or if it's back to normal.
 I felt cold even in the summer time, now I feel better.
 feel that my metabolism is boosted as a result of using this thyroid support supplement.
 I was actually going to order this and try it until i looked up the ingredient Hypromellose. An otherwise promising product ruined by its capsule formula.
 I have only been using this product for 8 days but I already feel a difference. I have tried a couple other thyroid supplements that just didn't seem to be doing anything but as soon as I started on this product I felt more energized and like my normal self which I have not felt in years. Product was shipped out quickly and the 1Body company has been really amazing. So glad I found this product, truly looking forward to seeing how it helps me long term.
 Seems to help with my overall feeling. You must take it regularly.
 My doctor had given me a prescription since my body wasn’t producing enough thyroid. Instead I took this for 2 months and my levels were back to normal. Now I take 1 tab a wk to stay regulated. Feel so much better with not feeling so tired,hair look healthier and the volume is back. Thank you
 I've been using this for a little more than 2weeks.  I love it!  I could tell a difference in my energy level the second day.  I finally have the energy to exercise when I get home from work.
 I really like this company's products.  I have used the Adrenal Support supplement and it's a quality product, which is why I chose to try their Thyroid Support supplement.
 I fell like I have more energy and my appetite is lessened a bit..
 Good energy and seems to be helping.
 I love the energy I gave and improvement of memory
 Although I am just a few weeks into taking this product, I have noticed an increase in energy. I am able to stick to a task longer without needing to rest.
 Seems to be working great. I have more energy and seem to be less tired in the afternoon. So far I am pleased with this product. I will continue use and see how it goes.
 It's only been a couple of weeks but I have noticed an increase in energy and the issue I was having with hives seems to be better. I will continue taking them to see if other issues I was having improve.
 Does work, but I got headaches if I took everyday.
 Feeling better
 As a professional biologist, I compare all the ingredients with the other thyroid companies and found this to be the best.
 I can feel the engine inside revving up again! My metabolism feels like it has turned back on &amp; I have more energy.
 Suffer from hypothyroidism and stroke survivor.  Began taking this product 3+ weeks ago.  Energy seems to be improving.  Will continue to take to make sure that my improvement in all areas affected by hypothyroidism continue to improve.
 I'm noticing more energy. The days I don't take it, I'm dragging all day.<br/>Haven't had any weight loss, but haven't exactly been dieting either.<br/>I'll buy this again.
 Arrived as on time seem to be helping me
 Diagnosed with critical hypertension.  Researched the best ingredients for cardiovascular, adrenal and thyroid support.  These product reviews were good.  Using this product along with other nutraceuticals.  My blood pressures are much lower and my anxiety symptoms are ebbing.
 I've been taking this thyroid supplement for 2 weeks, &amp; am starting to feel better overall. Very happy with my purchase, &amp; plan to continue taking this supplement on a regular basis.
 I've been urged to review this but really don't know yet what effect, if any, it's having on me. Will update if I come to have a more definitive statement.
 I think my husband's goiter has gone down a little.  He didn't notice too much difference.
 I started taking this as they where talking about increasing my prescription. as taking this made it so i didn't have to take more of the script I was very  happy with the results, my husband is going to start taking it and I hope it will work for him as well.
 I seem to have more energy and am able to stay on task for sustained periods of time. No need to take a nap every afternoon. The ingredients in the supplement are very good. I don't feel the need to take a handful of other supplements.
 I have been using it for a couple of weeks now.  I felt better almost immediately.  Before I used it I was feeling very lethargic and depressed and cranky since I was getting behind on everything since I was exhausted all the time.  I feel more energetic and I am more active since using it, as a bonus I have lost a few pounds and my mood has improved as a result.  I feel more like myself now.
 This product has really helped boost my metabolism. I added this into my supplement routine and i feel great!!!!!
 I love these. I have been extremely cold for years, to the point of being ridiculous. From the first day I took these I was already warmer. I have also lost a couple pounds without even doing anything different on my eating. I feel it is making my thyroid work properly. I have gotten blood test and it always turned out that my thyroid was fine but we have a family history of thyroid problems and my Mom had to have surgery for hers. I am hoping to avoid anything like that.
 I have more energy. I feel so much better. I am sleeping better and my mood is great. It has done a lot more than I expected
 I feel so much better. I feel like I'm sleeping better and it has really helped with my mood swings.
 I chose this because of the ingredients. I will have to do a follow up blood test to see if it has improved my thyroid function.
 I will check back in a month after taking product.  Starting because all females in my family have thyroid issue.  I come up normal but have all symptoms of sluggish thyroid.
 In less than a month this product has improved symptoms experienced for more than 15 years since hypothyroid diagnosis. Better digestion, less muscle aches and stiffness, improved sleep pattern. I've never had weight problem so can't comment on that. Thoroughly recommend this product.
 This product is a dream come true--my thyroid levels are normal for the first time in two years!
 Thyroid support has helped increase my energy and slow down the rate of my hair loss.
 This product helped a alot with my constant fatigue and the price point was even better
 Será que se puede usar para el hipertiroidismo yo quuero subir de peso no bajar de peso alguien por pavor que me explique
 This has everything my doctor has recommended for my Thyroid.
 Hoping this product will be my answer to a holistic approach for my hypothyroid condition.  Have been on a thyroid prescription for many years and decided to do some research and found this on Amazon and was encouraged by the many positive reviews.... will update my review after I have been on this product longer.
 This product provides iodine which is essential for thyroid health.
 Love this stuff, keeps me going, really nice
 I feel more energy and am losing weight on this - it is great!
 I have noticed an increase in my energy level since I began taking Thyroid Support two weeks ago.
 I just received my first bottle of Thyroid Support a few days ago. I purchased this product based on the reviews I read from those who have written testimony about the difference taking this product has made in their health and overall well being. I have noticed a change in energy level a bit in just this few days. I am excited to see how I feel in a week or two!
 Very good will be buying more
 Will write after a few weeks..just started
 Honestly this product got me ouf of a plateu and my weight loss restarted, it rocks
 It seems to help my energy level, especially when taken with Adrenal Support.
 The affect is  subtle at this point, I feel like I  have more energy.
 Great products gives a lot of energy !  Feel happier and lighter
 Feel so much better after taking this (which I've taken for one month so far). Do not feel completely "drained" and this has the ingredients listed on thyroid websites in the two capsules taken daily.
 I've read a lot about supporting the thyroid and this product has everything I've read about and is very easy to take. I havn't taken it long but am very hopeful that this will help!
 I can tell a difference in my energy levels since starting thyroid support. I want to keep taking this supplement to see how it affects my overall energy levels every day.
 I have dealt with thyroid issues for years and I am slowly beginning to feel more energy.
 I have been taking this for two weeks. It has made a world of difference in my energy level. I will definitely continue taking it.
 I don’t see any difference at all. I took this pill 2 or 3 weeks ago I have to stop because I have noticed that every time I take this pill my blood pressure was way up high and I thought I’ll be having a stroke. I don’t think I would recommend this medication. I was so happy and excited to try this because of what have other people’s experiences, but based on my experiences I would not recommend this.
 Great Product!! Love the capsules form, they digest easier. Thank you for wonderful products! Keep making more!<br/>I'm starting to feel better already!<br/>Please give them a try!
 Feeling better, less tired during the daytime. Really think this Thyroid Support is helping me! Excited to finally feeling like my old self again!
 I feel less tired and less hungry.
 I have been using this product for over a month and feel it works on many levels. I have more energy, my brain doesn't feel foggy, my metabolism works better. I have taken other products for thyroid in the past and I recommend this product.
 After taking thyroid support for the last 3 weeks, I am more alert and overall seem to feel better.  I would recommend this product !!
 I love taking thyroid support in the morning for a bpost of energy and focus. I took a chance on this product and I'm so happy I did.
 I have only been taking a few days thus far- so far- it has given me some of my energy &amp; life back that prescription medication alone was not accomplishing. I'd definitely suggest anyone to give this product a try- if your struggling- as I was.
 Big hype.  Nothing impressive.
 Feeling great after taking these. No more tiredness and bloating.
 I am less tired.
 I feel less cloudy or foggy.  I like that it does not make my feel nauseous or jittery.
 I can't feel it working but I'm seeing a positive increase in my lab tests results for the T3 &amp;T4.
 My sister gave me a week supply of her Thyroid support and I could tell that I had a lot more energy and I wasn't as cold as I had been lately. My hair began to thicken as well
 I like the results so far, and would try another bottle to see how effective it is.
 I think it’s helping. We will see with the second bottle
 Might work for some but didn't for me.
 I have hypothyroidism and I notice I have been extremely tired but now that I've been taking thyroid support I have a lot more energy. I feel really great.
 I have been taking this product for quite a while now and I feel great.  I sleep better and have more energy.
 I have more energy and don't tire as quickly.
 Like the ingredients and thus far good.
 So far after just two days of using this product, I can say I am feeling better and a bit more alert and not as sluggish. Seem to have more energy as well.  Look forward to seeing how I feel in a few weeks but so far, liking the product.
 I have been able to lower my thyroid medication.
 I like that you see results after trying this. I feel more energetic more regular. My hormones are leveled
 So far, so good. I think I will give it time and see if it continues to make a difference.
 I feel great! I actually started to lose a little weight, and I have a little energy at the end of the day to go for a walk or to do some light exercises;-)
 I have been taking "Best Thyroid Support Supplement" for about a week. The first very obvious sign that this is helping my body is that  I sleep very sound. I wake up before 7am feeling rested and dreaming vivid dreams while sleeping. Im guessing this is because I am falling deeper into REM sleep. I have a ton of energy and am all around in a better mood. Another thing is noticed and sorry guys for TMI but I had very few cramps when "Aunt Flo" came to town. Im excited to continue seeing the benefits of this product:)
 I have previously taken thyroid support, but just not this brand.  I do however, appreciate your concern about making sure that I am satisfied with it.<br/>and I will give it a good try.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Jill Waddle
 This supplement made me so incredibly nauseous every single day, I had to stop taking it after a couple of weeks.  Just unbearable nausea :(
 I feel great.  Wonderful
 I just started this product 2 days ago and can already tell a difference in my energy level. The "swollen" feeling and sore throat has already gone away. I hope to see many more changes with this product! Thanks for helping me feel better!!
 My energy is up and I am no longer dragging at the end of the day! Fantastic Product I highly recommend!
 I really saw an improvement in my blood sugar and in my regularity in my bathroom activity.
 Love it!
 This product is great I have noticed a big difference since I started taking it.... Thank You
 Great product without lots of conditions on when/how to use it.
 So I was a little hesitant at first since I have just dealt with side effects of Hypothyroism the last 15+ years. For the first time I have clarity and I can focus. I don't get the afternoon fog that has become normal to me, so normal that it took me a few days to put the connection that it was the Thyroid Support that was making the difference. For the first time in years I enjoy getting up in the morning...the groggyness isn't there anymore. I can't thank 1 Body enough for this product.
 "I have gradually felt better since I started taking this supplement. It truly makes a difference in my day."
 Great product with excellent supplements inside. Definitely worked for me! I had an issue with shipping, but customer service took care of me. I would recommend to a friend!
 Actually felt a difference taking this product. Best combination of needed ingredients I've seen for hypothyroidism.  Would reccomend.
 I can't wait to start taking this again. I took this along with the adrenal support and had more energy and better mood support. Love taking them about mid morning.
 After two weeks taking the Thyroid Support, I feel less lethargic and my body is not as sore and achey as it once was. Will update in a couple of months.
 It seems to work.
 Great product!
 I bought the thyroid support supplements because I've struggled with weight, hunger and mood swings for a while and thought it may be related to my thyroid. I just started taking them but excited to see what the results will be.
 Make me have chest pains,,,need to be able to return it,,,and find something else,,,was to strong for me.
 I gave it 2 stars because of the great customer service by the seller. I read the reviews thoroughly before making a purchase and really thought that these supplements were going to work for me but they didn't. I didn't request my money back and I regret not doing so. I'm trying to figure out how come it worked for so many people but did nothing for me.
 Ive been taking this product for a couple weeks now and have noticed increased energy. I don't have the afternoon tired feeling like I did before using thyroid support.<br/>Also, it gives me peace of mind, knowing I'm getting all the vital minerals and vitamins that a healthy functioning thyroid needs, all in one supplement!
 I recently received my thyroid support. I have many ailments and it is hard to tell how much this is helping yet. I like there is no poor side effects. I would recommend to try this product.
 Just what the doctor ordered. More energy, less tired at the end of the day.
 I couldn't really feel that this product changed my health in any way. I took it twice a day for a month
 Just received this. Only gave four starts but will edit it later when I have taken it a month. Thanks and I look forward to feeling healthier!! Thank you!
 Amazing product. I just started taking them and I already feel the difference. I have alot more energy through out the day. Great product highly recommend
 It seems to be helping
 I just received this but have taken the Thyroid Support in addition to my Armour thyroid meds,It seemed to give me extra support
 i just started using this, i like the variety of natural ingredients that the product contains, it meets my needs, which is why i chose it :)
 Not seeing much difference
 The promise of a free bottle does not work
 Helps a lot with energy. I've noticed a big difference since I started taking it a few months ago.
 I have ordered from this company before and took the Adrenal Support. I like the product cause it is Vegetarian and I have just been informed I have PCOS so I have been looking for an alternative to the medications the Dr.'s want to give patients with PCOS. I have not tried the Thyroid Support yet but I had no issues with the Adrenal Support, so I'm on my 2nd bottle with 1 Body
 It is great!  Really noticed a difference.
 Do not recommend this item made me extremely dizzy and nauseated!
 I was very excited to try this but I couldn't tolerate it at all ... made me very sick
 Thyroid Support is one of the best out there I have been taking thyroid support for a while and it seems to be working for me .
 Made me violently ill and ended up in the hospital.
 Didn't notice any difference after taking
 I've been using this product for a couple of weeks and have noticed a difference in how I'm feeling. So far...so good! Glad I tried it!
 I definitely have more energy. Too soon to tell if there are any weight loss benefits.
 No noticeable difference
 I chose this product because of the good reviews.  It was a nice surprise to find an offer for a free product.  Can't wait to start taking this supplement!!
 More energy, less bloat, less brain fog
 I have been using this product for approx. a month and it has not only helped support my thyroid but overall health.
 Thank you
 Helps with hair loss
 I can't believe I found a product to get me off of synthroid after 6 years!
 So far, so good. Only have had product about a week, but feeling quite optimistic as all the ingredients are each beneficial &amp; in one complete capsule, should address a number of needs lacking in a person with thyroid deficiencies. I hope to update in the near future of actual effects with completion of a bottle or two. I'm happy for the combination in one supplement!
 Great product.  Don't feel so tired and sleeping better.
 So far product seems ok similar to other thyroid supplements but the voucher it comes with to redeem free product doesn't work.
 I feel more energy when taking this product. I also feel like it keeps my weight stable.
 My body seems to appreciate this product and I take it several times a week.
 I have been using this supplement for a couple weeks now and I am already feeling the difference. Prior, I had been feeling extremely sluggish and fatigued, along with an uncontrollable weight gain issue, but with this supplement I am beginning to feel my perky, usual self again. I would highly recommend this thyroid supplement over others for both increased energy levels and improved concentration.
 I have been taking it for a few weeks now and have noticed an increase in my energy during the day
 This product was delivered right on time. I feel better since beginning the product, but haven't been taking for that long. I will update on another week but so far I feel GREAT!
 It's my first month, I have noticed a bit more energy and I did lose 2 pounds.  I will continue and report as I feel with what it helps!
 I felt looked after
 Only on day 4 but seem to feel an energy boost already. I am hypothyroid and looking forward to some positive results
 Been taking this for a couple weeks and so far I am pleased.  I like the ingredient list on this product.
 After about a month of using the product I do feel less lethargic. I also have been working out and eating better so I am not sure if it is all due to the Thyroid Support. Either way I like the product and will continue to use it unless I start feeling bad again.
 your synthetic form of b-12 is not all natural
 Works good! Feel much better just after taking it for about a week.
 it has really helped me with energy and weight loss
 I have more energy and I require less sleep. Very happy with product!
 Works great!
 Great so far!  Noticed a little boost in energy throughout the day.
 Tried adrenal support and I can't wait to get my thyroid support.
 good product. I have lost about 8 lbs due to increased metabolism. I didn't change my diet or exercise routine.
 Really helps with thyroid issues
 Just received my thyroid support.  Looks like an excellent product and can't wait to see results from use.  Arrived promptly and excited to receive a promotion of a free months supply with no gimmicks attactched!  Will post again after a months use.
 I have been taking for 16 days for thyroid support.  I am not on any thyroid medication but have most symptoms for hypothyroidism.  Was hoping this would help support without other medication.  I think it is too soon to know if it is helping.
 Didn't really do anything for me.
 I am feeling better since I started using the thyroid support
 Great supplement for people with hypothyroidism.
 Doesn't work miracles but has seemed to help me maintain my weight.
 I have more energy after taking this product a few days.
 Product OK, but too expensive. Unsure if it made a huge difference.
 I can't wait to start this week! I'll post how it goes!
 I noticed I was sleeping more deeply the second day!
 This product seems to be working for me!
 Feel so much better after taking for a few weeks. Fantastic product !!
 Will start taking it soon :) can't wait.
 Just started a few days ago. Excited to see how it works for me
 I am looking forward to seeing how it effects my ability to loose weight since that is my biggest struggle with my thyroid, besides the fatigue.
 This stuff is amazing!! Really works.
 I feel like I have more energy!!
 This is an awesome product. I would highly recommend.
 So far so good. No side effects.
 Very useful in helping with the effects of hypothyroidism---assists with tiredness, chipping of nails, etc.
 So far so good
 So far so good .  It helps my husband sleep well.
 Love the energy I get from taking this!
 I'm feeling less tired by 3pm and I do feel more alert.<br/>I'm taking this supplement to help with foggy brain, feeling lethargic and hopes of seeing weight loss . My mother had partial thyroid removed and is on medication.
 nice product
 Good
 I took 1 pill so far and looking forward to taking this more<br/>My current supplement I have not felt any difference but taking this 1 pill I did feel different<br/>Fingers crossed and I will be updating 😊
 Great product! A lot more energy and I am feeling more like myself. I have also lost a few pounds which is a bonus. Highly recommend!
 They are amazing.
 So far so good. I've been taking the product for about 2 weeks now and I feel like I have more energy, which is the main reason why I bought the product.  As of right now I will continue to purchase the it.
 Great B complex combination with trace elements!
 I have been taking this twice a day for almost a month and it seems to be supporting my energy levels. I don't experience that underlying stream of fogginess and am making it through mid-day without extra coffee to pump myself up.
 Love the product!
 Just received my order today and anxious to start taking this supplement. Read all the reviews and it sounds very promising.
 I have been struggling with symptoms associated with low thyroid for several years. So happy to have found this product. In just a short time I am feeling more energetic and losing weight!!
 I love, love this... This's changed my life for better! Now I have energy and feel really good! Thank you 1 Body!
 I just starting taking the product and so far so good!!!  I think its really working for me.
 These supplement are really good !! I definitely recommend this to everyone who is looking for Thyroid support supplement
 Just received my order today and am anxious to start taking as the reviews sound promising. I'll update later.
 Honestly I felt like it made no difference whatsoever.
 im starting to notice a little more energy!
 Crossing mu fingers this product wil help me with my slow thyroid.. we'll be back later to keep you posted!
 I am very excited to try this product after reading all the reviews, received the product today and with it came a free product offer!  So off to a great start!  :)
 Great product!
 Arrived on time.  Seems like a good product, although I haven't been taking it too long.
 Can't tell if it's helping or not yet.
 I just received this product and am very pleased with the packaging and the simplicity of the directions.  I believe the experience will be very pleasant and am hoping for amazing results.
 Great product!
 The bristles came out in my mouth during brushing
 I just started taking this product after my doctor recommends this brand.  I haven't seen any changes yet, but hope to soon
 So many positive review but I'm still kind of scared to try it
 i love that
 I haven't tried this product yet but I'm very excited. I have thyroid issues which has affected my mood, rest, and weight. If this product is beneficial I will definitely make it part of my daily routine.
 Before I start in on the review, I want to tell all the skeptics &amp; worriers to not pass on this product until you've taken an entire bottle!! Trust me on this, I was thinking nothing was happening up until the 3rd week. I'm a typical “I want it all right now” mentality in regards to everything and if I don't get instant results, I think it doesn't work. Please put that thinking aside for the first month &amp; you will be rewarded as I was!<br/>I purchased this item and am giving this review completely free of bias. The seller has offered nothing for a positive review, I know I like getting real result reviews before I purchase, so that is why I'm doing this.<br/>It wasn't that 'nothing' was happening, it was just that it didn't happen all at once so I was missing the subtle changes that were happening until I looked back over the past month. Things I didn't even think were related to my thyroid were improving along with everything else.<br/>The first week the main thing I noticed was that if I didn't take the pills with food, I would get horrid heartburn so TAKE WITH FOOD.<br/>The second week, I noticed my boobs hurt and I had PMS symptoms that were 2 weeks too early. Looking back, this was because hormones are connected to thyroid function and I was 'waking up' my sluggish thyroid. I also noticed I was feeling colder than normal. For the past couple of years with my sluggish thyroid, I've run hotter than normal so it was noteworthy when I had to wear socks to bed to keep my feet warm and my hands were chilly most of the day. My 'brain fog' during this week completely disappeared. I would sometimes spend weeks in a fog that no amount of coffee or redbull could draw me out of. Another thing of note was my sleep was becoming super restful. I would sleep a full 8 hours &amp; wake with no fog!!<br/>Third week notes were that I didn't really think anything of significance was taking place, my hair was still thin &amp; the 5 pounds I lost could have been due to normal monthly water retention. I was starting to get frustrated and annoyed by swallowing pill after pill every day and getting no HUGE results that I was hoping for. I still kept at it, however, determined to finish the bottle. My determination was rewarded.<br/>On the beginning of the 4th week, it was like a switch was literally flipped on my appetite. I didn't really make much of it the first 2 days, it was extra hot in our area so I attributed the lose of  appetite to the heat. By the 4th day, I really noticed after I'd gone all day and only thought about eating in order to take my morning pill (I eat a hardboiled egg as I am not a breakfast person) and then again for my evening pill. I had gone the ENTIRE DAY without planning a meal, thinking about what I was going to eat on my work break, thinking what I might need from the grocery store or even being hungry!<br/>That's when I sat down and wrote down all the things that had changed over the past month, even the things I didn't attribute to my thyroid. My sense of smell has been gone for about 2 years, it had strangely started coming back in fits and starts. I can SMELL THINGS again. The half moons on my fingers have been missing on all my fingers except my thumbs. They are almost all back now! (with the exception of my pinkies, they are still not totally back there yet.<br/>Its still too soon to tell with my thinning hair, but with everything else, I'm hopeful.<br/>So I'm giving this a WONDERFUL REVIEW!! TRY IT AND STICK WITH IT!!
 Have been taking this for 3 weeks now and have noticed a few things that I believe can be attributed to the use of this product. My sleep is better and my thyroid related swelling has been noticeably less to the point where my family members have told me they can see a marked difference. My energy is somewhat better but I also do have a serious iron deficiency so it will be sometime before I will know if it is this or the iron that is helping.<br/><br/>What I  do know for sure was that my cycle was less heavy and was almost normal for the very first time in 4 years just 1 cycle into taking this. Yes, dysfunctional uterine bleeding is tied with thyroid. This is where I think this product has helped with the most. The other thing that seems to coincide with the use of this production is a HUGE decrease in hair loss. I am taking this along with Biotin and my hair loss is down about 80%! No joke. I went from clumps and clumps of lost hair to being able to run my fingers through my hair with just a couple of hairs in my hand. If this keeps up and my cycle and hair loss continue to improve, I will be a customer for life BUT...<br/><br/>Since I have only taken it three weeks, I cannot say for certain whether the improvements are directly associated with this product and I don't think I will know for sure until I have given it at least another month. In the meantime, I will be keeping track of my symptoms, ordering another bottle and letting you all know how this is working for me in an update. So far, so good!<br/><br/>Interim update: My energy level is definitely up and my swelling has decreased significantly. I am sleeping much better. I am seeing an improvement in my irritability and am feeling well enough to work out. I noticed that I was able to get through some high intensity classes without wiping out this week. In addition to the Thyroid support I am taking Biotin and just started taking dessicated liver. My overall impression is that the supplements are working together. My appetite has really decreased. I am seeing a reduction in cravings for dairy and carbs. I am almost done with my first bottle and the second bottle is on the way. I do not have a before picture of my foot but my swelling is down quite a bit. I'll update some more soon.<br/><br/>Final Updates: Today is 11/9/16 and I am on my third bottle of TS. This is the real deal! It has made so much difference for me. I am absolutely losing weight and there has been a remarkable decrease in sugar cravings. I noticed that I am not ravenous. Everyone who sees me says that I look younger and I do because I am not so tired all the time. I am sleeping much better. My hair loss is still on the decline and it is beginning to grow again. I want to be that striking, energetic Latina with beautiful, strong hair that I knew I could be and this is getting me there.
 UPDATE: I decided to take 1 capsule a day and with food. I feel this definitely has made a difference now. My energy is up (I used to have to sleep 8 or 9 hours to feel okay, now 7 hours gets me by), my mood is more level (I was a bit more emotional and up and down a few weeks back).  Overall, I think this product is helping me but you have to take it with food and find the right dose for you.<br/>Original review:<br/>Not sure about this yet..I take all my supplements without food and apparently I can't do that with this one.  It does say to take with food, so after the second day of feeling nauseous, I took it with food. I also cut back from 2 pills to 1 pill and am hoping this helps.  I cannot say that this product has made me more hyper but I can say that I am having trouble falling asleep at night - not sure if this is the reason? I have never been able to go to sleep easily but maybe it's just me or maybe it's the product. I do take it around 3 PM and go to bed at 10 PM (again only 1 pill).<br/><br/>I want to continue with this product though because 1. I paid for it (ha!) and 2. I do believe it has good ingredients.  I will try to update how it's working for me in about a month (it's 60 capsules so if I only take 1 a day, it will last me 2 months). By then I'll have a better gauge I hope. I took a picture of it to show the pill size.  The pills are not that big, average to medium.<br/><br/>Also, just as an FYI, this is what I'm on in addition to this pill and I'm 48, not overweight and swim/walk everyday.<br/>DIM (great for hormones)<br/>Ashwaghanda (immune system and hormones)<br/>Vit K (been bruising so...)<br/>Gingo Bibloa (supposed to help with vitiligo and memory)<br/>Folic Acid (I had it in my closet...so why not?)<br/>Tumeric (LOVE this stuff - so good for your immune system and aches/pains - arthritis)<br/>Magnesium (helps keep me regular<br/><br/>Kat
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto and put on medication.  Thyroid support along with my medicine has given me my life back
 I'm giving this a 4 out of 5. I'm not noticing weight loss or anything like some other reviewers. I have noticed my eyebrows are thicker and I'm able to grow a unibrow again, lol.
  I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease right at one year ago. I was placed on thyroid medication (which helped) and followed a more strict diet. Over that years time I was also placed on an antidepressant. I had anxiety, depression, maddening memory loss and fatigue (which is NOT the same as being tired). No amount of sleep made me feel better. My body ached and I had migraines for the first time in my life. I started looking up natural remedies for this disease and stumbled upon this product. I started at 2 capsules a day as directed and by day #3 I was able to remember things! I was feeling somewhat happy again! I have been on this product for right at a month and I would recommend it to anyone that has a hypothyroid and feels like they have lost the "living" part of their life. I'm also now off the antidepressant. 
 i take synthroid 112 msg but I still have all the symptoms of hypothroidism.  I decided to select your product based on reviews and because it contained iodine and other beneficial items.  Too much iodine is not good.  I have benefitted greatly taking 1 am and 1 pm.  Thanks so much for providing me with relief from my years of misery.
 On my second bottle and what a huge difference....had half my thyroid removed and was struggling for months now my energy is back my hair started growing back would highly recommend!!!!
 After only 3 days of taking Thyroid Support, I felt super-charged. I've been on a 10,000 step program for about a year (usually doing more than the 10K, but that is my daily minimum), and it has always been a bit of a chore and a discipline, but I am noticing that, since taking Thyroid Support, it is much easier to accomplish this daily goal. I have more energy and considerably less brain fog. I am feel like my old self again - for the past two years, I have felt out of sorts, not myself - draggy, foggy, headachey. I just thought it was part of turning 50 and aging, but now I think this condition involved some nutritional and mineral deficiencies. Whatever is in this supplement is clearly something which my body needs. I'm grateful to have found it. In addition to taking 2 Thyroid Support capsules daily, I drink a liter of lemon water, a liter of hawthorn berry tea, plus ingest some other simple supplements (cayenne, cinnamon, turmeric, magnesium) twice daily. This seems to be the right cocktail for me to feel good throughout the day.
 I can only take this supplement in the evening beacause it makes me sleepy. For me, this is a wonderful thing. I have had problems sleeping since early childhood. (I am currently in my early 40's.) I have seen therapists and sleep specialists, and I have tried many sleep meds as well as different forms of meditation/relaxation techniques. While many of these help, I have never been able to sleep through the night. On a good night, I sleep for 3 hours, then wake-up every 45 minutes for the next 4 - 5 hours. Needless to say, I usually spend my days cranky and tired.<br/><br/>With these supplements I sleep for about 4 hrs, then wake up once an hour thereafter. While this may not be ideal for most, it is a treat for me. Over the past couple of months (I have been taking this since early April) I have noticed that I am not as exhausted during the day AND I have more patience at work.<br/><br/>In addition, I have lost a few pounds without trying because I am no longer hungry all the time.<br/><br/>For those of you who have a high, yet supposedly normal, TSH level, this supplement may help you.
 It gives me so much energy. I only have one complaint, if I take two a day I have absolutely no appetite. Sure that's not really a complaint for others but for me I need to eat food. I'm not taking this vitamin to lose weight I'm taking it to get healthy and have more energy and it's done just that. I feel so clear in my head and it's easier to get things done throughout the day. I highly recommend giving this product a shot.
 I have Hashimotos Thyroid Disease. I've tried several brands and I actually feel more energy taking these supplements. I waited to review this product until I had taken it for 30 days.  I will continue to purchase it.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a little over a month now and have lost 5 pounds. I have been struggling with hypothyroid for 5 years. My doctor put me on thyroid medication only and I could not lose weight. This product is wonderful!
 My TSH numbers have been elevated for two years after my yearly physical blood draw. We looked into it one year and none of my other levels were off. My fatigue has continued to get worse, affecting my ability to want to exercise and my weight has steadily crept up to 20 lbs more than I used to carry. I'm a fairly active person, I used to run 10-20 miles per week or more and go to the gym and have an active job, but I haven't had the energy to run for 6 months.<br/><br/>This year, my TSH levels were even higher and I talked to my doctor, who wanted to do a full panel looking for the cause of my fatigue because I'm only 29 and it's ridiculous that I feel like this. He did not pursue the thyroid levels but we did find my iron saturation was very low. I started that and it maybe helped a little, but decided to take the thyroid issue into my own hands.<br/><br/>I'll update after I've taken the full bottle, but after a week, I'm pleased. I've lost three pounds in a week, my energy is back and I've been able to go to the gym after work, I'm making it through the workday without feeling so exhausted that I can't function, and my mood is generally more positive. I started to notice positive energy effects after a few days. When I wake up, I feel less groggy and feel like my sleep quality is overall better.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Today is just past the two-week mark. I've lost about six pounds or so since I started and my husband has started to notice the weight loss in my face. Today, I noticed that my hair is now softer than it has been in a long time and actually looks healthier than it did. The skin on my face is also much softer and though it's almost that time of month, I haven't had a break out. Is it all related? I don't know. I've been a little tired the past couple of days, but I also haven't slept well for various reasons, though one of my co-workers told me I just seemed to have more energy over the past couple of weeks. I don't feel constantly starved either and haven't been craving carbs and desserts.<br/><br/>I did send off for a free bottle, but I would buy this again regardless of the free bottle. I may try another brand in the future just to compare, but I do have to say that this is the first supplement that I've tried in my quest to boost my energy that has worked.
 I have been taking this product for about 5 months now.  I was told by my doctors prior to taking this, that my thyroid level was way down so of course he prescribed my medication.  Instead, I choose to start on this supplement.  I take 2 of a morning.  I tried taking one of a morning and one of an evening but the evening one interrupted my sleep pattern.<br/>I ran out once, was out for about a week or so and noticed my appetite was getting out of control and since getting back on them, it has certainly stabilized.  I would recommend this product.
 Only been two weeks, but I can already see a difference in my mood and energy levels! Hoping to see some results with my thin hair. They always tell me my thyroid levels are in normal range, but I still get very weak and my moods get very negative. My mind at word gets foggy too and I forget things a lot. After starting this I feel my mind is clear at work and I'm performing better.
 I wish I had known about this supplement a long time ago. I’m 54 and have had an under active thyroid for more than a decade. It seemed that no matter how much sleep I got, I was always exhausted and it got worse when I started keeping my 15 month old granddaughter. I would sleep the entire weekend, getting up only to eat and go to the bathroom. I really could not function. I couldn’t even think. It felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. I’m a veteran with PTSD, so my anxiety was through the roof, also. The VA refused to believe my thyroid was out of whack. I’m desperation, I went to Amazon and searched for thyroid supplements and came across this one. The reviews were unbelievable. I didn’t think it was possible that a supplement could help me. Boy was I wrong. I took my first pill Sunday, expecting nothing. Well, about 45 minutes after I had taken it, I felt myself smiling. It had been many months since I had experienced a smile just because. And I wondered why I was feeling so good. And then I remembered taking the pill. My mouth practically fell to the floor. I woke up before 4 a.m. Sunday. Y’all, I didn’t stop doing things until after 8 that night. And I still wasn’t tired when I stopped. I haven’t experienced that kind of energy since I was in my early 40s. It just kind of happened. No crazy racing heart. No extreme burst of energy making me get up and do. It was a steady, constant, peaceful energy that lasted all day long! I figured this had to be some kind of fluke. But I took my supplement this morning. About 40 minutes later, here came that smile again. I was like WOW! I had a wonderful day with my granddaughter and still felt awesome when I left her for the day.  I drove into town which is an hour away and did some shopping. Got home and did some chores. It’s 10:40 p.m. right now and I have to make myself stop and head to bed. I slept great last night. I’m sure I’ll sleep just as well tonight.<br/>I truly thought I was in trouble, mentally and physically. I could not function.<br/>Man, I didn’t realize how horrible life had been for me until I took this supplement and felt human again.<br/>I love it. I am grateful for it. And I’m about to go order me 4 more bottles before they sell out. Seriously, y’all, if you feel rundown and can’t function because you think your thyroid is going crazy, try this supplement. When you do, I bet you will feel like I do. Thankful for all the people that took time to write reviews. And best of all, you will feel human again.<br/>God bless you all. Love and prayers for y’all to feel awesome. Thanks for listening.<br/><br/>My appetite has decreased and I don’t think about eating all the time. I used to eat just out of boredom, because food was in the cabinet, it made me happy. Now I hardly crave chocolate! My life has changed because of Thyroid Support. I’m so happy! And even though I’m not trying, I’ve lost 2 pounds already. Woo hoo!!
 So this is my review of the Best Thyroid Support Supplement.  This is a natural blend of herbs and vitamins designed to help your Thyroid function at full capacity.  This also came with a Free Bonus E book about "Hypothyroidism Diet &amp; Weight Loss".<br/>The purpose of this supplement is too Increase your energy &amp; avoid a lot of the symptoms you get from being hypothyroid.  This supplement is made up of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii<br/>If you are a person who has suffered the effects of a diseased Thyroid then you would know that, you would do anything you could to find an answer to the terrible side effects that come with being Hypothyroid.  I  suffer from so many ailments it is hard to list them all.  Weight gain, joint pain, puffiness, sleep disorder, exhaustion, dry skin and rashes, memory loss, hair loss etc......  Yes that many different things I have been dealing with since I first got diagnosed as Hypothyroid.  You would think that just taking the synthroid the doctors put you on would be enough to fix those problems.  Well it is not!  I am always on the search to find the perfect product to help me supplement my medication.  Now don't get me wrong the medication took care of some of the issues I first had.  Like the Giant Gotter I got when I first got sick, but it has done little to address all the other issues I have suffered with.  Why?  Well I think it is a lot more complicated then even Doctor's know about and I believe the answer is in nature.<br/>  Your thyroid is part of your Adrenal system. The thyroid has important roles to regulate numerous metabolic processes throughout the body.  Your thyroid operates like a Thermostat of sorts for your body. When it is impaired it can't produce the t-cells your body needs to operate properly.  So many different things can effect the thyroid system.  So it would make sense to think that it would take many things to set it right, if it is not working properly.  Mine is caused by an Auto Immune Disorder.<br/>  A lack of Iodine can cause thyroid problems.  Natural minerals we get from food, work to keep our thyroid working properly.  But with today's diets, most people are not getting the proper nutrition needed for our bodies to get those minerals.  I could go on and on!  But back to this supplement.  With all the research I have done, the ingredient's in this supplement are what the Top Endocrine Doctors in the world agree you should take, to help the Adrenal system work properly.  Ashwaghanda root works to control cortisol in the body, Iodine deficiency symptoms manifest as a result of improper thyroid hormone production.  Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland. Copper is known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of immune system function.  Coleus Forskohlii Root, a member of the mint family, Coleus promotes weight management. So this supplement  addresses a lot of the issues that arise from a poorly functioning thyroid system.  I will have to take this for at least a few weeks to see just how well this works and will update my review then.  No side effects so far.<br/>I received this free for product testing and review.

 I've been taking this over the last 3 weeks and I haven't felt this great in a long time! I have reverse T3 hypothyroidism, which has made it very difficult to lose weight. I'd already made some dietary changes at the advice of my former naturopathic doctor, but weight loss was still slow and my energy was not there. Now that I've been taking these twice daily, I fall asleep soundly by 10 and wake up ready for the day between 5:30-6. I've lost almost 10 pounds in 3 weeks. Will be a happy customer for life!
 My wife was diagnosed with having hypothyroidism but wasn't bad enough to get meds. We lost insurance and she got a lot worse. I bought these hoping they would help and she says they are a "Miracle".<br/>She has a lot more energy, her metabolism increased significantly, she doesn't bloat as bad, she has hair growing back instead of falling out, she isn't depressed anymore, and she only takes one pill a day vs. two a day that the bottle says.
 First I'd like to correct the angry people on here who are assuming this company bribes people with a free bottle in trade for a fake review: the free bottle does NOT require a review! It's a bonus whether we review this product or not.<br/><br/>My review: I've been taking this for two months, now. I've found I have to take one tablet per day instead of two, which is standard for me because I'm sensitive to herbs and medicines.<br/><br/>This supplement was immediately mood-stabilizing for me! My hair growth already seems a little stronger, too. Most importantly, though, my last period was more bearable. I didn't buy this product for my periods, but will buy it again for this reason alone. I have a condition similar to endometriosis and suffer deeply each month. It's INCREDIBLE to find some relief from that, and so quickly! These have been the highlights of this supplement for me.<br/><br/>I'll update this if I notice anything else after more time using them.
 A functional medicine doctor friend of mine recommended I take a selenium and iodine supplement to assist my poor, tired thyroid. I take pig thyroid, but still suffer from fatigue and poor sleep. I've been taking this product for 3 weeks. I chose it because it was so much more than a selenium/iodine supplement. Lots of good synergistic herbs and micronutrients plus way more selenium and iodine than other products I looked at. In three weeks I can feel a little more energized and I'm having slightly better sleep. I hope to be able to edit/update this review after I've been taking this for 2-3 months.
 One of the most effective supplements that my grandmother has taken to alleviate her ongoing thyroid-related issues. She has been on thyroid medication for most of her life, but has recently suffered from the medical laboratory's mandated decrease in dosage (strictly according to her values), which takes a toll on her actual sense of well-being. As can be researched online, this is a subject of concern among many thyroid patients, especially those who are limited in their choice of health providers.<br/><br/>Upon starting this bottle, she has reported feeling more energetic and more positive in her mood. Her hair and nails improved remarkably, as well as her skin (which was dry and would crack and bleed). She occasionally forgets to take it, and typically feels the difference during those days. It seems that there are cognitive benefits to taking this for people with thyroid issues, and while I don't know if this is because of the Ashwagandha (a nootropic) or an overall effect of boosting thyroid function, it's obviously a really important benefit!<br/><br/>The only potential drawback that she has observed has been that if the supplement is taken on an empty stomach, it can cause some pretty strong nausea, though she has never gotten sick from it. She has been able to work around it easily enough by only taking it after a full meal.<br/><br/>I will be purchasing these for my mother as well, who has been recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism after suffering for years with the symptoms, and possibly eventually for myself.
 I just received my first bottle of thyroid support 4 days ago and I take 2 a day (1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner). I haven't made any other changes to my eating habits or lifestyle and I feel like a million bucks. I feel awake, alert and happy which is drastically different than I have felt over the past year dealing with symptoms of hypothyroidism. The only 2 things that I noticed negatively were mild headaches and insomnia for the first 2 days....now I feel great. I will post an update after taking them for 2 full weeks.
 I have been taking these for little over a week and since have had worsening depression and mood swings. I have a history of depression, but had not been in a depressed mood prior. The last few days have caused me worsening depression, and the only change in diet has been these pills. They also have made me extremely tired with little energy, I've been sleeping 12-18 hours a day and not able to get up and work.<br/><br/>I am not saying they aren't good, I'm just saying that I wouldn't recommend them for someone who has a history of depression.
 It works!  I've been sick with metal toxins (old dental fillings/crowns) &amp; root canal infections, which are being extracted.  But I was feeling exhausted and fatigue.  Metal toxins effect red blood cell (air hunger), adrenal and thyroid (had mild low thryoid but got worst with metal toxins)  Once I started taking these, I felt better and able to be more alert to work on good days.  Slowly recovering...but still a battle with good and bad days from metal detoxing.  These have help me feel better.
 I had a very bad reaction after the first dose. I took my first dose with food as recommended, which upset my stomach. On the second dose, my stomach hurt so bad I was doubled over in pain for 24 hrs straight. I stopped taking it immediately but decided to try again a couple weeks later. I took it on an empty stomach and did not have any stomach problems. However, I had immediate loss of appetite. After a few days, maybe a week, I noticed excessive sweating and waking up at night with hot flashes. I also developed a weird acne or dermatitis on my face and neck. I stopped taking it and this time threw out the rest. It did not do anything to help my symptoms which I still believe to be related to my thyroid hormone. In fact this product seemed to make the problem worse not better.
 I thought I would share this review and shed light on possible undesired results. I started taking one capsule daily for thyroid support. I have “sub-clinical” TSH values and periodic fatigue. I started taking these Sept 1, 2018 and weighed 129lbs. I worked out 6 days/week (running 3 miles 3 days/week; strength training 2 days/week for 30’, and walking 6-7 miles 6 days/week at a brisk pace). I ate balanced meals with limited sweets and minimal alcohol. I have no medical problems and am on no other medications. My weight ballooned to 138 pounds over the month that I was taking these. I have never been that heavy and couldn’t understand how I gained this weight with my activity level. I am 5’5.5 and am struggling to get back to my prior weight. This is the only new thing I added to my routine. I’m glad this has done so much for so many. This was not a good choice for me. I am now at 135 lbs 6 weeks post discontinuation of this supplement.
 I have been struggling with exhaustion, weight gain, and hair loss. Even after working out it just drained me rather than give me energy. I kept having my thyroid checked and the doctor always said it was fine. I know it’s not! I did have Cushing’s Disease when I was 18 and while I’m not like I was, I have never returned back to myself. I don’t have those “half moons” on my nails either. I can sleep all day and still be tired. I’m only 33 with an 8 year old and a 1 year old; I don’t have time to sleep all day!! I gave this a shot and immediately I felt a huge energy boost! Not shaky caffeine energy, but TRUE energy. I thought it might be a “placebo effect” so I didn’t want to get my hopes up. But now it’s been 2 weeks and I’m still energized, happy, and can be the mom I need to be! I haven’t weighed myself and I think it’s too early to see any weight loss but I know I’m burning way more calories because I’m more active. I do find if I go too long without eating I can get nauseated. It reminds me to eat smaller more frequent meals. I also notice I urinate a lot more often. No biggie! I’m so grateful I found this product!!
 I have been taking this product for about two weeks and from the very first day I started to consume this product I have noticed a dramatic change. For years I have suffered from fatigue, bad blood circulation, hair loss, and weight gain.  It seemed like no matter what products or exercises I did I could not lose the weight for anything. I've had blood work done and not even my own doctors couldn't evev figure out why I was going through such a hard time. So I came to the conclusion of doing my own research to save myself from what was potentially hurting me. My research showed that I had the same symptoms of an underactive thyroid, I continued to seek a supplement that would help produce what my Thyroid was lacking. I came across "Thyroid Support" on Amazon in hopes of getting my life back like all products that I've tried I took a risk, and with this product within the 1st day I noticed a boost of energy, with 2 weeks I've noticed blood circulation flow, weight loss, and my hair and eyebrows started growing back as well. Now I'm not telling anyone to do as I did but I feel like I am slowly getting my life back and for the first time in 6 years I feel younger and I now know that it was indeed my thyroid. It's always a wonderful thing when you can feel like yourself and do several task without feeling like it's impossible. I will continue to buy this product only through the wonderful results that I am very pleased to see.
 I have used this product.for a couple of months now.  My hair had been thinning drastically, and I now have lots of new growth.  I have also lost five pounds after trying a variety of diet aids and exercises without results.  My skin was so dry that it flaked off on my clothes.  That is 100% better.  This is the only thing I've tried that actually made a difference.  If you think your thyroid may be causing weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, etc., this product is definitely worth trying.
 I have had my thyroid taken out, and have been on thyroid medication but I was still feeling fatigued. I was a zombie for a few months. I got on Amazon looking for armor thyroid, and I found this product... I read the reviews and I thought why not. This product has changed my life! I feel so much better. My mind is clear, I am staying awake past 6pm... I would recommend you listen to your body and take care of yourself. I've been taking this for 2 months now and just bought my third months pills... LOVE IT!!
 Ok, I stopped my 88mcg Synthroid 2 days before I started on 1 Body Thyroid Support and it was hell with some weird withdrawals ( It was my decision to stop because Synthroid gave me embarrasing facial flushing) Anyway day 1 I was at 147lbs... days 1-5 taking 1 pill in the mornings of1 Body Thyroid Support was still rough. Days 6-10 I started with the recommended 1 in morning and 1 in evening and things got MUCH better. I have the energy to do my 1 hour aerobic workouts and I go to sleep and wake up refreshed. So far I am loving it! Will keep taking and hope it keeps helping with weight loss as I am now Sept 2st 2016 at 142lbs!  With the Synthroid I was gaining weight even though my blood work showed normal...and with this supplement I am actually losing weight! Very Very Excited.Note: I also started taking multivtamins/multiminerals in liquid form and a nightly pill of Milk Thistle to detox.  :-)<br/> Please fell free to ask at a later time for updates!
 I have used this product for a few years and have loved how wonderful it improved my health. I have fibro and extreme fatigue with borderline thyroid.<br/>However- the company must have changed its formula or either its capsule coating- because for months I developed such severe acid reflux - my throat severely burned- nausea. Reflux so bad- the powder from capsule refluxed completely back up. I literally had powdered burps that blew like a smoker out my mouth and nose.. mixed with stomach acids.<br/>I quit all supplants and vitamins for two weeks... then took one capsule of the thyroid supplement- and was sick again for two days.  I quit all supplements again for a week.  I am taking all EXCEPT this thyroid one.... and am perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Why do companies change something when it was perfect already??  Greed  over making their formula cheaper????<br/>And of course it’s beyond the time I can get a refund. Deeply saddened since this thyroid supplement had originally made such a positive difference to my health.
 I was feeling so lethargic, brain fog, a bit depressed, not motivated, so cold all of the time, and so many more unpleasant symptoms. The list could go on and on. I had my TSH levels tested including T3 and T4, much to my surprise, they were NORMAL. I was shocked. At a loss for what to do next, I started doing more research and also spoke to someone that has a nursing background.  She advised me to get more iodine in my system and a few other things. I came across Thyroid Support, read most of the reviews, many sharing the same symptoms and also test results I have.  So many said this was a life changer. I read the ingredients, I knew I was not taking my B12 as I should and I also saw that Thyroid Support had many things in it, that I was not getting in my regular diet. I took a chance, ordered a bottle, and around day 2 or 3 I noticed I had some clarity, the fog was lifting. I also noticed an increase in my energy.  Nothing uncomfortable, no heart racing type feelings, I was just able to do more in a day and not feel like a truck hit me. I've just passed my 2nd week of being on them and I will be staying on them! I am also going to purchase their Adrenal Support. I am so happy that I am starting to feel myself again. Many thanks 1 Body!!!
 After about a week of taking thyroid support I started noticing a change in my energy levels..especially in the afternoons and early evenings. I used to come home and be exhausted every day and barely accomplish dinner for the family, let alone clean up and do anything extra before falling asleep. Now I am getting so much more done in my days and not dozing off while relaxing and watching tv. My moods have also really stabilized. I am starting my second bottle and excited to see some of the longer term effects others have seen like hair regrowth and weightloss.
 my Dr was hard pressed to comprehend my low dose of thyroid meds and improving numbers. i am getting retested. but i like taking less prescription. prefer OTC meds if at all possible<br/>UPDATE 09/11/18: just got my thyroid numbers today. for 12 years i struggled with whacky thyroid after whiplash from car accident &amp; miscarriage--sending my health down a dark rabbit hole. I found &amp; bought this &amp; started August 7, 2018. I take 1 capsule 2 times a day. so I take 1 cap in mid morning with breakfast at 9am &amp; 1 cap in afternoon with what is my evening meal at 3pm.. I just got my thyroid levels tested on September 4. so only one month using Thyroid Support. My numbers are all normal!!! I have not been normal in 12 years. Struggled thru getting diagnosed because i was always super healthy. then failed effects of Levothyroxine and the ever evil Synthroid, followed by Armour thryoid and now Nature-Throid ( by RLC Labs). i kept weaning self off scripts to low dose...then found this &amp; now I am within healthy ranges of all my thyroid tests...barely taking any scripts. I am on my 2nd bottle of Thyroid Support &amp; hope to get off scripts fully. This supplement is so amazing--because when i went script free my TSH went up to 130. Now TSH is 0.39 !!!! My T3 Free  went from 1.0 to 4.6 (a tad high but im happy). T4 Free went from 0.25 to 0.84 --normal --middle of range!! AMAZING! so worth buying. Try this first before going on Prescriptions as they cause so many many issues the worst of which is HUGE weight gain &amp; tumors. one month--one bottle amazing results. i kid you not!
 This product has changed my life. I’ve only been on it for 2 weeks and I can’t believe the difference in my general well being as well as increased activity level. I don’t want to be dramatic but this product really is life changing. I used to struggle to get out of bed every morning. Now I jump up ready to go. Jobs around the house that I used to put off indefinitely are now done without even thinking about it.  I could go on and on. Truly a life changing product. I have not been paid to write this!
 I haven't been diagnosed with a Thyroid issue, but many people have told me my symptoms are exactly what it sounds like. I was always tired, constantly cold, had dietary issues, etc. Instead of going to the Doctor and spending thousands on tests, I thought I would give this supplement a try. The first 2 weeks I was starting to think it wasn't going to help and I would need to go do all the tests. I decided to stick with it for 1 more week and I am noticing a HUGE difference!! I didn't truly notice it until my friends and boyfriend pointed it out to me. We were at a restaurant eating outside and they were talking about how cold it was. I said "cold? It feels perfect out here". They look at me in complete dismay. I was always the cold one, but for once my body temperature was regulating. I've also noticed that it's much easier for me to wake in the morning, I love exercising (because I now have the energy), I have a real appetite, and my emotions seem more upbeat (among other things). I will continue taking these and hope to see more improvement. THANK YOU!! I feel so much better!
 It is a great relief to have warm hands and feet this winter--hands in particular.  This 1 Body product gives me that the majority of the day.  I've been using it for half a month, and I look forward to more good changes in my body.  I will definitely order this product again.  It is so hard to find something that actually works these days and here it is!
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for about three weeks and just ordered my free second month. If it hadn't worked, I wouldn't have bothered.<br/><br/>My doctor did a battery of tests on my thyroid and although one of them showed a result that indicated low thyroid function, the overall diagnosis was that I was fine. But I didn't feel fine. I was tired all the time, had trouble sleeping (I still do), and had bouts of vertigo. The big difference I experienced with this product was an increase in my energy level. I noticed it after only a few days but wanted to wait to see if it continued and it did. The vertigo is gone as well, so I figure two out of three is a pretty good result. I'm happy and will continue taking this product.
 I’ve gained over 50 pounds this year without much change in diet.  I noticed I’m exhausted all the time, to the point that a short walk started giving muscle fatigue like I had done a spinning class.  My period has been missing for almost a year except for a month when induced with progesterone by a fertility doctor.  I’m 44 and was told the only slight possibility of pregnancy would be forking over $50k for donated eggs and IVF.  I got these supplements bc I suspect that thyroid wasn’t checked enough.  2 weeks in and it’s amazing how much better I feel.  Fatigue is much reduced.  Feeling like I can restart some regular gym routine.  Libido increased.  Happier.  And most ‘wow!’, I got a normal cycle!  Will follow up w regular doctor for more thyroid testing, and use ovulation predictor strips to see if ovulation follows.  Very happy customer so far!
 I've known for a long time that I've needed help with my thyroid. Ten years ago I began using Armor thyroid, and the difference in my energy level and clear-headedness was immediate. Lately, though, I've begun to wonder why so many Americans complain of thyroid problems, and I began to question why my thyroid was sluggish in the first place, especially because my energy level and metabolism were so excellent through my 40's. I began reading about the restoration of health through diet, and everything I read talked about the effects of refined food on thyroid function, so I began eating differently while researching thyroid support supplements. Clean eating helped, but didn't do the whole job, so I decided to try a thyroid support supplement. I looked at several, and when I came across 1Body, I was impressed not only by the ingredients, but by the LACK of ingredients: no magnesium stearate or any other superfluous fillers. I haven't given the supplement 5 stars because I've only been taking it for a few days, but I can honestly say that this morning I awoke with absolutely NO morning sluggishness. I was (and am) clear headed without caffeine, and eager for the day. This is exactly the effect that Armor thyroid had on me when I first started taking it ten years ago.  I will update my review and add the 5th star after I've taken it for awhile and can write in detail the changes that I experience.
 This product has really helped to aid in my new thyroid regimen, switching from synthetic to NDT replacement therapy.  It provides you with the supplements you need when managing hypothyroidism, and the quantities that will be the most beneficial.  I feel better now than I have in the last 13 years, when an infection fried my thyroid and the doctor put me on Synthroid.  After many hours of research, this is the product I chose, and I have not been disappointed!  Good luck to all my fellow thyroid sufferers ~
 I waited to review this product to give my honest opinion.  I take 2 per day (1 morning + 1 dinner)  After lab tests coming back normal and nothing out of wack, Dr. had no reason for my hair loss.  I could tell over months and the shower drain, my hands while washing/rinsing hair that it was falling out.  I have always had thin, baby fine texture type hair.  This is the only change in my dietary habits or medications.  I replaced my shower mat and can report that the hair loss has STOPPED!!!!.  I don't feel different in anyway and no side effects (good or bad) except the hair has stopped falling out, which is reason enough for me to continue buying and taking this stuff.  I will be going back to get lab work again in a couple months and am curious to see what the difference will be.
 I took this almost full bottle. but its damaging your LIVER. the doctor took my 3 blood tests from different labs. they said" something you took which damage your LIVER. when I checked label thoroughly. It's NOT MADE IN USA. it's Tricky.. " they write Assembled in the USA." its Vitamin, not a SpaceX. Please be careful.. even my some siblings suggest me a go through Lawsuit ..
 So I ordered this supplement for my thyroid. I ordered last week Wednesday and it came on Friday! I began taking it on Monday Jan 21. The first day I took it I took only one pill because I knew what my body could handle and it wasn't the recommended dosage. So I took it on a empty stomach, now let just saw do not take it on a empty stomach. It states to say a little food when taking it so yes eat food! Trust me by midday I had the worst headache! It kept getting worse throughout the day until I slept. So do your self a favor and eat when taking and drink water! Now I have only been on it for 3 days, I will update this review after finishing the whole bottle but let me say the second day was way better then the first. I woke up went to work took the pill with food and it gave me energy throughout the day, not yje kind of energy people on here were talking about but enough energy that I wasn't yawning and just wanting a nap. I was good, now another thing I noticed while on this supplement is that I haven't been eating as much! I don't feel hungry at all, before I just wanted to eat constantly never feeling full. I didn't eat Monday and Tuesday I just ate dinner and let me tell you it was the portion I eat. Usually after eating in an hour I get hungry and go eat. I didn't feel any hungry or the need to eat at alll!! Now I'm not saying it's a curve appetite supplement everyone is different and their bodies react differently. But I have to say that I feel much better on these pills than I did on any other medication I took for thyroid. I'm also not on any other supplement incase you guys wanted to know it might me the affects of other things I'm taking, I'm only on this supplement. I've slept better, I don't go pee as often as I did. I have energy that lasts me to the end of my day. So far so good. I did start exercising this week also so maybe I'll lose weight also, many people said they lost weight so let's see. I'll come back and update once I finish the bottle!
 I started having trouble with Synthroid and Levithyroxin prescriptions a few years ago- they simply weren't working and I was seriously hypothyroid.  I switched to WP Thyroid on the advise of a naturopath, and did very well on it, but it wasn't covered by my insurance.  When I left my high-pressure, high-stress job for a much lower paying job, I couldn't afford the WP Thyroid.  I purchased this product and slowly weaned myself off the WP to see what would happen.  I am on my second bottle, have been off the WP for 6 weeks now and feel great.  I have absolutely no hypothyroid symptoms at all.  I have tons of energy, my hair is shiny and not falling out, my joints don't ache.....if you are hypothyroid you know this a a big deal. I am sending a bottle to my daughter who is also hypothyroid.  I have never found a supplement that works this well.
 Recent bloodwork indicated my Free T4, Free T3 and TSH numbers were slightly below the normal range. Oh My Goodness. I wish I had found this sooner. I started sleeping better, waking up feeling rested, and that alone can fix so many health issues. I was also feeling more energetic throughout the day, not even feeling an afternoon slump or desire to nap. I feel like myself again and have happily returned to enjoying an active lifestyle with my family and friends. I prefer natural remedies to prescription medications - this product delivered for me. I plan to continue Thyroid Support and I love this product. I highly recommend this supplement. THANK YOU BODY 1!
 I know many people say they don’t take the time to write reviews but i REALLY never do. However i have to say...this stuff is AMAXING!!! Energy like I’ve never had before. Approaching 48 yrs old and was having horrible issues with fatigue and weight gain (8-10lbs) and this stuff is almost like a miracle in pill form. I take one in the morning and one around 4pm every day. I haven’t worked out in 4 yrs and was begging &amp; pleading with myself to get back to going regularly but thr fatigue was just too bad. I was letting myself down, day after day. Started browsing the amazon site and first ordered something called rhoodia (??) which helped but ever so slightly then i decided to try this and jack pot!! Unless something changes with my body (hormones shifting etc..)  i will be on this for life!!
 Before buying this product I felt like everything that could go wrong with my thyroid was going wrong, even after the test came back ok from the dr. Now even 6 mths after taking this I still feel better than ever. I wanted to wait to give a review because I wanted to make sure it lasted but I'm telling ya it has. My energy is still up, it has boosted my sex drive to back when I was in my 20's. I'm a 34 yr old woman and I'm feeling 25 and this product has helped me some much (and my husband is happy too)
 I have been struggling for 8 years with low thyroid yet my dr. took a wait and see approach while I struggled with sheer exhaustion every day.  It got to the point that I could not even work but I just could not find any help.  I had taken your adrenal support and felt so much better that when I saw that you made a thyroid support, I had to try it.  I have so much more energy now and feel like I am getting my "old" self back!  THANK YOU!!!
 I have been taking these supplements for 3 weeks now and I can proudly say that I have noticed a significant difference in my body.  I am so grateful for these supplements, I no longer have the annoying tightness around my throat, I am not as tired as I usually am, and my hair stopped falling out.  I overall feel so much better.  I am currently taking 1 tablet of the Thyroid Support with one tablet of Adrenal Support from 1 Body, and I am so pleased with how I am feeling these days.  I do notice when I forget to take my supplements I can start to feel the tightness around my throat again, however if I take my supplements like I should, I have no problems.
 I read the book the Autoimmune solution and I started looking for the recommended supplements there to treat Hashimoto  and Sjogrens. I Found this product and it contains exactly all of them. It is nice to have to only take one pill instead of a bunch added to the other supplements I take. I have big hopes for this product. The customer service is great, and  the container  last for one month.
 Bought this for a problem I had and thought this product cud help me solve my problems after reading countless reviews. I made a mistake in purchasing this . My throat begun tightening but I didn't relate that to this supplement until I stopped taking it. Am not sure which ingredient am allergic to since I don't have any allergies I cud think of. But just to say ,this isn't for me and beware of anything that goes into your body.
 I purchased this product along with the adrenal support supplements.<br/>I take 1 in the morning, and the adrenal support in the evening.<br/>It's been a full week, and I feel very energized and clear-headed.<br/>I was struggling with extreme fatigue despite plenty of sleep and my mind felt foggy and body felt sluggish.<br/>I feel fantastic and have had no side-effects.<br/>I do make sure I take this on a full stomach right after breakfast with plenty of water.<br/>I do not believe this is just a placebo effect because after reading all of the reviews I expected these to give me horrible side-effects.<br/>To my pleasant surprise, I've had none, and feel fantastic.
 I had been diagnosed with a Hypothyroid and was prescribed Levothyroxin 100mcg after my son's birth. My condition prior to seeing my PCP were hair loss, memory loss and retention, weakness, tiredness, vision impaired, skin dryness, slurred speech, joint stiffness, depression, swelling of my face and neck, and pain when swallowing were among many other symptoms. My doctor prescribed taking two 100mcg Levothyroxin pills a day for the next three days, and one per day thereafter. I've been on Levothyroxin for the past two years, although it has helped me it has not solved many of my symptoms, after relating this to my PCP many times and asked to revise and make sure that I'm on the right dosage he insists that it is normal. So faced with this challenge of still feeling not quite myself and tired of feeling tired, I decided to look into what I needed to do to fix this problem. I began my research and found 1 Body Thyroid Support it had all of the ingredients essential to help the thyroid function, there were no fillers and all natural. I have been taking them for the past month and a half and have noticed a significant change in my energy levels, my hair growth, and my overall health. I will continue to take this supplement as it has helped me. I take it at night as to not combine or have it interfere with my Thyroid medication.
 This right here gave me my entire life! I felt like my health had been declining for 4 years. Drs would run blood tests and tell I was fine, although I had low energy and depression. I felt disconnected from my body. I had a blood test for bioidentical hormones and found out that my TSH was high and my T3 was low. I decided against the hormones and purchased this because it was the best seller. I felt better after the first pill. My energy and focus are back and my depression is gone. I feel connected to my body again.
 This product has given a lot of benefits. I have the slowest  metabolism on the planet. Since taking this product, I can see a huge difference in my constant weight gain. I'm on my second bottle now. I wish I knew all this time that my thyroid was main reason for my weight and my Difficulty To Loose Weight.
 Every bottle the color of capsules is different which makes me question the the quality. I've had 3 bottles now and have had my tsh tested before and after and no change.so no more for me at 23.00 per bottle.
 I had my thyroid checked due to lack of energy, weight gain and hair loss. They told me my levels was off enough for medication . I searched for a supplement to help and found this one to have the best reviews. I started out taking it twice a day but noticed my Stomach got upset. I cut back to taking it once a day in the morning and it went away. I was glad I found this product! But I have not seen a change in my energy, my mood same<br/>After taking these for 2 months I had to stop using them. I noticed  my scalp itched all the time, it woke me up at night it was so bad. I thought it was the shampoo . Finally it occurred to me to  stop taking this product. Within a few day of stopping my scalp stopped itching a lot. It may work for some people but I was obviously allergic to it. Disappointed I had hope for improvement
 I have purchased this product 3 times, every single time it has come with as a completely different color. Not just the capsule I am talking about the color of the powers. The third time it was tanish/beige and taste and smells like straight ashawaganda. Tell me how it is this color if it has cayenne pepper in it???? It is a completely different product this third time around and I am questioning if they even check their products before shipping them. Not to mention they advertise a different form of b-12 and I this is clearly false advertising.
 I am 29 years old and have been feeling like an 80 year old for the last couple of years. Couldn't hardly walk after a day at work and was passing out at 5 or 6 pm. I had a lot of symptoms and after trying a verity of solutions I thought I would give this a try. I legitimately feel 15 years younger than I am. I am in my 2nd week taking this and I am sleeping more soundly, waking up easier and able to do more throughout the day without pain. I couldn't recommend this product enough.
 I'm so glad I found Thyroid Support. I have more energy, my hair is not falling out as much and I have been slowing losing weight.
 So far so good with this supplement. I am having positive results as far as feeling more balanced and energetic. I will continue to take this going forward. I am also seeing  nail and hair growth improving which has me feeling super optimistic. Health does not deteriorate over night and neither does taking a supplement make immediate improvement. However because I am seeing and feeling positive results within 2-3 weeks of starting this supplement I am excited to continue and see how much more positivity can come from its' benefits.
 I take multiple supplements, including Thyroid Support by 1 Body. I started taking it about 3 months ago, and I wouldn't change a thing! I cannot tell for sure if it is only Thyroid Support, or the combination with other supplements, but my metabolism and body composition has changed so fast! I can eat like a normal person and keep losing weight! It's been a miracle and I will keep taking it everyday, twice a day.<br/><br/>I took sea salt (with no iodine) for many years and I think this is helping me from a severe iodine deficiency, among other things.
 This is the best thyroid supplement on the market.  I've tried a few after my doctor said I was ok, but he would monitor my levels and retest.  I am always tired, have extremely dry skin, and I'm ALWAYS cold.  I've tried several other supplements, but none helped like this one.  My energy levels are much better, and I've noticed that my hair isn't thinning like it was!  My hands and feet aren't always freezing and I'm feeling better all over.  I highly recommend this supplement!
 I met with my doctor since I wasn't feeling low energy and overall unhealthy and after doing some blood work found that my reverse t3 was rather high. I have hypothyroidism everywhere in my family genetics and reverse t3 is a precursor to that. My doctor recommended I take a thyroid supplement that will support my thyroid and hopefully prevent me from having to take a thyroid medication. So far after a couple months I've been feeling much better on this. I take this before I sleep and it knocks me out allowing me to sleep really well! I even tried taking a different brand and things did not go so well, I couldn't sleep at all on the other one. This is the best brand I've tried yet and I highly recommend it!
 I started taking Thyroid support because I do not want to take a prescribed thyroid medication and my thyroid issue isn't severe. The main reasons for taking it were to try to increase energy and lose weight. I have only been taking it for two weeks and haven't been totally consistent, but on the days where I take it morning and night I notice a huge difference.  My suspicion is that if I am disciplined and take it twice daily as recommended, after a couple of months I will notice a big difference. I plan on using it long term to see how things go. I will definitely order it again and update this review as I have more experiences with the effects.
 I bought this product to supplement bone growth. It's no secret that the thyroid and the parathyroid both secrete hormone that is vital for proper bone density and growth. I recently fell three and a half stories breaking both legs (pilot fractures), compression fractures in the the vertebrae, and a dislocated elbow. With a very clean diet, proper supplementation (of which Thyroid Support is crucial), weekly massages to reduce inflammation, and weekly acupuncture to clear blockages/heal bone/reduce inflammation/etc....I'm 6 weeks out (accident March 6th vs. today April 21st) and I'm already walking again! Thank you 1 Body Thyroid Support for being a crucial part of my healing team!
 First attempt at taking this supplement and I three up immediately. Non stop until everything I ate was out. I felt weak after. Scary reaction. I will try a second attempt and update if reaction is same or better. But if this product isn't the same as the great reviews previously then this company needs to go back to the previous supplement.<br/>Update: I have taken supplement 2x a day as instructed with big meals. Small snack meals won't cut it. Drink lots of water and best to take pill in between eating meal to help keep the pill down. Burping it up happens and its nasty. Too early to see results but at least I can swallow it without vomiting. Some nausea may occur.
 I have been taking Iodine products for a few months now and I have seen some new hair growth and that is very important to me.  I take Synthroid and I still gain weight very slowly and find it hard to shed a few pounds.  My 73 year old joints are having a problem carrying the extra thirty I need to lose, in spite of my teaching a yoga class twice a week for mature people.  I keep looking for better products and  came across this one.  First of all it is vegetarian which is important to me.  The reviews were great.  The ingredients are more than iodine and research supports their benefits for the thyroid.  I may have Hashimotos and another persons feedback said that the ingredients in combination will not be harmful for Hashimotos Thyroiditis.  Anyway I come into this with an open mind and I am very hopeful that it will improve the quality of my life.  As time goes on I will follow up on the results.
 I am taking this because another supplement that I had to stop had iodine in it and I was able to cut way back on my Armour Thyroid medication while using it. Taking two of this product about doubles the amt of that older product I had to stop (the dosage in this is perfectly safe based on all the research I have done) so now I am testing it to see if I can cut out even more of my thyroid meds. I am in my mid-50s and my thyroid med is the only med I take and it is my goal to not take any meds at all. I do not like the medical-industrial complex and its effort to get us all on as many expensive drugs as possible. Right now it is working well; I will find out if I can get off my Armour thyroid in March, when I get some blood work (It usually takes about a month for your body to fully respond, I have found.)
 This product is insanely effective. I am 30M with hypothyroidism and was put on synthroid at age 24 when my tsh (or is it t4?) level showed 6. I've stuck with the same medical dosage and my thyroid readings are okay but not enough to warrant a higher dose. So I've turned to supplements. I've tried several and they are all VERY effective for me but this one is the strongest by far. I was sleeping about 10 hours a day and was exhausted the entire day even with my medication. With this supplement I am sleeping about 7-8 hours a night and am not tired until after 6pm which is amazing. I'm a bit<br/>concerned they might be spiking it with real thyroid hormone because apparently that's a thing from some research on the web.<br/>If you really have hypothyroidism you need a real doctor but this can help make your treatment much more effective.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's post partum. My TPO was above 900! Main symptoms were weight gain, goiter and severe hair loss, low energy. It is now my third week and my hair loss almost seized, my thyroid is significantly smaller but not to its normal size and my energy levels have improved. I will keep taking these capsules and hope that even a greater improvement will be noticed!. I did also re-adapt my diet and have completely stopped eating ''Goitrogenic' veggies such as broccoli , cauliflower, brussel sprouts, etc... I highly recommend tis product and advise that you be patient.... Good luck!
 I have been struggling with high TSH levels for two years. I am an athlete and work out excessively in training while eating well and still was not seeing the results I should. I also have been experiencing symptoms with melesma, night sweats, low energy/brain fog,trouble with body temp regulation and heart flutters. I am hoping to try Thyroid Support as a natural supplement to aid my frustrations and symptoms and feel great again.
 This is a great product! Will buy again! Thank you for getting my health back to normal so I can function normal everyday, with my hormones and better sleep. Try this product, you will be very happy.<br/><br/>I love love love this amazing product.<br/>I have Hashimoto's and low hypothyroidism, labs are low but not low enough for doctor to put me on medication. I have so many symptoms. Fatigued all the time and hair falling out and sleep issues but she is a miracle pil to help with everything! I'm almost 41 and feel better already with this.
 This supplement was such a huge support for me before I was able to get on thyroid medication for my Hashimoto's Disease.  I have been suffering from low energy and just plain feeling sick.  I started this and it helped with my energy levels and enough for my goiter to go down so I could eat.  Definitely worth a try for those with thyroid issues.
 After just two weeks, I feel like I have more energy than I've had in months. I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and did a lot of reading on supplements and decided to try this one. I'm glad I did. I was tired of being tired all the time. I'm hoping that this is my new norm and that I will be able to lose weight. After years and years of stuggling with fatigue, I finally have the help I was looking for. I'll write another review in a month or two to let everyone know how it's going.
 I am very happy (if not a bit envious) of those who have realized notable results using this supplement.<br/>But, alas, I didn't experience any improvements or changes..<br/>I started the supplement (1 tablet a day) about 60 days before my recent labwork (which included a thyroid panel).  I've felt no difference, slept no difference, noted any difference in energy levels,, no improvement in clarity or focus (though I could probably use it!)  nor saw any noted improvements in my recent lab results when compared to those 3 months ago.<br/>And I so wanted to...<br/>Now, I wish that I had been fast enough to test the 100% refund offer (within 60 days).
 They market this as a thyroid support supplement when it actually is just the same supplements used for weight loss. They are just making different claims!<br/>Every time I have tried any of these supplements they actually knock my thyroid (tsh level) out of range. I now have to have my synthroid adjusted (I am hypo) The doctor once again told me all of these supplements are garbage! That’s it .....I’m listening to my doctor from now on! I pay the price every time ......<br/>All of these glowing reviews are suspect to me!!!!!!!!
 I have been taking this supplement for a little over 3 weeks. It is easy to take and there is no gross aftertaste or queasiness. (In fact, my women's One a Day has more of an adverse effect on my stomach).<br/><br/>While I have not lost any weight, it has given me more energy and greater clarity of thought. Before I started taking this, I frequently felt disconnected with foggy thoughts, and I could barely find the will to do normal activities. It also does not rely on ramping up your energy levels with B vitamins as other thyroid pills do (which for me, leads to hot flashes, a racing heart, and horrible sweats.)<br/><br/>The most noticeable differences are the fact that I'm not retaining water (I had no idea how much I was retaining so much!) and that my face is not nearly as puffy (again, I had no idea!) Despite not actually losing any weight, I actually had family ask if I had lost weight because my face seemed to have slimmed down. Keep in mind, I have an athletic build and lift weights, as well as do martial arts, so I'm not overweight (although I would like to lose some vanity pounds) but the difference was noticeable to my family.<br/>Also, bonus! No more uncomfortable constipation plus my hands and feet aren't nearly as cold as they used to be.<br/><br/>Overall, a good product and I will definitely keep taking. Just be aware that when you buy this company's products, they WILL email you incessantly for a review. Not horrible since they will also offer you discounts, but it could be annoying for some people.
 I have had trouble with Hypothyroidism and take medication perscribed by my doctor. I still wasn't losing weight or getting rid of symptoms (like hot flashes,etc.). I researched what helps support the thyroid. I looked on Amazon and found 1Body Thyroid Support. I have had amazing results. I've been taking the supplement for 2.5 months and have lost a total of 20 pounds! My cravings for carbs has reduced dramatically and I have next to no symptoms. I highly recommend this product to anyone with a HYPOthyroid.
 My thyroid numbers were out of whack - some tests indicating hypo but one more in line with hyper. To help bring things back in line, my doctor had suggested taking kelp or iodine plus selenium, both which are found in Thyroid Support.  I'd been taking 1 Body Thyroid support for about a month before being retested, and my test indicators were back in line. My eczema has also improved, which may be attributed to the zinc and copper in the product addressing a deficiency. Other ingredients are recommended by many sources, including Dr. Terry, for hypothyroidism, so seems to be a good product.
 I decided to try this product because I was fed up with the synthroid making me feel like crap and still having all of the symptoms of low thyroid.  My hair was falling out, I was tired all the time, and basically felt useless.  It was depressing me that I felt so bad and kept getting told that my levels were in the normal range and to keep taking my synthroid.  So I have been on this for awhile now.  I’m halfway through the second bottle.  I actually have energy again!  I don’t have any desire to nap in the middle of the day.  I can run around doing stuff all day long, go to the gym for a good workout, play with my kids and dogs, and still not feel exhausted.  It’s life changing just for the energy boost alone.  However since quitting the synthroid and starting this, my hair loss has halted.  I don’t have a whole handful coming out in the morning after I wash my hair.  Now it’s just 4-5 strands instead of 30 or more.  Plus I am seeing new hair growth along my hairline where the thyroid issues had been thinning my hair.  I have all these baby hairs coming in!!  My scalp is no longer visible.  If you are on the fence about trying this give it a bottle and you will see the difference.  I will be a purchaser if this product for life.
 My endocrinologist has me on a new program to help me feel better and I knew I needed a supplement to give my body the pep and energy it needed to get me through my dreaded 4 pm slump that I always fall into.  I do feel like my thinking and memory is crisper and I don't feel as sluggish at the end of the day.  Combined with healthy eating and little exercise each day I feel like I can finally get my energy back and have the motivation to be active with my kids and lifestyle.  This supplement isn't a cure all but it's a small part in the big program of self care and becoming educated on health and food choices.
 I'm using those pills for about 3 month now. I bought two, and got one bottle for free. I thought I'll give it a bit of time before judging.<br/>Pro: My fingernails look better.<br/>I have a little more energy.<br/>Con: Considering the (comparably) high price, this product is disappointing. The capsules smell. I don't see much of an effect, worse, a few weeks ago I started having water in my legs. I stopped taking these pills, and the water retention subsided. Started the pills again, and my legs went back to swelling up. I don't think this product is worth the money. I'm not going to buy more of them
 I was having chills which was not a normal thing for me in a 68 deg home. I read were Thyroid issues could cause this. At the age of 60 I  figured that maybe it needs a little boost so I tried this.  Seems to be working for me I no longer am cranking the heat up to 70 and the other day I was out in 17 deg weather in Maine with just a sweater for about 10 min. then went back into the house and was toasty I did not need to go under a blanket and try to warm up. My two cents worth..
 Within just a couple of days I noticed a huge change in my metabolism, energy levels and ability to sleep. I now take this daily since January 2017 and love it! Without a change in my diet and with the addition of this supplement I lost ~5 lbs over two weeks. With the positive impact this has had on my body, losing additional weight through exercise and diet change has allowed me to lose an additional 10 lbs since then.
 I just received my THYROID SUPPORT today.  I have 2 nodules on my thyroid and although I have been using a product with iodine and potassium iodide, I noticed a couple of months ago, that I was having difficulty swallowing.  My doctor kind of blew that off.  For about 2 weeks now, besides having the difficulty swallowing, I began to have a pain up through my ear canal.  I spent some time researching and found that zinc and copper would be beneficial.  HOWEVER, combining the two separately was going to be difficult because of the ratio and the need to split the zinc to get that proper ratio was going to be difficult for me to do.  SO, I started looking for a product that would include both the zinc and copper in the appropriate proportions.  I just took my first pill tonight and look forward to getting rid of both the nodules and the pain to the ear.  I would also like to thank 1 Body for providing me with a coupon for a free additional bottle.  I chose the ADRENAL SUPPORT, because my numbers are low and that was next on my list of things to buy for my multiple disabilities.  I didn't even know they had something for the adrenals.  I can't wait to start that and add it to my regimen!!!!  I will update later and let you know how things are improving.  I also look forward to not having to take at least one or two naps a day due to fatigue.
 After taking just 1 bottle of Thyroid Support I am noticing a definite improvement in the thickness of my hair and I believe that the thinning spot in front is even beginning to see some new growth. I've lost a few pounds and my fingernails are starting to strengthen. I've ordered a 2nd bottle and will continue taking this product to see what my results will be.
 I started taking this supplement as my doctors weren't (and still aren't) listening to me when I tell them there is still something not right with my body.  The hair loss, lack of energy, massive weight gain (80lbs) when I start working out to lose weight, constantly being cold to point of shivering even in the summer heat, all kinds of that just scream thyroid issues and my doctors just look at my slightly low results and tell me to stop drinking a soda a day and stop eating carbs.<br/>Even an MRI showing a partially empty sella and I was told it was really nothing to worry about as it doesn't affect anything.  My endocrinologist finally grudgingly put me on some meds to help lose weight as just the act of breathing and I was gaining weight. I did lose 30lbs and then plateaued so she added another med instead of addressing any of underlying problems....just another bandaid. While I want to lose the weight, I much rather fix the reason I gain the weight when trying to lose it thru normal means (I gained mine just walking on a treadmill in the winter).<br/>I've lost my trust in doctors over the years and that is still a hard pill to swallow as I come from a family with a long medical background/career/history.  I did some searching and finally came across decent supplements and after reading so many reviews I decided to give this one a try first.<br/>Just a week after starting the thyroid support and I have way more energy when I used to have to force myself out of bed, my skin is starting to look better even in the middle of what is our cruddy winter weather winter, and the best part is my 3 teenagers have noticed my boost in energy and are overjoyed for me able to join family activities again.<br/>So far the only downside for me is that I can only take 1 pill daily as when I took the 2 daily I noticed in the first week I only slept 3 or 4 hours every night (I use a sleep tracker in an effort to show my doctor that I sleep way too much). I was reading at night and not even realizing how late it got and falling asleep immediately and had none of the tossing, turning and constant waking up I usually do, just 3-4 hours and waking up super energized, ready to go, and bouncing around all day long. Honestly, I think I drove my kids crazy last weekend. I had the whole family tear apart the garden to prep it for planting and turned my overcharged self on the garage and dragged the poor teens and husband with me. I ended up pulling an old horseback riding injury in my back and I'm on bed rest for a week or so and the giggling ER nurse recommended I just take one of the Thyroid supplement pills daily....and I think that would be a much better option for me :) I love what they have done for me in just over 2 weeks but I think I just need to slow it down and take the 1 pill daily and just enjoy the same results a little slower. Thank you for making a product that works...even if it worked just a bit too well in some areas at first.
 I’m on my 2nd month of taking these, and I have to say that I’ve definitely noticed improvements in my Wellbeing!<br/>The one thing is that my hair is becoming thicker, I’m a 56 year old woman and I was beginning to notice how my hair was becoming thinner and those nagging stubborn pounds just wouldn’t go away no matter what I tried ! But, since I’ve been taking this, like I said hair is becoming thicker and I’ve started to loss those stubborn pounds...score! I’m most definitely going to keep taking them, want to see what happens by the end of month 3!
 I having problems with hypo thyroid numbers .  Decided not to take senthetic prescribed by doctor. I’ve use two bottles of this so far and notice a energy level rise.  Also I do not take at night but at mid day so I can get to sleep faster.  Will know on my next blood test how I’m doing .  Do yourself a favor and look up bromine, chlorine and fluoride and make dietary changes.  The medical community wants us addicted to pay there salary. There not out to heal :(
 The product gives you plenty of energy, and helps you be alert!  It is also great for anyone with Epstein Bar Virus, in which is a virus that attacks your thyroid and other organs.  This supplement is crucial in combating the effects of same.  My wife has this Auto-Immune Disorder (EBV), and it helps her to function greatly!
 I had been taking this supplement for a few months and it helped a lot.  It really helped my fatigue. I ordered a new bottle, and it did not work like previously.  I was so tired I could hardly function. I asked if they had change the formula and they said no. I ordered a different brand of thyroid supplements from Amazon (which were cheaper) and felt better within 24 hours of taking it. I am not sure why it stopped working for me.
 i have a thyroid disease called Hashimoto's. This seemed like the best supplement to take after I read reviews. The first 3 days i knew that i had to be patient in order to tell if it will make a difference. Anything that has to do with the thyroid usually needs time to be able to tell.( even with my thyroid medicine) But after taking it faithfully for 1 month I really felt better. The heavy cloud that I usually had was slowly lifting. I also felt less swollen and bloated. I am honestly impressed with this.
 Ok I read the glowing, outrageous reviews and I fell for it.  I actually bought a bottle.  After the first two weeks I was disappointed to find out that it wasn't working, but then it finally kicked it. First, I noticed that my hair is not falling out as much, second I do have more energy.  The thing about this product is that is does work, but you have to be patient, which is not my strong suit.  However, I was desperate.  I really wanted it to work, so I stayed the course.  If you give it time, (3 weeks for me) it does kick in.  Was it worth it, well, YES, I bought a second bottle and I do continue to feel better.  The big thing is that my hair isn't falling out as much.  I hate to report it (because other things I've been doing may have contributed more) but I have lost 9 lbs.  I don't think this is meant to be a weight loss supplement, but I look and feel better and my hair isn't falling out as much.<br/>The report from the guy who said he leaps out of bed on this stuff, I find might be a bit far-fetched, but I do have more energy and am not dragging during the day as much, so YES it does work, but give it a good 3 weeks before you give up.  I am on my second bottle and I will continue to buy it. I've recommended this to my sisters who also have thyroid problems, so. I'm a believer, but patience is necessary.  I really does work so hallelujah for that.
 I gave it a try because of the good reviews because I believed my fatigue and occasional moodiness was related to my thyroid, it elevated my mood significantly until I ran out of the first bottle and procrastinated to order another, after a few days, I noticed my mood going down and despite trying different things, I just didn’t seem to have that feeling of ‘well-being,’ I ordered two bottles and received them today. Took them immediately and within an hour I’m already feeling much at ease and happy. Whatever this is, it helps me. I also ordered the Adernal one, I have high hopes the combination will work even better! I’ll update my review later.
 I have been taking this product for 21 days now and I have already seen/felt changes. This product exceeds my expectations. I have tried other holistic herbal supplements through the past year and a half that I spent so much money on, time on taking them for months with no benefit to move to the next.. I heard someone at my Doctors mentioning this product and how much success they had, I decided to give it a try and discontinue the supplement I had been on with minimal benefit. I can not believe the change I've experienced in just the second week my mood changed, I am so happy, I don't have anxiety attacks like before. I am not on anxiety medication but I would get anxiety and heart flutters from my thyroid imbalance sure enough I can lay down at night in peace now! That's a big step, secondly my hair shedding has completely changed no more massive clumps in the shower! My hair feels better already as well, my nails and skin, mostly my fatigue my fatigue has taken the back burner and I couldn't be happier. I have so much more energy, not like racing around and over the top but normal living and loving life energy. I will not discontinue this product I couldn't be happier .
 I just received this product today, so I can’t really comment on its effectiveness. But I will share a photo of the ingredients on the bottle. I was concerned reading a few other reviews that they had change the formula for the B12 — but that’s not the case with the bottle I just got in the mail.<br/><br/> I will update after using this for a few days! Looking forward to feeling better.
 What a Godsend! I've been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and even though I was a bit skeptical that vitamins would do much to boost my under-active thyroid, let me just say-- WOW!<br/><br/>I learned a while back, due to fertility treatments that included blood work, that my thyroid was under-active. I used to feel as if I were drowning in quick sand. All of my energy went into staying a hair's-breadth away from getting sucked under. (I'd been feeling this way the last year or two, but in retrospect, to a much lesser degree all of my life.) Now I have SO MUCH more energy every day! I've also noticed my metabolism speeding up. In conjunction with exercise and a healthy diet, some of the stubborn extra weight I just couldn't shake through the first two means has been melting away. In particular, my face is so much less "puffy" looking.<br/><br/>While I do plan on seeing a doctor for thyroid support very soon, these vitamins have (in the meantime) been such an amazing blessing in my life! Less sluggishness. More energy. Better concentration. Melting pounds. I am a real person for whom this product has made a real difference!
 Works great! Had a lot of energy when I first started taking it. However like all other thyroid supplements and thyroid medicine you get used to it after a while. With that said if you are taking this for the added energy just take it when you're exercising or doing some that require high energy... Don't take it every day or else you'll get used to it.
 I DO really like the Thyroid Support.  Purchased two bottles based on reviews also for adult daughter with same issues and she loves it as well a we are senior and middle aged and sluggishness and other issues are changing right away.<br/><br/>My hair loss has greatly diminished. I had been getting to the point of frustration; been trying everything I could think of when I went to a Reflexologist who advised me my feet were not only reflecting thyroid issues all over the place (yes - I was one of those that quit taking Synthroid a long time ago because it did nothing for me) and she could tell from my feet I was having issues with heavy metals as well (we have fluoride in our water.  I have gotten onto the Boron as well as the thyroid support, so not only has hair loss diminished greatly, but my joints are happy as all heck!  They had been barking for quite a long time, but cannot tell if it is boron or the Thyroid Support!<br/><br/>Have lost a few pounds which is pretty good for 12 days. SCORE.....not feeling like a slug and am M...O...V....I....N...G, whoo hoo!<br/><br/>$ SCORE.....I am not having to turn up heat so much in this cold weather as I am nice and toasty.  Electric bill down and Linda happy!<br/><br/>My body temperature (after reflexologist had me test, averaged 95.4 on left side and 96.4 on right side)....it is now improving with me finding myself not having to sleep with covers up around my neck and ears, which I kind of think is a sign hypothyroidism because of our body's subconscious ways of protecting ourselves!!!!<br/><br/>Also, due to this astute reflexologist and much research and reading all of the positive complimients, in less than 2 weeks many of my symptoms are reversing.  Thank you.
 I have had a thyroid problem for many years. I actually had part of my thyroid removed and still need the other half taken out to but I am trying to hold off as long as I can. The Dr put me on Synthroid after my surgery and I did not feel any better taking that than I did before my surgery so I stopped taking the Synthroid so I started my search for a supplement to take. I had no luck with anything until this one. Before I started taking Thyroid Support I would start to get very tired around 1 in the afternoon now I feel less tired and I have more energy. I can actually get through my day without wanting to lay down &amp; take a nap I still feel a little tired but not like I was. I have only been taking this for about 3 weeks so I am hoping it continues to get better. I started out with the 1 pill they suggested but did not feel any effect so after 4 days I increased it to 2 pills. I will continue to use this product until I have my other surgery which I hope is a long ways away.
 My thyroid function was out of whack, according to multiple lab tests over 8 months. I was referred to an endocrinologist and they wanted to put me on synthetic thyroid hormones. I decided to wait and try a natural supplement first. I found this product and liked what I read. I purchased and took it faithfully for 6 weeks, then went back and retested at the doctor's office. The test results came back normal. I've been using this product for 9 months now...and plan to continue doing so.
 I started thyroid support after stalling out on my weight post pregnancy.  I had my labs done, and noticed that my thyroid was borderline low.  I tried a few thyroid support products (even ones by very reputable lines) and did not feel much of a difference, so I decided to try something new... I usually don't order supplements on amazon b/c you don't always know what you are getting, but there were alot of great review. I have been using this product for several months and it's the only thryoid product that I notice a big difference in my energy, my weight, and my clarity of mind. I have tried more than a few products, and I have to say that this one is the one I will always come back to.  Also, the customer service of this company is excellent!  Oh yes! And BTW, did I mention that I'm an integrative medicine physician....? :-) Great job 1Body!
 I have been dealing with sub clinical hypothyroidism for years. My TSH numbers would fluctuate so going on medication wasn't an option; however, I was extremely symptom heavy. Hair-loss, cold, mental fog, fatigue,weight gain w/o reason etc... This was frustrating because I am super athletic (long distance trail runner) and my work requires me to be mentally clear and alert (Psychologist). I gave this a try with a lot of skepticism. I noticed a difference immediately but thought it could be a placebo affect. After taking it for 2 weeks I can say the biggest difference is the energy and lack of mental fog. I already order 2 additional bottles because if this continues to work I can't imagine going back to how I felt before.
 I don't know which particular item in this product my body needed, but once I started taking these supplements I felt a very noticeable difference.  I have a problem with inflammation, especially in my ankles, and this really helps me, it has eliminated the inflammation. I notice the difference when I don't take them.  I will continue to purchase these supplements.
 I had been sleeping terribly, was extremely cold all the time, exhausted, I had terrible cramps during that time of the month, and I had several other symptoms of thyroid issues. But my thyroid labs came back as normal. I read all the fabulous reviews about thyroid support and really wanted to try it but was leery about taking it because I have reacted to B vitamins in the past and was afraid it would keep me awake at night. So I only took one capsule.<br/><br/>The first day, I didn’t notice any change. But I didn’t sleep any worse than I had been, so I continued with one capsule per day. After about 5 days, I got my period and noticed that my cramps were almost nonexistent! After a week, I was sleeping through the night, something that hadn’t happened for a few months! I am no longer cold, my energy has come back up, and I feel much better than I had before starting thyroid support.<br/><br/>I’ve been taking one capsule per day for almost two months now and have continued to sleep quite a bit better than I was before. I still wake up around 4:00 now and then, but it’s pretty rare.<br/><br/>Last time I had my period, the second time since starting thyroid support, it was easy and virtually painless, just as it was the month before. But I had it last week again, and for about three hours one night, the cramps were agonizing. I don’t know why the change, but I sure hope it improves again!<br/><br/>Overalls, I’m super excited about Thyroid Support! I’d like to have my daughter try it also to see if it helps her out also. Thank you for such an awesome product!
 I have tried many thing I have read about thyroid support, I finally have found some things that are helping....know the foods to stay away from, that info is on the inet, but be sure your doc prescribes not just by test results but should ask you how you feel.  Only a few doctors will ask how you feel, your endocrinologist or your DO, I find the DO is more interested in me after test results.  I have read that docs do not...do not....prescribe enough thyroid strength for anyone, they under prescribe the strength...why...I do not know but one thing I do know, I am now using the 1 Body Thyroid Support and did not know that iodine is key after reviewing their ingredients or supplement facts, look up iodine and read!.....I am now getting some energy back, feeling better, more alert....more happy!  I have just started this a couple of weeks ago so since I feel better now, cannot wait to see my results in 6 months!  JOY JOY HAPPY HAPPY I now can say!
 I ordered 1 body support in an effort to help some of my hypothyroid symptoms such as difficulty in weight loss, fatigue, and very low basal temperature. In the 4 weeks I have taken 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening, I have noticed an increase in energy as well as the scale moving a little lower each week. This is in combination with diet, but before the weight wasn't coming off even while I was watching as I am now. I am still waiting for my temperature to come up, but am hoping that if I keep taking this that it will. I will continue to reorder.
 Under penalty of perjury of law, i swear to the following:<br/><br/>I tried this product, I am not affiliated with this product, and I am here to say it is the best supplement  that I  have ever taken. I take it with Zhou DHEA supplements, and I am a new man. I was tired, down in the dumps, lethargic, pessimistic and anxiety ridden.<br/><br/>I don't believe 99% of these wonder drug stories, but this one is a game changer. I will concede to one thing, i do believe that the zhou DHEA is also a huge part of it.<br/><br/>It took about a week or so to kick in.. I used to go to bed at 9pm. I was so tired, I could barely walk. I woudl sleep till 8:30. I was really not doing well. Now i go to bed at 10, but not really tired. I get up at 5:30 like I used to.<br/><br/>Totally different guy. I laugh more liek I used to. I see things positively.
 This product has all the herbs you need for a healthy thyroid. My functional Dr. found, through a complete Thyroid blood test, that my numbers were low. My hair has been falling out for the last 3 years and my conventional Dr said my thyroid was fine and I was just getting older. Well, my hair loss has slowed down considerably since I began these!!
 I kept thinking I needed a higher dose of medication for my thyroid. After my blood work confirmed I was already at the right dose, I looked for an option to help support my thyroid. I was feeling foggy and exhausted and after 2 weeks I feel so much better. Thank you for making this product!
 I have tried similar products and found that this 1 Body product is the best. It is easy to digest.The other products are tried upset my stomach and had dyes in the product. The instructions are clear and easy. I find I'm less bloated and have more energy. I also believe it has help with my sleep. I no longer have leg cramps since start the thyroid support. Nice bonus!
 The bottle I bought in October has the B12 listed in Supplement Facts as “cyanocobalamin.”  This is not a healthy form of B12.  The picture on the ad says that it is the methyl version of B12.  Did it (TRULY) change?  What form of B12 is really, honestly in this supplement?
 I have recently switched from another more expensive product that contained many of the same ingredients as Thyroid Support.  After two weeks, I haven't noticed any significant changes (since I was already taking something else), but I'm happy with the cost and the simple process of just 2 capsules a day.  I'm in my 50's and this supplement keeps me feeling like I  know I'm supposed to.
 I am generally very skeptical of this type but of product, so I was quite surprised to find that this actually works!! I don't necessarily notice more energy or focus, but it does help with weight loss. I generally have to watch my caloric intake very carefully to avoid gaining weight and I find that this speeds up my metabolism so well! I lost five pounds without any effort and don't have to be so careful about what I eat. That alone is enough for me to continue purchasing this supplement!!
 It has been 10 days that I started taking this product. The first few days I had several migraine headaches and thought of not continuing to take the supplement, but I decided to stick it out and 10 days later, I have to say....I am happy I did not stop. I am now taking my daily prescription of<br/>synthyroid with the thyroid support supplement and later in the day take two more supplements of ashwagandha root and spirulina/chlorella and they have helped me out tremendously. I feel like myself again!!! Clear mind, natural energy, good mood, and happy again :)  No longer feel fatigued or am dragging to get out of bed. I am actually ready to get up and go. I am truly greatly for finding this supplement and will continuing taking.
 I am perhaps in my 6th week of taking these supplements. I believe the first day that I took these supplements I felt a bit more relaxed but that could have been a placebo affect. Here's my story I have had alopecia for a number of years with terrible dry brittle kinky hair. All the characteristics of what frustration sounds like. I exercise lose weight and gain weight back so quickly that even my doctors eyes buck with astonishment. Here's what I know to be true and not a placebo affect. I began losing weight after taking these supplements in alll fairness I did start eating better soup, grapefruit, nuts as opposed to fast-food and doritos to my hearts content. I started jumping rope early in the mornings taking this supplement and then eating seemed to help initially. It was not abra kadabra. I have really bad PMS as it relates too breast tenderness and feeo8hg moody and depressed but aside from the pms moody and depression my mood seems more stable. When I first began taking this medicine my sleep improved; however, I started back taking benzos and I don't think they mix too well. One thing I know is my hair has improved!!! My hair seems to have gone from brittle hard and dry, to more naturally soft and is bordering on being more curly than kinky. I have gained length!!! I can't believe the texture of my hair and if these pills begin to fill in my bald spots this review will go from 4-5. I hope they don't change the formula I intend to keep on taking this product.
 I am writing on behalf of my mother.  My mother has an thyroid issue and this product has greatly improved the following, on a scale 1-10, 10 being the highest<br/>energy level from a 5 to a 7<br/>focus level from a 4 to a 6<br/>overall well being from a 5 to a 7<br/><br/>She likes the improvements of the product and so far is pleased with the product and recommends it to anyone with a thyroid issue
 Finally...I feel like myself again!  Having hit fifty, by body changing, my skin, my hair, my nails changing...I was struggling to find myself. I was not giving up, I tried a number of different things and was disappointed until I tried this product!  With the first dose, I knew it was different.  I have energy, I'm not tired in the afternoon, after 8+ hours at work, I come home and don't collapse on the couch.  I sleep better and wake up refreshed and the best part...I've actually lost some weight. Thank you so much for creating this amazing product, just for me.  To all those who, like me, have tried other things, don't be afraid to try this.
 When doc told me TSH was low, I started taking a Thyroid supplement.  On retest, doctor said numbers moved in right direction, but not enough.  He wanted to put me on Levothyroxine.  I found 1 Body's Thyroid Support and told my doctor I'd give this a try first.  I put off getting my TSH retested for about 10 months and just kept taking the Thyroid Support supplement.  Got results of testing this morning and doctor said my TSH levels are normal.  No Levothyroxine for me!!!
 I am so glad I found 1 Body Thyroid Support.  For years I have been telling my doctors that since having my children, my hair has been falling out so much, I have low energy, I sleep with a heating pad on high every night because I cannot stay warm and my metabolism is slow.  They have tested my thyroid and every time say it comes back within the normal range.  Then that's where they would stop- no follow up on what else could be causing these symptoms or ideas of what to try next.  It's frustrating to be dealing with this for years and I am so happy to have found Thyroid support.
 I have had thyroid problems for the past 2 years. I have been on medication since that time.  Some days I felt good and other days awful. Everyday I lost energy and had no feelings to do anything.  I hated this feeling.  One day I stumbled upon this thyroid supplement. I read other reviews and really wonder whether it was all true. I decided to order this product.  I started taking it about 2 week now.  The first 3 days of this taking this supplement I could'nt believe the feeling.  I started getting back my normal life.  I now have energy everyday and my mood is much better.  I feel great overall.
 I take 1 pill a day, which is half the recommended dose. I don't have energy level issues, but about ten years ago had low thyroid hormone levels and was worried they would keep going down. Now, hormone levels are healthier; Thyroid Support is a good supplement to more exercise and healthier diet to keep it up.
 I bought this thyroid supplement hoping it would help with the fatigue, mood swings and general lack of energy most people experience with hashimoto's disease.<br/>I'm on 75mg Levothyroxine and took the supplement at noon with lunch.<br/>About 30mins after I took the first capsule I started feeling dizzy and as if all my blood went straight into my face. My head started pounding and I ended up throwing up pretty badly. Never have I felt this miserable since being diagnosed with hashimoto's.<br/>I am certain that it had nothing to do with what I ate, since I have a very strict meal plan that I stick with and never had that kind of reaction before. What a waste of money. I don't even dare to take another one!<br/>I had to lay done for a couple of hours and drink lots of water for the side effects to subside.<br/><br/>It might be working for some people, but unfortunately for me it really made me feel horrible.<br/>I wanted it to do the trick, but it didn't! :(<br/><br/>Add on: 1 Body has sent me an email within 24 hours of posting this review, apologizing for the bad experience I had and giving me a 100% refund on the product. Also, I did receive the e-book and experienced good, yet not annoying follow-up emails with useful information.<br/><br/>I do appreciate that a lot, but what makes me really upset is that I was asked to edit or delete my review, which then would not give other people with a serious condition, such as an auto immune disease, an honest review of this supplement. Yes, one should always consult with their doctor before taking anything besides their prescription medication, still,l I do believe that it is morally wrong to delete an honest review, especially when it shows the other side of the medal and makes people aware, that it might not give them the benefits they're hoping for.<br/>People living with Hashimoto's disease are desperate to get their energy and ultimately their life back on track and an honest review, even if negative, is essential in choosing the right supplement.<br/>Like I said before, I'm sure it helps a lot of people to feel great and "alive" again, but there's also people on here, who did not do well with this.
 July 2017 I discovered I was gluten sensitive!  In my quest to wellness,  I read about treating my thyroid... I searched on Amazon and bought this based on the reviews! This is GREAT!!! I have so much more energy, sleep better and the scale has started to go DOWN!!! I don't expect immediate results with anything! I was think a fair assessment is 3-6 months... I'm going to keep using this :)
 So far in my postpartum experience this has been the only supplement that has really make a immediate difference on my thyroid. My thyroid took a hit when my hormones went in flux after having my son. I was having anxiety, depression, insomnia, heart palpitations, muscle fatigue, over all fatigue. It was awful. Having a whole food diet has helped but I noticed the biggest difference in my overall energy levels and mood once I started taking this supplement.
 I noticed an improvement in my energy within days. I am hoping for improvement with weight and hair thinning/loss. Time will tell. I will continue taking it, as the energy lift alone, has been worth it. In the past week or so (3 weeks in) I have started to notice more restful sleep, and waking up feeling rested again for the first time in quite a while!
 I started using this about 2 weeks ago, and I absolutely love it! I haven't felt so good about my energy levels in a long time. And although I haven't weighed myself since I started taking it, I feel like I've lost some weight as well!  This definitely helps with my morning work outs, getting the motivation to get out of bed and work out.<br/><br/>Now that I have to worry about my thyroid due to family history of thyroid disease, I am so glad I found this supplement to focus on what I'm missing from my thyroid not working and balance myself out. I will definitely recommend this to my mom!!
 I've been on the same thyroid doseage for 7 years and wasn't getting any results. My doctor said my thyroid is fine and blood tests were good. Yet I was still tired and gaining weight even with eating mostly healthy. So I started doing research on natural supplements. This one had the best reviews and way more reviews than a lot of supplements on amazon. I just received mine today so haven't started it but hoping my results will he as amazing ad others who have used this supplement.<br/>I have been taking this supplement for almost a month. I started out taking it twice a day which my body refused so I took it once a day for a couple weeks and then moved up to twice a day and feel much better! I've lost a lot of bloating and have ore energy and have not been craving old junk foods which has been great..my skin has even gotten a little clearer. I would definitely keep taking this product to see my results in a couple  more months.
 I used to love this supplement, until my last bottle came with a poorer/less effective vitB listed in the ingredients. What is advertised in this Amazon product description, is no longer up to date.
 I was really y excited to find a supplement for the thyroid. I had done research and thought I would need to buy individual items to cover all the supplements so I am very happy to have to only take 1 capsule as opposed to 3 or 4 separate ones. The first week I couldn't tell any difference but then the second week I have slept better and felt like I have more energy. I am looking forward to seeing how I feel in the coming weeks after being on it a bit longer.
 Many of my hypothyroidism symptoms have already decreased since taking this supplement and I expect the progress to continue. I no longer feel cold when everyone around me are feeling fine, and even my high blood pressure has improved. I read that high HBP can be caused by hypothyroidism and it seems to be true. I refused my doctor's suggestion that I take a drug for HBP after reading the side effects of that, and most other HBP meds. I prefer to go the natural route for all medical problems. 1Body Thyroid Support seems to "kill two birds with one stone" and I am happy and confident taking it.
 I have noticed decreased symptoms when I started taking this product, thicker hair, stronger nails, not as cold all the time. It works amazing to control my thyroid symptoms
 I take thyroid medication and my levels go up and down. Since I’ve started taking this as a supplement, I seem to be feeling healthier and more energized. Note: if you do take a prescription thyroid medication, do not take this at the same time. I take my medication in the a.m. and this in the p.m., and have not had any side effects.
 I am now using the Thyroid Support (continuing to use the Adrenal Support).  Hoping to continue my health journey - sleeping better, feeling better, losing weight, etc..
 Since i started taking this i noticed an immediate increase in energy with in days. My fall fall has slowed to very minimal and starting to see new hair spike back up through. my nails arent constantly breaking, i can actually sleep when i lat down at night, my mood isnt as flighty and more leveled out.i havealso started getting my sex drive back which has been conpletelt non existant for about 4.5years. Drs testing my thyroid function and said it was fine, but all my symptons showed otherwise. im so glad i tried this product and will continue to take from here on out.
 Thank you again. It is work. Before  I started, I was weak, all the time no energy, my hand and face  swollen. I was in the bed until 2-3 pm., then started to do something.  But now I full of energy. I am taking Synthroid,  my TSH  in range.  Before started,  I went  to endocrinology  and doctor told me thyroid profile in range, I told about my symptoms she  didn't give me any advice  how to help my body feeling  like before hypothyroidism. Now feel much better.  Thank.
 Before I started taking these pills, I was so lethargic I could not stay awake for more than a few hours at a time without taking large doses of caffeine. I did not have hypothyroidism; I have Hashimoto's, which has very similar symptoms. Once I started taking daily thyroid support, my normal high-energy self resumed and I was able to quit caffeine completely. I take Now Thyroid Energy in the morning and 1 Body Thyroid Support at mid-day; both are good products and I will continue taking both.
 I haven't noticed anything different with my cold hands and feet, however, what I will say is this supplement stopped the super bad cramps, uterine spasms and bloating during that time of the month.  I noticed the difference the very first month of taking, I usually would need Motrin for the first two days....not anymore.
 I feel like I have more energy, more desire to get up and do something. I also think the thyroid support may be helping to curb my appetite- which is not what I had planned but it is a good bonus! I'm hoping over time I will also see hair growth from the use of this product, too... as my hair is very thin.
 My primary care doctor told me that my thyroid was slightly under active.  I've tried a couple of other brands but this one has given more energy and less of an appetite.  I feel less sluggish with this one,
 I am about to finish my first bottle of this and will definitely be buying more. I feel like it has helped me with my energy, moods, and weight without changing any other major part of my routine. I have not been in to check my hormone levels but had all of the symptoms I found online. It hasn't solved all my problems but I really feel like it has improved my health.
 I started taking Thyroid Support about 3 weeks ago. I was suffering from extreme fatigue even though I was getting plenty of sleep/fresh air/ exercise. I noticed a difference in my energy levels in just three days. My energy seems to be steadily increasing, and the brain fog is started to disappear also. Another weird thing- i have pretty much lost my sense of smell for the last several years. Suddenly, I can smell again!!! I'm driving my husband nuts because I keep commenting on everyday smells I've missed out on for years. I plan to continue using Thyroid Support and hope to see continued improvement.
 I do have more energy and for longer each day. It is working well with my Dr. prescribed treatment (yes physician is aware taking both). However I would advise 1 Body change the formulation to remove Iodine. It is very difficult to find a quality comprehensive multivitamin supplement for age 50+ that does not include it, making the potential for overdose a real possibility. That or 1 Body needs to bring out a competitive companion multivitamin product to fill this need.
 Our thyroid is small but can be a very large ugly beast for individuals and for your doctor to treat. I have been taking thyroid medication for 35+ years and on days that I feel good I would like an instant blood test for my doctor. In addition on days that I feel really bad with many, many issues I want a blood test for my doctor to compare. Doctors seem to think that the range is acceptable and the best we can be. I believe there are many underlying causes for why the thyroid turns into an ugly beast. I have been taking Thyroid Support for approximately three weeks and have felt better. I feel this has helped give me an edge to continue without so many days of frustrations. Update - I have now used two bottles of Thyroid Support and will continue based on the better body issues caused by a thyroid disease that is not easily controlled with my Synthroid. I highly recommend you speak with your doctor and try Thyroid Support if you are still struggling with the effects of Thyroid highs and lows.
 Before starting using Thyroid Support I was in a bad mood ALL THE TIME, and I used to go to sleep and no matter how many hours I slept, I was always exhausted. With this product all of that is GONE!!! I love how I feel while taking it. I've forgotten to take it 2 times since I started in December, and those bad symptoms come back immediately! I hope I can take this product forever since I suffer from Hashimoto's. Thanks for creating such a wonderful product.
 I definitely noticed changes in my body. I have more energy since I have started taking this supplement. Therefore, I have desire to exercise and stay active even in the second part of my day. My memory is sharper and I am able to focus for longer periods of time. Thank you, I will be ordering it again.
 I feel like this is helping with my low thyroid although I went to the Dr and had blood drawn which came back low/normal for my thyroid, therefore no meds were necessary per the Dr. But half of my eyebrows were gone, my hair was thinning, and I had major weight gain, after taking Thyroid Support my eyebrows are growing back and my hair looks healthier, now to get the weight off:)
 Body temperature went from 96.7 to 98.1 when waking. So I think it’s working.
 Ok, I haven’t been diagnosed with thyroid anything but maybe because I don’t go to the doctor.<br/>I bought this because thyroid disease runs in my family and I wanted to prevent it. Well, I also drink coffee which it says you shouldn’t but the info is mixed for that. I eat well and mostly vegetarian diet. I didn’t see anything different, I actually think I gained weight (5pounds) I cant say for sure if it has made a difference or improved anything.
 I just got done sharing this on Facebook in hopes that if I had any friends that could have felt as terrible as I did find relief. I’m just over 2 weeks of taking thyroid support I feel like I almost have a new lease on life. I literally could look up thyroid function issues and check off the boxes one by one. Each time I went to the Dr they would tell me I was borderline but they didn’t see that they needed to treat it yet. I felt like death and desperate for rest because I always felt beat down. On a scale of 1 to 10 before taking thyroid support I stayed bout a 2 or 3 on how I felt each day today just 2 weeks in I’d say on a scale of 1 to 10 I’m about a 7 or 8. I will certainally stay faithful to this product. I have seen reviews that it can cause stomach upset but I’ve not had any problems there.
 I love this product! I am on my second bottle and I have seen amazing results. It takes about 3 weeks to start seeing results but it is worth the wait. My body feels like it is working properly. I have lost weight and feel like I have more energy. I have been struggling with my weight for years and this product is a great boost for my metabolism. My boyfriend is in the field of exercise and health and he has recommended it to his clients after seeing the positive results it's made for me. I will continue using this product as I find that it give me all the vitamins my body is lacking in order work function properly.
 This product, combined with the Adrenal Support has been amazing. Before I started taking it, I would be so exhausted and tired by noon. Now that I'm on these two supplements, I never get tired in the middle of the day and I'm starting to sleep better. It has been an awesome experience thus far.
 I love this product and it worked for me! I was having all the symptoms of thyroid issues but my blood work kept coming back normal and I was miserable. Tired. Brain fog. Overweight. I was ready to try anything! I found this product on Amazon and thought  well why not try it, I wanted to feel healthy and lose the weight! Working out and strict diet was not working for me! First week of using this supplement I noticed my brain was more alert and my whole mood was uplifted! Weight loss as well! My pants were feeling loose again finally. I'm not great at writing reviews but my experience was amazing after all the blood tests and no help from my doctors. I finally feel like myself!!!!! I'm happy with this product and I'm buying more!!!!!
 So far this is the best product for helping with my energy levels (low energy due to low thyroid function).  When I stopped taking it, I could tell the difference.  The company also sent an email offering the adrenal support for 75% off as well as including the most comprehensive document I have ever read explaining thyroid function and how to deal with it.  In the box, there is also an offer for a free product - no gimmicks and free shipping.  You just need the invoice number from Amazon.  You can't beat that for savings.  Other companies charge much more for much less effect.  I will purchase this from now on.
 Fast shipping, excellent customer service. Seller emailed excellent information on this product.  I chose this product based on the number of favorable reviews.  Today is my first day so plan to update post once I get an idea of how it works.<br/><br/>My physician only performed 1 thyroid test on me, said my levels are fine.  I tried the iodine test.  Less than 12 hours there was no indication I had put iodine on my stomach as it was completely gone.  I know my body and it's off kilter, so after research - my symptoms are indicative of hypothyroidism.  My dad, two daughters and grandmother all have thyroid issues.  I'm hoping this is my miracle.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for one month and am noticing an improvement in energy level. After thyroid surgery many years ago my energy level dropped severely and has not recovered. Based on only one month of using Thyroid Support I can not claim it is the reason for my feeling better, but I am hopeful. Full disclosure: 1 Body is offering me a second bottle free in return for this review --- but as I said, I am hopeful that this is the help I need.  Will only know after a few months of use.<br/>Update 12-24-2015. I am now starting my 3rd order of Thyroid Support while taking two capsules per day. I am still at the higher energy level although it seems to have leveled off. Not increasing but at a good level. This is antidotal results, but enough to convince me to continue with the supplement.
 Along with the prescribed Thyroid therapy, I have been supplementing with your product and have increased energy and focus.  So far, I love the product.  I received my free additional bottle of Thyroid Support, fast and a follow up to be sure I got it.  Great product and great company!  I will update when I get new labs, I'm sure to see better results.
 After taking this for a couple days, my energy levels increased and the "brain fog" I'd been experiencing disappeared.  This is a great product!  Give it a try!
 4 bottle of this product and I still love it, been on prescription meds for thyroid for 3 yrs, still felt like crap, until I started taking this, I also take vitamin d-3, c, omega 3 6 9. No regrets here!!!
 I had a visible goiter the size of a golf ball. This product has reduced it by about 30% after 3-4 weeks. Although it is still there, the goiter is less noticeable. Compared to other thyroid meds I've used, this one is easy to digest and did not cause side effects.
 1. Lied about form of B12<br/>2. Rash on my face looks like pink red spots all over. My face was just clear the night before. My face has been spotless for over a month and before that I never had rash/and look like this maybe just one or two small pimple from drinking high fructose corn syrup<br/><br/>3. Rash all over my body! The only new thing I have taken was this. I didn't even leave the house the other day.
 I started taking a different one,  Zhou Thyroid Support. I noticed lots more energy right away.  I noticed that less after a few weeks though.  I switched and tried this one due to the good reviews.  They immediately sent me a coupon for a free bottle if I leave a review.  I think that explains the many reviews.  That said I don't notice much effect now and I'm going back to the first brand.  However the ingredients of all these look pretty similar.
 prompt shipping, ingredients clearly listed.<br/>Product Review: I have been taking the supplements for 1 1/2 weeks. I had myself tested before starting the supplements, thyroid hormones were low-normal. I will follow up in 90 days with another to verify any changes. My main symptoms have been fatigue, brain fog, dry mouth, weight gain, brittle hair, skin and nails. I suspect an HPA-Axis dysregulation, and doing further testing before moving on.<br/> It took 3 days, but I feel a definite change in alertness and a feeling of well-being. I attribute most of this due to the high levels of B12 in this supplement. There has been some appetite suppression, and my 'dry mouth' is starting to alleviate - I attribute this to the iodine &amp; seaweed intake. I will report more fully when a 30 day mark has been reached, but the supplement appears to be having some effect.
 I would like to begin this review by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed as having an underactive thyroid, although I have most of the classic symptoms. What I love about this is that it's mostly just an arrangement of vitamins that my body needs anyway! I took it for a month and was hesitant to buy the next monthly supply. Although I felt pretty good while taking it, I wasn't sure if it was really making a profound difference to my overall fatigue, mood, etc. Then my mom and boyfriend remarked how pleasant it's been to spend time with me as of late. All throughout high school and college I struggled with mood swings that effected my relationships. I was given numerous prescriptions to treat me, but they only resulted in some really nasty side-effects and made me feel more like a zombie than anything else. It made me realize that whatever mood disorder I have (been diagnosed as bipolar and depressed), it must be linked to an underactive thyroid. This product has no side-effects but it certainly seems to have benefits. So far so good!
 I purchased and used the product for approximately 30 days has completely reversed my systems...  I have an abundance of energy, no  sluggishness, less hair shedding, less water retention, lost a few pounds and more.  This is solely my personal experience and which a wonderful one.  I do plan to place product on auto-subscribe so that I will receive automatic shipment.  I will look into other product by this company.  Finally, to the company, thank you for caring enough to bring up such a great product, keep up the good work.
 I am very skeptic. For a long time I've been having problem with my thyroid gland, and have medication. A friend told my about this product. A bit hesitant, I bought it. As a professor of philosophy with training in psychology I well know the placebo effect. This is not. It is a serious supplement. In only three weeks of trial, the difference is evident in my mind and body. I'm not being paid by the sellers, nor I know them. Honest to you, it has been so far an improvement in my health.
 I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism (and possible beginning stage Hashimoto's) and was looking for a natural remedy. I've only been taking this for about a week, but I've noticed that I wake up early and with energy that I didn't have before taking it. My energy levels throughout the day are more steady as well. Also, I've lost 3lbs in the past week and someone told me I look a little thinner too! I haven't changed anything else besides taking this because I haven't really able to exercise without weight gain and/or extremely sore muscles for the past year. Now I feel like I have enough energy to start exercising again. I'm going to ease into it, but I'm looking forward to seeing my condition continue to improve as I keep taking this!
 After two years of struggling with fatigue, "brain fog," and many other symptoms of hypothyroidism, I been taking Thyroid Support two months ago. Within one week, I noticed an increase in my energy level and sharper focus, and those two benefits are the reasons I continue taking Thyroid Support. I am a vegan, so I also appreciate the vegetarian capsules.
 I have not been formally diagnosed as having any thyroid issues, but they run in my family and for a while I have had some of the classic hypothyroid symptoms of extreme fatigue, low basal body temp and having a really hard time staying warm.  So I decided to try a thyroid supplement to see if it would help.  I've been using this product for a few months now, and I certainly do think it has made a difference.  My basal body temps went into the normal range within the first few weeks, and I have had noticeably more energy. I would absolutely recommend it.
 I took this and it's been 3 weeks now and I really haven't felt this good in ages!  I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism for a couple of years now and even though I was on medication I still felt fatigued and a bit off.  This is really a great product.  Remember to always consult with your doctor if you already are on medication.
 According to a book I've been reading on carb sensitivity, I'm displaying symptoms of major carb sensitivity and hypothyroidism. I chose this supplement based on the ingredients and reviews here on Amazon. After a month, I've seen a difference. I'm losing weight and I don't feel bloated and sluggish like I used to. In conjunction with a low-carb diet this really does work.
 As you can see from the picture, its not a bottle of thyroid supplement. I didn't pay over $20 for 3 little mice I can get for maybe $5 at Walmart
 I purchased this during Amazon's mid-year sale but held off writing a review until I had used it for several weeks and was able to evaluate it fairly. I'm thrilled with how it's working so far and definitely plan to continue taking it. I'm one of those people who used an electric blanket twelve months out of the year and  was constantly cold no matter what the temperature. I've noticed a remarkable improvement in just a short amount of time. I also feel I have considerable more energy and I feel like I'm thinking more clearly and the brain freeze is slowly starting to thaw. This company provides outstanding customer service and follow-u as well. Highly recommended!
 I have been taking this product for the past month - my energy level has stabilized and I feel better as a whole.  I have noticed that I am more focused and alert throughout the day and even sleep better at night.  I hope that when my new numbers come in for my thyroid it is nothing but good news...  I have just received my 2nd bottle and look forward to seeing measurable results in a couple of months...  Love this - will recommend!
 After working out and dieting for a year I couldn't lose any weight. Dr said my thyroid tested normal, but my tsh was a little high by non-US standards, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought this and have lost almost 20lb in 2 months, no editing or working out. My heels are no longer cracked and bleeding, and I am not sleepy all the time.
 This product is really good it has obviously helped fix my Wife's thyroid problem. She doesn't get cold like before and her energy levels have went up and she get's hungry more often now. These are signs her metabolism is back to normal levels and she's doing much better.
 I am a supplement junkie in that I am always trying to find the right combination to help my severe low thyroid issues.  I have now been taking this supplement for a little over a week and I can say I'm starting to feel a real difference and couldn't be more excited!  At first I had a little trouble figuring out when to take them but I'm starting to figure out the schedule that works for me with one in the morning and one at night.  Because of the quality ingredients used, I've actually been able to back off some other supplements that duplicated them.  I'd also like to say that I'm impressed with the company's integrity and customer service priority.  This a real winner people- you'd be crazy not to give it a try!
 The timing for beginning this was the worst, as I came down with a cold just as it arrived. However, I felt more energetic even with the cold. I was able to go for a walk in the fresh air each day. I plan to get more so that I can see if I truly did feel that good.
 I have been borderline hypothyroid with my annual numbers going up and falling back down.  No testing since I started taking the thyroid support supplement so I don't know what impact it may have.  I am sleeping better after my second bottle of the supplement.  I notice the offer for a free bottle and I messed up my attempt to order the free bottle by putting in the wrong Amazon order number.  Customer support discovered my problem and fixed it.
 About 2 months ago I was told by my doctor my thyroid blood test showed 0.01 and it should be at least 0.374. A week or two later I started this product. Today, 6 or so weeks later, I was surprised to find my thyroid levels are now in the normal range. Unfortunately I've yet to feel increased energy so I expected another 0.01 blood test result. I am also impressed with the communication I received from someone at this company, the owner - I think, shortly after my purchase. I will be buying this product often such that I can take 2 capsules each day as I've been doing.
 I have heard great reviews of this product and I read all of them (not just the good reviews) I was taking l-tyrosine on the recommendation of a naturopath. When I ran out I was going to order more but saw this product and it has a lot of ingredients that I know support the thyroid, so I am very pleased to be able to order it instead of the plain L-Tyrosine. The company seems quite invested in feedback and support -win, win!<br/><br/>I'm going to give it 2 weeks and check back in to offer more details on my experience.
 I ordered this because I thought it can't hurt. I have an enlarged thyroid nodule. I also have been noticing a lack of energy as the nodule has been growing. I have tried plexus and it helped some as well but the increase in water caused lots of bathroom breaks. Within two days of taking this I noticed my energy was back. Within the first week I was sleeping better. After two weeks my husband noticed the nodule was less noticeable. I will continue taking and will update after the first bottle.
 I've really enjoyed the extra clarity it's given me, it's more subtle for me, but I can definitely tell a difference. I also feel less "poofy" and more awake than I have been in a very, very long time!
 Had this a week.  Was feeling sluggish and thinking about having my doctor adjust my thyroid meds after 20 years...no need.  This really helped balance things out.  3 days in noticed a change for the better.  Don't miss a dose...you will notice!!!
 I am only in the first month of taking the support for my thyroid.  My thyroid needs assistance due to high levels of stress the last 6 months.  I know it is depleted and my adrenals can't pull  what it needs to keep my body working.  Hope this will be what my metabolism needs to jump start my weight loss  or at very least start it moving in the right direction.
 This supplement really did help me. I have more energy, really exercising more now. Which has brought my blood pressure down.<br/>Hair, skin and nails all seem better too. So glad I found this!
 I bought this for my daughter. She was diagnosis with Hashimoto's disease over a year ago. After researching a natural alternative I came across your product Thyroid Support. After one month she has seen a big difference in her energy level and over all physical well being.
 I have tried this twice. When I first tried taking it, my diet wasn't that great, and it seemed to put me more into the "nervous energy" stage. Now I'm eating a pretty healthy diet, and it really is a benefit to me. Because thyroid is about metabolism, it's hard to quantify my changes, but overall I have better energy and seem less reactive to various foods. I am going to continue taking this.
 I've had hypothyroidism for nearly 2 decades.  I was starting to feel sluggish both physically and mentally.  I started taking this and within a few days felt much better.  I'm not saying this will replace your prescription, but I do feel like it is a good supplement to my medication.
 Love this product.  After using it for 2 days I had a lot more energy.  I usually have cold hands and feet and this product has made a big difference<br/>I've used the product Armour Thyroid in the past which is an animal hormone and this product is just as good or better.  Also notice<br/>less moodiness not as depressed.  My grandson is also using this product and his moods and anxiety is much better.  I will continue to use this<br/>Thyroid Support.  Great product.
 I have taking this everyday for 4 years and it has been a miracle for me. But now they said the color had changed only but that’s not how my body feels. It feels like it use to before I started taking this 4 years ago. Something had to have changed in the formula. I feel run down no energy like I use to. Please go back to old formula
 I have been taking this product for 3 weeks now along with my hypothyroid medication perscibed by my doctor. I have notice that I no longer experience crashing after meals and feel my alertness level has been better. Thyroid Support has not interfered with my sleep nor has it caused any "jittery" feelings at all. I have also noticed that it has helped curb my appetite, resulting in 7lbs loss in these few short weeks. That is a huge bonus!!! I will continue monitoring the results I have seen with future use of Thyroid Support.
 Noticeably better brain and attitude functions. I take one in the morning with a meal, and one in the evening, as instructed. Thyroid Support Supplement with Iodine - Metabolism, Energy and Focus Formula - Vegetarian &amp; Non-GMO - Vitamin B12 Complex, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha, Copper, Coleus Forskohlii &amp; more 30 Day Supply<br/> really does complement my Levothyroxin.
 I have been researching alternative therapies for aiding my thyroid needs. I had my thyroid removed 8 years ago, so I will forever be on medication. I've recently had trouble getting my dosage stabilized. Since beginning this product a little over a month ago I've felt the best I have in a long while. Even my doctor encouraged me to keep taking it because "something" seems to be working. I've just ordered my 2nd bottle and am considering the Adrenal Support as well.
 A few weeks ago I decided that I wanted to try a more natural approach to handling my thyroid issues. I was taking a medicine that my doctor prescribed to me and it did help my numbers improve but all of my symptoms were still present. I have only been taking these for about a week and I can already tell a difference in many aspects of my life. I have more energy and desire to complete my daily tasks. I feel so much more positive about things. I find myself snapping at my boyfriend less about the smallest things. My sex drive has also made a return 18 months after my son was more. I am so happy with this supplement so far and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I still don't know how it is helping my metabolism return. I will update my review once I have a better understanding on if it is helping my body let go and lose some weight. BOTTOM LINE. If you are not happy with the way your thyroid is performing I would give this a go right away. Go. Now. Click the buy button. P.S. To my wonderful surprise inside the box my bottle of pills came in was a "coupon" for another bottle of Thyroid Support Supplement FREE. THANK YOU 1 BODY
 I believe this is helping me a great deal.  Overall energy levels are so much improved after 2 weeks of use.  I used to yawn my day away and force myself through my activities.  I would exercise and it got to the point where I would collapse after working out.  I was seriously thinking that life was subpar, just existing.  I've not been pressured by anyone to write this review,  I am writing it because I truly feel better.  I've alway had a slow metabolism and been told by a doctor my TSH was too high, but I am not currently on any meds for this.<br/><br/>So for what it's worth I'll keep taking this supplement, my second bottle is on the way.<br/><br/>Week 4, I'm even more amazed! I kick myself for not trying a thyroid supplement sooner.  Yesterday I went for a run in the morning, cleaned the garage, did dishes, 5 loads of laundry, played with my dogs...all this activity when before I had to leave stuff for later because I was just too tired to do too much.  I'm so grateful I found this product!
 I noticed you posted in Seller Feedback "I have a sluggish thyroid and am trying to avoid needing medication. This product has the ingredients I need to keep my thyroid healthy and I am hoping that the potency is there as described. This is my second bottle and so far I have noticed more energy and mental alertness."
 Ok it MIGHT be premature but not likely. Day one of taking this and the discomfort I usually experience in the evening when I retain stupid annoying hypothyroid/pituitary tumor water (up to a 3 inch difference in my tummy)was completely alleviated. I haven't felt normal at night in 5 years. My friends all call me a gypsy now because the proper knowledge of herbs and essential oils have fixed more for me than any prescriptions have. (Like taking evening primrose oil for hair loss and breakage from the same stupid hypothyroid/pituitary tumor). Apparently I like parentheses today. Anyway point is... the LACK of pressure, bloating, and physical discomfort is amazing. Not to mention the mental discomfort that comes from it. My face doesn't look puffy and round at night now. My pants don't feel uncomfortable. It's just like a major sigh of relief. This was the most uncomfortable but not important enough for anyone to care about part of my health issues. The capsules do not contain the typical TOXIC magnesium stearate that most affordable supplements do and the ingredients they do contain are all highly studied fantastic herbs. Like schizandra and ashwagandha. Go google. GO!<br/>Even better? Mine came with a little ticket for a free bottle. Nice. Only downside is oh. My. GOD Becky. They taste so bad! That is the taste of a happy body though. :)
 Thyroid Support  has made a subtle and noticeable difference to me since I have started taking thyroid support about two weeks ago. I have already noticed an increase in longevity during my walking and gentle exercise routine. I am hopeful to continue with this product in my regular health routine. Try it, you'll like it!
 It's amazing. I hit a plateau with weight loss despite staying 800kcal with no changes for a week. Of course, my metabolism is notoriously low. Taking this the past month, I'm consistently losing weight (woo!), manage to have more energy, and overall feel so much better now. I'm more pleased than I thought I would be, and I'm definitely going to order regularly. They even let you have a free one after purchase if you're happy, so that's nice (especially since I'm about to run out, haha!)
 I have normal but in the low range thyroid function. I've always had problems with fatigue and weight gain. This supplement has really helped with both. I'm going to continue taking this supplement long term.
 See a MD before taking this supplement my thyroid was sent in a tail spin! My endocrinologist took one look at the ingredients shook her head and said this is causing me more harm than good!<br/>TRUST YOUR MD!
 My life hasn't been very predictable lately. From what I'm eating and how much I'm sleeping to what I'm doing socially (or not). As such, I don't know what I can really ascribe to this product and what has nothing to do with it. Generally I fell like I'm a little perkier, and more willing to get things done. That could be ascribed to spring weather and more ability to be outside without being frozen as readily as to this product. But, they both started happening around the same time. I intend to continue taking the supplements for a while long to see if the effect continues.
 Well, I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, 2 weeks ago, the Dr.  made an appointment for me in two weeks after that. I wanted to start treating my problem, I came to Amazon, I checked and I bought this, due to the good reviews. Well, I have been taking it one per day, because it gives me insomnia, but, anyways, I try to sleep and with the time, I am going to get used to it. I haven{t lose any weight, but I can see, that my belly and waist and getting smaller, I have more energy, of course, and I think I am going to continue using these forever. In such a few days, I can see the change on my waist and belly, I used to have the belly like a drunkard  and I was embarrassed all the time. I have been trying to lose weight, counting calories, using anorexics, you name it, and nothing, but with this pills, at the time I have taken 6 only, one per day, and I can see my old beautiful shape returning. Just love it! I really recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I see a huge difference when I began using this product. I am a skeptic my nature so I was shocked to see a change. The skeptic in me decided to test the results. I used it for two months and than stopped for a several months to see if my symptoms of cold intolerance, hair loss, weight gain, mood swings, and fatigue would return. Unfortunately they did return, but fortunately when I began taking the product again it was like night and day, I felt like myself again. This is my personal experience, hopefully everyone has the same positive results I do.
 At first, I had a lot of GI distress so stopped taking this product. The company gave me a full refund, but because they didn't require that I send it back, I took a break and tried again, this time very slowly, until I was at the full daily dose,<br/>( 1.5 weeks). After 2 mos. of taking the full dose, my doctor retested my thyroid and my TSH had dropped over 2 points! This supplement really works.
 I have tried at least 20 different supplements recommended by my doctor to date to get rid of my hypothyroid symptoms ( Fatigue, weight gain, anxiety...) over the last four years. Nothing worked until I tried this supplement! Not only have I lost 5lbs in the first week but my energy level has greatly increased! Try this before spending money on a ton of separate supplements.
 I am diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroid. I am very symptomatic yet am told my values are on the low side of normal and dont require medication.  I bought this product thinking it would help me... it did the complete opposite of helping me. It made me feel unbelievably worse. I personally will never use it again. I actually ate the money! I threw it out !
 I feel this supplement helps to some degree with my energy, but I don't know if that's because of the B vitamins in it, or if all of the ingredients truly are beneficial. Some days it gives me a real stomach ache if I don't time it correctly around food and water. I find other supplements work far better for mental clarity than this. I may give another bottle a shot because I got a coupon in the package for one.
 I would like to admit that I was skeptical at first, and I even waited 4 weeks to write the review so I can give an honest one! I have nothing but good things to say about it! Ijust turned 30 and was working out 3-4 times a week and not losing weight. I had no energy, and was always constipated (sorry about tmi but being completely honest! ) These are all classic signs of hypothyroidism. Unfortunately for me it runs in my family. But after taking it for a week I noticed the constipation started going away, after second week my energy just doubled! I don't wake up feeling like I haven't slept in months. I even have better quality of sleep which is tracked by my fitbit. And finally,after 4 weeks I've started to LOSE WEIGHT! I will continue to take this product because it's delivered 100%
 When taking Thyroid Support, I sleep better with less insomnia. I also have more energy (maybe because I am sleeping better?) I tend to be less anxious while taking Thyroid support, remaining calmer and more clear-headed throughout the day. Also, to my surprise, my eyebrows are thicker. I had some serious thinning on the outer half of my eyebrows, and now they are much fuller without bald patches.
 I feel better, less hot flashes, good mood, appetite suppressed and motivated to do more.  Most important, no bad taste after taking. No stomach upset or any other reactions from taking this supplement.  I actually feel and see some weight loss.  Definitely going to purchase again.
 Feeling great! I was told in tests that I was with in normal ranges...in the mean time I was exhausted,gaining weight,foggy feeling.. I decided to take matters into my own hands and ordered this product! I am LOVING the energy and clarity that I am experiencing!!! I can actually stay awake a watch a full movie now lol!! The foggy feeling is completely gone!!
 Great product and company.  I will continue to use this product as I have been able to reduce Naturethroid (with Dr's approval) and am doing very well.
 Returned. This product wrecked havoc on my body within the first week of use. Discontinued use immediately.<br/> I would not recommend for anyone with thyroid disorders.
 Don’t know how I lived without it. Dr says my levels were fine but I was tired all the time. I noticed other symptoms of thyroid issues so I started taking this and feel so much better.
 I have been taking this for about a week. I have noticed that I am sleeping better, I have more energy and the biggest thing for me are my hot flashes are gone!!!
 I have hypothyroidism and even though my test results while taking synthroid are good, I still felt tired all the time. I felt like I had to push myself to get things done.  No matter how much sleep and rest I had, I was still tired.  I went to bed tired and awakened tired.  I don't feel 100% but this product has really helped.  I have only been taking this supplement for a month.
 I've never written a review before, so I figure this is a good time to start. I've been using the product for a couple of weeks, and while I do feel a bit better (metabolism has improved, mental clarity, etc.) I'm starting to think I may need to get the Adrenal Support Supplement as well, which I will do this week.<br/><br/>I can say that I really like this company and the fact that they check on you to see if you're getting the results you want. As a person with most of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but none of the help/treatment (borderline four months ago yet somehow "normal" last month smh) I was desperate, and it feels good to have an option to try and help myself. I recommend it.
 It's given me energy I didn't have. I used to take two naps a day, and now I'm not taking any! it's THAT good! Now even my mom is on this
 At first, the product was great! It provided mental clarity and I even started to lose a couple pounds.  Then after about two weeks of straight usage, I noticed that my I was losing way more hair than normal.  At first I didn't contribute it to this, but I went out of town for a few weeks and forgot my bottle.  Guess what? I wasn't losing as much hair!  So when I got home I tried the supplement again just to verify my suspicions.  After 3 days my hair went back to falling out in large quantities!  DO NOT BUY!
 This is an awesome product !!! I have been taking it for 2 weeks now, and I have so much energy !!  I started feeling great after about 2 days of taking this. I will continue taking the Thyroid Support !!
 Bought for someone w hypothyroidism. Seems to be helping with energy levels and other symptoms. Formula contains many ingredients that used to be taken separately, including Selenium and Iodine. Much easier having a combined formula that works in tandem with body's own processes.
 I have been taking this for 3 months. It has helped with my hypothyroidism. I used to really drag after dinner and now I am good all the way until bedtime. I am working on my adrenals and my liver and slowly trying to get myself off of thyroid medication. I have already reduced my dose from 60mg to 30 and next month going to try 15mg. These supplements are just part of my program. I am also paying close attention to diet and stress levels. But so far I am very happy with the 1 body thyroid and liver support.
 It my search to find just the right thyroid support I decided to try this one out. Is a bit more expensive than the other ones I have tried so far but after using it i understand why. First all of  my hair loss has decreased  significantly. It took a few days to feel any energy in my body but now is increasing as I continue to take it. I have lost weight 3 pounds since I started using it. My memory is also getting better. I believe I will be sticking with this one for a while.
 so i have historically a sluggish thyroid and have treated it naturally for years.  I bought this because this fall my levels went out of range and i needed to intervene with something other then diet.  It boosted my system after about 2 weeks of use but the best thing I found is that my 16yr old son also took it because we suspected him of having thyroid issues as well.  For him in about 1 week his acne was almost completely gone and improved energy levels significantly.  The acne situation started when he was about 14 and we have tried all of the remedies both natural and prescription but low and behold how shocked we were when this cleared his condition almost completely!
 I just recently found out the I have hypothyroidism. Taking this along with iodoral has helped with the brain fog and sleepiness. I still have muscle aches and pains though. I was on hormone medication (synthroid and armour) I had horrible headaches and barley could get out of bed and decided to stop taking them.This product along with a change in my diet has made an improvement in my health.
 I have been taking this supplement for about one week and I can already feel the difference. I sleep without interruption, feel more energetic (no longer need the mid-day nap), everything seems more vivid.  Also, I noticed that I feel more able to resist food throughout the day. I still have cravings, of course, but they are more subtle, I suppose. Very pleased.
 I have been taking this product for about a week. I purchased due to an out of stock status on another Thyroid product I was taking at the advice of my doctor. Even though I have not taken this long enough to fully know the full effects of this product, I can say that I am feeling better than before taking it, and I have more energy. Since I have not made other changes to my supplements or food intake I am sure this product gets credit. Over the next several weeks I hope to have even more energy and feel even better. I know my Thyroid has an issue that needs supplementation. This product fits the bill.
 I just feel healthier and my quality of life feels improved! I will definitely continue use of this product and also look forward to trying your Liver Support &amp; Detox. Thank you!
 My basal temperature is up to normal from 97 to 98.6. I feel good. Energy is up. Hair loss has decreased.
 Its hard to describe the changes at this time as it has only been about two since I started taking it. Some of my mood changes have calmed down and my energy seems to have improved. I'm not one to jump at fads but so far there seems to be improvements  to my health since I started taking the thyroid support supplement.
 I've had hashimotos for many years now and I've been wanting to take supplements that would help me increase my energy level.  I've taken this supplement for almost a month now and the only change that I've noticed is a 6 pound weight gain.
 I cannot be sure, but I ran out of Armour Thyroid for a few weeks and had to go in for thyroid test.  I expected it to be way off, but it was normal...so I think taking Thyroid Support worked.
 I take 2 Thyroid Support every day, along with 2 Adrenal Support. I have suffered from hypothyroid for 19 years and using these supplements, while changing my diet to support my thyroid, had made me a new person. I'm supporting my thyroid and enabling it to do its job correctly. I feel so much better.
 I like this product at first and left a 5 star review, so I ordered a second bottle.  I almost finished the second bottle but found that it is no longer helpful.  I am still struggling with my energy, still eating constantly,and I have been continuing to gain weights since taking the product, about 4 bls more.  I don't think I will continue taking it.
 Love this product! Like many other reviewers, I also have an undiagnosed hypothyroid issue, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and order supplements off Amazon. I really liked the description for this one, plus all the information to back it up. It arrived promptly and I started on just one a day to ease myself in. Boy am I glad I did! I had some problems with nausea, diarrhea, and even threw up once, but the side effects weren't very drastic so I decided to keep going, as I was sure this was a sign it was working. Sure enough, I soon felt fine, and after the first month mark, I upped the dose to the recommended two per day, one first thing in the morning, and one before I went to bed. There were no side effects when I increased the dosage, so I'm glad I started with just one a day, because the side effects might have been unbearable with two a day, and then I would have stopped taking them andI wouldn't be writing this review! In the second month I have lost 5 pounds, which had been impossible prior to the supplement, and I am sleeping longer and more soundly and have more energy during the day and a clear mind. I'm still losing weight and I will continue taking these as long as they keep working!
 I have been using this for six months and it has really helped my under active thyroid. My only complaint is the last bottle is overwhelmed by the kelp so it smells like fish and the pills taste like fish. I hate fish so this has been unpleasant for me. The other bottles were not like that at all.
 My doctor said that my blood test results were getting toward a more  normal level but all of a sudden started going in the opposite direction. When ask what I was doing differently, I said that I had stopped taking a couple of my supplements. My doctor said well you need to resume with whatever it was you were taking....so here I am getting more of my Thyroid Support!! I took this along with the adrenal support and at first I did not think it was doing any good but the test results told a different story!!
 Did not work well at all, hated the pills and the taste of it, no noticeable change even after a month and two. Taking it just made me feel sick the rest of the day.
 Definitely makes me feel much better. I am on my third bottle now and I know the mornings I amin a hurry and forget to take it. I end up having to use an energy supplement to keep me going. My level of alertness and cognitive functions have improved also. I was worried about sleeping at night and it has not disrupted my sleep patterns whatsoever. Additionally the best part of this for me personally is that I have suffered with a sluggish digestive system my entire life and I am regular as clockwork nowadays (sorry for the excessive info but this is a miracle for me). all I can say is give it a shot but check with your doctor is you are on any kinds of medication which I am not.
 I like the product - although I have been trying a couple of other brands out prior to trying this one. 1 Body seems to be doing as good a job as the others or better.
 I'm a naturally skeptical person when it comes to any kind of supplements, but due to recent diagnosis of thyroid issues this was recommended and I thought I'd give it a try. I've only been using it a week so far, but I actually can tell a difference. I'm not as sluggish and have more energy, and generally feel better.
 I purchased this along with adrenalin support. It came with coupon for a free thyroid support supplement (2 for the price of one :)). I have thyroid deficiency and it did seem to make a incremental difference. However, based on my thyroid levels, don't think this will work as a replacement for synthyroid. I will continue using it for few more months and get blood work done to see if adding this to my regimen makes any statistically significant diff.
 I am hopeful to have more long term benefits as I have had thyroid surgery and need to keep it healthy. I have only been using it for 36 days but I do have more energy and sleep better overall. Probably sleeping better helps both  my moods and my energy. Either way I am satisfied with the results.
 I've only been taking these for a little over 2 weeks, but I definitely have more energy and not having that 3 p.m. crash.  Sleeping has improved as well which is making my overall mood so much better.  Can't wait to see what I feel like after 2 months of taking Thyroid Support!
 I was just trying to get my free bottle, and it appears that submitting a review is one of the hurdles:)  It's only been 15 or 16 days, so it's too early for me to notice significant difference, but I AM impressed with the ingredients so will continue using it for at least a few months.
 I seem to have more energy, and clearer thinking. I feel better, in general, and my weight has come down, even without my thinking about it.
 I tend to see results with most everything in 2-3 days to a week/2 tops. This produced nothing noticeable after the entire bottle.
 I have more energy since taking this for 15 days.  I will post back more on effects on thyroid levels and weight loss.  I have no issues or side effects.<br/>Be careful if taking this with other thyroid medication, to leave the proper time in between.
 So far I have noticed that I am not as sluggish. I really feel like I am not so foggy and more motivated to take care of myself.
 I have taken these capsules for two months. The first month I felt more energetic and overall clearer. When I finished the bottle I procrastinated in ordering more. During that two weeks I noticed foggyness and lethargy returning. I faithfully finished my second bottle and the beneficial results return. I have a high stress life right now, and my coping, stamina, and attitude are improved, where before I felt stress, fatigue, and depression. That's a lot for one little supplement, but I will continue as long as it lasts.
 I feel like Thyroid support has been helping with my overall feeling of wellness. I have felt less stressed, and my sleep has been more restful. I also feel like my cravings for sweet foods have been somewhat diminished and I feel full sooner than I had before taking this supplement.
 I really like this product because I have more energy and I think it keeps my moods more level without the highs and lows.
 I feel great
